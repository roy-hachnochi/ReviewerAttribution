The article provides a specific set of recommendations for discovering a new small molecule drug to treat Zika virus infection. Figure 1 in the article summarizes this process, beginning with setting up appropriate assays and screening known anti-viral drugs, especially those already characterized against dengue, another member of the family of viruses to which Zika belongs (Figure 3 is a nice summary of the proposed workflow). The authors also suggest ways to incentivize this effort, and organize it as a collaboration. All these strategies make sense and are well precedented and documented in the article. Overall, I recommend the article for approval based on its well-founded analysis of a strategy for addressing a major public health concern.
