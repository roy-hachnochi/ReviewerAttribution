 General comments This study provides an elegant framework to predict the severe impairment of U.S. lakes and reservoirs by cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms. I especially appreciated the clever use of conditional probability analysis to identify chlorophyll a threshold above which MC concentrations exceed WHO drinking water and recreational provisional guidelines. Chlorophyll a is a regularly measured water quality variable, and this study indeed offers a promising approach that can me used in many lakes around the world to identify problematic lakes or regions. In that regard, it would have been interesting to account for the spatial heterogeneity across this landscape -- as indicated by Beaver et al. (2014), some regions of the continental U.S. are more likely to be MC hotspots. Accounting for this heterogeneity will likely help explain some of the noise in the biplot shown in Fig. 2. I have also analyzed the MC data from the same dataset and found that accounting for different ecoregions in my model (as presented in Beaver et al., 2014) helped further explain the probability of detecting versus failing to detect MC in lakes. I am curious to know how this would play out with your modeling approach (conditional probability analysis). Minor comments I recommend the following minor typographical corrections: P3 Change: “Yuan et al. (2014) explore these associations in detail and control for other related variables.

Thanks again! ## Spatial/Regional Heterogeneity in Chlorophyll/Microcystin realtionship We agree that there are likely regional differences and would like to account for this; however, sample sizes for each region vary (67 to 155) and are relatively small. The resulting conditional probability analysis would have very wide confidence intervals. Thus, comparison between regions would be difficult and inferring a pattern would not be possible. We have added additional text in the discussion (second to last paragraph) that raises this issue. Additionally, we have added the Beaver et al. reference in this discussion. ## Specific Edits ### P3 - Change: “Yuan et al.
