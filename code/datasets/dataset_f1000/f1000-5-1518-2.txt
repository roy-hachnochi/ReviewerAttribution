In the article “VISIT-TS version 2: A multimedia tool for population studies on tic disorders” by Vachon, MJ, Striley, CW, Gordon, MR, Schroeder, ML., Bihun, EC, Koller, JM, and Black, KJ, a new method of classifying tics by lay persons is proposed as an aid in larger scale population studies. The authors provide a clear account for the need for improving existing methods of detecting and differentiating tics and present an interesting solution in the form of their new multimedia tool. It is a positive aspect that participants with tics include different age groups, races, and both sexes. However, some of the video clips present one separate tic, whereas several tics are present in the video. The rationale for developing the screening tool is its integration in large-scale epidemiological studies. Even though a few epidemiological studies focusing on tics and Tourette have been carried through, future methods will probably offer possibilities for screening cohorts for several co-occurring conditions. The authors may thus consider the possibility of further pruning the video (almost 10 minutes) and comparing two versions (e.g. the long one and a shorter version focusing on the different types of tics, which are more or less presented in the first few minutes of the video) for their validity against expert ratings. The shorter the time used for a screening, the more it will be used in big cohort studies. This could be integrated into future perspectives at the end of the manuscript. It would also be interesting to carry out similar tests of the sensitivity as mentioned in the article by comparing the VISTS-TS to clinician ratings. Storch et al. (2005) is used as a reference for the YGTSS – the authors might consider adding the reference of Leckman’s (1989) original work.
