The article presents an update to a previously published Cytoscape App by providing a general overview of other methods. The title, as well as the abstract give a good introduction to the article. The authors give a good recap of other methods and possible approaches as well as presenting the updated app. The Cytoscape app presentation is clear and enough for the final user. Most importantly, the new feature introduced in V5 - i.e. Perturbation - is clearly described in a dedicated paragraph. "Robust" in the title is justified in the text and use cases were clear and doable. Border exception node is illustrated clearly as well. I could reproduce the examples given with no big problem. Overall, the article is well written.
