I have now read the revised article. I’m still struggling to understand the importance of this opinion piece, and why it belongs in F1000. I am also still unclear on the purpose of telling this audience that long-term planning for science communication in the UK is important. I do happen to think these things are important, I’m not sure the authors are conveying these points in a way that will reach those who don’t feel this way. A few examples: The authors name a number of “exceptional initiatives of science communication,” then state “All of these examples represent long-term initiatives driven by an overarching vision or objective. As is evident from the success of these projects, such an approach offers a number of important advantages.” But they list five initiatives, they don’t spend any time describing why these initiatives are exceptional or effective. Then, the “important advantages” they list next are startlingly obvious: e.g. that long-term planning allows for time to develop “a broader range of activities,” and “graduate and cumulative developments” of programming. The authors identify some of the biggest barriers to science communication: a lack of a culture that supports it, and few incentives for scientists. But again, this isn’t novel so much as exactly the sort of thing science communicators discuss all the time. I also didn’t read the responses to these barriers as particularly novel, but again exactly the sorts of things we all bemoan all the time.
