The meeting report “Revitalizing biomedical research: recommendations from the Future of Research Chicago Symposium” from Dolan, et al. , describes a meeting in Chicago in 2015 featuring two keynote speakers, a panel session and multiple breakout sessions attended by trainees, staff and faculty. The majority of this report focuses on the recommendations and outcomes of the breakout sessions. This paper is an important contribution to the growing literature on how postdocs view their place in the biomedical research enterprise. That said, the authors can make several significant improvements to this manuscript to clarify the outcomes of this meeting and what actions should be taken next. Primary recommendations The manuscript would benefit from a display item cataloguing the many recommendations made pertaining to each of the themes. The authors should state clearly how the outcomes of their meeting relate to (1) McDowell, et al. , (2014) and (2) other reports recommending changes to how students and postdocs are trained. Postdocs play a pivotal role in the research enterprise, but this is only the second publication from a postdoc meeting discussing the ailments of the research enterprise. The growth of the postdoc voice in the conversation is an important point that the authors should stress. The authors should clearly state how their outcomes are the same or different from the McDowell paper and what conclusions they draw from these similarities and differences. Many reports have been written discussing trainee issues, and the authors do a nice job referencing much of the literature. The authors should go further to clearly define how their recommendations contribute to the ongoing discussion and highlight areas of agreement or disagreement with these reports. It is important for the authors to make very clear for the reader when they are reporting the participants’ recommendations or their own suggestions. In the final paragraph of Theme 1, the authors use “We think…” when discussing recommendations made by participants. This is quite confusing. Other sentences throughout the manuscript should also be clarified to ensure the reader understands who is making the recommendations. It may be useful to move the authors’ suggestions and recommendations to the conclusions and stick to participant recommendations in the themes. The authors should take more time in the Conclusions to give direction to the recommendations made at their meeting. Many of the recommendations had been made by others, as the authors indicated, but what does this mean about the progress of change? Which recommendations do the authors think are the most important to focus on? Where, given developments since the end of their meeting, should efforts be focused to make the most change? Secondary recommendations The authors list that “postdocs, students, faculty, staff, and others” participated in their event. Rough estimates of the percent attendance by career stage would be important to understand the tenor of the recommendations being made. Furthermore, if the data are available, it is important to communicate if one career group, like postdocs, had more of a say in the recommendations of one theme than other groups. It is not clear what the authors are trying to convey with this sentence: “Without long-term strategies to address the realities of career trends among PhDs, and absent a major shift in the research funding landscape, the outlook for continuing to attract talented young minds to biomedical research remains dim.” What are “long-term strategies to address the realities of career trends” and how do they help recruit young scientists into the enterprise? Would a “major shift in the research funding landscape” do more to retain young scientists in the enterprise or recruit them to it? This sentence should be recast to capture the authors true intentions or deleted altogether. The participants in Theme 1 did not offer “implementation methods” as the authors suggest. Implementation requires a plan to make the recommended change a reality, such as who should be tasked with advocating for and making the change and a timeline for the change to take effect. This type of plan is not offered in the manuscript. Rather, the participants make recommendations for alternative models to achieve the objective, and they should be characterized as such. In the final paragraph of Theme 1, the authors list, “First, the availability of…” but there is no “Second…”. The sentences should be recast to address this issue. In Theme 2, to give an alternative, yet complementary, picture of what the Silva et al. group did, the authors should consider referencing The Stanford PhD Alumni Employment Project ( http://web.stanford.edu/dept/pres-provost/irds/PhDAlumniEmployment ). It could also be useful to reference some of the schools that publish career outcomes information such as UCSF , University of Chicago or Tufts University . In Theme 4, the participant’s recommendation suggests a lack of interaction and social cohesion is responsible for people not “experiencing powerful positive feelings about their work.” Is this lack of interaction the root cause of poor morale as identified by the participants? How much of the material in Themes 1-3 play a role in lab morale? The authors should expand and clarify what the participants cited as depressing the lab culture. The authors discuss several broad problems facing the research enterprise but sometimes obscure the complexity of the reasons behind them. I recommend recasting these sentences to reflect the complexity of the situation. Specifically: “However, since 1990, the estimated postdoc population has doubled, causing an increase in the average length of postdoc training to 5–6 years and…” Linking population growth directly to the length of postdoc training leaves out many important details. Stagnant research funding, the dwindling number of faculty positions and poor training for jobs outside of academia, in addition to population growth, have affected the length of postdoc periods. “Over the past 20 years, the percentage of grant applications funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has fallen by 50%.” While accurate, it is important to note that, in the context of the rest of the paragraph, this is due to a doubling of grant applications rather than a decline in the raw number of grants funded. As funds disappear, biomedical research has become hypercompetitive…” Stagnant funding is a major contributor to the hypercompetitive environment, but so is the growth in the population applying for grant funding and the increase in applications referenced above. The authors state the BEST program was implemented, “In response to employment trends among young biomedical doctorates…” This is partially true, but again, oversimplified. The BEST program was initiated in response to a recommendation in the NIH Biomedical Workforce Working Group report from 2012, continuous advocacy from parts of the research community, the apparent success of a variety of existing university-specific programs, and yes, an analysis of employment trends.

Not approved Fundamental flaws in the paper seriously undermine the findings and conclusions Having reviewed the manuscript prior to reading the comments of the other reviewer, I would concur with most of the points raised so I won’t repeat them. In particular, however, the current version makes it difficult for a reader to: Separate new ideas from those in concordance with previous reports, especially those that came out of the Boston meeting of postdocs; Determine which conclusions and recommendations were coming from the meeting participants vs. the authors; Determine which ideas and recommendations had the strongest consensus behind them vs. novel ideas of one or a few individuals Specific Comments: Introduction First paragraph – It is not really true that research funds are ‘disappearing’. Stating it this way creates a false sense of rapid decline that is not accurate. The bigger change has been on demand side, not on the supply side, as universities keep applying more pressure to faculty to get grants, decreasing institutional support for faculty salaries, and increasing infrastructure costs. This has led to a big increase in the number of applications for the same research pie. Second paragraph – As written, this gives the impression that the postdoc is solely a route to academic research career whereas it is also a route to other research careers in industry and government labs, although it is clear there are many postdocs who aspire to but who will never achieve a research-based career in any of these sectors. Last paragraph – By the end of the introduction, it is still unclear how this event was different than FoR in Boston, whether participants overlapped at all, whether Chicago participants had read the recommendations from Boston, etc. The meeting – How many individuals attended and about how many participated in each of the breakout groups? As a reader one can’t determine if the report represents the collective thoughts of a large or small number of postdocs and others. Part I – To what degree did these keynotes shape discussion, opinion, and what came out in this report? How were they similar or different from speakers in the Boston event? Essentially, to what degree did the choice and messages lead to or influence the findings and recommendations reported here? Part II – Who moderated or led the workshops? Were there any guide questions or structure to them, or was it simply as described – providing opportunities for ideas to be ‘voiced’ via sticky notes which were sorted for themes? Do they have any information on the extent of knowledge of prior publications related to the questions being addressed? This is a potentially important issue if a reader is to determine the degree to which what came out of the meeting was spontaneous ideas which can be triangulated with those previously proposed and published, or ‘commentary’ on those. Theme 1 – new training paradigms – Soft Skills – It is not clear what is meant by these as they can be interpreted in many ways. What are the perceived priorities and how might they be taught? Just giving a link to the Core Competencies is not sufficient to know what the participants raised as important or not. Improved mentorship is a very vague term and difficult to know what to change. Are there issues that came up other than lack of attention and consideration of trainees’ goals? If so, it would be more valuable to cite them rather than generic better mentorship. Theme 3 – Several of the recommendations are actually in place and have been for many years, such as carry-forward of unspent funds from one grant year to another. This is standard practice except in unusual circumstances, only requiring clarification if the amount to be carried forward is more than 25%, and even then it is generally approved with reasonable justification. Also, a great deal of funding is going toward shared resources and core facilities, and if more was to go in that direction it would have to come from some other research line. The recommendation for more F32 and K awards was somewhat hard to grasp given the concerns raised for more emphasis on non-PI careers. Currently, the limiting constraint is the number of tenure-track faculty positions so it is unclear how training more postdocs for these roles will improve the situation. Non-tenure track positions have continued to rise so this is one potential growth area for young scientists, albeit with limited stability. The suggestion that grants from early career scientists should be reviewed separately was actually implemented several years ago for NIH review panels. Competing Interests No competing interests were disclosed. I confirm that I have read this submission and believe that I have an appropriate level of expertise to confirm that it is of an acceptable scientific standard, however I have significant reservations, as outlined above. reply Respond to this report Responses (0)
