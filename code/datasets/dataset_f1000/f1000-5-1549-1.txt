The review article summarizes the current understanding about the molecular circadian network for its role in muscle development and muscle biology. This topic is relatively new but will have significant implications in exercise, metabolism and aging. The manuscript is well-written and easy to read. I fully support its indexation in its current format. I have a few minor suggestions to help further strengthen the manuscript: It is expected that myocyte-specific molecular clock controls the diurnal expression of key genes that are important for muscle function, such as MyoD. It is less known whether molecular circadian clock within myocytes could directly control the key signalling pathways of muscle metabolism. It would be great if the authors could elaborate on this topic. The question regarding the regulation of muscle circadian clock is missing in the current manuscript. Do we know anything about hormonal or nutritional dependent regulation of muscle circadian clock? Does muscle circadian clock change during obesity, diabetes and the aging process? These knowledge will enhance the readability of this manuscript.
