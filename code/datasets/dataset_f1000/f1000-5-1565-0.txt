I have read the research article, it is a good attempt made by the authors to present their work. It can been accepted for indexation, but before indexation the following points can be considered to revise the manuscript: Kindly give citation for below: "The reliable detection of the centromere by image analysis techniques is challenging due to the high morphological variations of chromosomes on microscope slides. This variation is caused by various cell preparation and staining methods along with other factors that occur during mitosis. Irregular boundaries and large variations in chromosome morphology can cause a detection algorithm to miss the constriction, especially in high resolution chromosomes." Missing information, like in the line just above methods "The following section describes the proposed algorithm in detail. In section we show how this algorithm performed with a large data set and in section we comment on the performance and how it compares with other methods." The authors have tested their method on DAPI Q Banded metaspread images. But they have not taken the data from the standard dataset. I recommend them to test their method on standard dataset of ADIR dataset, Q Baded prometaphase dataset and G banded dataset. For which the benchmarked datasets are available online. Then compare their results on different datasets. As they have highlighted that straining methods can cause morphological variations. The features have been selected for the purpose of classification. I would recommend that selected features should be analyzed using correlation based feature selection, to remove the redundant and non contributing features and improve the classification accuracy. The result section can be further improved by explaining the reasons for obtaining such results. There are grammatical errors. This paper needs a second review.
