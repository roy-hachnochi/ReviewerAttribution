Wang and Maâ€™ayan have developed an open source RNAseq processing pipeline using standard methods as well as integrated tools for visualization and data analysis of differentially expressed genes between two sets of data. They test the pipeline by reanalyzing a previously published study of Zika virus infected human cells. They replicated the main result of the original study where genes related to the cell cycle were downregulated after infection. They also find a potential link to genes involved in brain morphology and a normal functioning of the nervous system in mice, something the original study missed. These genes are upregulated after Zika virus infection. This pipeline should be useful in any type of study where two conditions are compared, e.g. infected vs uninfected cells or treated vs untreated condition. Minor comments: Figure 2. Have the different conditions/figure labels been mixed up? The 2 Zika infected MiSeq conditions look complementary to the 2 mock infected NextSeq controls, while the 2 Zika infected NextSeq conditions look complementary to the 2 mock infected MiSeq controls. Figure 3a and 3b have been mixed up. 3b should be 3a and vice versa.
