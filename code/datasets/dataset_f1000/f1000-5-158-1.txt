This article describes the winning method of the DREAM6 promoter activity prediction challenge. While a meta analysis of the competing methods participated in the challenge has already been published (Meyer et al. , 2013), this article provides more details of the winning method and some additional analysis of the predictive model, which may lead to better understanding of the predictability of gene transcription. While its contribution is undoubtable, this article should be revised to address several issues: Major issues: The 23 features utilized by the SVM model (as well as their coefficients in the model) is not provided explicitly in the main text nor in the supplement file. Table 1 in the main text shows that 6 trinucleotides and 12 tetranucleotides are important features, but it is nowhere to be found which tri- and tetra-nucleotides they are. For lengths of T or TA-tracts, the supplement file shows several different values, including mean, median and stdev. It is unclear which one is actually used by the SVM model. Similarly, supplement file shows 79 values for deformability and it is unknown which one is used. In the case of ranking the features by their SVM coefficients, the authors need to clarify if the feature values were normalized prior to model building, as these features are on very different scales and if not normalized the ranking of the coefficients are not very meaningful. The main conclusion in the subsection "Error profile of SVM promoter activity model" do not seem to make sense. First, promoters of low activity had larger prediction error. Then the authors stated that natural promoters had lower activity. This seems to contradict with their observation that the prediction error was significantly less for natural promoters than for mutated promoters. Minor issues: Authors only mentioned that feature selection was done in WEKA with wrapper. More details need to be given. For example, what was the selection strategy used by the wrapper, e.g., exhaustive search, greedy forward search, backward search, or other types of heuristics? What is the purpose of first training 1000 SVM classifiers using 66% of data as training and 34% as testing, and then another 500 SVM classifiers using 80% as training and 20% as testing?
