The article “A multi-site cutting device implements efficiently the divide-and-conquer strategy in tumor sampling” represents an intelligent and practical evolution of the previous article of the same authors on the challenging issues of intratumor heterogeneity and tumor sampling. Tumor heterogeneity is one of the most important features of any approach to oncobiology and/or oncology. Together with other factors with which it is related – topography and time (evolution) – tumor heterogeneity is a key issue of cancer diagnosis and cancer treatment. Lpez and Cortes addressed this issue adequately in their previous article demonstrating the importance of finding ways of evaluating tumor heterogeneity and topography via a clever and innovative strategy – Divide-and conquer (DAC) strategy – of tumor sampling. I must confess I liked very much the previous article but I did not know how much effort one would need to implement a successful DAC strategy. It was therefore an agreeable surprise to see the continuation of the work having the real life of a Pathology Laboratory as the objective. I think the authors describe reasonably well the method they have “invented” and I concur with them it looks a simple procedure that assures a rather complete sampling of large surgical specimens in a relatively short period of time. However, for the sake of utility, I think the authors should provide a more detailed description of the “technicalities” of the procedure.
