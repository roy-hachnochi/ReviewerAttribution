This is valuable and innovative work, which provides a simple and practical approach to more efficient sampling of larger human tumors, with the goal of better determining tumor heterogeneity. There are some omissions in the description of the technique, which would make adoption of the technique easier for others. Specifically, the authors should state clearly the recommended thickness of the whole tumor slice, whether using a long-bladed knife or slicing machine. Clearly the slice thickness must fit in the tissue processing cassette - so probably less than 3 mm - do the authors think that 3 mm slices of a large mass will generally remain intact/not fall apart before being cut with the grid. The second, perhaps more important, point is the authors need to state clearly how much of a given tumor they believe should be sampled. In their 10 cm example, it seems like they would submit virtually the whole tumor but this is not clear. How much would they submit from a 20 cm tumor? Conversely, how big does a tumor need to be before this type of sampling technique is advised? Presumably smaller tumors (e.g. 5 cm) could be sampled in the conventional/routine fashion with larger pieces? Clarification of these points will enhance the value of the authors' proposal.
