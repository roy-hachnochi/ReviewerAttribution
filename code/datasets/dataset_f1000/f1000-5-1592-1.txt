A very interesting study. It highlights the increasing use of WES in diagnosing rare diseases. The authors confirm the findings of ES with Sangers and sequence both the parent and the proband. The manuscript needs editing and rearrangement of text. The paragraph on SME and AME needs/can probably be put together as the introduction. Minor grammar corrections.
