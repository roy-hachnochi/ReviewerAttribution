Mandlik and Singh have applied the pharmcophore model and physicochemical properties to select five coumarin derivatives as a starting point as inhibitors targeting inositol phosphorylceramide synthase a target selected to study sphingolipid metabolism of Leishmania. IPCS is an important target because there is no mammalian equivalent of this enzyme. The authors have utilized the state-of-the art computational techniques molecular docking and molecular dynamics to confirm the binding mode and its interaction with the enzyme. The analysis explain that the high number of H-bond acceptors, donors and hydrophobic groups introduce strong interactions of the ligand within the binding site of the enzyme. The cytotoxicity profile of the selected inhibitors provides additional information about the coumarin derivatives. Thus, this study is a good starting point for focusing coumarin derivatives as inhibitors targeting against Leishmania. In the future study, it can be extended to modify these molecules to further enhance the interaction with IPCS and other experimental studies to confirm the binding affinity.
