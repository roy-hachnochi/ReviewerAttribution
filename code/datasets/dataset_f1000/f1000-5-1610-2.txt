Mandlik and Singh are presenting a very interesting study against Leishmania. Using in silico methods they have identified promising compounds. They chose with great reason IPCS as a target for its uniqueness to the pathogens the study very interesting yet the manuscript needs some clarifications. As there is no structure the authors have done a model, the model should be presented here and I feel a previous reference from 2012 won't do. The reader needs to be introduced to it and at least to have a clear understanding of the catalytic site and docking site. In the material and methods it would be appreciated to have an idea where is the center of the grid (may be with a figure). Can you explain why you chose a grid with large dimensions? The analysis of the viability raises a question. Why the surface p1 is not the same between control and compound? To compare the stats it should be the same size here it is half. Also from fig 6 compound 3 it seems that a lot of data were excluded from P1 area? Can you explain? As perspective are you planning on testing in vitro the efficiency of compound 3 and have an idea of binding affinity? Minor comment on figure 2: structures of compounds are distorted and could you put all the compound in same orientation 1 (and 2 are upside down). It will help to compare the geometry and differences between molecules. Figure 5: description of interactions could be better represented ma be with LigPlot, as it is it is not clear.
