This is an interesting case of a differential diagnosis for inflammatory myopathy. I only have minor suggestions or open questions. Was ESR only tested once? What about previous examinations which might have shown increased values? In daily practice we ask for such results when we see these patients (e.g. from previous GP consultations) and it would be interesting to see if the patient never has had increased inflammatory markers, which would be a bit unusual. Should there be an MR image of the pathologic finding, it would be nice to add it to this report, if the space allows. Did you ever consider doing a second biopsy for the case that the right area has been missed? If not, it would be worth it to add a sentence in the Discussion about the role of repeated biopsies in such cases. The patient had reported to have poorly controlled diabetes mellitus. What happened to that condition after 1 month of high-doses of cortisone and how did you deal with it? Again, 1-2 sentences in the Discussion would be informative in order to think of how to solve this comorbidity.
