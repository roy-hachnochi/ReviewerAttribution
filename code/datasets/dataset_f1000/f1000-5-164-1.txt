This is an educational case of a 64 year old male who presented with a fairly typical picture of a few weeks of proximal muscle weakness, difficulties swallowing, increased AST and very high CPK levels, but was initially misdiagnosed as having rhabdomyolysis. The absence of a usual trigger of rhabdomyolysis, the lack of rapid improvement and the pharyngeal involvement were early clues that the latter differential diagnosis was not correct. A muscle biopsy was unfortunately negative, and the authors found no specific autoantibodies, so that the diagnosis is not certain. The clinical picture, the MRI findings, and the improvement under glucocorticoids, which usually takes at least two weeks, nevertheless support that this patient has polymyositis. The only unusual finding is the normal ESR. In addition, the authors should have tested for antinuclear antibodies (ANA) by indirect immunofluorescence on HEp2 cells, where both ANA and cytoplasmic fluorescence would have given further clues. Many of the patients with anti-synthetase antibodies do have additional symptoms, ranging from mild Raynaud’s and mild arthritis to mechanics’ hand and early signs of interstitial lung disease. In addition to anti-Jo-1 antibodies, several other anti-synthetase antibodies can be tested for today. Some patients will have malignancies underlying new onset polymyositis or, more often dermatomyositis.
