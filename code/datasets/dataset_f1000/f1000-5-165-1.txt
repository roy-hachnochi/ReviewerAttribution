In this manuscript, Asano et al. have applied the own developed method, SDS, to microbial rhodopsins. The basic idea of this scoring is to calculate all Carbon-alpha pairwise distances in each crystal structure and to avoid the ambiguity from the structure-matching. The manuscript is well presented and the method/results will be of interest to broad readers. I would recommend it for acceptance. Some minor comments: Authors propose a new numbering scheme (*.50) from the conservation rate of residues. Adding conservation rates of key residues to the legend of Fig.S1 or Table 1 is useful (one need not to check Table S1). Also in Figure S1 only the residue number “216” of Helix 7 (7.50) is shown and other numbers are missing. The different numbering in Figure S1 and Figure S2 is a bit confusing. Adding the numbers of the *.50 residue in the bR sequence (27, 57, 82, 122, 152, 182, and 216) at the bottom of the sequencing alignment (Figure S2) might be helpful.
