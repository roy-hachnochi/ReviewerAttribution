This is an interesting report of a quality improvement initiative which highlights the importance of such activities being piloted and refined prior to widespread implementation. I have a couple of minor comments: Firstly, given that the evaluation appeared to cover the full quality standard it would be useful for readers to be able to review the full list of QS statements. Could this be added as a table or supplementary information? Secondly, the first paragraph of the results describes the methods of the evaluation. The authors may wish to move this to methods section and provide more detail. Thirdly, it would be useful to have some more information about the participants in the evaluation e.g. roles, participation in the development of the QS as this would provide some context for the findings.
