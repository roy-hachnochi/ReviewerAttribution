There is nothing wrong with the description of a surgical technique for ALCAPA repair in the form of a case report. This, however is no proof of superiority over other approaches. The main concern is presentation: “ALCAPA syndrome, also known as Bland-White-Garland Syndrome, is a rare congenital heart disease, affecting approximately 300,000 newborns in the USA.” Affecting 300,000 newborns? In which time period? “This disease has 90% of mortality"; “important morbidity“; ”surgical correction is more difficult to resolve”; “The paraclinical diagnostic methods showed anomalous emergency of left main coronary artery from the pulmonary artery”; “physiopathology” - examples of incorrect use of the English language.
