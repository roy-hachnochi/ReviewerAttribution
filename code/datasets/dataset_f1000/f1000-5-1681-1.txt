We congratulate the authors for their work on a relatively difficult surgery with modification in a resource constrained setting such as Nepal. However, there are some points which warrant clarification: 1. Exclusion Criteria Some redundancy is noted in points 1 and 2. Disrupted transverse ligament could mean either Anterior dens interval (ADI) 4mm or in case of Jefferson’s fracture, overhanging of lateral masses of C1 on C2 of 7mm. Our suggestion is to divide them as: Disrupted transverse ligament (Anterior dens interval (ADI) 4mm) Associated Jefferson’s fracture (Overhang of lateral masses of C1 on C2 7mm) 2. Surgical modifications for the procedure Midline trajectory of the screw- The C-arm images in the antero-posterior (AP) view usually ensures the correct alignment of the k-wire with the dens. It is not clear whether the authors routinely used the biplanar fluoroscopy or AP view was sufficient. 3. Clinical presentation Frankel grade of the last patienthas not been mentioned. We would have used the ASIA grading which is a better and universally accepted grading system for impairment following spinal cord injury. Overall, though this is a small serious with one year follow up, this will definitely stimulate other neuro and spine surgeons in Nepal to carry out such study in future. Dr. Mohan R.
