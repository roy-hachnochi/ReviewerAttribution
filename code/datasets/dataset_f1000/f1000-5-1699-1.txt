Authors employ a supervised learning algorithm for prediction of protein complexes from protein-protein interaction networks. This manuscript requires considerable work. I am listing what I think as most crucial points for authors to work on: The input to the proposed development is protein-protein interaction network. This information usually comes from laboratory studies. While there is always an element of accuracy and completeness associated with the data, once a network is constructed what are the protein assemblies within the network is intuitively obvious. Why do we need a development such as the one proposed in this manuscript? Where is the question of “prediction” of assemblies? – the interaction information is already firmly coded in the network and information on assemblies is part of construction of the network. This is a fundamental and serious problem authors must address. Authors have come up with a computational development. But there is no assessment on how well the method works. There is no application shown using a protein-protein interaction network. Manuscript reads too technical with too much jargon. Figures could be lot more informative. For example the two parts of Figure 3 are extremely similar and the message from the figure is not clear.
