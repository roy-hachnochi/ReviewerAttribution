The authors describe the use of a commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) device to ascertain which interval provided the most accurate data regarding the route driven. The objective is to determine the optimal interval that would be applied to future research studies involving individuals with and without Alzheimerâ€™s disease. A total of three participants drove a single 7-mile driving course. The course was designed to reflect real world driving conditions. Participants drove in different cars, at different times of day (morning, afternoon, and night), and different intervals (120-second, 60-second, and 30-second). The three participants were healthy and cognitively normal. The datasets were analyzed. The preferred data collection interval was determined based on the results of best fit. Best fit was operationalized as the route generated by the routing algorithm as compared with the actual route driven. The analyses revealed that the 30-second interval provided the optimal (best fit) characterization of the route. The ability to use a COTS device to assess driving skills has considerable public health implications in the context of an aging nation. The study is a critical initial step in determining the utility of the COTS device for prospective research studies. With the inherent limitations of driving simulators and road testing, the use of the device as described provides a cost-effective option that more closely emulates real world driving experiences.
