 The current study is a Cytoscape app which visualized kinetic data from SABIO-RK. The article and results are of interest, but overall the article will be largely improved if the novelty and aims of the app are clearer. The abstract should be more focused and make shorter. The introduction should be more concise and informative of previous works. A paragraph explaining that different approaches have been described the visualization of the kinetic data based on ……….. in …… platform. (and explain the highlights of each method). The Figures are not in a high-quality resolution and figure 4 is not informative. The author just showed the main three clusters of human galactose metabolism. I suggest illustrating the method clearer (specially the operation).
