This article studies the effect of gestational diabetes on maternal thyroid function and BMI. A case control study was done in Sudan and thyroid hormone levels and thyroid autoantibody testing was done. With the increasing abnormalities in thyroid function such as subclinical disease seen in pregnancy, this study further consolidates existing literature with decreased thyroid hormone levels and increased thyroid autoantibodies in gestational diabetes. This study also looked at the association between BMI and thyroid parameters. However, the conclusion states that BMI correlates positively with free thyroid hormones but the discussion says a negative correlation was present. Also the conclusion says BMI was negatively associated with thyroid autoantibodies but the discussion says the opposite. I assume this may be a typographical error in the conclusion section. Please address this issue. Otherwise this study, with its limitations adds interesting data to the preexisting literature on the subject.
