The manuscript by Holcombe et al. as a comment on Thorstenson et al.' s prior manuscript is well well written and reasoned. The problems with the Thorstenson et al . article are many and most of them have been well addressed here. However, since the manuscript by Throstenson et al. has been retracted reportedly for other reasons, it does not seem particularly fruitful to critique the original manuscript further unless a resubmission has published. On the other hand, pointing out the additional methodological and statistical problems with the original manuscript may be instructive for those following up on this work as suggested by Holcomb et al. In particular, there does seem to be a disturbing trend to attribute results to factors that have not been well established as uniquely or even likely causal, (e.g. in the present case that "sadness" caused the observed trends in the data). Holcomb et al.' s manuscript also illustrates the importance of scrutinizing the raw data for evidence of faulty methodology, and ceiling/floor effects. Perhaps publishing the present manuscript may be worthwhile as it is a potentially valuable instructional tool.
