This is a novel and important piece of research. Extensive research is being conducted using next generation sequencing but researchers are becoming increasingly aware that many factors such as PCR bias, region of the 16S rRNA gene targeted etc. can impact on the results achieved. This has a negative impact on the ability to compare results across studies. This manuscript sets about to address this with their new analysis pipeline NG-Tax. The title of the manuscript is good. The abstract accurately summarises the research but the results section should have less methods and more results. Figure 1 is vague and fails to show the unique aspects of how NG-Tax differs from e.g. QIIME. More details would make this figure useful. I think greater details on the filtering and the classification used by this approach would benefit the reader. Perhaps a table showing the differences between this approach and e.g. RDP , QIIME etc. would improve the readers ability to interpret the novelty of the work. This work was done only using HiSeq data. Do the authors feel that the approach would be equally successful on approaches e.g. Ion, MiSeq etc where longer reads are achieved? It would also be nice to test the approach with a real life data set and not a mock community and see how the results compare to those achieved using traditional analysis approaches. Figures 3 and 4 are difficult to interpret, perhaps remake as tables.
