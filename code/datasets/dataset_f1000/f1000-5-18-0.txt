This is a very nice opinion piece surveying the current community practices around genome projects and the shortcomings thereof. Using the metaphor of the insect lifecycle, the paper discusses the “genome lifecycle” (sequencing, assembly, annotation… re-sequencing, re-annotation, etc) and various lessons drawn from real-life case studies (e.g. informatics is key, perfection is the enemy of the good, we need to decouple data dissemination from publication to some extent, we need plans for sustained computational infrastructure, we need new collaborative tools). I agree with the positions espoused here and I find this piece a very insightful distillation of the challenges facing the community as funding pay-lines become tighter and we transition from an era of quick genome-project headlines to one in which the community can (with luck) collectively curate and maintain data, rather than letting data-silos decay. I had one minor suggested edit which is that the line “until the skill and leadership of Jim Kent saved the day” could use a citation (presumably to Kent Haussler, 2001 1 ). References 1.
