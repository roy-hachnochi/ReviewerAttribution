This manuscript describes the use of the PET tracer [18F]-L-FEHTP in an attempt to image beta cell mass. Pancreatic uptake of the tracer is high. However, while experiments in Akita mice show a slight (but highly variable) decline in pancreatic [18F]-L-FEHTP uptake, there is no change in STZ-treated animals. The authors demonstrate that the target receptor, LAT1, is expressed throughout the pancreas, and is not confined to islets. Comments As biodistribution studies were performed immediately following the cessation of PET imaging, why does the biodistribution data (Figure 2A) not match the end of the TAC curve (Figure 4A)? This biodistribution data does not support the conclusion of ‘significantly reduced 18F-L-FEHTP uptake in Akita mice.’ In Figure 2 is all activity coming from the pancreas? It appears that there may be PET signal from other organs – is the spleen visible on these images? Figure 4 caption states: ‘Time-activity curves (TACs) for 18F-L-FEHTP uptake in the pancreas of a ) wt and b ) Akita mice.’ However, I believe the figures show the pancreas TAC in panel A and the kidney TAC in panel B. The text under the heading ‘Dynamic scan analysis’ needs to be edited to correctly reference these figures. It is interesting that the kidney of Akita mice also exhibits a statistically significant decline in tracer uptake. Is there known LAT expression in the kidney that would explain this finding? The authors state that: ‘Such clear visualization of the pancreas using a targeted PET agent has not previously been achieved.’ Does the level of pancreatic uptake exceed that previously achieved with C11-acetate, another tracer with high pancreas uptake? Figure 5: Connecting the points in the TAC would improve consistency with previously presented TACs.
