The authors describe a useful tool for performing automated quality control analysis of GWAS input data. They provide a set of script written in Python and R that automate running plink and smartpca to check for common issues with input data. This is a valuable contribution for documenting and automating the processes involved with checking GWAS input data. I have some suggestions for improving the usefulness of the tool: A description of the input data would help users get started with this tool. Does it take only array genotyping data or also sequencing data? Is different pre-processing or QC threshold adjustment required for the different types of data? The software needs a minimal set of example files that users can run to confirm they have the necessary system tools installed. This will help distinguish errors in installation/running from errors in the input data. It will also help users understand the exact inputs, including plink phenotype files. It's quite hard to get started with any tool without test data. If you run into issues it is hard to distinguish differences/problems with your dataset from issues with the code. It would be helpful for tool usage if it had a unique name. Naming the scripts generically as GWAS (or GWAS QC) makes it hard to reference or find information about the tool.
