 Title and abstract: The title and abstract are appropriate and suitably summarize the work. Article content: The article describes a series of scripts that the authors have developed to provide quality control measures for genomewide association studies The scripts address critical questions for genomewide association study datasets such as checking the extent of heterozygosity to determine whether it is as expected, checking whether there are markers that do not follow Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium predictions, and checking whether there are pairs of closely related individuals. The authors provide a helpful series of scripts that will allow users to perform these tasks in a reproducible and automated fashion. The scripts make it easy to determine the number of samples removed for different parameter settings. These scripts are likely to be valuable for researchers in the field. Conclusions: The conclusions of the manuscript are appropriate, that use of these scripts will allow for consistent quality control of genomewide association study datasets, which will lead to better interpretation of the available data.
