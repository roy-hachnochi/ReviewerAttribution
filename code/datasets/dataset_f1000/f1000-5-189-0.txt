Solvent accessible surface area is a frequently calculated quantity in structural bioinformatics. Although many tools are available, an open source, easy-to-use program is certainly welcome. The author did a careful test and performed comparative studies to existing tools. The code is clearly written and well documented. There are no major changes required for this clearly written manuscript. Here are some minor questions requiring further clarifications and additions. For multiple chains or a protein-ligand complex structure, does Freesasa yield the ASA for isolated chains or chains in the complex structure? It would be better if the program has an option to calculate the change of ASA on a residue before and after binding to another molecule (ligand, RNA, DNA, another chain) assuming that there is no structural change upon binding. This would allow to identify the functional residues. Please clarify the command to produce a residue-level ASA, rather than the atomic level ASA. What are default recommendations for the ASA calculation in term of resolution required or choice of LR and SR approximations? Are the default atomic radii employed here the same as used in DSSP and/or NACCESS? If different, what are the main differences? Is this method faster than analytical methods? If so, by how much? Can authors provide a table that lists all possible commands? The program would be more useful if it can directly read in Biopython data structure and work with pymol.
