This study examines the long-term behavior effects of prenatal ethanol exposure in an outbred murine stock. The authors discuss a very important idea that the sole use of inbred mice to study FASD is problematic due to the lack of genetic variation. If scientists attempt to model a human condition like FASD, it is ultimately more informative to use a genetic model that is more similar to humans, who are by nature an outbred stock. Issues: The NIH has stated that scientist should no longer neglect female mice as subjects in studies like this and if the authors do not wish to include females in their analyses (if they did it would strengthen the paper) then they should give justification in the text for the sole use of males. Sex could be used a potential covariate, as is time of measurement. The 4-6 month age time period may cause some differences in the data. For example, a 6-month old mouse has had 50% more time for neural plasticity than mice that are 4 months old. I would not require redoing the experiments but perhaps including age as a covariate to determine whether it plays a role in the effects would be a wise idea. There are two reports left out of the discussion that should be mentioned as they employ use of an outbread stock of mice (CD1) in a prenatal alcohol exposure model. They should be includes in the discussion (El Shawa et al., 2013 and Abbott et al., 2016). In summary, the title is appropriate for the article and the abstract represents a suitable summary of the work. The design, methods and analysis of the results from the study are appropriate and explained well. I think that the conclusions drawn by the authors draw are sensible, balanced and justified. All the data provided is in a usable format/ structure, and enough information has been provided so that the experiment can be replicated. Overall this is a good paper.
