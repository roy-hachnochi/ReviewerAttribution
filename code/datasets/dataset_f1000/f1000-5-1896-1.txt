This paper is motivated in part by the discrepancy between genetic variation in humans that is absent in many animal models of FASD that involve assessments in inbred strains. The authors examined learning/memory and motor strength/skill in adult outbred (Swiss-Webster) mice exposed to gestational alcohol exposure (first two trimester equivalent). Exposed mice showed no statistically significant deficits in grip strength, open field exploration, or in the Barnes Maze. Exposed mice were slower to learn the rotorod, but did not differ in overall performance. The authors conclude that motor learning abilities are affected by moderate gestational ethanol exposure in the absence of conspicuous effects on motor performance. The strengths of the study are 1) the use of multiple behavioral and cognitive tasks within subjects, 2) measurements taken during adulthood to address persistence of effects, 3) the use of an established voluntary drinking paradigm, and 4) potential for motivating more research on genetic variability and ethanol exposure. Addressing several points outlined below would strengthen the paper and its impact on the field. For analyses the litter was used as the unit of analysis. Litter effects are commonly addressed by limiting the number of animals from a given litter used in a particular study. In this report, unequal numbers (2-4 animals) from 4 litters were used. Thus, the n for each group was 4. Considering this, some effects that are numerically noteworthy but not statistically significant (e.g., open field, time in center, Fig 1A; Barnes maze exploration of holes in the opposite quadrant, Fig 2B; final rotorod performance, Fig 4A) could be underpowered. Estimates of effect sizes and power calculations should be provided. This issue takes on added importance given that one of the principal conclusions concerns the lack of motor performance deficits following prenatal alcohol exposure. An alternative analysis could also be considered. Though litters are commonly used as the unit of analysis in developmental studies with proper justification and design, averaging data from multiple animals in a given litter also eliminates potentially important individual variation. An analysis treating animals as nested within litters within groups (Lazic and Essioux, 2013) represents an alternative that could yield different statistical outcomes. The relative sensitivity of the tests and measures should be considered. More fine-grained behavioral assessments may be more sensitive to ethanol exposure. Further, different motor behaviors that are distinguished by effector systems and neural circuitry (e.g., orofacial movements, skilled reaching; see e.g., Hamilton, 2014) will likely yield distinct results, which should be considered in integrating the present results and conclusions with the extant literature. One of the primary motivations noted in the paper is the issue of using inbred vs. outbred strains in the study of fetal alcohol effects. The present study does not directly compare outbred and inbred strains statistically. The potentially large variation in parameters of ethanol exposure models and behavioral methods make drawing conclusions from qualitative comparisons across studies difficult. The authors should consider providing some recommendations for how to more fully address the issue of genetic variation and fetal alcohol effects. The authors note that inbred mouse strains display deficits in motor function and learning/memory. It is important to contextualize this discussion with reference to critical variables including the timing, dose, duration, and route of ethanol administration. Further, an expanded treatment of the motor effects following prenatal alcohol exposure would help place the current findings in the broader landscape of the literature. The authors should provide estimates of blood ethanol concentrations associated with the level of drinking, and clarify what they consider to be moderate ethanol exposure. The raw data files contain some discrepancies or omissions that should be corrected. Raw data 1 (open field) contains litter numbers that do not correspond to same mouse numbers as provided in other files (e.g., .Raw data 3). Raw data 2 (Barnes maze) only includes litter numbers but not individual mouse id values. MINOR ISSUES Abstract : “Mice who” should be “mice that” The introduction should provide more information and citations to relevant articles regarding various ethanol exposure paradigms. The second sentence of the third introduction paragraph is a bit vague. As written the second sentence of the fifth introduction paragraph reads as if the use of male mice is critical to advancing understanding of the behavioral consequences of ethanol exposure. For the open field please include the lighting parameters. The methods for the Barnes maze indicate that the task was conducted with a light source but no auditory stimulus. This is inconsistent with the methods cited (Attar et al. 2013). Page 7. In the sentence beginning “In rodents, moderate gestational ethanol exposure can alter medium spiny neuron dendritic branching in the striatum pups (Rice et al., 2012), …” The word “pups” should be removed.

Not approved Fundamental flaws in the paper seriously undermine the findings and conclusions This study examines the long-term behavior effects of prenatal ethanol exposure in an outbred murine stock. The authors discuss a very important idea that the sole use of inbred mice to study FASD is problematic due to the lack of genetic variation. If scientists attempt to model a human condition like FASD, it is ultimately more informative to use a genetic model that is more similar to humans, who are by nature an outbred stock. Issues: The NIH has stated that scientist should no longer neglect female mice as subjects in studies like this and if the authors do not wish to include females in their analyses (if they did it would strengthen the paper) then they should give justification in the text for the sole use of males. Sex could be used a potential covariate, as is time of measurement. The 4-6 month age time period may cause some differences in the data. For example, a 6-month old mouse has had 50% more time for neural plasticity than mice that are 4 months old. I would not require redoing the experiments but perhaps including age as a covariate to determine whether it plays a role in the effects would be a wise idea. There are two reports left out of the discussion that should be mentioned as they employ use of an outbread stock of mice (CD1) in a prenatal alcohol exposure model. They should be includes in the discussion (El Shawa et al., 2013 and Abbott et al., 2016). In summary, the title is appropriate for the article and the abstract represents a suitable summary of the work. The design, methods and analysis of the results from the study are appropriate and explained well. I think that the conclusions drawn by the authors draw are sensible, balanced and justified. All the data provided is in a usable format/ structure, and enough information has been provided so that the experiment can be replicated. Overall this is a good paper.
