“The Use of Collagen Matrix As a Patch Graft in Glaucoma” is a well designed study on the use of Ologen as a primary graft in glaucoma shunt surgery. The title is appropriate, though it may benefit from the inclusion of the word “primary” (...”as a primary patch graft”) to distinguish it from other publications on the use of Ologen as a patch graft. The method and analysis are well explained. Although not the primary intent of the study, additional statistical analysis would be useful. This would include reporting the mean change in IOP and medication use post-operatively. While we do not expect that grafts would affect IOP or medication use, data showing IOP reductions could be useful in drawing this conclusion. Reporting the number of previous surgeries on the study eyes and eyelids may elucidate root causes for complications. At present, the supplemental data included only describes surgeries and procedures that occurred after the initial tube placement. The conclusions are sensible and justified; however, they do not address whether use of Ologen in any way alters the mechanics of the glaucoma surgery and subsequent IOP management - which again we do not expect. Furthermore, this study describes the use and results of Ologen in one surgeon’s hands. It is possible that results could be different in alternative surgical techniques that may differ in tunnel length and closure. As identified by the authors in the discussion, the major limitations of this paper are its small study size and its lack of comparison to other grafts. However it does present a novel method for covering tubes - timely given the shift of glaucoma to a surgical disease. This article serves as a straightforward and succinct study that justifies further investigation and a more robust sub-group analysis. Overall, this article is in line with the requirements of F1000Research and we support its approval.
