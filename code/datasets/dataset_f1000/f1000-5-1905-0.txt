The reasoning behind the use of open source applications with an awareness of the difficulties they can present, and the decision to host on infrastructure as a service platforms is sound, and well presented. However, a more detailed consideration of the individual application choices is required, beyond their previous use in local studies. For example, which alternatives to CiviCRM were considered and why were they rejected? The complications and downsides of using a third-party cloud resource (which would be likely required for someone aiming to install BRISSKit themselves) are not examined in any detail. More explanation of the 'software-defined vApp' approach is required, to enable a similar level of isolation between instances to be achieved on non-VMware platforms. Issues of data security are raised, and addressed, but not much guidance is given for those wishing to adopt BRISSKit who do not have access to the specific service provider chosen for the project. Ubuntu 12.04 reaches end of life in April 2017. No discussion is given of changes that may be needed (for instance in the Puppet modules) to accommodate porting to a newer version of Ubuntu. Moreover, further detail is required to give confidence that the applications can be installed on other operating systems than those mentioned. This might include providing examples of operating system-agnostic Puppet code. The specific version of Puppet cited in the report has reached end-of-life, so similar concerns apply there regarding updating to a supported version. Given the importance of data security, it is surprising that the mention of SSL certificates does not include any mention of certificate authorities and client browser validation of certificates.
