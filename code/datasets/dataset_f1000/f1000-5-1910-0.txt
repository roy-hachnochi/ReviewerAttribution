Even though it is a descriptive research, I think it's important for local researchers. However, I suggest some changes: the title “Prevalence of hepatitis B and C infections in hemodialysis patients” should be completed to include the geographical region P-values 0.05 were considered significant, not 0.005, is possible there were a typing error How many of the patients presented the symptomatology of hepatitis? How many of the patients included in the study were being vaccinated against hepatitis B virus?
