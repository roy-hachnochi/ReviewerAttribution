Below my considerations. I believe that the article can be indexed with minor adjustments. I do not agree with the statement: "In the last decades, Brazil has faced different arbovirus epidemics. However, none of them had the complexity of Zika virus and associated diseases". Dengue has caused and still causes serious public health and has much higher mortality rate in Brazil. The article cites many epidemiological bulletin of the Ministry of Health. This is important, but it has some articles that deserve to be mentioned. As an example, we have published papers citing cases of zika in Brazil (RN and BA) before the publication of the Ministry of Health report. Even with all the advances cited by the authors I believe that it is necessary to mention the delay in the release of funds for research on zika in Brazil.
