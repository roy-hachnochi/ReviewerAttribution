The manuscript in review uses a previously tested model of protein-protein interaction (PPI) called High-confidence Protein-Protein Interaction Prediction (HiPPIP) to predict novel PPIs of two small membrane-associated interferon-inducible transmembrane proteins IFITM1 and IFITM3. The authors cite previously reported data on the role of IFITM1 and IFITM3 in inhibiting Zika virus (ZIKV) and make a valid argument that the novel PPIs of IFITM1 and IFITM3 from the HiPPIP model could possibly predict mechanisms of host invasion and immune suppression by Zika virus (ZIKV) and members of its family Flaviviridae . They also analyze functional and pathway associations of the interacting proteins and discuss possible roles of these proteins as targets for ZIKV infection. The title, abstract and article are clearly presented and make an engaging read. Although the authors present an extensive discussion on novel interactors, the article ends arbitrarily. A conclusion paragraph summarizing the results and presenting new ideas for future research would be apt.
