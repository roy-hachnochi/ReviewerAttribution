This manuscript presents a use model of the a protein-protein interaction method developed by the author along with other collaborators, focused on a very important pathogen (Zika) in the present circumstances. It is lucidly written and well presented. The biggest shortcoming of this manuscript is the failure to cite several previous work related to the interferon-inducible transmembrane protein 3 ("The Antiviral Effector IFITM3 Disrupts Intracellular Cholesterol Homeostasis to Block Viral Entry" - Amini-Bavil-Olyaee, et. al, 2013, "The antiviral effector IFITM3 disrupts intracellular cholesterol homeostasis to block viral entry", Amini-Bavil-Olyaee, et. al, 2013 to name a couple). Furthermore, the current manuscript and its stated methodology does not find two proteins (VAPA and OSBP) that have been shown to have interactions with IFITM3. This would have been a clincher. It would also be proper to mention other work related to IFITM mechanism ("IFITM Proteins Restrict Viral Membrane Hemifusion": Li et. al, 2013) - and focus on the viral membrane hemifusion mentioned there. Minor comments: "functional studies initiated solely" - capitalize functional. Widespread use of "we" with only a single author. "Computationally discovered PPIs have been shown to be highly accurate by computational evaluations and experimental validations of a few PPIs'." - overstated and speculative. It is also speculative to correlate the expression changes of predicted interactors to these IFITMs, since there can be multiple other reasons for such expression changes ("whether any of the interacting genes were differentially expressed in that study and found five genes that were differentially expressed").
