The title, abstract and article overall are well written and clear. The design, methods and analysis are mostly well described, although some detail could be added. In particular, given that the IFITM interactome contains a large number of previously unknown PPI’s, it would be useful to give a little more detail on the methodology on how these predictions were obtained, rather than just stating that HiPPIP was used. In particular, it would be useful to understand what cut-off was used and a brief mentioning of the prediction methodology in general. An estimate of false positive and false negative errors for the prediction in Figure 1 would be particularly helpful. In the analysis, the legend for Figure 2 needs expansion. It is not clear what the edges signify and in particular what is the meaning of directionality in the arrows. I object to the wording used on page 2 “which was validated to be a true PPI”, as any PPI evidence is debatable. I would reword to “which was experimentally validated”. I also object to the wording used on page 2 “Computationally discovered PPIs have been shown to be highly accurate”. Such a blanket statement is clearly not true, as there are many predictions out there that are highly inaccurate. A more specific example needs to be provided here. A minor suggestion is to replace “HiPPIP model” with “the HiPPIP model”.
