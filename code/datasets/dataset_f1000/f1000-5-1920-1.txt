Ku et al, describe the experiences with a newly designed device for collecting cough specimens from patients with CF. The device is constructed with the intention that dead space air, presumably containing a high concentration of oral contaminants, should be collected separately, while on the other hand cough material from the lower lungs is to be collected on a specific filter constructed so that bacteria should be trapped in such a way that the material may be used for RT-PCR. Title, abstract, methods and material are clearly described as is results. Discussion is adequate and relevant. The presented results indicate high specificity with low risk of oral contaminants in cough specimens than in sputum from 20 adult CF individuals. Actually only 12 patients produced a sputum specimen, so it is a small study. However the differences were significant. Sensitivity cannot be assessed with the way the study was carried out, but comparison with other studies indicate satisfactory results. Thus, the device seems to permit improved analysis of quantitative bacteriology in lower lung specimens from CF patients. The device is described as simple to use and is suggested to be used to follow lower respiratory tract microbiology in CF patients, so that increased concentrations of significant bacterial pathogens may be noted. This may be a step forward for the management of these patients. Further studies, including pediatric studies, are needed to corroborate the findings in this study and to explore the advantages of longitudinal follow up of CF patients PCR may not suffice all the time, since bacterial resistance may have to be detected and specified in order to find an adequate treatment alternative. Needless to say this is an increasing problem.
