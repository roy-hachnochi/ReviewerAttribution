I believe that the title is appropriate for the content of this article and the abstract represents an excellent summary of the work. This very interesting paper describes the synthesis and cytotoxicity testing of several Schiff bases with potential use in cancer therapy. The bases are characterised and then tested for toxicity to human cell lines using two well established tests. The results reveal differences in responses of the two cell lines (one blood and one epithhelial derived) making them potentially very useful. The authors also hint at different biological mechanisms being involved. The structure, methods and analysis of the results from the study are very well designed. I think the conclusions are sensible, balanced and justified on the basis of the results of the study. There is enough information provided to be able to replicate the experiment and the data are in a usable format/ structure and have all been provided. In summary, the paper is well written and the data appear sound.
