 In this manuscript, the author investigated the neural electrophysiological characterizations of the spinal cord, the nucleus reticularis of the thalamus and the cerebral cortex by means of whole-cell patch-clamp recordings. The results suggested that diabetic mice showed reduced neurosteroid tone but enhanced sensitivity to some neurosteroids, ob/ob mice exhibited mechanical hyperalgesia and allodynia, which was reduced by neurosteroids applied exogenously. The author concluded that the reduced endogenous neurosteroid tone in ob/ob mice may be linked to their hypersensitivity. Questions: 1. The author concluded the loss of neurosteroid tone in ob/ob mice. There is no further mechanism study. 2. What is the neurosteroid receptor expression in ob/ob mice, compared with WT mice? Is there any alternation in diabetic mice? 3. The author did not show the frequency of mIPSC in lamina II of the spinal dorsal horn, nRT and layer 2/3 of the cortex. How about the frequency of mIPSC in those sites with development. Please show some representative consecutive chart recording. 4. According to the results, the amplitude of mIPSC is around 35-40 Pa, which is larger than our experience. Can the author give the reason. 5. Please can the author check the alphabetical sequences of the figures and figure legends.
