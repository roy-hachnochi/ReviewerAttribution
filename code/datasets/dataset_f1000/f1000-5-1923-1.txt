This is an interesting study using electrophysiological and behavioural approaches in strains of mice to gauge the potential changes in neurosteroid signalling in diabetic neuropathy. The study extends through the central nervous system and the data is suggestive of important roles of these substances. The work is detailed and meticulous. However, using in vitro slices cannot allow for investigation of identified neurons in terms of pain inputs and how these may be altered by neurosteroids or indeed, neuropathy.
