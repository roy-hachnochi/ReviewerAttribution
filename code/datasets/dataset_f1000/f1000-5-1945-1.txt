The revised manuscript was substantially improved. I have two remaining points, which I suggest to clarify in form of a minor revision of the article: At the TBS conference in Gttingen 2016, Peterchev and colleagues presented modelling work (P90 in the abstract handbook) related to this study, and found the axon terminals to have the lowest thresholds. While their work is not yet published as full paper, it is worth adding a statement to the discussion of the study limitations here, e.g. that axon terminals of incoming axonal projections were not modelled, but might be further neural elements that are well excitable by TMS. I am still puzzled by the way in which the effect of the TMS field on the neural compartments was modelled (page 5 of the revised manuscript). This seems to depend on the assumption of rotationally symmetric compartments of negligible diameter (as the change of E is only evaluated along the compartment, and the transverse component of E is neglected). In contrast, the soma has a more complex geometry with several branching points at which the axons and the dendritic tree start. As the validity of the main conclusions (i.e. that the axon initial segment close to the soma is most easily stimulated by TMS) depends on an accurate modelling of the TMS effects on this region of the neuron, I would ask the authors to elaborate further on this question. A visualization of the compartmentalization might help to clarify this issue.
