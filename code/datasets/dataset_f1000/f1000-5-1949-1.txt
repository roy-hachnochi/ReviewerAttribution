Ajamma have an article on the use of the technique high resolution melt analysis towards the identification of morphologically indistinct species of mosquito. The specific goal is to expand the current set of primers in the research literature in order to identify more species from multiple genera of mosquitoes. The methodology is clear with sufficient details for it to be reproduced by listing all appropriate reagents, DNA primer sequences and real-time PCR instrumentation. I do recommend adding the criteria by which the melt curves were deemed to be sufficiently different to allow identification of the species as compared to the "Did Not Separate" state as reported in Table 4. Figures 1 - 3 and 5 are clear and support the results summarized in table 4. I appreciate the authors efforts to repeat and report data from the previously published primers ("AgamUni") as a point of comparison. Appropriate controls were used with (1) water as a negative control for amplification and (2) samples from defined colonies and samples previously sequenced as positive controls. The most significant limitation is the number of replicates, and the diversity of sample collection points for each species. The authors clearly acknowledge these limitations in the conclusion and clearly state the need for additional samples to asses the intra-specific variation which is critically important information to make this method highly useful. In summary, the paper is clearly and concisely written with 1 minor recommendations for additional information on the method. The goals of the research are clearly stated, and the results as well as the conclusions support the goals. The researchers have achieved the goals by identifying and confirming at least one primer pair for each of 4 genera that identify various species that are difficult to identify by morphology alone.
