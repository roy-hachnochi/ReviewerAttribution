The manuscript by Long and Hu is of considerable interest in the field of evolution of genomes. However the authors could consider the following points to improve the quality of the manuscript : Is there any numerical measure of species complexity ? On page 2, column 2, line 6 'Huang found that more complex species have less changeable sites in certain regions of the genomes.' It would be nice if some more details could be included with regard to these sites. The authors should be more elaborate as to why they considered the Genic zones to be mainly functional and invariable and the Distal zones as mainly non-functional and variable, and the Proximal zones functional and variable. The note about Lao Tzu was also quite attractive and added some philosophical charm to the scientific note.
