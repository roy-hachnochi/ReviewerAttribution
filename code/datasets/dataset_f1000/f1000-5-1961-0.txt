This is a well written manuscript describing the effects of aging on monocular and binocular visual acuity by recognizing luminance-modulated and contrast-modulated letters. There are some points, outlined below, which need clarification or further consideration by the authors. The visual acuity (Methods) for younger adults seems to be better than the older adults. Could the authors add each observerâ€™s original data for OD, OS, and OU acuity as another supplementary data? And note which eye was used in the monocular experiment? In the method session, please explain the experimental sequences of LM and CM under monocular and binocular viewing. In the method session, please add the value of contrast to display the letter stimuli. The additional experiment - the authors tended to use the ND filters to simulate the reduced retinal illumination in older adults due to senile miosis. However, the possible reasons or mechanism related vision changes in older adult are not limited to senile miosis or higher visual areas. In fact, the visual acuity of older adults seems to be lower than those of younger group. However, it is suggested to discuss other possible reasons to contribute the results.
