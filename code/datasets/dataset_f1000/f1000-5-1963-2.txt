This R Package "rDGidb" is of immense usability for genomics and proteomics research community for integrating drug interactions with variations obtained from NGS data and researchers studying complex multi target drug-gene/protein interactions. The research article is written clearly and well organized except for results section which has a room for improvement. The minor concerns are outlined as follows:- We recommend authors to demonstrate results shown in Table 1 as a pictorial representation such as drug-gene interaction network to increase readability. We suggest inclusion of the information related to Source Trust Level. It would be nice to include query option using r eference S NP ID number (“ rs ” ID) or by chromosomal position of genomic aberrations obtained from Next Generation Sequencing pipeline to directly identify drugs associated with these clinically actionable variations. We encountered a problem in installation of package “rDGidb”in R (version 3.3.1, release date 2016-06-21) with a warning message i.e. Package ‘rDGIdb’ is not available (for R version3.3.1). We recommend authors to make “rDGidb” working and if this warning message is platform dependent, then please provide detailed documentation on software’s or any updates needed in existing packages before installation of package.
