In this paper the authors analyze the data produced by the MalariaGen community that provides high quality data on over 900,000 SNP in more than 3000 samples from 22 countries. The authors report a significantly higher ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous polymorphisms in P. falciparum from South-East Asia compared to Africa and propose that this could explain the emergence of resistance in Asia. However this observation (and also the higher multiplicity of infections in Africa) is not novel. Furthermore the large number of K13 alleles, their dynamics and relative contributions to the clinical phenotype are likely to also be important. I think they could improve by showing that their analysis helps to understand the spread of a specific allele of K13 such as the C580Y. It would be useful if the authors could provide more explanations as to why they believe their findings are innovative and how they help us to understand the evolution of artemisinin resistance, since the mechanism is clearly different to that of other antimalarials.
