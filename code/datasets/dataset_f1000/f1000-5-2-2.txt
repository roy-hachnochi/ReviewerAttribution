Dirnagl and Przesdzing provide a highly innovative and comprehensive summary for the use of electronic laboratory notebooks (eLNs) in life science research. They highlight advantages of eLNs over traditional hand written LNs, comment on possible obstacles and inform readers about distinct features/specification of different types of eLN systems, e.g. complex rights management, integration of original data, direct link to laboratory equipment etc. In addition, they offer a step-by-step instruction of how to establish eLN systems in everyday laboratory practice based on the successful implementation of eLNs in their own institution. From an internal survey of their staff (scientist, students, technicians) they deduce which features of eLN systems were considered most desirable and which ones were regarded less relevant. In total, the article is highly informative for any researcher working in the life science field and is a very well suited guide for everybody who plans to switch from LN to eLN.
