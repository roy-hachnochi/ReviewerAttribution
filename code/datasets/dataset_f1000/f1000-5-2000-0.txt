As a meeting report and opinion piece, there is little to contradict in the manuscript. The ideas put forward are sensible and make a great starting point for discussion which is the purpose of the manuscript. Maybe the scope of the article could be slightly better defined to differentiate the goal of the proposed metrics from that of the metrics and methods used for software verification (see for example Giannoulatou et al (2014) ) References 1.

I confirm that I have read this submission and believe that I have an appropriate level of expertise to confirm that it is of an acceptable scientific standard.
