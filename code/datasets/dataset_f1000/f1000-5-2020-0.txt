This is a very interesting work in which the authors applied a simple yet very smart approach to address the very complex issue of intratumoral heterogeneity, for which clear cell renal cell carcinoma stands as a paradigm. Such method could indeed be applied to other tumor entities as well; moreover it could form the basis for a practical approach to tackle the problem of the minimum required number of samples that must be collected in order to cover the most of the molecular landscape of tumors. Lastly I would like to suggest that the authors might briefly explain in the introduction what is the “divide and conquer” strategy, as they did in their previous paper.
