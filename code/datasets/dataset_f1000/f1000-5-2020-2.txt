The authors demonstrate that multi-site tumor sampling improves the sensitivity for the detection of molecular heterogeneity in routine paraffin-embeded clear cell renal cell carcinoma samples. Molecular heterogeneity is a relevant feature of the advanced cancer samples that determines the adaptation capacity of the tumoral cells and their capacity to survive to the therapy. Standards for recognizing or reporting tumor heterogeneity are still to be defined. In this sense, this work is an inspiring example. It would be great to know whether this heterogeneity has clinical prognostic or predictive implications.
