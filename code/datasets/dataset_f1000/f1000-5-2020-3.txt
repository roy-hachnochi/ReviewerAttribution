The study extend previous demonstrations on the usefulness of this original sampling procedure, that might be relevant also to detect variability of molecular landscape in tumors, whatever is their origin. Just an annotation to better understand the method used: Was the total surface of fragments contained in a MSTS significantly different from that of a RS cassette? How was grading and other parameter assigned in the MSTS cassette, in the sense, based even on a single or part of fragment of those contained in the all cassette? Similarly, was in the RS given based on part (and how much?) of the section? I do understand that the procedure used likely followed the published rules, but this might be mentioned in the paper.
