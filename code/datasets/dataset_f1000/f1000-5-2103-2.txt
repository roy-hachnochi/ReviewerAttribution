This is an excellent paper highlighting the importance of sample annotation as a critical contributor to reproducible research. Using transcriptomics of sex-specific gene expression levels as an example, the authors do a careful analysis to illustrate the issue of mislabeling. My one concern, which they candidly acknowledge, is that nearly half of the samples appear to have only one error, which may lead many readers to conclude that this actually a quite respectable error rate and that thus this is not really a big problem. It was not entirely clear to me why, as the authors argue, that this is in fact 'the tip of the iceberg".
