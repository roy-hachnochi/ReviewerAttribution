The authors present a retrospective study looking for associated factors of stone free rate following PCNL on staghorn stones. The primary endpoint was stone free status evaluated at an early postoperative period. It’s interesting data in that the number of procedures is high (345). Overall, the paper was written concisely with a good methodology in research design and statistical analysis. I would recommend this article is indexed after addressing some issues enumerated below: Introduction No specific comments. Material and Methods This is a retrospective study over a time period of 15 years. The authors didn’t mention about the surgeon’s level of experience so I wonder if there will be any effect on stone free rate by the surgeons’ learning curve. Stone free status was a primary endpoint and a main focus in this study. However, it was evaluated by either plain KUB radiograph, CT scan, or antegrade pyelography. Could there be any bias based on these images, since we probably missed 3-4 mm residual fragment on a plain KUB film? Additionally, it could be difficult to evaluate stone free status accurately with plain KUB film in an early postoperative period. Fluid leakage around the kidney may obscure residual fragments. Results In Table 2, data regarding Number of PCNL access was duplicated with the above row. How would nephrostomy tube size correlate to stone free status? I think the tube size most likely depends on surgeon’s preference and other factors such as bleeding or requirement for postoperative drainage. Discussion No specific comments.
