This is a large retrospective analysis of the recurrence rate over 15 years of staghorn calculi after removal of staghorn calculi by percutaneous nephrolithotomy which examines the factors which appear to influence the recurrence rate. Univariate analysis indicated that a history of ipsilateral open renal stone surgery, stone burden and the type of anesthesia were significant factors in determining a stone-free outcome whereas multivariate analysis eliminated the type of anesthesia as a risk factor. The authors pointed out that they did not have adequate data concerning the metabolic factors that could have made a significant contribution to the recurrence rate. Nevertheless this is an otherwise worthwhile contribution to understanding the appropriate treatment of staghorn calculi.
