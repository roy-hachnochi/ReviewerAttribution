This is a well-written and informative substudy of a thoughtfully designed clinical trial to improve motor function. The authors report imaging predictors of recovery before and after controlling for initial severity. Main criticism: It was not clear that resting state sequences masked infarct. How many patients had infarct in M1. It would be unsurprising that there would be lower connectivity between M1 on the affected side and other areas if it is partially infarcted, and that would predict recovery. Conclusions about M1 connectivity predicting recovery are too strong, since the results were not statistically significant, but only showed a trend (e.g. p = 0.06). Furthermore, it seems that they did not control for multiple comparisons, so these could have been found just by chance.
