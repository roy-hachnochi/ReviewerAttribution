The change in the hemoglobin/phytoglobin nomenclature presented in Hill et al. paper is timely and well supported by the hemoglobin and phytoglobin community. The change has been discussed in many conferences including the 2014 XVIII Conference on Oxygen-Binding and Sensing Proteins mentioned in the paper. The system presented in Table 1 is logical and supported by the protein structures and by the phylogenetic tree presented in Figure 2. The only and very slight problem is in the positioning of symbiotic hemoglobins present in non-legume nitrogen fixing plants, which have amino acid sequence similarities with both Phytogbs1 and 2. However, their positioning as a separate group in Table 1 is supported by the fact that they are only found in the nodules of actinorhizal plants. Dr. Topunov has provided a historical perspective on the evolution of the name phytoglobin in his referee report, which clearly shows both the need for the term and no scientific discrepancy in its use. I agree wholeheartedly.
