The authors discuss an interesting concept of using plants as vehicles for the production of vaccines and pharmaceutically important proteins. Although it is a promising field with some successful examples already existing, I get the impression from the text that it may lead to a quick solution for the vaccine development targeting the current Zika and chikungunya outbreaks. However, given the time for the development and testing needed before such a vaccine could be administered to a larger population I cannot foresee that this will happen in the near future. Maybe this can be rephrased to reflect this. Furthermore, the skeptical or negative opinion against transgenic crops existing in many countries may also affect the medical substances in question here, especially if targeting edible vaccines. As this may be a larger obstacle than the actual technological challenges, this could have been discussed further.
