The revised manuscript has satisfactorily addressed my largest concern about the reproducibility of the workflow by updating the code, and stating the dependence on Bioconductor 3.4. While I understand that this workflow is meant to work under version 3.4, it is important to mention these information in the manuscript regardless of the time of publication, especially if one expects that there might be casual users of R (at this point I would echo the sentiments of Hongkai Ji regarding installation convenience). Working with development versions of R - albeit awaiting its release at that point in time - is a slight danger in itself, unless the workflow is only relying on packages that the authors have themselves developed. However, these are but minor issues. I thank the authors for creating this documentation that should provide a sufficient launchpad for those getting into single-cell analyses. I hope the authors will continue to improve upon the components as the field matures.
