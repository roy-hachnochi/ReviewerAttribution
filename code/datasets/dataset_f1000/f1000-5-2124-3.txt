This study proposed prediction methods using SVM and RF classifiers with mRMR selected feature sets from cell line data and demonstrate its prediction ability for outcomes from METABRIC patient cohort. The classifiers with good prediction performance show the usefulness of combining domain knowledge with feature selection techniques. However, some details essential for reproducibility and interpretation are missing. Required information is listed in the following. What are the values of parameters for SVM and RF classifiers and the methods for parameter selection (by default or other selection methods)? The development and evaluation of models for patient data are not clear. Whether the models were trained using partial data from METABRIC or only leave-one-out cross-validation was applied? If cross-validation is the case, then what is the model offered at the online server because there will be more than one models created, and whether the cross-validation is involved in the feature selection process that often leads to an overestimation of the performance. For the case of training on partial data, both training and test performance are essential information for evaluating the robustness of models. Since some of the datasets are highly imbalanced, the numbers of positives and negatives, as well as sensitivity and specificity are more important than accuracy for interpreting the results as a high accuracy with a low AUC could be the result of all positive/negative predictions on an imbalanced dataset. Listing all the information along with the accuracy and AUC will help the interpretation of prediction performances.
