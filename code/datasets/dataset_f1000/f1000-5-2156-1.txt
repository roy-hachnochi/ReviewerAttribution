The manuscript from Crusio et al . describes the use of GeneNetwork to identify QTLs associated with morphine response in a genetic reference mouse population. The authors highlight many strengths afforded by both GeneNetwork and the BXD recombinant inbred mice. Specifically, they used composite interval mapping to reanalyze publicly available phenotypic and genotypic data in the BXDs to identify a QTL on chromosome 7 that had been masked by a major QTL on chromosome 10. Next, they employed a bioinformatics approach to prioritize among candidate genes within the QTL interval. This resulted in the identification of promising candidate genes that may be associated with drug-abuse phenotypes. One step that would strengthen the manuscript would be to use QTLminer in GeneNetwork to examine cis -regulation of the genes located within the QTL support interval (or even just the most promising candidate genes) and to see if any of those genes were expression QTLs in BXD mice. In addition, the authors raise an interesting question when they ask whether the chromosome 7 QTL is opioid-specific, or if it also occurs with other classes of drugs. They could use GeneNetwork to search for genetic correlations between the expression levels of their top candidate genes and drug-related traits. Minor Points: On the GeneNetwork website, Trait ID 11851 is defined as the number of beam breaks after morphine injection, but is described as “distance traveled” and “locomotion” in the Figure 1 legend of the manuscript.
