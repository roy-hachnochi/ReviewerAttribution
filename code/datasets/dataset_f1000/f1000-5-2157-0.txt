In this manuscript Wall et al. introduce the future potential of large display systems for visualizing neuroimaging data, making particular reference to their relevance for clinical neuroimaging by visualising multiple sources of neuroimaging information in parallel. I found this manuscript to be timely and well written. The MS case study also provides a clear example of how these tools can be used in real life. I whole-heartedly recommend this article is indexed after a couple minor grammatical errors are addressed. Third paragraph of the introduction – I think you mean to say “MRI and MEG have also been ‘fused’ …” rather than ‘used’. Pg 5 paragraph starting “Synthesising and visualising…” – change “are a critical components” to “are critical components”.
