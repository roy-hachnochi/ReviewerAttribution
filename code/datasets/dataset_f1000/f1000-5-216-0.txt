This study is well designed and written during a long period of 7 years from 2003-2010. The study is a retrospective chart review and not a randomized trial as acknowledged by the authors. It is not clear how follow-up and recurrence rates were identified (i.e. Holter monitoring, phone calls to patients, etc.). Did any patients in each group have an implantable rhythm management device (i.e. pacemaker or implantable cardioverter-defibrillator)? Were there any crossovers from dofetilide to dronedarone or vice versa? Table one shows almost 20% (19.7%) of patients with congenital heart failure were on dronedarone. The PALLAS trial demonstrated that the drug increased mortality; therefore, dronedarone should not be prescribed to such patients. The authors should mention and further discuss that this data implied that dofetilide is more effective than dronedarone is in preventing recurrence of atrial arrhythmia.
