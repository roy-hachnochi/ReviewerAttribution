Serge Nataf has admirably schematized the “cognitive paradigm,” so aptly coined by Irun Cohen 25(!) years ago (see his citations in the accompanying review). The immune system is, indeed, a “mobile” brain (Fridman 1991) and the parallels between the immune and nervous systems is far from metaphorical or idealized modeling: their inter-connections include the origins of their respective developments, that continue with intimate anatomic relationships, as well as shared messengers and receptors. Indeed, psychoneuroimmunology comprises a large research field, whose wealth of studies have confirmed the close evolutionary histories of what are, in essence, similar information processing systems (Ader, Felten and Cohen 1991; Ader 2006; Orosz 2001; Forrest and Hofmeyr 2001). (Note, instead of using the visual system as his example, Nataf might have shown the obvious similarities in the molecular-sensing perception of taste or smell to make the same point about perception and, in that example, emphasized the similarities of structural correspondence and subsequent activation employed by both the immune and taste systems.) Two historical notes: First, while Nataf credits Jerne with introducing cognitive terminology to immunology (citing the 1974 idiotypic network paper), the origins of immunity as cognitive appears earlier in the cybernetics craze of the early 1950s and Burnet’s musings a decade later (Tauber 1994). (Although Burnet first used "cognate" in passing in 1959 [Burnet 1959, p.70], by 1962, he invoked an analogy with language to account for antibody selection [Burnet 1962, p. 94-5].) But historical primacy is not the matter of interest regarding Jerne’s seminal paper, but rather his introduction of how the context of antigen presentation determined the immune response. According to his hypothesis, the disruption of the network by antigen, and more to the point, the extent of that interruption in terms of breaking the inter-connections of the lattice-like structure, determined the immunogenicity of the introduced substance. That fundamental idea is the source of Matzinger’s Danger Theory and Pradeu’s more recent continuity/discontinuity theory. The second historical note is that an important chapter of the cognitive paradigm’s history must include the work of Antonio Coutinho (1991; 1995; 2003), Francisco Varela (Varela et al., 1988; 1991, 1993; Varela and Coutinho 1991), John Stewart (1992; 1994a; 1994b; Stewart and Varela 1989), and Nelson Vaz (2016; Vaz et al., 2006). These publications developed Jerne’s cognitive point in its full theoretical array and attempted to draw both theoretical and practical parallels between the nervous and immune systems. Those studies comprise the rich mulch for the emergence of our current thinking about how immunity may be properly regarded as an information processing faculty and as such shares organizational (and ultimately regulatory) characteristics with the brain. In terms of going beyond Nataf’s schema as an educational tool (which it certainly is), a deeper assessment must be made as to how well modelers have applied the integrative principles employed here. In other words, to the extent systems biology has offered models of immune responses or steady-state conditions, has the hierarchical structure employed by Nataf been utilized and if so, what insights does such an approach offer? That assessment would be useful not only in terms of confirming Nataf’s schema, but perhaps modelers might develop this approach for their own efforts. A review of this issue, as well as a critical discussion about the cognitive paradigm applied to immunology, is found elsewhere (Tauber 1997; 2013; 2017). References 1.
