This article would be improved with statements quantifying how common progression to disease occurs in patients treated with anti-HCV compounds in the absence of other drugs. The main point of the article, that there should be pre-clinical trials to test for efficacy and toxicity of dual therapy with Pitavastatin are valid. However, a replicon system in hepatocellular cells is not likely to duplicate the full gamut of potential side effects seen in humans receiving pitavastatin and anti-HCV drugs. Although it is an important place to start, the risk that complications will not be revealed in a preclinical trial using this system should be acknowledged.
