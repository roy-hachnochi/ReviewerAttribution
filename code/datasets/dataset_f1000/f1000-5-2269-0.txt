Rett syndrome is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by mutations in the MECP2 gene. The authors previously generated a knock-in mouse model of Rett syndrome ( Mecp2 A140V). This paper describes in vitro studies of hippocampal and cerebellar granule neurons from the Mecp2 A140V mice. The paper demonstrates that the soma and nuclear size of these neurons in the Mecp2 A140V mice is decreased compared to the wild-type animals. The authors took advantage of a mouse line with an eGFP transgene on X chromosome to show that this size difference is a cell-autonomous effect. Further, they show that the small cell soma size phenotype can be rescued by IGF-1, and there are altered molecular signatures of the mTOR pathway in the mutant mouse brains. It is a well-designed and well-executed study, and the data are clearly presented. This in vitro experimental model, with soma and nuclear size of neurons as biomarkers, could potentially be an attractive platform for high-throughput drug screening. In terms of the effect of A140V on the mTOR pathway, the reduction of Rictor, phosphorylated mTOR (S2481) and phosphorylated 4E-BP1 displayed on the Western blots is highly intriguing, but it would require further functional studies to link these molecular signatures to the phenotype of the A140V mutant neurons. Minor points: In Figure 5C, only the results of IGF-1 treatment in the mutant neurons are shown, but it would be better to also show the results of IGF-1 treatment in the wild-type neurons. In Figure 6A, there are two lanes of Western blots shown for each of wild-type and A140V. There should be an explanation as to what these two lanes represent.
