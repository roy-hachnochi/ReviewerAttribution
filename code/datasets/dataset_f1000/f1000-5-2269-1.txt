Rett syndrome (RTT) is caused by mutations in MECP2 gene which encodes methyl-CpG-binding protein 2. One such mutation is MECP2 A140V. This group has previously generated a mouse model of RTT, expressing Mecp2 A140V mutant. This mouse is extremely useful to characterize a complex disease like RTT, at the cellular and molecular level. This interesting study by Rangasamy et al., focuses on the characterization of in vitro neuronal phenotype and reports several novel findings. Size distribution studies with hippocampal and cerebellar granule neurons suggest that the neurons from male mutant mice have smaller soma size. Following treatment with IGF-1, the neuronal soma size is rescued. This finding supports the potential therapeutic use of IGF-1 in RTT. The authors have also generated a novel female mouse model with heterozygous Mecp2 A140V mutant, carrying X-linked GFP allele on the normal X-chromosome. By this approach, GFP-positive wild-type neurons and GFP-negative mutant neurons can be compared within the mixed neuronal populations. With this model, the authors demonstrate the cell-autonomous nature of MeCP2 action on the neuronal size. In addition, MeCP2 appears to play a role in the regulation of mTOR pathway. Defects in this pathway are observed in the mutant mice, as shown by decreases in the levels of phosphorylated mTOR (pS2481) and phosphorylated 4E-BP1. Overall, this is a well-designed study with significant findings that contribute to the understanding of a complex disease. Future studies are needed to further understand the mechanism linking mTOR down-regulation and neuronal dysfunction.
