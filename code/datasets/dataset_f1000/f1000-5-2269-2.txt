The manuscript uses the experimental leverage of an in vitro cultures to document a change in soma size in neurons from a novel mouse mutant with a knock-in A140V mutation of the MECP2 gene linked to the x-chromosome. Phenotype of hippocampal and cerebellar granule neurons from male and female mice were examined, and statistically significant reductions in soma size were noted. These reductions in soma size were associated with reductions in mTOR signaling and rescued by IGF-1, which drives mTOR signaling. The authors suggest that the reductions in neuronal size may be a good phenotype on which to screen for drugs or molecules that overcome MeCP2 mutant effects. Overall this is a nice paper, with generally good controls and an intriguing message with clear clinical implications. Although not absolutely necessary, it would be nice to see if molecular or pharmacological inhibition of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling pathway abrogated the effects of IGF1. It would also be useful to look at a growth factor that drives Erk signaling to see if it can overcome the effects. Finally forced expression of Rictor in vitro or in vivo might more directly link mTOR signaling with the Rett phenotype. Otherwise, a very interesting and important study.
