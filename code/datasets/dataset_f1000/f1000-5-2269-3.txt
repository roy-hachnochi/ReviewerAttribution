One of the cellular features of Rett syndrome replicated in MeCP2-based mouse models is a smaller cell body of neurons, which, together with the lack of neuronal cell death, results in a higher packing density of neurons in all brain regions studied to date. The study by Rangasamy et al. extends these observations to the MECP2 A140V knock-in mouse model that was crossed with a GFP-based mouse reporter of X-chromosome inactivation. These mice, together with knock-in mice with a GFP sequence inserted into Mecp2 gene, are a great tool to identify cells that express the mutant allele in the mosaic brain of heterozygous Mecp2 female mice, allowing the characterization of cell autonomous and non-cell autonomous consequences of MeCP2 loss. The authors replicate the observation that the mTOR pathway is downregulated in MECP2 A140V knock-in mice, as it is in Mecp2 null mice. Finally, the authors describe that IGF-1 increased the cell body size of cultured neurons from Mecp2 A140V male mice. Overall, these observations confirm that neuronal cell body size is a reliable biomarker of MeCP2 dysfunction, that IGF-1 improves cellular features in a Rett model, and that Mecp2 A140V knock-in mice replicate cellular features observed in Rett individuals and other Mecp2-based mouse models. The observations and approaches described by Rangasamy et al. represent a useful contribution to the field of translational and preclinical studies in Rett syndrome.
