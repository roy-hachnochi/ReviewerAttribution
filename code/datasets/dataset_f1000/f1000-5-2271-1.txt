This well-written report describes the creation of a new platform for facilitating collaborative work among and between research groups. This platform takes advantage of the existing protocols.io site and App, and so is focused on methodological sharing, although other types of information are also covered. This approach fits well with the recent emphasis (from NIH and others) to address the issue of reproducibility in the biomedical literature. Of course, the ultimate utility of this (or any) platform will depend on what those in the field make it. One item that the authors may wish to clarify is the protocols.io business model, which is touched upon near the end of this piece, but is likely not familiar to many readers. This is not meant to impugn the data services model, but just to ensure its transparency.
