This is a snappy and thought-provoking Opinion article, written in Steven Frank’s characteristically laconic style. The main message of the article is that, by investigating apparent failures in the design of organisms, we get a deeper understanding of organismal design. The particular focus here is on the suprisingly high levels of male sterility observed in many populations, and Frank takes us on a whirlwind tour of sperm dysfunction, pollen abortion and hybrid male sterility, highlighting commonalities and providing synthesis. Frank ends the article with a compelling metaphor: a car is a complicated object whose design may be difficult to fathom simply by inspection; but, by cutting a wire and noting that it causes the brakes to fail, we learn something about how it is put together. The design of the organism is also illuminated by its failure. I agree with all this, but would add two further thoughts. First, it could be that apparent failure owes not to actual maladaptation on the organism’s part but rather a misunderstanding on our part as to what constitutes good design. For example, sterile individuals abound in social insect colonies, and contemplation of this apparent puzzle led to a much deeper understanding of what it is organisms are designed to do (the theory of inclusive fitness). Second, it could be that failure reveals we have been looking for design in the wrong place. Several of the specific examples discussed in this article concern conflicts of interest within the genome, e.g. between mitochondrial vs nuclear genes. Failure might not reveal organism design, but design at the gene level. As is my policy, I waive anonymity Andy Gardner
