This is a well designed, carefully executed and documented study, that provides important insights into the cost-effectiveness of national stockpiles of neuraminidase inhibitors to be used during influenza pandemics. The analysis is relying on a number of key assumptions, such as the effectiveness of NAI antivirals against mortality due to influenza, the probability of a pandemic occurring during the shelf life of the stockpile and the proportion of pandemic influenza deaths occurring in hospital. Many of these assumptions are based on a limited or controversial evidence base, however the authors acknowledge and address most of these limitations. The assumption that most pandemic deaths occur in hospitals, is based on the observation during the 2009 pandemic in the UK, however in many countries, already during severe influenza A(H3N2) epidemics, and during many previous pandemics, the majority of deaths are likely to occur in the community, outside of hospitals. It is confusing that the authors compare the costs of a population wide (80%) stockpile with the estimated benefits on hospital mortality only. Although this is discussed in the second paragraph of discussion, it would be helpful to see an analysis or results taking also into account outpatient and community mortality. It is likely that such an analysis would be useful for other countries than UK. Please discuss briefly the limitations of this approach and these assumptions, when replicating the study in other settings (such as differences in societal willingness to pay per QALY). In Box 1. the two columns are not aligned when viewing as a pop-up on MS Internet Explorer. In Figure 1. the references to UK, and the national pandemic flu service are not helpful and distract from the more general main message of this figure.
