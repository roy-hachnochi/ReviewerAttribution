The report describes a rare case where spilled gallstones following laparoscopic cholecystectomy resulted in fistulas to the subcutaneous tissue as well as to the pleura. Albeit an uncommon late complication from spilled gallstones, the report is an important reminder of the hazards of gallstone surgery and an argument for careful surgical technique in laparoscopic cholecystectomy for acute cholecystitis. Even if there is no high risk of developing severe complications such as those described in the report, it should be kept in mind when performing laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Granulomas due to gallstones left in the abdominal cavity is probably an overseen complication following gallstone surgery that may cause persisting pain. Comments: Did the report from the cholecystectomy include more detailed description of the spilled gallstones? Where the gallstones left in the trochar site (which could explain the subcutaneous fistlulas)? Where any attempts taken to extract the stones? Were any bacterial cultures taken? The aggressive local growth, with formation of abscesses as well as fistulas raised the suspicion of uncommon pathogens (e.g. Salmonella Virchow or Clostridium perfringens) In the discussion “In this case, the gallstones were found on CT before complications developed. Perhaps, the abscesses and fistula could have been avoided if the stones had been removed when they were discovered.”. Do the authors suggest a repeated laparoscopic procedure, even in asymptomatic patients, in order to remove spilled gallstones? This seems like a slightly hyperbolic recommendation from this single experience. A laparoscopic exploration aimed at discovering gallstones overseen at the first procedure may hardly be expected to reduce the risk of late complications.
