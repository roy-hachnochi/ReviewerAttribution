This article reports about an open mouse ultrasonic vocalization (USV) database (mouseTube) to store both USV data and its metadata about recording equipment, conditions and experimental protocols. As the authors clearly point out, the field of mouse ultrasonic vocalization research is challenging due to the very high variability of both the data itself and the experimental protocols, recording equipment and analysis software/approaches used. The establishment of the mouseTube database, if implemented well and adopted by mouse USV researchers, could represent the single most important advance in the field to date. mouseTube has the potential to enhance experimental reproducibility, standardize recording condition reporting and allow for a rich test bed for analysis software and methods. Again, this will SIGNIFICANTLY advance the field. As for implementation, the article gives detailed information on the structure of the mouseTube database and several examples of specific use cases. The structure is well thought out and it is clear that, as more users come to mouseTube, the database will be flexible enough to accommodate iterative user-driven changes. Overall, the article describes a well thought out implementation of a desperately needed tool for USV research.
