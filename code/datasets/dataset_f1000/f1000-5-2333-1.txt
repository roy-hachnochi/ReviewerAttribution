"Our finding that molecular profiles are significantly more consistent than drug sensitivity data, indicates that the main barrier to biomarker development using these data is the unreliability in the reported response phenotypes for many drugs. For studies such as these to realize their full potential, additional work must be done to develop robust and reproducible experimental and analytical protocols so that the same compound, tested on the same set of cell lines by different groups, yields consistent and comparable results. Barring this, a predictive biomarker of response developed from one study is unlikely to be able to reliably validated on another, and consequently, is unlikely to be useful in predicting patient response." Again, I think the concern here is wrong for the same reasons I describe above. The main barrier is *not* the differences in quality between assays. The author's response to my initial concern shifts it to variability within an assay, but that is obvious -- if an assay doesn't work it can't be informative. Bad assays should be excluded. Period. The original premise of the work was that differences in results between assays was problematic but that is not the problem. Its that specific assays do not produce the high quality data necessary. My further points remain. I agree it may be hard, but it is possible.
