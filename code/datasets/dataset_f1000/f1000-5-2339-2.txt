The article is a very brief introduction to some uses of Minecraft outside of its core gamer base. The authors highlight some interesting projects, but do not dicuss them at any length. Beyond providing a handful of examples no real attempt has been made to discuss how Minecraft can or might be used to craft minds and communities. Nor do the authors express much of an opinion on the topic. Furthermore some fundamentals and high profile attempts to use Minecraft as an educational tool projects have been overlooked. For example the authors imply that the first versions of Minecraft designed for educational uses was launched in September 2016. However MinecraftEDU has been available since 2011. Other educational projects such work by the Royal Geological Society , the Tate Modern are not mentioned. The article does cover a very interesting and rich area for which I would like to see a comprehensive review or opinion piece. This article is a good start however much more depth, both in terms of examples, discuss and opinion is needed.
