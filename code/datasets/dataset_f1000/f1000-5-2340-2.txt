GeneBreak is an R package to help identifying recurrent breakpoints of copy number variants (CNVs). While the offered analyses are straightforward from a methodological point of view, this package can be valuable in practice, providing an easy and reproducible way to conduct such analyses. I appreciate that it is available from bioconductor (and hence easily installable), openly developed on github, and archived on zenodo. I merely have some minor suggestions for improvements: When trying to use the package, I couldn't open the example data (got a "data set ‘copynumber.data.chr20’ not found" error). Could you verify that it's available? First sentence: SNV commonly means "single nucleotide variation" (not "small"). P1, L9: " Recently, ... " Of course what you consider "recent" is a matter of taste, but here you are citing a review paper from 2007. I wouldn't call this recent. P1, Methods, L3: " ... and copy number detection algorithm " Either explain what exactly you mean here, or remove. P1, paragraph " Due to the typical granularity [...], in fact represent a chromosomal interval. " I can guess what you mean here, but writing this more clearly would be good. P1, " This method assumes the same permutation null- distribution for all candidate breakpoint events for the analysis of breakpoints at the level of genomic location. " Could you describe in more detail how the null distribution is obtained? P1, " In addition, a more comprehensive and powerful dedicated Benjamini-Hochberg FDR correction that accounts for discreteness in the null-distribution is supplied. " The Benjamini-Hochberg procedure is a well defined statistical method. I would rephrase the respective sentence(s) to explicitly say that you are talking about Gilbert's method.
