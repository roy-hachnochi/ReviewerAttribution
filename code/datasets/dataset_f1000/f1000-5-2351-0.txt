The Ralser group has thoughtfully designed and created a comprehensive set of plasmids suitable for the complementation of various combinations of the widely used leucine ( leu2 ), uracil ( ura3 ), methionine ( met17 , formerly known as met15 ), histidine ( his3 ), and lysine ( lys2 ) markers. Auxotrophy can have significant effects on a variety of phenotypes, as shown by this group and others (and as well-described in the introduction). This new collection of plasmids provides a convenient source of auxotrophic markers supplied from their endogenous promoters on a CEN/ARS plasmid, which is near single-copy in most situations. Not content to make a simple derivative of the pHLUM plasmid they previously created in order to build a prototrophic version of the yeast deletion collection, the group went to significant efforts to preserve several sites including BamHI and XhoI within the blue/white compatible multiple cloning site of their base vector. These plasmids have been fully sequenced in collaboration with Addgene, revealing a handful of mutations not present in the original (theoretical) sequence of the parent plasmid deposited in Genbank more than a decade ago. One minor point could be mentioned for clarity - The introduction mentions supplementation of "nucleotides" but it is important to note that yeast cells do not take up (phosphorylated) nucleotides directly. Instead, these are dephosphorylated by extracellular phosphatases to nucleosides and then imported. There are also transporters that can efficiently take in nucleobases such as uridine.
