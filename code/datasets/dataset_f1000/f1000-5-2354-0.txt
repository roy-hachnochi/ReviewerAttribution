The authors propose a means of detecting heart rate variability (HRV) from the photoplethysmographic (PPG) signal. As presented, the study is only marginally informative and the following issues require consideration. From the references cited in relation to the available database of PPG signals, it appears that the ECG was also recorded in the same subjects. If so, it begs the question as to why the HRV obtained from the ECG signal was not compared to the HRV obtained from the PPG signal.It is not clear why secondary associations with age needed to be invoked to provide a rather indirect justification of the fact that HRV can be obtained from the PPG signals recorded for 20 seconds. If there were no ECG signals available, there is still a significant limitation in the study due to the very uneven distribution of age in the cohort. There are very few subjects in the age range 30-40 compared to 20-30. Given the low correlation, it is not clear if this could even be an indirect demonstration. Abstract: correct $aa$ Page 4.
