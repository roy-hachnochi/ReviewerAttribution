In the paper, heart rate variability (HRV) is determined using the photoplethysmogram (PPG) signal. The demonstrated findings are based on the calculation of the standard deviation of heartbeat interval (SDNN) and the root-mean square of the difference of successive heartbeats (RMSSD). These indices were determined using the second derivative wave of photoplethysmogram (APG) signal. The presented methodology seems valid. However, there are some issues that should be addressed. Since authors in their previous works used 20-second PPGs for calculation of HRV indices (SDNN and RMSDD), it cannot be said that “To date, there have been no studies that investigate the independent use of the photoplethysmogram (PPG) signal to determine heart rate variability (HRV)”. Please refer e.g., to: M Elgendi, M Jonkman, F De Boer.: Applying the APG to measure Heart Rate Variability, ICCAE 2010, DOI: 10.1109/ICCAE.2010.5452042. Authors claim that “if the PPG--HRV indices are negatively correlated with age, then short PPG signals are appropriate measurements for extracting HRV parameters”. The work “Applying the APG to measure Heart Rate Variability” (in the comment 1), as well as the paper: M Elgendi, M Jonkman, F De Boer.: Heart Rate Variability and the Acceleration Plethysmogram Signals Measured at Rest, Third International Joint Conference, BIOSTEC 2010, Valencia, Spain, January 20-23, 2010, DOI: 10.1007/978-3-642-18472-7_21, have already proven that short PPG signals are appropriate for extracting HRV parameters. In my opinion, the main novelty here is in showing the correlation of HRV indices measured before and after exercise with age, and such correlation with age should be emphasized, referring to these works, since it strengthens their findings. The title of the paper should also reflect this – the question in the title (“Can heart rate variability (HRV) be determined using short-term photoplethysmograms?”) was answered in 2010. The works above should be added to the literature. Figure 1 can be also found in these papers. Data were collected at a sampling rate of 200 Hz, with recording duration of 20 seconds, and the duration was limited since subjects were waiting after exercise for the measurement. This suggests a need of different organisation of the data collection, in which a line of participants is not formed and does not affect the experiment. However, since “short” is a relative term, it would be desirable to assess the shortest duration that can be used for meaningful calculation of the correlation between HRV indices measured at rest and after exercise with age. Here, for example, p-value for different lengths of PPG signals can be shown (in e.g., range 5-20s). Please add to the investigation the correlation of the HRV indices with the heart rate in order to make the conclusions more general (see your works in my second comment). The PPG database contains samples with imbalanced age distribution. This certainly influences the results and drawn conclusions on the age correlation of HRV indices, i.e., they can be wrong. Since new samples cannot be simply added to the database, the imbalanced data should be handled appropriately in order to obtain reliable results. There are many approaches to handle imbalanced datasets, e.g., undersampling (see Longadge, Rushi, and Snehalata Dongre. "Class imbalance problem in data mining review." arXiv preprint arXiv:1305.1707 (2013). http://arxiv.org/pdf/1305.1707). I strongly advise applying at least one such technique. References 1.

Not approved Fundamental flaws in the paper seriously undermine the findings and conclusions The authors propose a means of detecting heart rate variability (HRV) from the photoplethysmographic (PPG) signal. As presented, the study is only marginally informative and the following issues require consideration. From the references cited in relation to the available database of PPG signals, it appears that the ECG was also recorded in the same subjects. If so, it begs the question as to why the HRV obtained from the ECG signal was not compared to the HRV obtained from the PPG signal.It is not clear why secondary associations with age needed to be invoked to provide a rather indirect justification of the fact that HRV can be obtained from the PPG signals recorded for 20 seconds. If there were no ECG signals available, there is still a significant limitation in the study due to the very uneven distribution of age in the cohort. There are very few subjects in the age range 30-40 compared to 20-30. Given the low correlation, it is not clear if this could even be an indirect demonstration. Abstract: correct $aa$ Page 4.
