Having personally published earlier this year on GBS vaccination 1 , this is the most comprehensive review of GBS vaccination I have seen. Quite appropriately, the authors have extended the review beyond early onset GBS disease to include late onset GBS disease and GBS disease in non-pregnant adults. Unlike many reviews they have focused on low and middle-income countries (LMIC) where the burden of disease is at its greatest whereas most of the available data are from resource rich countries. In addition, the review covers other important topics often omitted from other overviews such as the increased risk of neonatal GBS disease in HIV-positive mothers, the use of protein based vaccines, reverse vaccinology and the necessary use of surrogate endpoints in vaccine trials. Importantly, they have addressed the problem that logistically, because of the estimated sample size for a phase III randomised controlled trial using a clinical endpoint of invasive neonatal disease, the different burden of disease across geographic regions dictates that trials may have to be performed in LMICs. This has its own problems, not the least of which is the acceptability of local standards of care in the context of such a trial. Finally, a minor criticism would be the omission of a discussion on the association between black race and GBS rectal colonisation, which is particularly pertinent bearing in mind the burden of disease in Africa and in African American women in the USA. In addition, while the use is mentioned, the role of rapid detection of GBS carriage using automated PCR techniques that might decrease the unnecessary use of intrapartum antibiotic prophlyxis during labour merits some emphasis.
