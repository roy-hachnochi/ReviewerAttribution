This is an excellent review article summarizing the status of GBS vaccine development for global use. This manuscript, in a logical and practical way, lays out the case for further development and testing of a GBS vaccine to be given to mothers primarily for the protection of their neonates. The burden of maternal and neonatal disease is thoroughly discussed and highlights the paucity of epidemiological data in many resource limited settings. This is the critical data needed to determine the contribution of GBS to overall neonatal morbidity and mortality in low and middle income countries where a candidate vaccine is most likely to be beneficial. There is an excellent list and discussion of previous GBS vaccine trials and outcomes. Even more useful is the discussion of challenges going forward with GBS vaccine trials, including a review of potential trial endpoints, challenges of any maternal vaccination program, and potential ethical and regulatory hurdles.
