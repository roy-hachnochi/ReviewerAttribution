In this data note the authors provide a new annotation of the motion picture Forrest Gump focusing specifically on moments of semantic conflict in the movie. This annotation is designed to further enrich prior annotations of the movie and the associated functional neuroimaging dataset of participants viewing Forrest Gump. The authors do a fine job of describing exactly how semantic conflict events were segmented and provide details on the inter-rater reliability of these annotations. Moreover, providing the source code for calculating descriptive statistics and general quality assurance is much appreciated. I have only minor recommendations: Perhaps it is beyond the scope of a data note, but it may help the reader if the authors could expatiate on the various annotation categories. Specifically, the introduction could be expanded to say a few words as to why semantic conflict is interesting, why these particular dimensions were the ones chosen and what exactly each means in lay terms. Second, the authors suggest in their introduction that there are insufficient semantic conflict events in Forrest Gump to be truly useful. Although I appreciate the candor, it's my opinion that we should first see what creative uses people can make of this annotation and the associated imaging dataset before we get too sullen!
