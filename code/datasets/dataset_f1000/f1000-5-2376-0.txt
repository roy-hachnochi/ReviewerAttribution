I thank the authors for having addressed the issues. I still find the legend on Figure 6 to be confusing as the lines for "B" and "D" still look alike. Maybe a wider window would help? Also I would prefer the sentence added to the Discussion referring to reference 21 be divided as follows: "Some studies have used radio frequency identification tags to differentiate drivers of the same car. One study has suggested methods to preserve privacy for research participants by anonymizing home location. (21)"
