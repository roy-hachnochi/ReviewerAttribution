The authors describe their adaptation of a commercial off the shelf (COTS) in-vehicle device that captures GPS date. These data are analyzed using GIS techniques. Data were collected from a total of five participants who were members of a longitudinal cohort study. The five participants were aged 65 years and older and were cognitively normal. They possessed a valid driver’s license and drove at least once a week. In addition, all participants had provided Alzheimer’s disease biomarker data (brain imaging or cerebral spinal fluid studies) in the past two years. The authors used COTS Azuga G2 Tracking Device for data collection. The data included longitude, latitude, and vehicle speed. Data were collected every thirty seconds from the time that the ignition was turned on. In addition, aggressive driving behaviors such as speeding, hard braking, and sudden acceleration were logged. A driving profile was developed for each participant. The profiles included spatial, temporal, and behavioral components. This pilot study demonstrates that the COTS device provides accurate data regarding daily driving behavior in older adults. The driving profiles for participants can be compared month-to-month or year-to-year and thus, provide the opportunity for observing changes in driving behavior. With the aging of the population, the pilot study provides data that can be applied to the development of further studies to provide additional characterization of driving profiles of older adults.
