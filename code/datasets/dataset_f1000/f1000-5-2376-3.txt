With the current lack of an accepted standardized approach to assessing changing driving risk associated with aging, and with emerging technology, naturalistic driving is an important area of research. The authors of this paper have a strong track record in publishing in the field of aging, cognition and driving. This paper provides the results of a pilot study of 5 participants using an off-the-shelf global positioning data acquisition system connected to the OBDII port of the older driver’s car. It describes how 5 months of data, collected by the company selling the device, was cleaned and processed to identify such features as spatial components (primary location, unique destinations and driving areas), and temporal components (time of day by season). They also used data obtained from the company on adverse driving behavior: speeding, hard breaking and hard acceleration. Using these features they were able to show differences between the drivers. It may be implied that changes in these parameters over time could be used in the future to help assess changing driving risk or help determine interventions to keep older adults driving longer, safely. Major issues: While this paper is well-written and describes in some detail the work this group has done, it is not clear what the new contribution of this work is. While the Background suggests that the objective was to “describe methodological challenges associated with adapting a COTS in-vehicle device that captures and synthesizes GPS data for processing and analysis using GIS techniques” the abstract does not refer to this. Importantly, the design of this sensor system and analysis of data were not compared to other systems recently described in the literature, for instance by Marshall et al. (CanDrive project), Eby et al. (2012), and the SHRP2 study by Skog Handel (2014). Specifically, work on destination identification has been published by Wallace et al. (2013). Our group has further addressed the issue of how to anonymize locations to protect individual driver identity (especially home address), a requirement of most research ethics committees (Wallace et al. 2015). Data cleaning has been discussed in papers by Porter and Wallace. The sensor information (breadcrumbs) logged every 30 seconds should be compared to other groups, for instance we sampled data every 1 to 5 seconds. The length of the pilot data is short compared to our published work using 1 year of driving data, from 7 years of available CanDrive data set. Finally, Wallace et al. (2014) have published work on driver identification that is not referenced Similarly, to be able to compare to other literature we need the definitions used for the alerts, e.g. how much over the speed limit was considered “speeding” (absolute or percent), and how this was determined (via GIS data?). Similarly we do not have definitions for hard accelerating and hard braking. Minor issues: Background Page 3: “recent studies are limited to capturing data… from weeks to 2 months.” CanDrive has collected driving data for 7 years from several hundred drivers – downloaded every 4 to 6 months. Methods Unique destinations paragraph: for clarity: suggest “two or more distinct breadcrumbs occurring within the same radius during the same time period would be combined….” I would move the sections describing the results of breadcrumbs (Fig 2) and the section how changing the buffer from 100 to 500 feet affects the grouping of breadcrumbs (Fig 3 and 4) into the Results section. Results: The Abstract refers to 5 participants as a subset of the study participants, but we don’t have a description of these drivers (age, gender, cognitive scores). The first paragraph states: “A single trip could have hundreds of breadcrumbs that are aggregated and over time can provide specific information about driving patterns and behaviors.” Why were we not given the mean and range of breadcrumbs for trips, or time and distance of trips? Figure 6 – legend: the lines for participants B and D look similar. Page 7: Figure 6 is referred to twice – the second time should read Figure 7 (percentages). References 1.

Not approved Fundamental flaws in the paper seriously undermine the findings and conclusions The authors describe their adaptation of a commercial off the shelf (COTS) in-vehicle device that captures GPS date. These data are analyzed using GIS techniques. Data were collected from a total of five participants who were members of a longitudinal cohort study. The five participants were aged 65 years and older and were cognitively normal. They possessed a valid driver’s license and drove at least once a week. In addition, all participants had provided Alzheimer’s disease biomarker data (brain imaging or cerebral spinal fluid studies) in the past two years. The authors used COTS Azuga G2 Tracking Device for data collection. The data included longitude, latitude, and vehicle speed. Data were collected every thirty seconds from the time that the ignition was turned on. In addition, aggressive driving behaviors such as speeding, hard braking, and sudden acceleration were logged. A driving profile was developed for each participant. The profiles included spatial, temporal, and behavioral components. This pilot study demonstrates that the COTS device provides accurate data regarding daily driving behavior in older adults. The driving profiles for participants can be compared month-to-month or year-to-year and thus, provide the opportunity for observing changes in driving behavior. With the aging of the population, the pilot study provides data that can be applied to the development of further studies to provide additional characterization of driving profiles of older adults.

Not approved Fundamental flaws in the paper seriously undermine the findings and conclusions The authors adapted an in-vehicle device to measure driving behavior in individuals with Alzheimer’s disease. Data from five participants were collected using the COTS Azuga G2 Tracking Device. Results from this study suggest that this technology was able to accurately identify locations and travel patterns of the participants. Given the increasing number of individuals diagnosed with Alzheimer disease and the important role that driving plays in a person’s life, this study has the potential to provide a measurement tool that can be used reliably to study driving involving seniors with Alzheimer disease. I have two recommendations for the authors to consider: For the introduction, can authors provide a little background information on the driving behavior of senior citizens with Alzheimer? It may be helpful to orient readers who are unfamiliar with this topic. As for results section, do you have data on under what situations, the alert behaviors happen the most frequently? If so, would it be possible to add it to the result section? Competing Interests No competing interests were disclosed. I confirm that I have read this submission and believe that I have an appropriate level of expertise to confirm that it is of an acceptable scientific standard. reply Respond to this report Responses (1) Author Response 07 Dec 2016 Ganesh Babulal, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, USA Dr. Qian: Thank you for your prompt review and comments on this manuscript. On your first point—since this is a methodological article, we limited the amount of information on driving performance and Alzheimer’ disease in the background section. However, we have added a sentence in the introduction with a recent reference (2016) of a systematic review that summarizes the evidence on driving in early stage AD. On your second point—we have the location (latitude and longitude), time and date of where/when the alert for adverse driving behaviors occurred. We are working to analyze these breadcrumbs, but given the high volume of data for each participant we do not have results available at this time that can be added into the result section of the current manuscript.
