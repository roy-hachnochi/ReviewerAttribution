The paper provides a detailed overview of single center data. I slightly miss 'time to recurrence' and basically the endeavour remains without the result that was aimed. Few other issues are that all information about self dilatiation misses. And also that it is unclear what the definition of 'traumatic stricture' has been, as separate from 'unknown'. Last but not least the single center results could be much better integrated in the body of evidence that exists for this topic.
