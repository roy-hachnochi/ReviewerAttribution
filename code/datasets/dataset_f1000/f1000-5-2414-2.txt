The authors of this paper describe a new function provided by the rBiopaxParser library, which is a R based system for parsing BioPax documents. BioPax is coded in RDF, which is a linked data format that describes the subject matter using graph triples in the form of a Subject, Predicate and Object. Their pathway2Graph and the old gathwayRegulatoryGraph essentially attempt to do graph transformations, taking the RDF graph and converting it to a graph that is suitable for analysis. The paper’s primary metric for demonstrating improvements in their method is measuring the number of non-zero pathways retrieved after extracting data from Reactome. In addition, I tested code and their supplied supplemental data. ``` library(rBiopaxParser) biopax=readBiopax("19c8ac7b-96b2-4db4-a78a-c2defed535ae.owl") a - pathway2RegulatoryGraph(biopax, "Pathway1020") b - pathway2Graph(biopax, "Pathway1020") nodes(a) [1] "CASP3" "CASP3(176-277)" [3] "DFFA(1-?)" "DFFB" [5] "DFFA(118-331)" "DFFA(1-117)" [7] "DFFA(225-331)" "DFFA(118-224)" [9] "Histone H1" "DFF40 homodimer/homooligomer" [11] "HMGB1/HMGB2" nodes(b) [1] "Protein8776" "Protein8777" "Complex4232" [4] "Complex4233" "Complex4234" "Complex4235" [7] "Complex4169" "Complex4238" "Complex4236" [10] "Complex4239" "Complex4240" "Protein8779" [13] "Protein8784" "Protein8785" "Protein8783" [16] "Complex4241" "PhysicalEntity567" "Complex2061" [19] "Complex4242" "Protein8786" "PhysicalEntity109" [22] "Complex4243" "Complex4244" ``` From the old version (a) to the new extraction (b), for this particular pathway the number of nodes went from 11 to 23. Interestingly, the names of the vertices became less descriptive in the newer method, going from gene names like ‘CASP3’ to strings extracted from the RDF urls, like ‘Protein8776’. It would seem that the authors claim, that the number of extracted elements from the BioPax files is accurate. But what is slightly confusing is the significance of this change. Was the original method faulty and this is a bug fix? Or is the method being updated to deal with the BioPax standard as it changes from version 1 to 2 to 3? This seems like a minor but necessary change to the library to make it have a better extract information from BioPax. More explanation about the nature of this change, and how the new parsing strategy improved how the library was able to deal with all of the various types of relationship classes in the BioPax format would make a big difference in helping to illustrate the improvements mentioned in this paper.
