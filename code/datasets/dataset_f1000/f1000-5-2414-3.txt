The authors have developed a new function that allows the user to build a regulatory network in a graph format based on pathway information. In the version that the authors developed, the output graph includes regulatory and non-regulatory interactions and allows the viewer to more fully comprehend the underlying network. Nodes in the network represent classes, while the edges show the relationships among these classes. An example of the approach is provided with the Reactome database. The authorsâ€™ approach, P2G, was used to analyze data for 1,666 pathways. P2G returned more nodes than was retrieved by the earlier version in 85% of the cases. The software will be available as part of the Bioconductor 3.4 release. This will likely be a valuable addition to the Bioconductor package that will provide scientists with a means for generating graphical and intuitive networks from gene expression and metabolic data. The manuscript is clear with an appropriate title and abstract. The article is clearly written and the conclusions are based on the data.
