The authors have developed a new function in the rBiopaxParser package to generate figures from BioPAX formatted biological pathway data. This new function, called pathway2Graph (P2G) replaces an older function called pathway2RegulatoryGraph (P2RG). P2G includes more interaction terms than P2RG, and therefore generates more complete interaction graphs. That said, as written the changes are mysterious - why did the original function limit the interaction types when generating graphs and what is advantageous about including more interactions? Addition of the P2G function is a small improvement to the rBiopaxParser package that will be useful, but the discussion of P2G's advantages and disadvantages should be expanded. Specific points: The language throughout is highly technical, potentially compromising its readability to end users. The edge labels in Figure 1 are very difficult to read. As these are discussed in the text, their font size and/or weight should be increased. It would increase the readability of this software tool article if the authors described a (biological) scenario where the P2G function would be uniquely useful compared to P2RG. It’s obvious that including more interaction types will lead to more complete graphs, but in what scenario would this be useful for a user? Why were all interaction types not originally included in P2RG? The advantages and any potential disadvantages of including all interaction types should be discussed more. Currently, the difference between P2G and P2RG is rather minor (1,666 vs 1,548) – might this difference change in the future if more edges are added through the interaction types that are unique to P2G? The work is technically sound and presents a useful extension to the rBiopaxParser package, but the paper describing this work will be useful to a broader audience if changes similar to those above are incorporated.
