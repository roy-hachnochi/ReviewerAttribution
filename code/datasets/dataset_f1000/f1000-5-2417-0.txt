 Title and Abstract : The abstract is well written. The title of the study perhaps would have been a little more expressive if it would have a word “Rural”. The study has been conducted in the rural areas and there are differences in perception among the rural and urban population in terms of knowledge, perception and practice. Article Content: It is a well-designed study. The study population groups have been selected appropriately, FGD groups were homogenous in nature which was crucial in order to get the best out of a FGD. The discussions were well directed. Analysis was done manually and no qualitative software has been used which is OK (and perhaps more meaningful). The study looked into the issue of maternal deaths from all possible perspectives. As a public health professional with program based hands on experience in maternal and child health, I have repeatedly come across the issues/ difficulties as mentioned in the article. I consider it a real good one. Conclusion : The conclusion was comprehensive and was able to summarize the study efficiently. Data: As it is a qualitative study, I was not expecting any set of data. The quotes from the respondents were enough for me.
