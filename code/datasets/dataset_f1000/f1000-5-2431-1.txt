 Mueller-Hinton media should have been used in antimicrobial tests instead of Luria Bertoni (LB). The optimum growth temperature of Xenorhabdus spp. is 28 o C. Why authors used 33 o C for bacterial fermentation? If autoclaved supernatant will be used, why centrifugation and filtration methods were used to remove the cells? Not only autoclaved but also non-autoclaved cell-free supernatants should have been tested against S. aureus bacteria as well. Tube-A in Figure-2 looks like there are several tubes in a beaker! This photo needs to be renewed.
