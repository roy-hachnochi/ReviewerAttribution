The manuscript would be improved by addressing the following suggestions: Is it known how Lunasin is penetrating the cell membrane or whether it is acting on an extracellular receptor? With in vivo studies using peptides, it is difficult to assess bioavailability due to lack of stability. The manuscript would benefit from discussing what is known about in vivo delivery. This may take into account why pre-treatment of cells was no more effective than s.c. delivery.
