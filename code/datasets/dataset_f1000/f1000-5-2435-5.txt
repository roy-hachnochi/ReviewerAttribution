This note reports, for the first time, the presence of a rare colour morph (purple) of the dogwhelk ( Nucella lapillis ) near Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada. This is an interesting observation which will be strengthened by two minor revisions to the presentation. First, it would be helpful in the Abstract and Methods to indicate that dogwhelks were (presumably) sampled during low tide when they were exposed to the air rather than in water. Secondly, temperature records are provided which would benefit from clarification. Judging from the range of temperatures, the temperature loggers were exposed to water during some of the tidal cycle and to air the rest of the time (i.e. they were placed in the intertidal). It would be helpful to know at what point in this temperature record the whelks were sampled. It might be that there are better measures of temperature to report than the daily average (and why do you report the sample size for temperatures recorded on one of your sample days (n=96) but not the other days? Should we assume the same n?). Also, the whelks were sampled on June 16, 2016 but the nearest temperature record is June 12, 2016. Yet the abstract talks about the temperature on the day of whelk sampling. Did I miss something? Finally, it would be useful to report whether you archived these unusual specimens, and perhaps some of the more usual colour morphs, in case a future researcher wants to look at them for possible morphological differences from the more common colour morphs. You note that there are physiological differences. With that said, I am delighted that there is a place that basic biological observations like these can still be reported. Well done F1000Research!
