I’m following the HarvestChoice webpage for a while now and used data provided a few years ago, so it’s good to see the publication of their spatial database. The title and abstract are appropriate for the content of the article. The basic methods for generating CELL5M are explained, however I would like to ask the authors to not only describe the sources of key layers, but all data sources they have used (maybe in the SI). This description should include at least the input data for each data set, the original resolution or spatial units, the base year(s) and a reference to a full documentation. This is important in my opinion because at the moment you reconcile data sets only spatially but they might diverge in their methods and assumptions which prevents particular applications. A simple example are the livestock densities you use from the Gridded Livestock of the World 2007 which are modelled based on (among other things) climate as in WorldClim and the climate variables you present in CELL5M that use CRU. What happens often as well when developing a global data set is that areas are masked out or typologies of certain areas are created with distinct thresholds and if this information is not available to a user he might falsely interpret a spatial overlay of two data sets. Figure 6 needs a legend, Guo Yu 2015 is a book chapter and not freely available. Your description of how to assign a grid cell ID is a bit over the top in my view and not worth mentioning or maybe shorten in to one sentence and add to the introduction. Geographic Information Systems are around for 40 years now and any GIS works with grid cell IDs, they might just not be in the order of your IDs.
