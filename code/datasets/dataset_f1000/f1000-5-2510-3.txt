This is a very comprehensive review of the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease (CD). The paper thoroughly covers all relevant aspects, including epidemiology, microbiology, immunology, and genetics. In that regard, it is both holistic and reductionist -- a very rare combination nowadays. It is beautifully written and presents a fair account of the current state of knowledge. Importantly, it is not biased: it does not resemble any of the too many reviews on CD that provide more beliefs and opinions than facts. This is in my view the very best review ever written on CD. This is clearly a must-read for anyone interested in this condition.
