I appreciate Dr Tirgan’s replies. I certainly endorse his overarching messages that injury to the skin is a major predisposing factor to keloid development, and surgery is certainly a form of injury to the skin. I also wholeheartedly endorse the need for a full discussion with affected patients about the full range of treatment options, both medical and surgical, and the risks and benefits of both. I continue to feel that while cryotherapy is indeed an option, and clearly a successful one in many cases, it is not viable for all and in some cases surgery can be the best choice with the aforementioned caveats. As for the lack of a billing code for cryotherapy as a possible reason for this not being offered to patients, I guess I can’t speak for all who practice in this realm but only myself: I don’t ever personally operate on keloids nor have any financial connection to those who do so my own motivation is not so conflicted. I can and do bill for cryotherapy, keloids, warts or other, when appropriate. All of that said, this is a very nice review of the topic and will no doubt be useful to providers (and patients) as they consider their options.
