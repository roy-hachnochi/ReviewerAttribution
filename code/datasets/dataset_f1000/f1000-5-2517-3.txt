This is a good accounting of keloids with many cases for discussion. The placement of new data in the discussion section is a bit off-putting for the reader. I would recommend placing all the charts in the Results section rather than having them in the Methods Section. Also, there needs to be more than just the grouping of keloids as presented. Basically, this is a list of keloids. There needs to be some correlation drawn or statistics to note associations rather than just descriptive stats. This is a great start, but just needs more to really give the reader information that is useful. I recommend not putting new data in the discussion and conclusion and moving this to the results. The analysis used on the cases should be included in the methods section. The discussion should focus on the natural history of all the things that are discussed in the results sections.
