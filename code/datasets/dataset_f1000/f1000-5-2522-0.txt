I'm mostly satisfied with the author's changes, with a few minor changes. Thank you for making an R package. I downloaded, and checked the package, with a few observations: In the package use utils::read.csv instead of just read.csv - you probably saw the warning if you've run R CMD CHECK or devtools::check() The package has no examples. I'd strongly suggest including examples. The package has no tests. I'd strongly suggest including tests (though if time is limited, at least include examples). The authors note that the package now gives warnings when input values are out of range - I'd strongly suggest to document what the correct ranges are for each parameter so users don't have to guess In addition, if there are sensible default values I'd use those - if applicable - may not be applicable. Urge authors to document what type of value is expected for each parameter, e.g., age (numeric), subregion (character) Sincerely, Scott Chamberlain
