My main concerns have been addressed in this new version of the manuscript. I think the developed package represents a useful addition to the field. I was able to install and run the package and indeed the package reports the absence of data points (NA). Only a minor concern: within R, getting the citation 'citation("whoishRisk")' returns the names of the name of the package, the names of the authors and the R version. I recommend they include a reference to this work.
