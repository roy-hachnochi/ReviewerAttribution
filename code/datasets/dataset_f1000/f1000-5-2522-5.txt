The paper describes a software tool for calculation of WHO/ISH cardiovascular risk scores for different epidemiological subregions of the world. This could be a useful piece of software for researchers working with cardiovascular epidemiological data and make the practices for calculating such scores more reproducible over multiple studies. However, in the present form I found the paper to be severely lacking in both implementation and substance. First, the code should not be distributed as an RTF file. R packages are well accepted standard for reproducibly distributing R code that also forces to provide some rudimentary documentation and examples. As an additional benefit, hosting the package in a repository like CRAN, Bioconductor or even Github, makes it easy to install and update the program. There is no reason to not follow this convention for this particular project, thus, the code should be converted into package format and hosted in one of the above-mentioned services to be any use to the community. The argument of the code in the present form being simply adjustable is not valid. One has to spend quite a bit of time understanding what is happening in the code, especially when not an R expert. For the code to fulfill its purpose it has to be rewritten in a way that adjustable parts are presented to the user as function parameters (with reasonable defaults). This way users have to know even less R to use the code effectively. Also, having a figure depicting the code is uncommon to say the least and not useful in any way. It would make much more sense to include a worked out example to the text, where you would describe a common use case of your R package. To enhance usefulness of the package and make it more universally applicable it would be good to see some more risk prediction models like Framingham and SCORE added to the software. This would make it easy to compare the validity of different scores over a study population.
