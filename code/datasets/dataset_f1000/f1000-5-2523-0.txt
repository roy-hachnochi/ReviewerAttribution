Infection by Zika virus (ZIKV) is an emerging global health crisis, and as of today there are no approved therapeutic interventions are available for patients. In a search for novel anti-ZIKV agents which could be moved quickly into clinical use, the authors have applied their well-established high-throughput, high-content assay platform to develop a ZIKV assay, and have applied this to evaluate a library of FDA-approved drugs. Building a high-quality high-content assay is a complex exercise, but this team is quite experienced, and has had particular success in the past with other tropical infectious agents. Starting from a library of 725 compounds, a series of staged triage steps leads to the identification of 5 validated hits. While the established mechanisms for the majority of these hits (anti-cancer, antibiotic) are recognized sources of anti-parasitic leads, two are quite unexpected. Because they have been sourced from a collection of approved drugs, all should be able to move rapidly into in vivo proof-of-concept studies. Additionally, they might serve as starting points for further optimization by drug discovery teams; the sharing of these lead structures is a particularly altruistic decision on the part of the team. The work reported here is very similar to that reported recently by another multi-national, multi-disciplinary consortium 1 , who screened a nearly-identical collection in a similar manner. Interestingly, there was very little overlap in the hit-sets identified by these two teams. The origin of this difference is unclear, though the two groups used ZIKV from different sources; this may suggest that anti-viral activity is strain-dependent, complicating the development of agents with broad-based activity. It would be very interesting to have each team cross-test the other's set of leads in their own assay format. References 1.
