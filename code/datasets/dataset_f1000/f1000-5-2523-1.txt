The authors describe a cell based assay suitable for screening compounds for activity against Zika virus. The assay is compatible with high content screening methodology and was used in this mode to screen a library of FDA-approved drugs. Palonosetron, 6-Azauridine, 5-Fluorouracil, Lovastatin and Kitasamycin were identified as low micromolar hits. The mechanism(s) for inhibition of the Zika virus infection was not identified.
