Tosadori et al. have developed Cytoscape app that was much needed in the Cytoscape app store for comparing networks with Random networks with degree or other centrality statistics preservation. The updated version of research article deals with all the concern raised by the fellow reviewers. The manuscript is well written and work flow is easy to understand. Minor concerns: I would suggest authors include a figure showing how centrality statistics are affected on randomizing networks with degree preservation (or any other centrality statistic preservation). I would suggest authors use an appropriate word in place of "the so-called" as it is giving an impression that word "small world" and "centralities" are inappropriate.
