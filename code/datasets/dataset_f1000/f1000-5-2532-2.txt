Govindaraj et al. report a typical SCID patient with a known mutation in Rag1 (p.E770K) with a previously known defective recombination activity and thus, there is very little novel information in this manuscript. In fact, the manuscript is already in itself published in F1000 (October 18th, 2016) and available on the web. The mutation should simply be added to existing databases. Additional comments: The figure should be improved â€“ providing the different domains. The pedigree (inheritance pattern is incomplete) - or simply state that the missing individuals were not sampled. Introduction should be more focussed on Rag 1. Immunization schedule (if any) for live vaccines could be of interest for the readers (but not necessary). In the methods section, uniformity should apply (cc, mm ul etc). The number of NK cells appear to be too high (higher than the total lymphocyte count). Gene names should be in italics and transcript IDs should be given. Abbreviations should be correctly used and introduced at the first time of presentation.
