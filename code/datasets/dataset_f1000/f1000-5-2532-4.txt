The manuscript “Whole exome sequencing identifies variation c.2308GA p.E770K in RAG1 associated with B- T- NK+ severe combined immunodeficiency” is the description of a case report, that is a child as a supposed case of SCID. Exactly, the authors found a homozygous variation c.2308GA by whole exome sequencing and they hypothesized that this variant is associated with the disease. All the sections of the manuscript are well presented and written (title, abstract, content and discussion). However, there are two points that I would like to comment: In the introduction the authors wrote that there are over a dozen genes known to be implicated in the disease. So, what about these genes in this case report? By performing a whole exome sequencing, did they also observed the variants of these genes? if yes or not, please comment! In order to explain the functional consequences of the mutated protein, the authors write “The variation causes an amino acid change p.E770K, which lies on RAG1 domain of the protein……Incidentally the mutation was previously reported and analysis suggested a significantly reduced recombination activity” referring to work of Asai E et al . Clin Immunol. 2011. In Asai’s work the nucleotide mutation is referred as 2420 GA with a E770K effect. The position of nucleotide between the two works is different, but the authors of the manuscript declare the same position for amino acid change and the same reduced recombination activity. Please, specify/insert the RS ID number of the homozygous variation.
