This article represents the first description of a real-world implementation of blockchain, smart contracts and decentralized/floating cloud storage for medical approval studies. It logically extends the application of blockchain beyond the pure ‘notarization’ functionality, as earlier described, into the realm of post-processing and data analyses. The source code is provided, so future groups can work on that. It can be hoped that this example will be picked up and used as a model in real-world studies. I ask the author to consider crypto-assured study blinding in future designs. Furthermore, it would be great to compare the practical possibilities of such a study system to today's system on a step-by-step analysis. The author mentions the potential of zero-knowledge proofs and homomorphic encryption. I’m looking forward to reading more from this author.
