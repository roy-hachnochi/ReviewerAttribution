This article proposes a smart-contract based system for improving the transparency of clinical trials. This represents an original extension to existing proposals which apply blockchain technology to prove the historical existence of certain documents and protocols. Specifically, a private blockchain network with an hierarchical arrangement of smart contracts gives the various stakeholders (e.g. regulators, clinical research organisations etc.) the ability to manage and record trial data in a natural - but also immutable and auditable - fashion. The paper itself is well-written and focused and adequately referenced. I have a few minor queries which could be clarified in any final version: "Untrusted parties" - are these actually "untrusting parties" or "untrusted and untrusting" parties? "ensuring tamper resistance" - should this be "ensuring a very high degree of tamper resistance" (since 51% attacks are still possible)? Being a private, permissioned blockchain, does it need any special arrangements to ensure its integrity, or does the fact that runs on top of the Ethereum network ensure this? "includes a container" - can you please elaborate on what you mean by "container" here? It is a very overloaded term in computer science, and can refer to data structures, a lightweight virtual environment for code execution, a file store etc. Overall I enjoyed reading the paper and I think it makes a worthy contribution to the literature. I am happy to recommend it be indexed.
