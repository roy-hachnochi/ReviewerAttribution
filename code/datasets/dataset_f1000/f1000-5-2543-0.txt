We are satisfied that the authors have adequately addressed our comments in this new version. Minor points [1] Some of the test examples provided in Supplement 2 did not work with Cytoscape 3.5.1 and dot-app 0.9.4 and could not be imported dot-app_testing/Import/ER/ER.gv : Sorry! File did not comply to dot language syntax dot-app_testing/Import/philo/philo.gv : Sorry! File did not comply to dot language syntax dot-app_testing/Import/unix/unix.gv : target node is not a member of this network All import examples distributed with the dot-app should work with dot-app (this should be part of the unittests). If the test examples do not work with the app there will be issues with real world examples. It is stated "We verified the dot-app import and export functions separately. All of the files we used in testing are found in ZIP 2 of the Supplementary Material." This seems not to be the case. Please fix the issue https://github.com/idekerlab/dot-app/issues/15 [2] The app cannot be build from the provided repository after a clone. This is reported at https://github.com/idekerlab/dot-app/issues/14 Please fix this issue. This is related to my initial review where I reported this issue.
