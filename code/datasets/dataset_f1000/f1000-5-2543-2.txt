The article introduces an app to import/export Graphviz (.gv-.dot) files to/from Cytoscape. Since the Graphviz format is of wide usage, the app is very useful to the community. The article is well-written and the user-guide is complete and easy to read. As minor comments I ask more details about which characteristics can be lost passing from a format to another. I tried some network choosing them randomly from internet, and sometimes I lost features that I didn't expect to lose. A table explaining which features are preserved and which not will be very useful in the paper. If there are problem of space maybe the implementation details can be described in supplementary materials and not in the main paper. The table should contains also short comments about the missing features that can be added in the future, and the problem that can be encountered implementing those characteristics that are not of immediate conversion. I think that with these updates the paper is suitable for indexing.
