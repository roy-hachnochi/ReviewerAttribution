The article "dot-app: a Graphviz-Cytoscape conversion plug-in" is well written and describes background, implementation and use of the application in a comprehensible way. ## major comments "The differences that arise between the Graphviz network and the Cytoscape network stem from how the two programs handle implicit default values. If a DOT attribute is omitted from the DOT file when using a Graphviz utility, an implicit default value for that attribute is used. The list of DOT attributes and their default values can be found on the Graphviz website (http://www.graphviz.org/content/attrs.html)." - The implicit dot default values should be used as default values in dot-app for the Cytoscape styles. Users of the dot language rely on the default values and expect rendering tools to use them. - Especially, in combination with dot-app writing the Cytoscape default values in the exported dot this results in unnecessary changes of the graph rendering in the round trip (dot - cytoscape - dot). This round trip should introduce minimal changes to the rendering. Dot default values should be used and the respective text passage and figure be updated. ## minor comments In the implementation all visual styles are hard coded in the visual mapping via bipasses. It would be better to create node attributes for the dot attributes and subsequently use them in visual styles. In this way users have access to the dot attributes, can use them in other visual mappings, create derived node attributes from them, or use them in analyses. It is unclear how dot height and width are transformed to Cytoscape node height and width. There is some scaling factor, but how this is actually handled should be described in the manuscript. What information is lost in the roundtrip due to scaling. For instance height = "0.486111",width = "1.041667" result in height 40 in Cytoscape. The dot node font color is not rendered correctly. See: https://github.com/idekerlab/dot-app/issues/7 Saving as *.gz always adds the .dot extension so that files are called *.gz.dot. If the user selects "name.gz" the file should be saved as 'name.gz', not as 'name.gz.dot'. p5 "For the import function of dot-app, we used Java-based Parser for Graphviz Documents (JPGD), a Graphviz document parser made by Alexander Merz(5)" - reference missing/wrong. There should be a reference for (5). p5 "After JPGD creates the model objects, dot-app creates a corresponding " - something wrong with first half-sentence, probably better: "After JPGD has created the model objects, ... p6 "All other DOT attributes are ignored during the import process and have no effect on the visualization in Cytoscape." If the ignored DOT attributes can be listed, state them in the manuscript as list. This is very helpful to see what information should not be used in dot files if one wants full Cytoscape support of the file. If the unsupported attributes are only the features listed in "Unsupported DOT features" than this should be clearly stated. p2 "The store contains nearly 300 apps that ..." At the state of review this is already = 300. Add a date to the statement: - The store contains nearly 300 apps (October 2016) that ... Add reference for graphviz software/url see for instance http://www.graphviz.org/content/citing-graphviz-paper The preferred citation is @ARTICLE{Gansner00anopen, author = {Emden R. Gansner and Stephen C. North}, title = {An open graph visualization system and its applications to software engineering}, journal = {SOFTWARE - PRACTICE AND EXPERIENCE}, year = {2000}, volume = {30}, number = {11}, pages = {1203--1233} } and the URL is www.graphviz.org p8 use cases Provide the *.gv files and Cytoscape files of the use cases in the supplement. This will provide the necessary materials to follow the provided examples. I tried to save the files from the pdf which did not work (due to line breaks in pdf), copying the examples from the HTML version of the manuscript worked. Adding the two example files to the supplementary information will improve this. p9 testing Provide the url/repository for the test files and test results. There should be a page which shows all the comparison images with the respective dot files. In the article it is mentioned that this exists, but no resource is given for the test files and test results. p9 conclusion "This article describes the dot-app Cytoscape app, which enables a user to import a DOT-formatted **here** into Cytoscape" - word missing p9 conclusion "we recognize that future versions of Cytoscape may introduce new visual effects" - formulation. Better: 'visual shapes and styles", visual effects are something else. p9 conclusion "we recognize that future versions of Cytoscape may introduce new visual effects (e.g., new arrow heads) that present opportunities for rendering DOT files more truly or for the loss of formatting information if the DOT format cannot represent them." - second half of sentence does not make sense (... or for the loss of formating). Please reformulate to clarify what is meant. The github release corresponding to the zenodo code is missing. The latest github release is 0.9.1 on 11.September, the zenodo was created in February. This makes it difficult to try to build the app from the mentioned source code, by checking out a corresponding tag. Which version is packed in zenodo? 0.9.2 ? Also the current app version in the app store is 0.9.3, but there is no 0.9.3 release on github. Please create a github release which is corresponding to the zenodo release and the mentioned code state of the publication. I was unable to build the app from latest source code. The app is working via the app store, but in addition it should be possible to build the latest source code. https://github.com/idekerlab/dot-app/issues/8 git clone https://github.com/idekerlab/dot-app.git mvn clean install results in [INFO] Compiling 16 source files to /home/mkoenig/git/dot-app/target/classes [INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------ [INFO] BUILD FAILURE [INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------ [INFO] Total time: 7.250 s [INFO] Finished at: 2016-10-31T12:48:57+01:00 [INFO] Final Memory: 21M/238M [INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------ [ERROR] Failed to execute goal org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-compiler-plugin:2.0.2:compile (default-compile) on project dot-app: Compilation failure: Compilation failure: [ERROR] /home/mkoenig/git/dot-app/src/main/java/org/cytoscape/intern/read/reader/NodeReader.java:[46,36] error: package com.alexmerz.graphviz.objects does not exist [ERROR] ...
