The title and abstract are very appropriate as they give the reader a quick overview of the subject matter discussed as related to Zika. This opinion piece provides a brief background of the International Congress of Entomology with an emphasis on a symposium exploring what is, and not, known about Zika. The article summarizes presentations given by a number of globally recognized researchers in the field of medical entomology and disease ecology. The article does an excellent job providing an overview of where society, and research, stands today with regards to Zika and its potential spread globally. However, as they discuss, additional research is needed to fully understand the ecology of the pathogen and vector capacity as related to disease manifestations and frequency of occurrence. I would like to stress the outbreak of Zika is a demonstration of the need to continue exploring the mechanisms regulating mosquito, and other arthropod vectors, attraction to, and blood-feeding on, hosts as the development of methods to disrupt such interactions could prove vital in protecting human populations and their associated livestock globally.
