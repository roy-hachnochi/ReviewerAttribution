In this opinion article, Dr. Walter S. Leal presents not only the discrepant results in the literature concerning the vector or vectors mosquitoes of Zika (ZIKV) â€“ (Aedes, Culex), but gives an up-to-date knowledge about the history of ZIKV infection and its consequence on the human health. Dr. Leal clearly describes all the steps since the ZIKV isolation from a febrile monkey of Uganda forest, the isolation of ZIKV from human in 1954 and presents the results (opinions) of different groups of research, concerning the responsible vector of ZIKV transmission as well as the different concerns to explain the discrepancies.The paper also brings information about ZIKV epidemics in the world, the sexual transmission, and a very helpful discussion on the genetically based vector control strategies. A disease considered as a mild infection in the beginning is now well established as causing microcephaly through congenital infection. This teratogenic effect led the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare ZIKV an international public health emergency. I read this submission and my opinion is that it is worth to be indexed considering its high standard.
