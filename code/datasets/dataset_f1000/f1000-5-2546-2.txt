I have read the MS "Zika mosquito vectors: the jury is still out" by Walter S. Leal Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, University of California-Davis, Davis, USA. This MS nicely describes the scientific and academic atmosphere and major findings of International Congress of Entomology (ICE 2016) held in Orlando, Florida (September 25-30, 2016). The MS goes far beyond the simple description of the common routine in Meetings such like this. In fact due to our major and now global concern on arboviroses the MS provides a precise account of the most relevant issues discussed on this meeting. Also, it poses an ultimate perspective that should be urgently followed regarding the discussion of the true vectors of Zika. Such relevant points must be immediately addressed concerning the final definition of the molecular and genetic strategies to be used for its control which were also discussed in the meeting and reported in the present MS. I believe the scientific content and the present format of this MS are suitable for indexing.
