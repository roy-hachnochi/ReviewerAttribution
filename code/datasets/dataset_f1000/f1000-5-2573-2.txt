This is a good comprehensive review and model of the scientific status of the religious and secular belief or believing process. Major point: It would be more helpful for the readers if there was emphasis on what is the key aspects of the current model that makes it new and different from previous models of the authors or other researchers. Minor point: While the two figures have very similar format, in the figure 1 there is a specific quantity of the time (i.e. 40ms) but not in the figure 2; the former looks a kind of experimental data and the latter a conceptual schema. It may be better to clarify whether two figures are similar or very different in terms of the roles in the manuscript (i.e. data or schema).
