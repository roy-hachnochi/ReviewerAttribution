The purpose of the current study was to investigate whether ADM2 activates ERK through PKCα, which is a major upstream activator of ERK in endothelial cells. The authors examined the effect of phosphorylation of ERK on ADM2 stimulation in endothelial cells isolated from PKCα null mice or wild type (wt) counterpart mice. The findings obtained in their experiments were clear. However, they studied by only a single method. They need to study, for example, by siRNA method to certify the independency on PKCα. Another concern is that the authors are expected to, at least, discuss the crucial signal pathway to activate ERK in this cell system. In this context, they need to study Ras-Raf-MAPK/ERK kinase (MEK).
