This case is very interesting because of the combination Cantrell’s pentalogy and transposition of great arteries is extremely rare. But there are several questions to the authors. I have a doubt of the presence of transposition of the great arteries on CT scans in the article. On the scans it seems that the pulmonary artery arises in front of the aorta (anterior). I think you need to provide another scan where it would clearly show the location of the great vessels. There are not data about LV volume before and after the surgery. Where was the VSD? Sizes? Surgery is preferable in patients with symptoms of heart failure or in those with complications caused by left ventricle diverticula, whereas resection in asymptomatic patients remains controversial. What was the indication to resection of the diverticulum? There is little information about surgery. You wrote that “Surgical treatment is usually recommended when left ventricular diverticulum is associated with other cardiac or abdominal abnormalities” but there is not any information about the surgery of TGA. Did you preform the correction of TGA and VSD simultaneously or not? What were the time of aortic cross clamp and CPB? Currently, there is no single generally accepted method for the resection of left ventricle diverticula or for left ventricle reconstruction. What did you do in this case?
