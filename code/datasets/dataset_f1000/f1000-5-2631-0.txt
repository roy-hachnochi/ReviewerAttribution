This paper is an important contribution to genomics. The choice of the cabbage white butterfly for this study is especially fitting, as chemical interactions between plants and herbivores have been recently studied on molecular level using this species and its relatives, with some very interesting insights into evolution of detoxification abilities in insects. The paper also addresses several additional questions from phylogenetics of Lepidoptera to the origins of the invasive exotic pest in North America. The authors provide creative solution for distinguishing between modern inbreeding and historical population bottleneck and interesting observations concerning recreation of evolutionary history using full-genome information. The potentially applied aspects of the paper - presence in the model organism of protein with anti-cancer properties and mapping of this protein â€“ make this study a valuable foundation for future medical research. I am also attaching the pdf of the article with minor suggestions concerning grammar/wording.
