Chemical space networks (CSN) technique is an efficient way to visualize and analyze the content of chemical databases. Typically, CSNs are built using the Fruchterman-Reingold algorithm in which the distances between objects are determined for layout purposes. In this paper, for CNS construction the authors suggest to use the Kamada-Kawai algorithm providing with a graph in which the edges lengths correspond to similarity measures. Thus, CSNs obtained with the above algorithms provide with two complementary views of a chemical space. I believe that reported results are of the great interest for chemoinformatics community. The title is appropriate for the content of the article; the abstract represents a suitable summary of the work. I recommend indexing this paper as is.
