XLA is a rare disease which gave this case report high value for being indexed. However I have some concerns regarding the report as below: Since the patient was suspected with XLA and BTK gene is well known as the cause of the condition. Why Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) was conducted for this case? Why not conduct targeted sequencing for BTK since that would be much cheaper and easier to analyse. Since WES was conducted, I think authors should provide other results from WES analysis such as variant analysis, etc. The results in Figure 1D for heterogeneous needs further explanation. It seems like the heterogeneous is not having two peaks at the asterisks position, but having two peaks at 5 positions downstream to the asterisks. I would like to suggest evidence to be provided for the truncated BTK gene due to the mutation (Reverse transcriptase-PCR). I would like to suggest the authors to referred to other database with bigger number of samples such as Exome Aggregation Consortium and 1000 Genomes database (not only BTKbase).
