In this paper the authors investigate a new annotation method in the YeATS suite (YeATS Annotation Module - YeATSAM), which was used to annotate the newly-sequenced walnut genome using a simple workstation. In YeATSAM the assembled transcriptome is splitting into multiple ORFs. They show that YeATSAM failed to annotate ~700 genes identified by MAKER-P, while identifying ~4000 genes missed by MAKER-P. While most of these genes have repetitive stretches, both methods missed important genes identified by the other. Since many of the additional genes identified by MAKER-P have no known transcripts, the authors suggest that these were identified using ab initio methods. In the absence of such an ab initio module in YeATSAM, they propose a combined method using both MAKER-P and YeATSAM to annotate the WGS. This work is very interesting because the results probe the adequacy of this new annotation method. In general, the presentation is clear and the conclusions are adjusted to the results obtained. The figures and tables are also clear. Some comments are listed below: In the abstract, please change the order in “Results and Conclusions” part, from lines 17 to 21. Consider to mention first “YeATSAM used a […] chickpea transcriptome assembled using Newbler v2.3” and then that “1000 genes were identified, which were not previously annotated by Gnomon annotation tool”. Fourth and fifth paragraphs of Introduction could be changed to the discussion and in the introduction leave some short sentences about this. En fifth line of Methods section correct “seqeunces”. Please consider to explain further section “future work”.
