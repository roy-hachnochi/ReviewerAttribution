The revised version does not include any of the suggested additional experiments. While I understand that my suggestion of performing a deeper analysis of the inflammatory response could go beyond the scope and format of this research note, I still consider that my first comment, focused to clarifying the mIL6R is a reasonable ask. The format of this communication would allow the publication of preliminary findings, but I think it is for the author's interest to provide a clear message with their findings, rather than a source of further questions.
