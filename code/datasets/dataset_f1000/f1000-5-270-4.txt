This is an interesting preliminary study on the effect of IL6 on an immortalized human cerebral microvascular cell line. The authors show convincingly that addition of IL6, in the absence of exogenous sIL6R, induces production of MCP-1, a chemotactic protein. This induction is a subset of possible responses shown previously in response to IL1- and TNF-alpha by the same group. The result also contrasts with an earlier report on the response of HUVEC cells in which the authors showed that the response required sIL6R (the cell culture conditions were quite different than the present study). The report would be stronger if the authors had showed either the presence of mIL6R on the cell surface or demonstrated the absence of sIL6R in the system.
