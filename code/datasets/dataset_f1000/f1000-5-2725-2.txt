The research note of Tolulope et al. reports EAG responses of the parasitic wasp Microplitis croceipes and relates the antennal responses to the relative abundance of the compounds in the odour bouquet of the larvae. When looking at the relative abundance of a compound you might need to consider all environmentally occurring contexts and compounds. Microplitis is orientating to the host habitat first, then it locates the host plant in the habitat, and then the host. That means that plant odours play an important role (see Li et al. 1 ) and not only larval odours. In my opinion you have to rank the importance of odours according to all environmental contexts and consider the abundance of compounds in cotton or also in other relevant host (and habitat) plants. Heliothis feeds on more than 100 plant species, thus M. croceipes is confronted with the odour of this plants and with the odour of larvae having fed on these plants. Li et al. 1 have performed antennal studies with M. croceipes and cotton plant compounds and found similar responses to similar compounds as in your study. Heptanal was the most stimulating tested compound while caryophyllene was less stimulating. The the discrepancy you indicate in the title might be easily explained when including habitat and host plant volatiles. The wasps in your study had the experience of living and hatching from larvae having fed on cotton. Thus they might have experience with the compounds you present in Table 1. It has been shown that M. croceipes can learn almost any compund (e.g. Olson et al. 2 ). In your discussion you point out that it might be the ecological relevance of a compound that determines the antennal response – however, Park et al. 3 showed in electroantennogram studies that the antenna of M. croceipes is also responding to anthropogenic compounds with high sensitivity. Thus, the antennal response might not reflect the ecological relevance. This might be more reflected in the behavioural response, as you indicate in your discussion. And this might be fine-tuned by leaning in case of a parasitoid with a polyphagous host. Minor points: Methods: Why is 1 g an optimal dose? Data analyses: Differences …were analysed References 1.
