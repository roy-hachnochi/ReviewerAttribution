The manuscript reported the the relationship between the relative abundance of volatile chemical emitted from Heliothis virescens larvae and the antennal response by the larval parasitoid of the herbivore, Microplitis croceipes . By electroantennogram bioassays, the authors found that the level of parasitoid’s EAG response is not related to relative abundance of the volatile components in the blend. Since a chemical that elicits an EAG response in an insect does not mean to elicit a behavioral response, and a chemical eliciting a bigger EAG response does not mean to elicit a stronger behavioral response, these experiments seem little and the novelty and significance of this study seem limited. Introduction: In a previous study, the authors have investigated the attractiveness of these individual volatile compounds to the parasitoid, thus it would be better to introduce these results briefly in the section of Introduction. Methods: It has been well documented that an insect has different responsive ranges to different chemicals. Thus, only using one concentration of chemicals is not enough. Discussion: Based on the previous results reported by the authors 1 , 8 chemicals in the blend, including decanal and ( E )-β-Caryophyllene, had a role in attraction of the parasitoid. The authors should give a discussion based on above results. References 1.
