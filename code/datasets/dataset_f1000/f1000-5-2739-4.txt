General comments: This is an interesting study with novel findings showing that myocardial ischemia triggers the release of circulating MMP-2, which inhibits SDF-1α and CXCR4 release, and that ischemic preconditioning (IP) inhibits MMP-2 release, thereby increasing both SDF-1α and CXCR4 levels, resulting in a higher level of CD34+ cell mobilization 3 days post ischemic injury in in vivo condition in large animals. In addition to the limitations mentioned by the authors, we have the following comments that the authors may need to consider to improve the manuscript. Specific comments: Is there any particular consideration why female but not male pigs were chosen as the study subjects? This needs to be clarified. Similarly, the reason why n=6 in the IP group but n=12 in the non-conditioned AMI group is not clear. IP has been shown to reduce post-ischemic IL-8 release in most, if not all, models of myocardial ischemia and reperfusion or in some clinical trial studies. While in your model, IP almost significantly increased, and could actually significantly (see below), post-ischemic IL-8. This should be discussed in comparison of other studies in more detail. One may expect that IP may also could have significantly increased post-ischemic CXCR4, if the authors have 1) observed more time points; or 2) the sample size of the two groups were 9 per group rather than 6 vs. 12; or 3) the area under curve (AUC) data are compared. This applies to the above IL-8 story. Have the authors considered to perform repeated measures ANOVA with post hoc comparison to assess time effects or time-treatment interaction? The conclusion that IP enforces CD34+ cell mobilization via inhibition of MMP-2 does not seem to have well supported by data, in particular you did not have intervention of MMP-2 in the presence or absence of IP in the in vivo model, and you did not measure cardiac MMP-2 proteins. Therefore, it needs to be toned down.
