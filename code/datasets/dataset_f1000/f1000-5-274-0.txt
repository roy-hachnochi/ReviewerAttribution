The article "Chromas from chromatin: sonification of the epigenome" proposes a new and original method to sonify (i.e. convert into music) data information coming from the analysis of the epigenome. The paper is extremely well written and it should be indexed on the basis of being the first to try this kind of review. The results of Cittaro et al. 's work, although without an immediate applicability in the field of biomedicine, is by itself a small scientifical breakthrough. My only concerns regard the applicability of the sonification method as a truly alternative way to detect biological properties. The authors imply that similar biological features (e.g. belonging to a particular pathway, differential expression) could be discerned by listening to gene-centered audio tracks. I listened to such tracks and I concur, but to be scientifically complete, the authors may think (even as a follow up paper) to test this on a wider subject set. I would propose a psychological study with a blind panel of human subjects, who are then asked, after listening to some biological properties on a "training set", to find genes with similar properties on a "test set".
