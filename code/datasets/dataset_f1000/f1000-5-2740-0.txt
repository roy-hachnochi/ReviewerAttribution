The manuscript “Differentially correlated genes in co-expression networks control phenotype transitions” investigates the differentially co-expressed genes in two biological processes, a homogeneous one-causal-factor process (B cell deficiency) and a heterogeneous multi-causal system (cervical cancer). The authors have adopted the Pearson correlation and partial correlation for the inference of networks. Major revision: The networks were inferred from local partial correlation method, which is able to identify a linear relationship between two variables X and Y (genes), and this relationship may or may not be mediate by another gene Z. It is not clear why the authors have adopted the Pearson correlation for B cell deficiency analysis and the partial correlation for cervical cancer analysis. Moreover, it would be interesting to highlight the gain obtained by adopting the partial correlation. For instance, what were the relationships inferred with the partial correlation that would not be inferred using Pearson correlation? Another important issue is that even with partial correlation, only pairwise of relationships are identified. In the study presented at http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/JSTSP.2008.923841, it presents the Intrinsically Multivariate Predictive (IMP) Genes, which are genes that depend on a subset of predictors. How did the authors deal with these IMP genes? It is not clear how and why the microarray data was filtered. The authors could better describe how the data was filtered and how the parameters were adopted. The title “Differentially correlated genes in co-expression networks control phenotype transitions” is too rigid leading to the understanding that all correlated genes control the phenotype transitions. I believe that is not true. Authors could provide a more appropriate title. Minor revisions: Page 3: “homogenous” → homogeneous Page 4: "correlation lost" → correlation loss; References 1.
