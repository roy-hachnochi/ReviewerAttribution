In the present work Thomas et al. employed method to find differentially co-expressed genes in co-expression networks of a B lymphocyte deficiency (largely mono-causal) and a complex cervical cancer (multi-causal) dataset. They used different graph-theoretical approaches to find relevant genes in this context. Interestingly, the authors found that 72% (39/54) of the correlation gains involve at least one Ig gene, which is in agreement with the previously shown association between intestinal gene expression and B cells ability to produce antibodies. Is it possible that this "correlation gains" are merely a consequence of the general enrichment of Ig genes in the DC list? In the cervical cancer analysis, the authors used shortest-path and betweenness centrality to argue for the regulatory relevance of DC genes. I think it would be great to supplement this finding with more biochemical information. For example, how many of these genes are transcription factors or protein kinases? Overall, I think this study is technically sound and properly executed. == Minor corrections In the abstract, "mus musculus" should read "Mus musculus". In Figure 2, Ig is underlined as if marked by a spellchecker.
