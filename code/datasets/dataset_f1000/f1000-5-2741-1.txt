We believe that overall the software tool article by Ahdesmki et al. seems sound and provides a solution to a problem that appears to be inadequately addressed in the field currently. Nonetheless, we believe the manuscript would benefit from some minor amendments in order to increase its utility and accessibility to readers. In brief: Intro/Background Needs expanded slightly to better set the scene and describe the general approach of read disambiguation. Methodology The methodology should be expanded slightly and made more explicit. Tables 12: Combine 1 2 into a single table and label the samples by data type, i.e DNA and RNA Show %s as well as numbers Clearly label the species in the tables Clearly label correctly mapped/incorrectly mapped reads in table Clearly label human and mouse genomes as such Tables should clearly show all numbers pre- and post- disambiguation, rather than having superscripted references in the table legend Essentially, a novice should be able to read the paper and extract relevant info more easily. Figure 1 Should be more granular, informative and descriptive of the process. Include read alignment etc. Describe the Disambiguate process Use same font size for all text in the Figure Comparison with a competitor product This is something that is clearly missing. If it is literally impossible to compare to a competitor because the software is not accessible, this should be stated clearly as a reason for the lack of comparison in the paper. Tumor samples It would be interesting to know how performance is affected by use of highly mutated tumor xenografts. This is arguably beyond the scope of the paper, but warrants at least some mention.
