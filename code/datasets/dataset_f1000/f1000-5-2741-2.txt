This paper describes a computational tool for separating sequencing reads from a sample that contains DNA or RNA from two species. This is a necessary pre-processing step for genomic or transcriptomic analysis of patient-derived xenograft cancer models. The approach is based on alignments of sequence reads to the reference genome sequences for the two species in question. The authors have tested their approach on DNA-seq data from publicly available human and mouse exome datasets concatenated to simulate a xenograft sample. The results presented in Table 1 show very good separation of reads from the two species datasets with only a small percentage of reads being assigned to the wrong species (0.06% and 0.01%) and a higher but still very low percentage of reads flagged as ambiguous, i.e. align equally well to both genomes. Similar results were presented for RNA-seq data, although here the percentages of incorrectly assigned and ambiguous reads are unsurprisingly higher than for DNA-seq. Use of the alignment scores, and in the event of a tie the edit distance, is a reasonable approach to disambiguate reads and is the method used for BWA and STAR alignments. For TopHat2 and HISAT2 a different scoring function is required, although the reasons for this are not given. Further, the choice of function (sum of edit distance, number of reported alignments and number of gap opens) is not completely obvious and raises the question of whether the authors have attempted to tune the function, e.g. by adjusting the weighting of each component.
