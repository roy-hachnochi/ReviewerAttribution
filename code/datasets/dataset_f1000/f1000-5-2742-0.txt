 The title of the paper is appropriate for the contents of the article, as myopia is an error of refraction which is still a “hot topic “ and worth discussion. The abstract of the paper is short and should include some more data in the Methods, results and Conclusions. Measurement of central and peripheral refraction by using the open field auto-refractometer needs short learning curve ,easy, non invasive fast method for measuring refraction; these points should raise the sample size and age in the study. The results are covered with good statistical analysis of data, reaching the conclusion of having the Multistage CL to be better than preclear CL.
