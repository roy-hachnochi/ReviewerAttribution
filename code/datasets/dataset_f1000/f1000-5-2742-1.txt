Myopia is the most common type of refractive errors and it has become more prevalent recently. It has been reported that normal myopic eyes showing more hypermetropic (less myopic) values toward the peripheral retina. In this paper, the authors attempt to find the effect of different new designs of progressive soft contact lenses in controlling peripheral refraction. Studying two different designs of lenses, the authors found that multistage PCLs had more effects on reducing the peripheral retinal hypermetropic defocus compared to Proclear PCLs which more likely could be due to the difference in designs between the two contact lenses. Power of the study: The power of this study could be due to: Originality Proper statistics and analysis Technical comments: Authors must highlight some additional findings in the result part of the abstract Authors should write Lens specifications instead of lens design and materials in table (1) Figure (4) should come earlier in the text body.
