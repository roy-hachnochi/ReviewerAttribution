This manuscript, as the title implies, presents a guide and best practices for Bioconductor tool integration into the Galaxy web environment. Some Bioconductor tools have been integrated into Galaxy, but there are still a number of tools that are not supported and need to be installed by a Galaxy administrator in a multi-step process. The two biggest challenges for any type of tool integration are introduced: installation of all tool dependencies and correctly generating tool component files. The authors provide a table of best practices to help address these challenges, but more importantly the authors introduce Planemo, a wonderful command-line utility suite, which greatly aids in the creation and publishing of Galaxy tools. The Methods section does an excellent job at providing a guide for integrating Bioconductor tools, and the Use cases section, together with sample commands and provided supplementary files, shows the reader the benefits and ease of use of the Planemo suite. We have tested the provided sample files and code, and it behaves as described in our hands. The manuscript is very well written and will serve as a great reference for seasoned developers wishing to integrate R/Bioconductor tools into Galaxy, and the clearly written explanations as well as use cases will help ease newcomers into working with Galaxy. All examples provided are with R/Bioconductor, but this content could easily be used as a manual integrating other tools or command line scripts outside of Bioconductor. This is a great development for Galaxy documentation, and we are happy to recommend the article for approval.
