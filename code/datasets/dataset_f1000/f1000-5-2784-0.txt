Persistence of Earwax during otoscopy still represents a challenge especially for paediatricians and general practitioners during diagnosis. Finding appropriate and efficacious solutions that can make removal easier is surely very important. The article by Knebl et al tries to evaluate the efficacy of their new ceruminolytic solution. However their experimental setting may be misleading in respect to the real value of their product. First their in vitro setting is flawed due to the chosen temperature (they partially acknowledge this during the discussion) and the shaking and position of the earwax in the test-tube (earwax is compacted inside the earcanal and only one side of it is exposed to drops or solutions) this makes the conclusions about timing completely misleading. Secondly they chose two solutions with the same component (Carbamide peroxide 6.5%) for comparison; furthermore a component that has already been shown to not be efficacious (Roland PS, Eaton DA, Gross RD, et al. : Randomized, placebo-controlled evaluation of Cerumenex and Murine earwax removal products. Arch Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg. 2004; 130 (10): 1175â€“1177). This is very problematic as to their statement of superiority (albeit this component is used in daily practice). Last but not least they insert a citation into the discussion regarding the clearing of middle ear effusion in grommets (Uppal et al ), suggesting the addition of glycolic acid to NaHCO 3 as superior for that purpose. This use is also very misleading as glycolic acid should surely not come into contact with the middle ear mucosa. This study shows promise regarding their solution, however it is flawed and therefore misleading. Surely a better setting will be able to demonstrate the superiority of their solution for earwax removal.
