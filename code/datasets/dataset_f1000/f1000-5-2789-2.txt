Phylogeny reconstruction is a classical research topic in bioinformatics. In this context the standard trade-off between speed and accuracy becomes a choice between slow but accurate sequence alignment on the one hand and fast but less accurate alignment-free methods on the other. Bernard et al. aim for speed and use an established alignment-free measure, D_2, to reconstruct the phylogeny of 143 Bacteria and Archaea from full genome sequences. D_2 is based on the number of shared k -mers, and the main contribution of the paper is the visualization of the D_2 distance matrix of the 143 taxa as a network rather than the traditional bifurcating tree. This visualization is dynamic in the sense that the user can choose a similarity threshold between 0 and 10, and watch as the taxa disintegrate from initially two clusters to essentially every taxon on its own. This is an innovative way of presenting large-scale evolutionary relationships, and the tool is fun to use. As the authors remark, it is unclear how the D_2 metric scales with more familiar measures of evolutionary time such as substitutions per site. It would thus be interesting to explored this in future work; for example by supplying a version of the visualization tool that allows users to upload their own sequences. I was also wondering how the networks generated by Bernard et al. compare to established methods of network-based evolutionary analysis such as SplitsTree and minimum spanning trees. I realize that these are both usually based on alignments, but it is always possible to analyze a given alignment using D_2, thereby allowing a direct assessment of the accuracy lost (if any) for the speed gained.
