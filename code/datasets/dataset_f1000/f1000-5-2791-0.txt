The authors worked out the compilation of germline mutations in the CHEK2 gene in patients diagnosed with different cancer types and in different populations focusing on Latin American population. CHEK2 mutations have been linked with Li—Fraumeni syndrome, also germline mutations are thought to confer a predisposition to sarcomas, breast cancer and brain tumors. The most frequent CHEK2 mutation c.1100 delC is the low penetrance mutation and it has low impact in breast or other cancers risk. The rest of the mutations or SNPs are much less connected with the known cancer risk. Therefore, it is difficult to evaluate the increase of the different cancers risk for the carriers of germline mutations in CHEK2 gene. It is particularly difficult to do so if there are only one or two carriers of these mutations in the population under study. I totally agree with both reviewers especially with two issues: The text is written in that way that the reader can think the authors analyze somatic mutations in CHEK2 gene in different cancer types whereas they made the search for germline mutations. In Table 4 they indicate that the blood was the tissue which was used to analyze mutations so the text should be rewritten in that way there would be no doubt that germline mutations were under study. The Tables 1 and 2 also should be changed. The description of the ethnic minorities is strange. In Table 2 the data from databaseExAC do not contain the information about the disease connected with the mutation so it does not make sense to include these data if the title of the manuscript is “Mutations of the CHEK2 gene in the patients with cancer…” these data should be excluded from the analysis because they do not bring any important information about CHEK2 mutations in different cancer sites.
