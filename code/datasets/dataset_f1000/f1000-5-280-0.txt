This opinion piece is an extremely timely, topical and well-written article which highlights a range of important points regarding the two communities of practice (research-focused and teaching focused) which exist within universities and across the HE sector. There clearly needs to be a re-balance between the tensions of teaching and research and the author proposes approaches to help meet and unite the needs of both communities of practice through for example, an enhanced role for learned societies. To strengthen the article a paragraph recognising the role of the UK Professional Standards Framework (UKPSF) and the Higher Education Academy (HEA) Fellowship recognition scheme in raising the profile of teaching to all academics would be a valuable addition. HEA Fellowship status is a quality assurance indicator in UK universities regarding standards in teaching and supporting students’ learning and is often implemented as a KPI target in many institutions. Research experience is often relevant to an individual’s HEA Fellowship application if it relates to their university learning and teaching. Is this a further opportunity to extend the ‘brokering model’ proposed by the author? There is also potential to unite both communities of practice at HEA Writing Retreats and HEA recognition events, these CPD opportunities help support both communities to network and communicate their expertise. The article is acceptable for approval with a few minor corrections, it should be the Society for Experimental Biology (lower case t) – Introduction section, line 3 and the same applies to the Higher Education Academy (Introduction section, line 2).
