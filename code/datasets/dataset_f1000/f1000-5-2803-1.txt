 I would suggest the authors change the topic and revise the conclusion (in text and abstract) of the manuscript. Due to the differences of contact lens power profiles made by different contact lenses manufacturers, the peripheral refractions would be influenced when the subjects wear SVCLs made by different manufacturers. This study only use one particular brand of contact lenses, hence, cannot conclude that all the SVCLs would have the same impact on the peripheral refraction. First line of the second paragraph in the introduction: Although contact lens focus on correcting the central vision, the peripheral image, in most of the conditions, will still be improved, just not so accurate (or adequate) as that of central vision. Please revise the sentence. Last sentence in the introduction: Currently, there are more published studies that evaluate the SVCL wearing on the retinal profile in myopic children now. Please revise the last sentence and add references. For the statistical analysis: When comparing different eccentricities, it involved multiple comparison problem. It is prefer to use multiple comparison corrections.
