General comments The article introduces a density-weighted Cox model (DWCox). The model was created by Team Cornfield in the 2015 Prostate Cancer DREAM Challenge for outlier-robust prediction of survival. The article is well written and the introduced method is novel. The only major comment about the article is that the comparison of the new method and the existing methods could be more complete. The authors test the DWCox method with the 2015 Prostate Cancer DREAM Challenge data and simulated data. They compare DWCox method with the Cox model and Halabi’s model introduced in reference 4. I suggest that the authors also consider as a fourth alternative method the Smaletz method 1 due to the fact that it was also used in Halabi et al. article. To make the study complete these 4 methods should be compared and the results reported for the simulated data and the 2015 Prostate Cancer DREAM Challenge. It would be interesting to see complete results in the spirit of Table 5 and Figure 7. Table 1 shows the 22 featured ranked by DWCox. It would be interesting to know how DWCox behaves when the features with missing values (namely race, testo, ldh or alb) were omitted. Based on the Table 1 these features have small weight and they might have little effect on the prediction results. Additionally, it would be interesting to see how the method behaves on other data sets. However, this general study might be out of the scope of this article. Furthermore, it would be more descriptive to explain how the missing values are handled in DWCox approach in page 5. Detailed comments: - page 1, line 6 of abstract: The result will not be worse in interpretation, but the model’s interpretability will decrease. Hence the last word “result” should be substituted by “model” - page 3, line 18: It should be specified that the reason Cox is not appropriate for testing time dependency is due to the nature of semi-parametric models that are have no assumption on the shape of the hazard function. 2 - page 3, line 30: It would be nice to have a citation to clarify the statement thatDWCox was performing “better than or comparable to the best ensemble approaches” - page 10, line 3: the comparison represented in Figure 8 was done using t-test. Maybe Wilcoxon test would have been more appropriate. References 1.
