The authors present an interesting extension of the well-known Cox proportional hazards model if data contain outliers. They demonstrate the advantage over the traditional Cox model on synthetic data and applied their proposed model to a real world problem in the context of the 2015 Prostate Cancer DREAM challenge. Major issues Unfortunately, the author only provides little insight in the motivation for choosing a kernel density estimator to determine the sample weights. In particular, traditional kernel density estimation is only applicable to continuous random variables, whereas feature vectors comprised of clinical variables can contain continuous as well as categorical variables. It is unclear how density estimation was performed when feature vectors are a mix of continuous and categorical variables. Moreover, I strongly suggest to explicitly mention the assumption of the proposed density-weighted Cox model. The authors state that their proposed model is suitable when data “contain some sparsely distributed outliers.” A more systematic approach to thoroughly formulate this assumption would be highly appreciated. Minor issues Page 2, paragraph 2: Reference 3, please cite the original paper Cox 1972. Page 4, paragraph 3: I would suggest to change reference 5 to the original work on multiple imputation by Rubin: D. B. Rubin, Multiple imputation for nonresponse in surveys, John Wiley Sons Inc., 1987. 1 Page 5, paragraph 2: How were the candidate values for the L2 penalty chosen? Page 5, paragraph 3: It is not clear what the coefficients \hat{b} represent. It seems they are not associated with any features, only \hat{k} is. Is the error e assumed to be normally distributed? If yes, such a choice might be problematic, because survival times usually follow a skewed distribution. Representing the log survival time as a linear model, as in the case of the accelerated failure time model, is usually preferred. Page 5, paragraph 5: Please cite the original work on iAUC: H. Hung and C. T. Chiang, “Estimation methods for time-dependent AUC models with survival data,” Canadian Journal of Statistics, vol. 38, no. 1, pp. 8–26, 2010. 2 H. Uno, T. Cai, L. Tian, and L. J. Wei, “Evaluating prediction rules for t-year survivors with censored regression models,” Journal of the American Statistical Association, vol. 102, pp. 527–537, 2007 3 It should be mentioned that the RMSE used in the challenge was only with respect to uncensored survival times in the test set. Page 5, extended applications: I would suggest to remove this short section, because it is already clear from the description in the text, that the author’s propose a general model that can be applied to any survival data. Page 7, paragraph 2: Please cite the recently published paper summarising the Prostate Cancer DREAM challenge Page 7, Results on the PCDC data: The author’s stated earlier that the Halabi model is based on a Cox model and that a Cox model is not able to directly predict time to death. However, the authors mention that the Halabi model achieved an RMSE of 196.6704. How was this value obtained, if the model is not applicable for this task? It would be helpful of the authors could add the exact Bayes factor of the proposed model. Page 9, Results on simulate data To better understand the benefit of the proposed density-weighted Cox model, it might be interesting to plot the the i-th weight against the i-th residual in the unweighted Cox model. I would assume that samples with high residuals are assigned a low weight, leading to an overall better prediction. Grammar The text contains several grammatical errors and convoluted formulations, which damps the overall presentation. I strongly suggest to improve the grammar and wording. I’m only highlighting some obvious errors below.
