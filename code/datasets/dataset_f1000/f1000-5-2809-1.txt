This work addresses the concern of clustering analysis. There are mainly two issues in performing clustering: how to locate the clusters in the best possible way, and, how to determine the number of clusters. In most cases the determination of the number of clusters is rather intuitive. Recently some researchers also highlighted this point for hierarchical clustering and other clustering methods. There is a growing need to establish an automated system of estimating the number of clusters accurately for various applications. I hope this work will give due consideration in this field of research. Two strategies were considered to find the number of clusters: jump size and maximum difference. It would be better if more theoretical aspect can be given to select parameter Î± , as different values of this parameter can lead to different solution. The same can be argued to maximum difference method which is given as maximum difference plus a constant, again changing this constant can vary the final results. It would be helpful to survey more methods published in this field of research.
