The authors proposed two simple methods for estimating the number of clusters. However, the results failed to support the motivation. The authors criticized that the current methods are subject to subjective bias. The new methods also rely on human judgement. Computational cost is not a problem nowadays and mathematically the new methods do not show obvious advantages in accelerate the calculation. This is not a valuable work for the community and not appropriate to be indexed.
