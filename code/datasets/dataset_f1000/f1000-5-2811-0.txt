The authors motivate the problem well by summarizing the drawbacks of 2D cell culture in vitro studies to predict in vivo responses in humans. 3D human cell cultures offers several advantages; here, the authors highlight how, in this era of personalized medicine, 3D platforms can be tailor-made to offer a more realistic approximation of in vivo studies when examining drug release kinetics. Specifically, a 3D printed model of a mucopolysaccharidosis type I patient's corpus callosum is developed from an MRI trace. The report is presented clearly and the authors demonstrate how to rapidly develop the aforementioned 3D model and prepare it for drug delivery studies. However, the paper lacks any studies that demonstrably show the advantage of the 3D model. Future work that experimentally establish the effectiveness of 3D models synthesized using the reported method would be useful.
