Indeed our society and health care system is moving toward more personalized medicine and care. Currently this is expensive and there is a great need for high throughput screening, lower costs, and 3D human cell culture to verify new drug discovery. The authors sum this up well in the title and introduction and the brief follows this idea throughout and provides an example with the rare genetic disorder of mucopolysaccharidosis. The paper flows nicely, but it was the methods section that had a lack of details and data and leaves one with more questions than revelations. The data is available in two linked files; however, one would first need the correct software to open them. Thus, I recommend more images/video to convey what the scientists accomplished and show the readers the potential results and outcomes. The discussion sums up some important ideas that need to be considered when developing a methodology such as this one. These methods will need to be independently verified and show promising potential prior to a new mass platform. In conclusion, this paper puts forth the ideas of a low cost approach to 3D printing scaffolds for drug release profiles, hopefully leading to faster turnarounds and lower costs of personalized medicine, drug discovery, tissue engineering, and stem cell biology.
