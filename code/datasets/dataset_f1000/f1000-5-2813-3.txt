In this article Chubb et al. 1 describe a software tool (CanVar) that the authors have developed to make publically available germline variant frequency information from sequenced exomes of cancer patients. Most importantly, they have used the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAc) framework, a tool the scientific community is currently very familiar to, in order to facilitate its access and use. The incalculable value of the open accessibility to the germline variation data obtained from 60,000 exomes provided by the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAc) seem to finally begin to reach disease-specific cohorts, as it is the case of CanVar. Hopefully this will soon become a reality not only for cancer but also for other common diseases. This information, together with the variation frequencies observed in the general population, is key when trying to evaluate the pathogenic relevance of disease-predisposing genes and/or variants, not only for novel candidate genes but also for well-known susceptibility genes. So far, the data available through CanVar correspond to the 1,006 exomes of early onset familial colorectal cancer cases recently studied by the same group 2 . Being this a very insightful cohort in the field of colorectal cancer predisposition, much needs yet to be done to make CanVar a relevant routine tool for the scientific community, and it is the responsibility of all of us to make this possible. The tool is already available, so I encourage all researchers with germline exome sequencing data in cancer patients to submit their data to CanVar, as larger representation of tumor types, populations and patients in general is required. I also would like to encourage researchers to use these extremely useful data in their cancer predisposition studies and to increase the visibility of CanVar among their colleagues and peers. Despite the so far limited availability of germline exome sequencing data from cancer patients, a huge amount of data has been gathered in the last years from genome-wide association studies and exome SNP arrays. This information would be of value if added to CanVar, at least the variants included in exome arrays and rare exonic variants included in genotyping arrays. Another issue that needs to be contemplated is the implementation of filters for ethnicities/studies, anticipating the inclusion of data from other groups. Alternatively, as occurs in ExAC, data could be itemized by ethnicity/geographic origin and study. References 1.

Not approved Fundamental flaws in the paper seriously undermine the findings and conclusions Summary Impression The authors describe an online resource for exploring germline cancer variants. The resource currently contains data from 1,006 samples representing a single cancer type, a single ethnicity, and a single centre. The authors have invited collaborators to help expand this to other cancer types which will add further value to what is already an excellent tool over time. We share the authors’ enthusiasm for intuitive data sharing, and agree that presenting variant frequencies from disease cases, as well as reference samples, is hugely valuable. Overall, the manuscript is very clear, and we anticipate that the intuitive web resource will be well received. We have a couple of high level comments, and some minor suggestions for the authors to consider. Comments The authors describe 2 uses for this data: variant-level analyses (i.e. interpreting individual variants, primarily in established disease genes), and gene-level analyses (assessing candidate disease predisposition genes). The resource in its current form is primarily suitable for the first. The case data and control data are unlikely to be technically matched sufficiently for case/control association testing at the gene level (burden tests), and the authors wisely do not provide this sort of comparative data on the gene page. So, while variant frequency data is important in interpreting genes, in our opinion the present resource is primarily valuable for variant interpretation. A critical strength of the ExAC project was the joint and unified analysis of aggregated data. The authors describe adopting the “ExAC framework”, but at present this represents only data from only a single source. As well as adopting the ExAC web architecture, it would be interesting to hear the authors' plans for data analysis going forwards - will CanVar seek to harmonise variant calling and analysis on data from disparate sources as it grows? Suggestions for consideration Readers are likely to know ClinVar as the go-to resource for germ-line variants in inherited diseases. It may be worth highlighting the complementary value of ClinVar CanVar - i.e. the addition of consistent frequency data. I would provide a little more detail on the case series in the section on “CanVar datasets" (introduction). In particular, are cases are all unrelated probands? I would add here that cases are all European (given in methods). Drs Huber Kim note that variants were limited to “germline variants that were identified as risk-associated” - I did not appreciate this from the manuscript, and think this is important to note if the dataset does not include all variants in protein-coding regions. Gene view Are variants annotated with ExAC frequencies even if they do not ‘PASS’ filters in ExAC? May be helpful to display the ExAC filter status as well as CanVar filter status. Would be helpful to indicate whether variants absent in ExAC were well covered - i.e. give some summary measure of ExAC coverage for all variant sites, since capture platforms and coverage profiles may be very different We understand that ExAC_AF on this page is non-TCGA ExAC frequency. Is this ethnicity matched too, since samples are all european)? Variant view It would be invaluable to incorporate ExAC frequencies into the frequency table (Fig 3e) - especially since the non-TCGA data is not accessible via click through to the web browser (only by download). Users may be misled by a link to the full ExAC dataset (with TCGA included). As data is added would be desirable to stratify by cancer type AND ethnicity The call rate is reported with 12 decimal places of precision Methods "Curation of colorectal cancer exome data within CanVar" May be helpful to indicate which of the technical parameters differ from ExAC where relevant. It would be interesting to hear about any challenges encountered in reconciling the data sets that may be relevant to others attempting something similar - Were there any problems with multi-allelic sites? e.g. GATK filters by site, rather than variant. Are multi-nucleotide polymorphisms phased and jointly interpreted? Any other technical challenges? Data availability Is the sites-only vcf available for download? This may be useful in addition to raw data available via application to EGA. Could add source code link to final sentence of the discussion.

Not approved Fundamental flaws in the paper seriously undermine the findings and conclusions Short synopsis. The authors describe an online resource for exploring disease-associated germline variants. The Cancer Variation Resource (CanVar) browser is inspired by the ExAC browser at the Broad Institute. Currently CanVar is limited to those germline variants that were identified as risk-associated in a study of 1,006 familial early-onset colorectal cancer (CRC) patients published by the authors in Nature Communications in 2016. Overall impression. CanVar is a useful tool for mining variants implicated in CRC, and the authors do a good job at explaining how to use the resource. The authors also provide some background information on the underlying data, methodology and technologies. We have only a few minor suggestions as to how its presentation could be improved. Suggestions . In the Introduction, the sentence “CanVar has been produced by adapting the ExAC framework” is a bit vague. You could be clearer what is meant by framework: software? APIs? some or all of the concepts, and which? datasets? Abstract and introduction can be confusing (at least to the rushed reader, of which there are many) as to whether CanVar also contains or interfaces to the ExAC 60,000 exome data on top of the CRC data. This is clarified in the “CanVar datasets” subsection, but in our view this should be clarified earlier. For instance, abstract and introduction talk more, and earlier, about ExAC than about the data that are actually contained in CanVar; in the “CanVar website” section, links to the ExAC browser and to the CanVar website are provided side by side, which might lead to further confusion. Since both websites are almost look-alikes, readers might even be led to expect that both sites might also mirror each other. Perhaps, it would be better to provide the links in a more asymmetric manner. In “CanVar datasets” it is mentioned that each variant is annotated “with ExAC allele frequency data excluding samples from the TCGA”. Perhaps, a short explanation of why this has been done could be provided, as not all readers may be familiar with the source of non-TCGA samples in the ExAC dataset. It should be time to remove the “Beta” state from the resource. Bring it to a good enough state to warrant release, and then be not afraid to update it later with new releases.

Not approved Fundamental flaws in the paper seriously undermine the findings and conclusions The study of Chubb et al. presents an online database and software tool Cancer Variation Resource (CanVar), developed on the basis of Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAc) framework (sequenced exomes of cancer patients). The main aim of the database is to enable an open access to germline variant frequency. CanVar focuses on colorectal cancer, as it summarizes exome sequencing data from more than 1000 familial early-onset patients with this disease. Strikingly, the CanVar database catalogues almost 1.1 million variants and more than 100000 insertions/deletions. An additional advantage for the user are the data on associated annotations of variants and insertions/deletions. The information, which may be acquired from on the basis of the published database, may provide valuable information on gene variants and indels in populations assuming disease-specific context. The data that could be mined with the help of the present database may also find utilization in clinics, particularly in the context with mutational screening in cancer, which becomes to be routine. A sentence in Introduction (When undertaken by multiple agencies…) would benefit from re-phrasing into a more reader-friendly form. Competing Interests No competing interests were disclosed.
