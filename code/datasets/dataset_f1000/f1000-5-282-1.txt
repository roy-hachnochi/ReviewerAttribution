Survey among doctoral students and staff members (1 university) on their own and general public's perception of animal experiments with 6.38% response rate. The presented questionnaire was general without requiring too much detail from respondents, which I found sufficient. The results are similar to previous research (as cited by the authors), the used methodology sound, and the conclusions, notably the need for a more systematic review among institutions in Europe on this topic, well balanced.
