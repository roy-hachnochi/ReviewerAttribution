The title is appropriate for the content of the work; and the abstract captures a very good summary of the respective sections of the work. To me it is well written. The content is excellently presented with a very good and balanced literature review. All the articles cited are not only current, but very relevant to the scope of the work. The gaps in knowledge in this area were well highlighted and a good attempt made to bridge the gap. The conclusions are in line with the results obtained, and have profound recommendations which will improve on antifungal antimicrobial chemotherapy in sub-Saharan Africa. However, I have some minor questions, which I think would improve on the presentation if addressed. In the methods section under inclusion criteria: I was wondering why only studies conducted between 1998 and 2016 were used? Authors should state reasons to justify the stated period. Except for journal instructions, I am of the opinion that merging Results and Discussion as a single section to read: Results/Discussion will be better since so much discussion has been taken under the results section.
