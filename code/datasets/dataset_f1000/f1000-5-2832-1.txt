This is a very good and much needed review. The subject in question, Candida antifungal drug resistance in sub-Saharan Africa, is most pertinent and up to date. I would, however, suggest that, similarly to what authors do in the Introduction, they would mention in Discussion, how is the situation of Candida antifungal drug resistance in sub-Saharan Africa different from that in the rest of the world, in a general outlook and as a result from this literature review.
