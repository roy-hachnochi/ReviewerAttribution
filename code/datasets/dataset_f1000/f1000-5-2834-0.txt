The authors need to be congratulated for this randomised controlled trial comparing pain during flexible cystoscope with or without rectal diclofenac. The methodology is sound and the paper is conclusively written. The discussion is covering the relevant literature and the conclusion is supported by the data. A step up in the methodology would've been a double-blind, placebo controlled trial which would further validate the results but this limitation is mentioned by the authors. Overall I'm recommending indexing of the article in its current form and do not really see leeway for improvement.
