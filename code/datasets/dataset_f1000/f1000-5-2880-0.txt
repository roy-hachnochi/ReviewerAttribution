The study by Sokolov et al. investigates changes in chromatin marks among saline and freshwater populations of sticklebacks. While I like the idea of the study and I do appreciate that this manuscript is intended as a short note, the current state of this manuscript is not suitable for indexing at the moment. The authors need to rewrite most of the manuscript as major revision is necessary. I've given some suggestions below. Introduction The introduction needs to be expanded so that the authors give some background on the system as well, there is plenty of previous research on the stickleback system that has been done and more of it needs to be cited here. Please also explain the ideas behind the divergence islands, give some information about these chromatin marks etc. Methods More information needs to be given about the chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments and the bioinformatic analysis. Currently the methods do not stand on their own. For example, at the moment the manuscript only states that MACS software was used for peak calling with no information how the method works or what parameters were used. Results I was wondering would it be helpful if the some of the results were shown as figures. Perhaps at least those peaks where differences were found. Discussion Currently the results are not really discussed at all. The authors should properly discuss their results. The authors found changes in certain genes, but the biological functions of those genes are barely mentioned or whether these are candidates for explaining adaptation to marine and freshwater environments.
