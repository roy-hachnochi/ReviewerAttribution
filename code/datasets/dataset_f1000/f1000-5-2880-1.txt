In my opinion, the results on differential distribution of histone modifications in sea and freshwater three-spined sticklebacks may potentially be interesting. Despite this, I strongly believe that text of the manuscript is currently beyond the minimal standards required for paper indexing. Specifically: the abstract does not describe main findings of the paper in sufficient detail; the introduction does not provide an adequate background information for the study but, instead, mainly repeats the abstract; any Discussion comparing the results with already available literature is missing; some crucial details of the methodologies used (e.g. which antibodies have been used for CHIP) are missing from Methods; some sentences in the text are difficult to understand. I recommend the authors to rewrite the text of manuscript addressing these points.
