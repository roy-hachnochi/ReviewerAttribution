Unfortunately I must concur with the major concerns highlighted by other reviewers. The data set is essentially a reassessment (meta-analysis) of previously published data. The phylogeny is functionally rooted against an in-group taxon without explanation. The analyses could have been improved by combining amino acid and nucleotide data (rather than solely treating these data separately). Due reference to similar articles from which these data have been derived was omitted. Other key references are missing. There is confusion within the article over the utility of some multi-copy genes and so interpretation and veracity of results is compromised. In combination and considering the lack of sufficient novelty of data, approach or interpretation the publication falls short of achieving its goal. The phylogeny is revisited and with some investment of time from the authors, but little additional clarity and few insights are forthcoming to merit acceptance in its current state.
