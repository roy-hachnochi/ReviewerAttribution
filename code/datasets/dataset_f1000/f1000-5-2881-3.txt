This article performs a meta-analysis of molecular phylogenetics within the Ctenophores using published sequences. I have previously had amiable correspondence with the authors and sent them data. Although the protein-coding sequences and some of the ribosomal RNA data came from my lab, I nonetheless feel I can give an unbiased assessment of their subsequent use. Regrettably, I do not see enough original intellectual contribution or additional scientific value to justify its publication. At best, it is a minor contribution, in which case the interpretation needs to be improved, and at worst, a good portion of it is a re-publishing of work already published by other authors (Simion [1] and Podar [4] in particular). A large part of the analysis is building trees using previously published ribosomal RNA datasets. This recapitulation does not add anything to the discussion of ctenophore internal relationships, and in fact, by rooting the tree with Beroe, they obscure the true evolution of the group as shown repeatedly since at least 2001 [4]. They also fail to cite Simion, et al. [1], which is the source of some of the data. Merely adding that citation would not solve the fundamental issue, which is that there is no added value to their re-building of the same phylogeny. The "novel" aspect of the paper is building trees based on two protein-coding genes which were also published previously in two separate papers [2,3]. The trees based on their [our] protein datasets do not give any additional insights into ctenophore relationships except in that some species are present in those trees that are not represented in the 18S phylogeny. This taxonomic coverage does not reveal any particular insight. These data also already appeared in trees (albeit not limited to ctenophores only) in the original publication. There is some confusion because there is no Hormiphora IPNS gene in their [our] dataset, yet it is listed in the table of genes and that species is present in the tree, apparently based on a GFP-like gene that was found. Furthermore, the IPNS genes are not single-copy[2], so are not reliable for phylogeny building. There is a misspelling of Bathyctena in Table 1 and 2 and of Lampocteis in Table 2. In summary, two gene trees, of which one gene which was found to be absent in a ctenophore lineage, does not seem to be sufficient basis for a paper. The title itself is a vast overstatement of the content of this study. References 1.
