 Introduction 1st paragraph: - "deep metazoans" is an odd term; also "Parazoa" is no longer accepted as a valid name. All 4 taxa are clearly metazoans; they are best summarized as "non-bilaterian metazoans". - The citation after the 1st sentence is from 1999; this should be replaced with something more recent as a lot of research in this area has been done since then. - While the statement of the 1st sentence is true, reconstructing the phylogenetic relationships within Ctenophora does not help much to solve these issues, i.e. finding the position of Ctenophora in the animal tree of life is a separate issue that this study is unable to address. - The "previous work" cited in the 2nd sentence is very old. There is a study from 2015 (Simion et al. , Zoology 118: 102-114) that also reconstructed internal relationships of Ctenophora based on multigene analyses. It is crucial that the authors interpret their results in light of that study. It is actually quite puzzling that the paper is not cited, especially because the authors used sequences originally reported in Simion et al. (2015). - The statement in the following sentence is highly debatable. As long as the phylogenetic position of ctenophores is not resolved (see e.g. Dohrmann Wrheide 2013 Integr. Comp. Biol. 53: 503-511; Pisani et al. 2015 PNAS 112: 15402-15407), it is totally unclear how relevant they are to answering these questions. - In the next sentence, "previous studies" should be replaced with "ctenophores". - The following 2 sentences suggest that this paper represents the first multilocus analysis addressing internal phylogeny of Ctenophora. As mentioned above, this is not true. In this study, the authors used 2 protein-coding genes and the 28S gene in addition to the 18S and ITS/5.8S markers already used by Simion et al. (2015). This is what sets their study apart from the previous paper, and this has to be clearly communicated. The paper should focus on discussing differences to the results of Simion et al. in light of expanding the set of markers (but also addressing the different taxon sampling in the 2 studies). - The abbreviation "MLSA" is introduced for "multilocus analysis" – what does the "S" stand for? Maybe it should read "multilocus sequence analysis"? 2nd paragraph: - "ribosomal genes" should read "ribosomal RNA genes" (also elsewhere in the MS), since there are also genes coding for ribosomal proteins. - "ortholog" should be replaced with "protein-coding" (also elsewhere in the MS), since ribosomal RNA genes are also orthologs. 3rd paragraph: - I think the taxonomic overlap between the protein-coding and the ribosomal RNA datasets is sufficient to conduct a combined analysis, to infer a tree based on all the evidence simultaneously. As far as I recall, using mixed nucleotide and amino-acid data is possible with RAxML and MrBayes; alternatively, the protein-coding partition could be analyzed on nucleotide level (possibly excluding 3rd codon positions if they are oversaturated). Methods - It is unclear how ambiguously alignable regions were treated. These have to be excluded prior to analysis, but a quick glance at the concatenated matrices provided in the data supplement (concat_matrix and concat_prot_corrected) suggests otherwise. Difficult-to-align regions can bias phylogenetic inference, so this is an important point to address. - Information about the lengths of loci and concatenated alignments should be given. - Information about how the trees were rooted should be given in this section. In the Results section it is mentioned that Beroida was used as the outgroup to all other ctenophores. However, this is poorly justified. For example, Simion et al. (2015) found this group deeply nested within ctenophores. In general, I suggest following closely the methodological protocol of Simion et al. to make the 2 studies truly comparable. 3rd paragraph: - Replace "is" with "are" - The accession numbers are buried in some text files in the data supplement, which is quite inconvenient for the reader. I suggest providing them directly in Tables 1 and 2. 7th paragraph: - Information about the substitution models used has to be provided here. I highly recommend using partitioning by gene and incorporating secondary structure information, for full comparability with Simion et al. (secondary structure models are available both in RAxML and MrBayes). Results, Discussion - These sections have to be rewritten after reanalysis of the data and comparison with Simion et al. (2015).

It's important to outline that the main objective of this research note was to revisit the phylogenetic reconstruction (mostly methods) for this group, using available sequences in the GenBank. It is a meta-analysis, as the reviewers said previously. We are not reporting nothing new but our methods for this specific set of sequences. Research note is defined as: "Research Notes include single-finding papers that can be reported with one or two illustrations (figures/tables), descriptions of unexpected observations, and lab protocols. Posters from conferences or internal meetings may be summarized as Research Notes. In many cases, some additional detail, particularly in the methods, description of the results, and/or discussion/conclusions will be required to make sure that readers (and referees) have enough information to understand the description of the work". The phylogenetic reconstruction is basically a bioinformatic lab recipe, so here we report the results of our "lab protocol". For the second version we took the comments of the reviewers (including yours) and we tried to accomplish all of them. One of your comments was about IPNS1, a duplicated gene in Table 1 (I must comment that in the supplementary data there was not a Hormiphora IPNS gene): "There is some confusion because there is no Hormiphora IPNS gene in their [our] dataset, yet it is listed in the table of genes and that species is present in the tree, apparently based on a GFP-like gene that was found. Furthermore, the IPNS genes are not single-copy[2], so are not reliable for phylogeny building." We so, reevaluated the accuracy of the phylogenetic reconstruction of the protein tree of the first version and we decided to remove it. It was not a random exercise. In fact, we also removed 28s information for the same reasons, we decided that it wasn't suitable for the phylogenetic reconstruction through single locus phylogenetic reconstruction. And I must assure that the inclusion of the HLH domain containing protein and Tyrosine aminotransferase wasn't either a random exercise. We executed many single locus for the great variety of the reported sequences from Ctenophora in the GenBank, for example, we determined that the other domain-containing proteins were not suitable for the phylogenetic reconstruction, as the photoprotein reported also in Francis 2015 [2]. But when we tested Tyrosine aminotransferase and HLH domaing containing protein, we observed that it didn't present incongruences with ribosomal data and NFP. One of my biggest concerns was about how this could bias the phylogenetic reconstruction because they have low species coverage. So my team and I, we reviewed about how missing data would bias the phylogenetic. We found a paper, Wiens, 2006 [1]. One of the paper's conclusion was: "Recent simulations show that there is little evidence to support excluding taxa based simply on the amount or proportion of missing data that they bear. The placement of highly incomplete taxa in a phylogeny can be resolved with perfect accuracy (based on simulations) and with strong support statistical support (based on empirical analyses)". So we "gleaned" the sequences from the GenBank and included in the final analysis, because, through this we improved the analysis. In the supplementary data for this version 2 there are no accession numbers, they are presented in Table 1 of the research note. The objective of the supplementary data is that anyone can reproduce our results. Nowhere in the paper is not mentioned that we are reporting a sequence, as previously said, this is a meta-analysis, a bioinformatic lab exercise. Best, Luis Alfonso. Bibliography [1] Wiens, J. J.

Not approved Fundamental flaws in the paper seriously undermine the findings and conclusions Unfortunately I must concur with the major concerns highlighted by other reviewers. The data set is essentially a reassessment (meta-analysis) of previously published data. The phylogeny is functionally rooted against an in-group taxon without explanation. The analyses could have been improved by combining amino acid and nucleotide data (rather than solely treating these data separately). Due reference to similar articles from which these data have been derived was omitted. Other key references are missing. There is confusion within the article over the utility of some multi-copy genes and so interpretation and veracity of results is compromised. In combination and considering the lack of sufficient novelty of data, approach or interpretation the publication falls short of achieving its goal. The phylogeny is revisited and with some investment of time from the authors, but little additional clarity and few insights are forthcoming to merit acceptance in its current state.

Not approved Fundamental flaws in the paper seriously undermine the findings and conclusions This study is a metaanalysis of available ctenophore sequence data. My thoughts largely echo those of the previous two reviewers. The methods seem reasonable (with the exception of the methodological problems with analysis of the Homiphora IPNS gene raised by Steve Haddock) but rooting with Beroida as the outgroup is inappropriate as no molecular studies have supported this in the past, key references are absent, and the English of the manuscript needs significant improvement. Available ctenophore transcriptome data could be used to expand sampling of the protein-coding genes. If that were done, a concatenated analysis of all of the markers used with only taxa sampled for 18S (so all taxa overlap for at least part of the alignment) with the addition of appropriate outgroups would be an interesting improvement. Competing Interests I am also actively studying the evolution of Ctenophora but I can honestly say that this does not impact my view on the present work.

Not approved Fundamental flaws in the paper seriously undermine the findings and conclusions This article performs a meta-analysis of molecular phylogenetics within the Ctenophores using published sequences. I have previously had amiable correspondence with the authors and sent them data. Although the protein-coding sequences and some of the ribosomal RNA data came from my lab, I nonetheless feel I can give an unbiased assessment of their subsequent use. Regrettably, I do not see enough original intellectual contribution or additional scientific value to justify its publication. At best, it is a minor contribution, in which case the interpretation needs to be improved, and at worst, a good portion of it is a re-publishing of work already published by other authors (Simion [1] and Podar [4] in particular). A large part of the analysis is building trees using previously published ribosomal RNA datasets. This recapitulation does not add anything to the discussion of ctenophore internal relationships, and in fact, by rooting the tree with Beroe, they obscure the true evolution of the group as shown repeatedly since at least 2001 [4]. They also fail to cite Simion, et al. [1], which is the source of some of the data. Merely adding that citation would not solve the fundamental issue, which is that there is no added value to their re-building of the same phylogeny. The "novel" aspect of the paper is building trees based on two protein-coding genes which were also published previously in two separate papers [2,3]. The trees based on their [our] protein datasets do not give any additional insights into ctenophore relationships except in that some species are present in those trees that are not represented in the 18S phylogeny. This taxonomic coverage does not reveal any particular insight. These data also already appeared in trees (albeit not limited to ctenophores only) in the original publication. There is some confusion because there is no Hormiphora IPNS gene in their [our] dataset, yet it is listed in the table of genes and that species is present in the tree, apparently based on a GFP-like gene that was found. Furthermore, the IPNS genes are not single-copy[2], so are not reliable for phylogeny building. There is a misspelling of Bathyctena in Table 1 and 2 and of Lampocteis in Table 2. In summary, two gene trees, of which one gene which was found to be absent in a ctenophore lineage, does not seem to be sufficient basis for a paper. The title itself is a vast overstatement of the content of this study. References 1.

Not approved Fundamental flaws in the paper seriously undermine the findings and conclusions Introduction 1st paragraph: - "deep metazoans" is an odd term; also "Parazoa" is no longer accepted as a valid name. All 4 taxa are clearly metazoans; they are best summarized as "non-bilaterian metazoans". - The citation after the 1st sentence is from 1999; this should be replaced with something more recent as a lot of research in this area has been done since then. - While the statement of the 1st sentence is true, reconstructing the phylogenetic relationships within Ctenophora does not help much to solve these issues, i.e. finding the position of Ctenophora in the animal tree of life is a separate issue that this study is unable to address. - The "previous work" cited in the 2nd sentence is very old. There is a study from 2015 (Simion et al. , Zoology 118: 102-114) that also reconstructed internal relationships of Ctenophora based on multigene analyses. It is crucial that the authors interpret their results in light of that study. It is actually quite puzzling that the paper is not cited, especially because the authors used sequences originally reported in Simion et al. (2015). - The statement in the following sentence is highly debatable. As long as the phylogenetic position of ctenophores is not resolved (see e.g. Dohrmann Wrheide 2013 Integr. Comp. Biol. 53: 503-511; Pisani et al. 2015 PNAS 112: 15402-15407), it is totally unclear how relevant they are to answering these questions. - In the next sentence, "previous studies" should be replaced with "ctenophores". - The following 2 sentences suggest that this paper represents the first multilocus analysis addressing internal phylogeny of Ctenophora. As mentioned above, this is not true. In this study, the authors used 2 protein-coding genes and the 28S gene in addition to the 18S and ITS/5.8S markers already used by Simion et al. (2015). This is what sets their study apart from the previous paper, and this has to be clearly communicated. The paper should focus on discussing differences to the results of Simion et al. in light of expanding the set of markers (but also addressing the different taxon sampling in the 2 studies). - The abbreviation "MLSA" is introduced for "multilocus analysis" – what does the "S" stand for? Maybe it should read "multilocus sequence analysis"? 2nd paragraph: - "ribosomal genes" should read "ribosomal RNA genes" (also elsewhere in the MS), since there are also genes coding for ribosomal proteins. - "ortholog" should be replaced with "protein-coding" (also elsewhere in the MS), since ribosomal RNA genes are also orthologs. 3rd paragraph: - I think the taxonomic overlap between the protein-coding and the ribosomal RNA datasets is sufficient to conduct a combined analysis, to infer a tree based on all the evidence simultaneously. As far as I recall, using mixed nucleotide and amino-acid data is possible with RAxML and MrBayes; alternatively, the protein-coding partition could be analyzed on nucleotide level (possibly excluding 3rd codon positions if they are oversaturated). Methods - It is unclear how ambiguously alignable regions were treated. These have to be excluded prior to analysis, but a quick glance at the concatenated matrices provided in the data supplement (concat_matrix and concat_prot_corrected) suggests otherwise. Difficult-to-align regions can bias phylogenetic inference, so this is an important point to address. - Information about the lengths of loci and concatenated alignments should be given. - Information about how the trees were rooted should be given in this section. In the Results section it is mentioned that Beroida was used as the outgroup to all other ctenophores. However, this is poorly justified. For example, Simion et al. (2015) found this group deeply nested within ctenophores. In general, I suggest following closely the methodological protocol of Simion et al. to make the 2 studies truly comparable. 3rd paragraph: - Replace "is" with "are" - The accession numbers are buried in some text files in the data supplement, which is quite inconvenient for the reader. I suggest providing them directly in Tables 1 and 2. 7th paragraph: - Information about the substitution models used has to be provided here. I highly recommend using partitioning by gene and incorporating secondary structure information, for full comparability with Simion et al. (secondary structure models are available both in RAxML and MrBayes). Results, Discussion - These sections have to be rewritten after reanalysis of the data and comparison with Simion et al. (2015).
