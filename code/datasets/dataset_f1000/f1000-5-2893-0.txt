This manuscript is a retrospective single- canter analysis of the outcomes of kidney transplantation in HIV infected recipients stratified by anti-retroviral therapy (ART) used. The authors found inferior 3 year graft and patient survivals in patients on protease inhibitor (PI) containing regimens. Six month opportunistic infections were also high in patients on PI-containing regimens. ART with integrase inhibitors was associated with better outcomes. Integrase inhibitors such as raltegravir has minimal drug-drug interactions and are being increasingly used in ART regimens. Overall, the manuscript is written well and conclusions are supported by the study findings. I have following comments: Was there any difference in outcomes based on induction agents used? Any postulations as to why the observed inferior graft and patient outcomes in the PI group other than drug-drug interactions?
