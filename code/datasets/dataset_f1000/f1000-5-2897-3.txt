Thank you for the opportunity to review this manuscript. We should note, however, that given the nature of the manuscript, which is really an editorial, we are of the opinion that it probably does not require the kind of rigorous peer review usually applied to original research. The manuscript presents a good summary of many of the issues facing research into metrics, and offers a plan for addressing them, at a very high level. We would suggest a few additions for improvement: A nod to the fact that metrics can always be gamed, and that while making them more scientific could cut down on this risk, it will likely always be possible. It might also bear mentioning that no matter what metrics we end up with, they are no substitute for reading a particular paper. Put another way, metrics may be useful for certain things (eg large-scale productivity) but not others (eg quality). A more specific set of next steps. What first steps might funders, scientists, and administrators take? A systematic review and meta-analysis? A gathering to frame the questions and identify funding priorities? Etc.
