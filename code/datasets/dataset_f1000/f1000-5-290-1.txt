I feel the case report seems to be an original one, though such cases have been published previously. It provides sufficient details for others to learn, like it emphasizes that such clinical condition must be kept in mind and adequate safety precautions must be taken while operating on such patients, though all cases will not have intra-operative complications. It states the clinical condition and investigations done. An adequate number of references have been sited. Hence I feel the article is acceptable.
