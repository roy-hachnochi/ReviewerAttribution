This is a well conducted experiment examining the influence of various teratogens on the egg laying rate and embryo quality, and progeny, in C. elegans. There is an expected fall off in the fertility of worms exposed, however the actual rate of egg laying on initial exposure was raised. My only comment would be that egg laying in worms is associated with/ needs worm movement. Thus you can get a ‘bag of worms’ phenotype if all movement is blocked. Hypothetically worm irritancy by noxious exposure in itself may promote movement, which then raises egg laying rate. It may be worthwhile commenting on this as a possibly explanation.
