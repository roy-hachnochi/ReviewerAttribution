The revised manuscript of Breckels et al. addresses all my previously stated comments. The inclusion of code snippets in the appendix to fully reproduce the results from the authors adds to the overall very high credibility and quality of the article. It can be seen as a poster child article for reproducible research. For not finding the appropriate, computationally costly files in the first review online, I would like to excuse myself. Any other issues will be dealt with through the corresponding developer channels.
