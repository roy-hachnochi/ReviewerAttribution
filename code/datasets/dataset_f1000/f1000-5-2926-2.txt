This manuscript describes a Bioconductor workflow for analyzing subcellular proteomics data. It is very detailed and comprehensive and will be useful for others in the field. A few comments: Some clearer statement early on would help to clarify for readers what types of data this works with. I know that the authors indicate that the example they use is 10-plex TMT and that it can be used with label-free or other labels, but that is not what I am referring to. Rather, structure of the experiment. That is, that one needs systematic quantitative data on all the different relevant fractions from a cell, as opposed to someone who perhaps did a differential centrifugation experiment to isolate a couple fractions and then wants to apply this (my understanding is that this latter example would not be usable). How do the authors recommend collapsing replicates? This could be covered in the section dedicated to the Compare function. Two replicates will (almost) never agree 100% so how are discrepancies handled?
