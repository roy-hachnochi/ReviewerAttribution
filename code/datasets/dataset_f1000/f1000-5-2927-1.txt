This is an original research article reporting a machine learning approach exploiting gene expression profiles to predict pan-cancer cell line sensitivity to drugs. The title is appropriate and the abstract represent a suitable summary of the work I would however suggest that the authors define the abbreviation “GDSC”. The paper is well written, the experimental design is good and the conclusions fit with the data. Minor point: page 7 figure 3 legend, RC=0.37 is not of the figure: this must be corrected
