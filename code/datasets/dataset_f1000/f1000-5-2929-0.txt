The authors present data on the distribution of LLT1 in human tissues, obtained by flow cytometric analysis of PBMC and by immunohistochemical analysis of diverse tissues, using a novel monoclonal antibody 2H7. The current literature is inconstant in this regard, so this paper will be a useful reference point for those studying of the biology of LLT1. Can the authors provide more information on how the antibody and cell lines used to test it were originally generated and selected in the laboratory of Gordon Freeman, or provide a reference. In the results section describing Figure 1, the authors state that 2H7 is a good tool for studying distribution in tissue, but the methods section state that for Fig 1D, where immunofluorescence is shown, the antibody AF3480 is used. Is this correct? Can the authors clarify why a different antibody was used here? Please clarify what the 6 histograms in each part of Figure 2 represent. The columns are labelled 24h and 48h, but this does not appear to correspond to the figure legend. The authors should add scale bars to the images, rather than stating the magnification of the objective lens. Please correct IgG2A to IgG2a throughout. The authors should state the reference number for the ethical permission obtained.
