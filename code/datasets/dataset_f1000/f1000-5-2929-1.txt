The present study by A. Llibre et al. is describing novel monoclonal antibody, clone 2H7, that is able to detect protein LLT1 in various healthy as well as tumour human tissues, as shown by immunohistochemistry, fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry. LLT1 was shown to have broad expression pattern with the highest expression levels detected in circulating B cells and monocytes and, surprisingly, also in immune-privileged sites - brain, placenta, testes. This observation supports its role in inhibition of NK cell cytotoxicity mediated by its interaction with inhibitory NK cell receptor NKR-P1. LLT1 inhibitory properties were confirmed in the present study using NK cell degranulation assay. Overall, this study is of general interest, mainly to the scientists studying directly this receptor:ligand interaction pair or other closely related pairs. Given the fact that LLT1 and especially NKR-P1 are linked to multiple human immune pathologies or other diseases, detailed characterization of LLT1 expression is adding valuable piece of information to this field. However, as already pointed out by Prof. Lanier in his peer review, I would also argue that for maximising impact of this work and its possible benefit to the scientific community, the availability of this novel antibody should be addressed, as well as the information whether it is blocking the LLT1:NKR-P1 interaction or not. Also, as already mentioned in preceding review, the use of blocking antibody (possibly 2H7) should have been included in degranulation assay, as it is a standard control setup in such experiments. This would also directly show blocking capabilities of 2H7 clone.
