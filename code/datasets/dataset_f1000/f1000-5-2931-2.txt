The authors have focused on an important area of public health research from the perspective of Bangladesh. Due to scarcity of data availability, it is important to publish more evidence based research. The findings of the study are interesting and would shed lights for the future awareness programs and possible policy changes. The following issues need to be addressed for my approval: The title needs to be amended to make it correct grammatically. The article, specifically the abstract needs to be revised for grammatical and language errors. Introduction: Needs to have more discussion on data availability from Bangladesh or neighboring countries. Results: The numbers presented under the incidence are confusing. The authors mentioned that 51.5% were children, who were stuck by lightning, whereas the next line says that the highest incidence was among 50 years old. The authors should consider presenting more inferential analyses (only gender and residence location are presented) Discussion: There should be a comprehensive discussion on the ways forward, how to prevent such incidence mentioning the steps taken in other neighboring countries.
