The authors have described one of the most important public health needs for further action. Paper is well structured and written well too. Although the findings is from Bangladesh health and injury survey which conducted in 2003, therefore the epidemiology and factors may be modified in last 10 years. Since, there is no alternative data to compare, this paper is important for the decision makers, at the policy level. English of the manuscript is understandable. I would recommend to accept and approve the article to be indexed.
