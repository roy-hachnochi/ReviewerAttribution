This manuscript is about the generation of a Aldh1l1-CreERT2 mouse model to better study astrocytes in vivo. Due to the lack of Cre-driven astrocyte-specific rodent models, manipulating and studying astrocytes has been exceptionally challenging. This new mouse model may open up many opportunities for scientists in the study of astrocytes. However, for the staining of astrocytes during cell counts and co-labeling the S100beta staining seems to label only a fraction of all astrocytes compared to reporter mouse models such as the BAC-Glt1-eGFP or Aldh1l1-eGFP; an antibody that could detect all astrocytes would be the best to quantify overall double positive astrocytes such antibody combinations of Glt1, Aldh1l1, and/or Acsbg1. In an ideal situation you would generate a triple transgenic with the Aldh1l1-CreERT2, Rosa26-Tdtomato, and BAC-Glt1-eGFP to obtain more accurate cell counts and co-labeling. Although this experiment would take considerable time to complete and might be a fine followup study. Overall, this study will provide a greatly needed tool to glial biology. Provided these approaches such as staining are considered, we approve this manuscript for indexing.
