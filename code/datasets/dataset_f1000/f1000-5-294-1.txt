I appreciated the author explaining the role that preprints could play in biological and biomedical research and support publication. I have several comments that I think could make this a stronger opinion article. “A preprint is a manuscript in a finished form that has not yet been published in a traditional journal.” I would emphasize in this first paragraph that preprints are not peer-reviewed, particularly since the author points out that preprint posting is likely to be simultaneous or soon after submission to a traditional journal. “The practice of publishing preprints is universal in the fields of physics and mathematics” According to Lariviere, et. al, 2014, only 20% of published papers in the general field of physics are posted as preprints on arXiv. While it is nearly universal in some physics subfields, i.e astronomy, astrophysics and nuclear and particle physics (60-70% of journal articles are posted as preprints), it is less common to post a preprint and subsequently publish in a peer-reviewed journal in fields such as solid state physics. Rather than undermining the value of preprints, this disparity highlights that posting a preprint can be a considered decision rather than a common practice even in the field of physics, something that may also be eventually true in biological and biomedical research. I appreciated the author’s personal perspective on publishing. Another point that may argue against the "junk" argument: Several studies have evaluated the impact, in terms of citations, of papers posted on arXiv and subsequently published in journals versus papers only published in journals and found no difference in the level of impact (Davis and Fromerth, 2007; Gentil-Beccot et al. , 2009; Lariviere et al. , 2014).
