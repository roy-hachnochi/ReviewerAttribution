The critical point of this article is the detection limit of the ELISA KIT used. The concentration of metabolite measured in EBC was too much low. I suggest to concentrate the sample by evaporation under vacuum, or use an another KIT with a higher sensitivity. The number of healthy subjects from which it was collected EBC is too low. I suggest of collect others EBC samples from healthy subjects.
