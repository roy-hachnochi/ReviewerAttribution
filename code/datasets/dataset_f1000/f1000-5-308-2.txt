The article describes an excellent method of antibody specificity validation before commercial release. Non- specific binding of antibody is a major constrain for reproducibility and for acceptable quality of data. Thus, knocking down the target gene utilizing siRNA is a suitable method to determine the specificity of the antibody. The author explained a suitable method to develop high quality antibody commercialization. I believe that the article is appropriate as published in F1000Research.
