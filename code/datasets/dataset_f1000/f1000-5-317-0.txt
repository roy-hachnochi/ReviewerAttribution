This article addresses a topic of interest (Wnt signalling in the Drosophila gut), and brings new, relevant data to an issue that has remained controversial despite numerous publications. The article is well written, includes a complete up-to-date introduction, and the data that are shown are good quality and believable. Indeed the various methods employed to assess the spatio-temporal patterns of Wnt signalling in this organ are ingenious. Interest from the field is documented by the large number of internet hits already sustained (307). Notwithstanding these strengths, the paper has some notable weaknesses that should really be addressed before it is finalized for indexing. First of all, it needs to be said that there is no data on Wnt function in this paper, and this is a limitation. Secondly, the two assays used to assess Wg activity, namely fz3-RFP expression and Arm stabilization, are not validated with the necessary controls. Although references are cited that support the accuracy of these markers, these references looked in different cell types and so controls in the gut still need to be done. The obvious controls would involve increasing or decreasing Wg expression and seeing increases or decreases in the activity reporters. Finally, the authors need to note that Wg is not the only Wnt expressed in the fly intestine, and so some of the activity patterns might be due to other ligands.
