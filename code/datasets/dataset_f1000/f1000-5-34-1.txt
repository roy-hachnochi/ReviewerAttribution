Thank you for having allowed me to review this manuscript. I am very concerned at the fact that the authors try and generalise from one single case report. There is little modern evidence that neovascularity is the primum movens of tendinopathy, and that it should be a therapeutic target. The enrollment of the patient after such a short period of symptoms is questionable. The follow up is much too short to be able to make recommendations. References 1.

Continue reading In summary, our report has been considered not to be of an acceptable scientific standard by the reviewer Nicola Maffulli. This blunt disqualifier statement is surprising. The report submited to F1000 has been elaborated according the same scientific standards employed in the rest of our scientific papers, quoted thousands of times (according the statistics of the WOK), sometimes published in journals of the widest international diffusion. Keystone for the scientific disqualification seems an article published by the reviewer in 2012, in the journal "Knee Surg Sports Traumatol Arthrosc" (20:1891–1894), which has been quoted eleven times along these last four years, that defends that detecting neovessels has no additional value for the diagnosis, no firmly confirmed prognostic value, and no proven relation with symptoms in Achilles tendinopathy, a statement that seems contradictory with some studies quoted in the same article: In (a series of) Swedish studies, the investigators were able to detect neovessels in 100 % of the symptomatic tendons [1, 26, 37, 38]..... other researchers, ... reported a percentage varying from 47 to 88 % [13, 41, 42, 54]. Our report does not aim to engage in any sort of controversy about the relevance of neovascularization of the Achilles tendinopathy and whether it is a primum movens or not in such diseases, a discussion that still seem widely open, according to the results of bibliographical searches of recent publications. Accordingly, the report should not be judged from such a point of view. We, exclusively, intend to report the case of a tendinopathy the vascularization of which healed very efficiently, accompanied of a considerable relief of pain, after local treatment with an inhibitor of fibroblast growth factor (FGF), a main angiogenic and inflammatory protein. The treatment was applied after three months of unsuccessfully treated chronic pain and swelling on top of his left heel that made the patient had to discontinue sport practices. This does not seem a questionable short period of symptoms, before the enrolment in the alternative treatment (point 2 of the reviewer considerations), taking into account the quite undesiderable consequences of a prolonged inflammation and abnormal vascularization [Carmeliet, Nature 438 (2005) 932]. We did not try to report a long term healing process, but the fast disappearance of neovascularization and pain relief by inhibiting FGF, a treatment supported by a solid rationale. To this purpose a two-month follow up seems reasonable. A different question is if we had intended to report on a long-term cure. But this is the objective of a different-aimed observational study that we are carrying out at this moment (point 3 of the reviewer comments). The treatment was carried out, as detailedly described in the report, according to the requirements of a proper science, which, surprisingly, was straight on globally disqualified without pointing out at any major mistake in the followed procedure.

Not approved Fundamental flaws in the paper seriously undermine the findings and conclusions This is an interesting article where the authors showed the efficacy of dobesilate for the treatment of Achilles tendinopathy. Dobesiltate is an inhibitor of Fibroblast Growth factors. Inhibition of FGF in this pathology reduced angiogenesis in the tendon and pain-related symptoms. The report shows that it could be used safely in patients. Competing Interests No competing interests were disclosed.
