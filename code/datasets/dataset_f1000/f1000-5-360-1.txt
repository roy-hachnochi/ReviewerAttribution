This is a nicely done survey that assessed the persistence of rheumatologic symptoms in patients diagnosed with chikungunya. I presume the virus was the Asian lineage (rather than the Indian Ocean lineage that caused the outbreak in La Reunion), so it's interesting to see the impact of different virus lineages. The term "censoring time" may need clarification.
