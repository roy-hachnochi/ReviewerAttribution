This paper represents a very useful development. The authors have painstakingly reviewed and synthesised the articles useful for scaling up interventions (specifically, innovations) and created a model for innovators to follow, or check their progress. This kind of staged approach is useful for those who follow logical, structured ways of thinking and working. My sole reservation is that models such as this downplay the point that health care is a complex adaptive system. In the real world, people are busy, challenged, and stressed, for the most part, and rarely use tools and frameworks in a logical, structured manner. And innovations rarely unfold in neat and tidy ways. I would like to see some recognition of this in papers such as this. Perhaps the authors in a future piece of work could factor in the complexities, and the fact that most clinicians flex and adjust their practices to meet exigencies as the real world unfurls before them.
