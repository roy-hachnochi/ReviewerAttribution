Much innovation research is all about developing an innovation, with too little attention paid to how the new tool or idea will be, or can be, implemented. Gupta et al. have done a literature search of the subject to review how innovators plan (or not) for the whole process from development and funding through to implementation and commercialisation. They have developed a planning programme called the Nose to Tail Tool which provides steps for action and steps for deliberation, by all the players concerned along the entire process of innovation implementation. Specific questions are raised with different groups of people during the course of development. The NTT tool is a planning grid (of 72 boxes) which helps bring everyone together early in the development phase so that problems further down the line can be anticipated or avoided. Discussions may even lead the team to decide not to waste further time and effort on the project. Gupta states that the tool is being put to use in Canada; it will be interesting to see how effective it is; experience with using the tool will probably lead to some fine-tuning. I like the idea of the NTT. I think the paper is long, with quite a bit of repetition; but it is worth a read and the NTT could save innovators both time and money. But the proof of the pudding will be in its successful use.
