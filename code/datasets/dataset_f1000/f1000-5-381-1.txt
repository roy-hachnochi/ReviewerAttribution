This is manuscript describes the development of a valuable new Python package that provides the user with an environment in which they can explore multiple different large datasets related to a single gene. The software maps genes back to Ensemble, provides polymorphisms from dbSN, and provides information on experimentally detected patient-specific polymorphisms. The software can also handle DNA Sequencing data, RNA-Seq data and proteomics data for the same individual. The authors have designed the software so that it manages these datasets efficiently, thus providing the user with seamless and rapid access to the information desired. The use of “datawraps” so that co-authors can share information will likely also be valuable for users. The software has been downloaded over 12,000 times in the first year, demonstrating its utility. There is a very helpful figure, Figure 1, that gives an overview of the process. The authors might consider adding a section of the manuscript in which they walk the reader through the analysis of an actual gene in an actual genome to give the reader a sense of the findings.
