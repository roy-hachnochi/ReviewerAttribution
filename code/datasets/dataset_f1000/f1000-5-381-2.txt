pyGeno is a Python package that allows a user to simply query either a standard reference genome or a custom genome for information such as sequences, SNPs, and related RNA and protein data. I agree that this package fills a need for genome research, appears to be very straightforward to use, and I would like to use it myself. However, when I tested it I was unable to get it to run; contrary to the authors claims that it is easy to install with minimal dependencies I couldn't make it work. (I am not a Python expert, but I have installed much more complicated packages successfully.) With Python virtual environments, I wonder if there is a need to be quite so minimal. Would it be easier to rely on standard packages to ensure a universal, smooth experience?
