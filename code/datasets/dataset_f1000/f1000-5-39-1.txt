The authors present version 6 and 7 of BioTapestry in which they introduced improved network layout and drawing capabilities and added an in-browser JavaScript web editor functionality to BioTapestry as a hybrid between desktop and web app. BioTapestry aims to visualize and analyze gene regulatory networks and make it easy for users to share them. The article is clearly written and has a good flow, despite being occasionally a bit informal. The article follows a clear structure with a descriptive title as well as a well-described abstract and conclusion that summarize the work. It links to documentation/tutorials as well as the code. As another referee noted, the authors followed a recent trend for more web security by using a HTML Canvas, CSS and JavaScript approach instead of deploying the app via Java Web Start which runs Java code as previously done, a design decision that I support. The following suggestions could further improve the article. The proposed software was created about two years ago. I would encourage a timelier publication of this article to promote awareness of the software as well as to be a resource and reference guide for users. On similar terms, the Github code repository seems to be a bit outdated. The last commit was 2 years ago. Consider how version updates of dependent software might impact BioTapestry despite version backward compatibility. Currently, Java 8 is distributed while this update to BioTapestry was initially written for Java 5. Integration with other (network) tools, such as Gephi, would be desirable. The website mentions that export to SBML and SIF (for Cytoscape) are currently supported. It might be of interest to open a voting on the website (e.g. based on IP address and/or browser session to discourage multiple votes) to find out which import/export capabilities are most desired by most users. This would provide a fluent integration of BioTapestry with other bioinformatics, network or general software and would be an incentive for users of other programs to start using BioTapestry. More on a side note, while being very descriptive and conversational, the article could have been more concise and separated future development from current design choices. Overall, the authors did a very good job at developing and clearly presenting an update to BioTapestry, an important tool for gene regulatory network analysis and distribution.
