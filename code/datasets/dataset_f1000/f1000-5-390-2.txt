The authors describe a dataset used for flow cytometric analysis of sloughed epithelial cells from a set of 6 individuals. It is not at all clear why these data are different from those reported in their copublished research note ( http://f1000research.com/articles/5-180/v1 ) which provides an analysis of these data. The anonymized names of the individuals in the two papers are the same and they are both in .fcs format. The Data Note is larger than the data in the Research Note, presumably because it contains technical replicates. The differences are trivial. In fact, the Research Note would have greater validity if the Data Note dataset was incorporated into this document and discussed there. The second point that should be addressed is how the statistics of the fluorescence distributions (FS, SS) for different samples from the same individual or from different individuals can be compared given that the intensities vary, presumably as a result of the differences in yield from each sample. The reliability of using these histograms for making comparisons between replicates or individuals for forensic or any other applications could be suspect (eg. sample R12) due to noise, broad distributions or other factors. I suggest that the authors determine and provide minimum threshold criteria for analysis of a sample or comparison with other samples.
