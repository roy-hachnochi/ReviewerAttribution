The article suggests "touch samples" however the data set contains no data on forensic relevant touch samples. The six samples were from volunteers rubbing their entire hand. These are "fresh" cells and might not show the same flow characteristics as cells left behind on an object after a touch contact and having "aged" on the object. The dataset provided is as it is not really relevant to the forensic field. In addition I think that 6 samples is maybe a too limited number for this kind of studies.
