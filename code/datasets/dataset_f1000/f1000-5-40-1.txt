This is about dreams, and dreams do not always come true, even open access ones. This is an interesting opinion text, and not a researched article. It therefore aims to stimulate discussion about the key issue of open access, particularly in the medical world. It raises the interesting, and often overlooked, issue as to access to research for medical practitioners and not just researchers. There are a number of issues. One is the control of the big publishers who have no intention to release archived texts. Whilst new production may come out as gold open access, there is still a wealth of hidden data. As they say, citing the Finch report, there is a question of cost as publishing one has a cost that the researcher must pay. Another issue is one of language, and that is related to evaluation criteria and indicators. As long as international is seen as a proxy for quality, and as long as the English language will be seen as international, there will be a problem. In years to come, their dream will come increasingly true, but to hasten it a change of mindset on language is vital, especially as Spanish is far from a minority language. The big question will remain archives as the publishers are sitting on a gold mine, and they know it.
