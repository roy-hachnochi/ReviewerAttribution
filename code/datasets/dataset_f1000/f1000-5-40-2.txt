This is a very interesting article facing a challenge for developing countries, costs of publications. Whilst Open Access is excellent in this setting because allows wide access for everybody, also implies costs for authors in most journals, which is also difficult. Particularly this should be considered more in this discussion. Goverments and institutions should be more responsible covering those costs. But also journals should be responsible and consider extreme cases of inability to pay, then offering waivers, and particularly giving different costs for authors from developing countries, regardless of the classification of the World Bank, which is not fair. For example, the HINARI initiative has fallen short for this reason. Many countries there, included Colombia and Peru, were considered according to the WB as countries with an income not classifiable to have access. Then, this is unfair. Anyway, I would like to see more of this discussion in the paper.
