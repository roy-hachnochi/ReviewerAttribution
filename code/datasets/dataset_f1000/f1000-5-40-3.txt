Proao et al. present an interesting opinion paper about the availability of health information for health practitioners in Latin America. The title gains in irony after one reads the article, which concludes that health information for all remains a dream and not an accomplishable goal. The abstract clearly contextualizes the article to the opinions of the authors and adequately encapsulates the depth of the subject matter. The arguments presented in the article are clearly stated as opinions based on personal experiences, and thus are not necessarily substantiated by evidence gathered from relevant literature. I recommend the article be approved as an opinion paper – this is not ground breaking new knowledge - but is a topic that needs discussion as in the end, access to information can affect clinical decisions. I recommend the following minor revisions: p.3, column 1, line 18-20. “This project was created to allow all theses to stay available online: however, this project is run independently by each school.” Please include a sentence on why this is problematic – is it a meta-data problem, incompleteness, etc. Do the authors have a solution? p.3, column 2, line 1. “In 2007, Villafuerte-Glvez et al. (as a Peruvian medical student) Please correct the use of the singular to the plural eg (as Peruvian medical students) p3. Column 2, line 9-12. “It has been shown that at least one in three recent Peruvian medical graduates use Medline/PubMed….” Is this surprisingly different from any other country? In the referenced article by Mejia et al. (ref.#24) 34% of the sample regularly used Medline/PubMed. Other studies, using other countries, for example by Davis (2011, follow the link below), report use of PubMed/MEDLINE to be between 70 and 84%. https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Karen_Davies/publication/49763179_Physicians_and_their_use_of_information_A_survey_comparison_between_the_United_States_Canada_and_the_United_Kingdom/links/004635286b7abf103d000000.pdf p.3, column 2, line 51. “…but maybe is time to change..” Please correct to “…but maybe it is time to change…” p4, column 1, line 2. “ …fulfilling the four principles aforementioned.” Please change to “…fulfilling the aforementioned four principles.” p.4, column 1, line 3-4. “Will we keep dealing with the dilemma of accessing “what is available” rather than “what we need”? The ending could be stronger. Please consider rewriting this final sentence. Try something like: “Until then, we will keep dealing with the dilemma of accessing “what is available” rather than “what we need”. For my personal interest: p.3, column 2, line 26-28 “Some Latin American journals have aimed to lessen the gap by providing the same article, with the same digital object identifier, in more than one language” This is interesting, I would like to learn more. Is this allowed, ethically? Is this not self-plagiarism? How do you cite such publications and do they count as one or two separate works?
