The report by Marr and colleagues compiles a valuable set of human early-life publically available expression datasets from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) resource. Obtaining consent and sufficient amounts of sample for this population group is problematical and the limited number of datasets presented reflects the scarcity of studies in this area. The authors have made these datasets web accessible through the Gene Expression Browser (GXB). Interrogating these datasets using GXB application is straightforward but is quite limited providing a restrictive gene analytic view. Incorporating pathway-querying and visualization functions could enhance the overall utility of GXB. Further this would benefit with a note regarding the update frequency for new relevant datasets â€“ during the review process new datasets have already become available. The usefulness and research value of this resource will only be met with continued effort to routinely curate new datasets.
