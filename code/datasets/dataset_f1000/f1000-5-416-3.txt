Higher vertebrates express six different highly conserved actin isoforms. The authors determined the precise localization of alpha-skeletal actin (aSKA) and alpha-cardiac actin (aCAA) in normal and regenerating rat skeletal muscles. The distinct distribution of the two alpha actin isoforms seems very interesting. However, the authors should describe the results of their immunofluorescent analysis on skeletal muscle more precisely and carefully. The authors often used terms “renewing muscle (fibers)” and “regenerating fibers”. However, there is no definition of them. The authors should show the presence of centrally located nuclei in those myofibers because those are found in newly formed myofibers. The authors identified myofibroblasts in regenerating skeletal muscles as the alpha-SMA (aSMA) positive mononuclear cells. However, myoblasts also express aSMA. Thus, the authors should determine the absence of myogenic lineage markers such as MyoD in those cells. Intracellular localization of alpha actin isoforms should be shown in pictures with higher magnification in addition to the present Figure 2 and 3. Those data will provide important information suggesting different function of those actin isoforms. The term “self-renewal” is used incorrectly. For examples, “self-renewal in muscle cells” and “during muscle self-renewal” are difficult to understand. I wonder whether “muscle cells” mean muscle satellite cells, myoblasts (muscle progenitor cells), or myofibers. “Muscle self-renewal” means muscle regeneration?
