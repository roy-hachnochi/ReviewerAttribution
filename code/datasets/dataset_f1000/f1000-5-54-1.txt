ChIP-seq is becoming a standard tool for transcription factor or histone mark mapping, but many assumptions are made about the reproducibility of this method, particularly between factors. There is a general assumption that one set of parameters are appropriate for all ChIP-seq experiments, regardless of the factors being purified. No genuine gold standard exists for ChIP-seq and the current accepted guidelines defined by Encode, may or may not be of sufficient robustness (i.e. Encode recommend two ChIP-seq replicates, which eliminates any possibility for statistical differential analysis and simply wouldn’t be acceptable for almost any other genomic analysis). One big issue in ChIP-seq, is the quality of the antibody and the number of required reads to get robust data. This manuscript provides a very useful and important tool for dealing with this critical issue. The QC indicator described and tested in this manuscript, provides a user-friendly way of gaining insight into the best antibody for a factor and the minimum read depth needed for an experiment to capture most binding sites and to therefore be considered successful. The system described here provides information about the best reagents and the appropriate sequencing depth, using a clear and informative grading system. The findings from this paper show that different sources of antibodies have distinct efficiencies and that different sequencing depth is required for individual factors, an importantly and largely unknown finding. Whilst the method is based on a priori knowledge and doesn’t account for non-specific antibodies or isn’t appropriate for novel factors that haven’t been previously explored, the QCi approach is an important and much needed resource, for both novices and experts. This tool will undoubtedly improve the quality of the data that is being produced and analysed by the community and this should be the first place to start for anyone thinking of doing ChIP-seq experiments.
