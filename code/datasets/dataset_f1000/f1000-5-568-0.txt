The manuscript illustrated–through geographic mapping–the epidemiological behavior of Zika virus infection in the municipality of Tolima, Colombia, which results in an easy and understandable way for the decision makers in order to face an emerging problem like the one analyzed. I think the title and the abstract are accurate; the methodology clearly stands that the study was conducted at one of the high incidence departments located in the central area of ​​Colombia. In general, I think the results are arranged clearly enough; besides, the findings in the municipality of Ibagu, capital of the municipality, given that it comprising almost 40% of the total population of the department, the data are shown independently It would be desirable at a given moment to develop this same method of mapping conjointly with the municipalities of Cundinamarca and Huila, bordering areas with Tolima, Colombia, where there was also a high incidence of Zika virus infection, at least until March 5, 2016. The article highlights, in a balanced manner, the advantages of performing this type of mapping, considering that the authors also note the area on study as endemic for dengue and chikungunya.
