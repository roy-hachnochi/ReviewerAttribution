The authors provide an excellent and timely mini-review of the interactions between the circadian and stress response systems, and their actions on dopaminergic reward circuitry underlying addiction and diseases of drug abuse. They highlight the differential expression levels of BMAL1 binding partners CLOCK and NPAS2 throughout the brain, indicating that NPAS2 is specifically enriched in the nucleus accumbens. This sets the stage for the idea that selective manipulation of the circadian clock through NPAS2 in the nucleus accumbens could influence reward-seeking behavior. Additional evidence is discussed regarding the binding of CLOCK/BMAL1 at the tyrosine hydroxylase promoter to repress transcription and therefore dopamine synthesis. The authors further discuss the fundamental link between the HPA axis and the circadian clock through glucocorticoid-response elements in clock gene and tyrosine hydroxylase promoters, acetylation of the glucocorticoid receptor by CLOCK/BMAL1, and other potential interactions with the newly discovered clock component CHRONO. The review is concise and provides an excellent starting point for anyone interested in the etiology, treatment, or molecular biology of addiction or drug abuse. It may be beyond the scope of this review, but future discussion of the effects drugs of abuse on the circadian clock may be warranted. Is there any evidence for circadian control of opioid reward signaling? It may be worth discussing stress effects on opioid or opioid-receptor expression in the VTA or NAc on a circadian basis.
