The study investigates the influence of accounting for covariate shift in classification performance using logistic regression models. Overall, this short paper is very well and clearly written, however the method section should be expanded (see below). Although no increase in performance could be established by accounting for covariate shift, it provides an excellent basis for further investigations. Suggestions/Corrections: The method section should be expanded: I assume all models were trained as binary classifiers. This is potentially confusing as the chosen ADME properties in the experimental data could also have been modelled using regression models. This should be stated clearly and explained how labels (good/bad) are assigned to the training instances for the different ADME properties (and how labels are assigned to the ChEMBL data given the potencies). Which basis functions (kernels?) were used in equation (2)? What distance measure was used for k-NN (e.g., Soergel/Tanimoto, Hamming)? In Figure 3 (and 4), given the imbalance in data size between training and test set, consider reporting the balanced accuracy. E.g. a trivial classifier classifying each compound as "training" compound would have an accuracy of 75% based on the imbalance of the data set, which needs to be taken account when interpreting Figure 3. The authors provide a data set for download although they do not explicitly report the results for that data set. The results should be reported. Typos: In the formula for KL on page 3 the two vertical bars should have the same size. In Figure 1, the labels for the red and blue line are mixed up.
