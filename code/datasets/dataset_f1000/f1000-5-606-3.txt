The manuscript describes modeling studies suggesting that Lovastin lactone, a statin, inhibits growth of methane-forming archaeon Methanobrevibacter smithii by inhibiting an F420 dependent-enzyme involved in CO2 reduction to methane, namely F420-dependent methylene-tetrahydromethanopterin dehydrogenase (Mtd). Modeling studies had previously indicated that another F420-dependent enzyme, F420H2:NADP oxidoreductase in methanogens could be a site of inhibition (reference 14). The results are interesting, however, before indexing the following information has to be added: The authors must provide experimental evidence that their theoretical prediction is correct. Show that Lovastin inhibits methane formation from H2 and CO2 in non-growing cell suspensions of M. smithii and/or that Lovastin inhibits Mtd activity in cell extracts of M. smithii of better with the purified enzyme. The authors might want to team up with a lab experienced in the proposed experiments. Without these experimental data the manuscript would contain nothing really new relative to the results published in reference 14. The authors must clearly indicate that crystal structures of Mtd with and without substrates bound have been published and give reference to these publications. To only refer to PDBs without the enzyme name is not fair. To indicate in the Abstract, Methods, that there is “no tertiary protein structural information” is more than misleading and can be misunderstood.
