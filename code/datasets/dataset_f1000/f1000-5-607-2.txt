The Author describes an unusual multifocal presentation of Biphasic squanoid alveolar renal carcinoma associated with a conventional Clear Cell Carcinoma. BSARCC is a recently described rare entity with a peculiar squamoid differentiation characterized by cyclin D1 immunoreactivity; Cyclin D1 per se is not limited to this type of renal tumor, but its pattern of reactivity seems specific for BSARCC. I suggest, considering some, although limited, similarity to squamoid morules in other epithelial tumors (colon, endometrium) to perform also immunostaining for beta-catenin.
