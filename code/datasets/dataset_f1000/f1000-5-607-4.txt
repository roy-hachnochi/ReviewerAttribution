The study describes a multifocal biphasic squamoid alveolar renal cell carcinoma in association of clear cell renal cell carcinoma. The Author claims that staining for cyclin D1 is specific for this entity; however, labelling for cyclin D1 has been reported in clear cell renal cell carcinoma, papillary renal cell carcinoma, chromophobe renal cell carcinoma and oncocytoma (1, 2) and more recently in clear cell papillary renal cell carcinoma (3) and SDH-deficient renal cell carcinoma (4). Since the immunoreactivity might depend of the clone used, the Author should supply information regarding the antibody to cyclin D1. It would be also interesting to know whether cyclin D1 is positive in the clear cell renal cell carcinoma. Finally, pictures of clear cell renal carcinoma and more detailed pictures demonstrating the squamoid features of biphasic squamoid alveolar renal cell carcinoma should be added.â€‹
