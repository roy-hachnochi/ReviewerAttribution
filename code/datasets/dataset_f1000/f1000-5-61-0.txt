The author has provided an improved version of the manuscript in which he has considered most of the suggestions and commentaries from the referees. He has improved the discussion regarding the advantages of the use of 3D printed objects in comparison with other alternatives, has described the actual activity further and attempted to assess the perception of the students. Experiences in the classroom in which no learning gain is demonstrated or there is no new theoretical proposal are difficult to publish, although some of these experiences can be very useful to design and implement new learning environments. In this case, the use of 3D printed options in a large classroom is presented, a technology that will certainly be a part of the near future of education to help students visualize and understand complex concepts. That being said, there are still some issues to be addressed regarding the actual implementation, that I consider the author will be easily able to clarify: This was implemented in the first year of study with cohorts of 150 students for three consecutive years, while the assessment was done in the final year of study of 44 students. Why only 44? Is it a 3 year study program and only the first cohort was surveyed? The paragraph in which Kolb’s experiential learning cycle is presented should be discussed further or eliminated. As it is, it provides insufficient information, confusing the reader. In the Doing section it states “apply new knowledge…”, what new knowledge? The experiential approaches followed a lecture in which the concepts were previously presented? It should be clarified if the models were used before, during or after presenting the theory and concepts involved. I consider this manuscript approved. Nevertheless, that these minor issues should be addressed in order for this experience to be a valuable approach for other educators.
