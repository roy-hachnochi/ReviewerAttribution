This article is a revised version of an earlier submission. In submitting this revised version, the author has addressed the major concerns from two reviewers. The comments have been addressed in a positive and constructive way, and the new version is significantly improved. The author has provided careful responses to the comments from both reviewers, which highlights the major changes that have been introduced in the revised submission. Particular improvements in the manuscript include: a more careful description of the arrangements for the sessions including their costs; some qualitative evaluation of the approach by the students involved in the sessions; a deeper introduction to the literature that describes this type of approach, including in other disciplines. Significantly, the title of the article has been changed and it has now been submitted as a Research Note, rather than its original submission as an Observational Article. These changes seem appropriate. One minor comment is that the responses to the two reviewers seem to have been swapped between the reviewers i.e. the response to Reviewer #1 is actually the response to comments by Reviewer #2 and vice versa. Since both sets of comments have been addressed, ultimately this does not cause problems in working out why changes have been made.
