The topic of this review is important and timely. The paper in its original form feel short of a systematic review of previous research findings related to the impact of open access on scientific publishing, public engagement with science, science literacy and altmetrics. In the latest version, the authors have modified the manuscript language to more carefully navigate any value judgements or arguments related to the case for open access. They have also provided additional evidence-based benefits, drawbacks, and evidence of a lack of significant benefits in some cases. In the latest version of this manuscript, the authors have included more balanced evidence of impacts of open access on the various domains of potential impact they consider in their paper. The evidence presented in the paper is rigorous and detailed, and should provide a basis for further discussion and evidence-based research on the impacts of OA.
