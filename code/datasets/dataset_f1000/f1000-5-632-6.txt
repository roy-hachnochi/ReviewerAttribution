This paper is a comprehensive review of the complexities of OA. I have come late to the discussion on this paper, and I find that the previous reviewers have been meticulous in their critique of the paper, to the point I have very little to add. However, there are a couple of points for consideration. What is the effect (if any) of the UK Research Excellence Framework on Open Access? To what extent is disciplinarity a factor in Open Access? I ask this question because of the high impact of the sciences and biomedical research, but wonder about Arts and Humanities (and other areas) as a comparision. As one of the other reviewers said, "this doesn't consider the fact that the prestige of some journals is advertising in and of itself." While this is true of scientific journals, the same can't be said, for example, of education journals, so there is a lack of parity between disciplines. There was also an assumption of the willingness of reviewers to continue to offer their services freely. This aspect of OA (and subscription-based) publishing is hardly ever critiqued, but it assumed to be part of the process. All in all, this paper gives a lot of food for thought. I don't expect a rewrite of the paper, based on my comments, but I would welcome further discussion on where the authors (and readers) see OA going in the future.
