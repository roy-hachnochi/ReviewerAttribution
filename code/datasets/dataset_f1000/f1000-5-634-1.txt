The authors have highlighted an important issue concerning the inability to reproduce published data supporting the activation of mTOR-dependent pathways as a potential mechanism for the rapid antidepressant effects of ketamine. The authors have provided in-depth methodological details from all labs involved, allowing for a direct comparison of the experimental procedures carried out by all research groups involved in the study. The authors suggestions of including detailed methods within the manuscript or as supplementary information as well as the disclosure of failed attempts to reproduce published data, are valid and would be a benefit to the scientific community.
