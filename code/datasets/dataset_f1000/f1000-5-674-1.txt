The authors describe a pilot version of an integrated pipeline of network analysis tools for genomic variants. It includes four existing tools. The pipeline analyzes the input files and run the tools applicable to the input files. The value of this contribution would greatly increase if the pipeline consolidated the output of the different tools. The authors acknowledge this fact and plan to include that in future versions of the pipeline The manuscript is well written, and the functionality of tools included is clearly described.
