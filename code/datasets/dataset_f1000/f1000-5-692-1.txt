This is an exceptionally well-designed survey, which was carried out professionally and effectively. The results of this survey will be incredibly useful for future researchers who want to gain an insight into current practices relating to innovations in scholarly communications. The transparency of this data set, both upon completion and also throughout the collection period is commendable and is something that I would like to hold up as an example of best practice. The authors have worked tirelessly to ensure that this data set is of the greatest possible value to the wider research community. In particular, the use of the WordPress blog and the presentation of the final data set on Silk are processes that I would like to see repeated by others. I have only a couple of queries relating to the survey's design and implementation: What quota sampling strategy was used? In the Distribution of the survey; sampling section the authors mention that quota sampling was used, but how was this done, which quotas were selected, and why were they chosen? In the Translation of the survey section the authors mention that the Arabic survey did not include "one additional question at the end of the survey on the use of tools targeting that specific language area," why was this the case? Apart from these two small details, I would like to commend the authors on such an excellent dataset, which sets a very high standard from research design right through to dissemination of results. I am also very much looking forward to what future analysis of the data will reveal about current practices relating to innovations in scholarly communications.
