The paper is a cogent and very useful exploration of an under-considered topic by critical review which challenges certain established clinical assumptions. The difficulties of estimating the prevalence of PTD and the risk of a newly ascertained case of tics progressing to a chronic disorder are discussed in detail, based on the literature. The inevitable conclusion of a need for (expensive) further prospective study is reached, and is an aspiration shared around the world. The appendices are particularly helpful, explaining problems of terminology, ascertainment of tics and the expected lifetime prevalence of PTD in the case of various prevalences of the other tic disorders. â€‹I very much agree with my fellow reviewer ( http://f1000research.com/articles/5-696/v1#referee-response-13477 ) that the clinical term "Tourette" may have outlived its usefulness, can be unhelpful to patients and clinicians and could be improved by now being subsumed into a concept of "tic spectrum disorder", notwithstanding our reverence for its birthplace or, more practically, the freshness of DSM V.
