The study design is appropriate and the article is well written. The use of a sweep net (SN) represents a significant improvement for the surveillance of developmental stages of anophelines. I know by experience how difficult and time consuming it is to assess the abundance of anopheles larvae especially in muddy water with a dipper. The use of a SN will allow a more precise and quick assessment of the larval density e.g. before and after larvicide treatments to calculate the mortality rates or to document the presence of larvae at all. I agree with the statements of the authors that the use of a sweep net is more efficient than the dip method when larvae of anophelines have to be counted. I agree also that the data concerning culicine larval counts are not sufficient to draw a conclusion of the efficiency of the SNC for the assessment of culicine larvae. You have also to take into consideration that in some programmes the standardized dip method is used to assess a threshold of larvae (e.g. 10 dips per breeding site) to start the control operation. I confirm that this research work fulfils all prerequisites for indexation and scientific standards.
