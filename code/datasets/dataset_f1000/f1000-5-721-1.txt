In essence, Auerbach et al. tried to replicate findings by Baier et al . 1 and were unable to come to the same conclusions. Starting from the alleged (tbk unreproduced) finding of rice miRNAs in human plasma 2 , a field advocating dietary uptake of xenomiRs and proposing potential regulatory effects has arisen. While the number of studies contesting such findings is rising, it is important that more scrutiny is applied in this context and the study by Auerbach et al. is very important in this context. One clever analysis in this study is the application of clustering to investigate if there is a patient or time point related effect, or none at all. And as it turns out there rather is a patient than a time point effect. I fully support their conclusion that no more studies in this area are indicated before some additional fundamentals have been established. E.g.: the uptake efficiencies of naked and packed (pre-)miRNAs. Then downstream process like uptake of (pre-)miRNAs by cells and finally the regulatory effect of these need to be established before any further effort in the area of dietary xenomiRs should be exerted. Minor Revisions: The introduction mentions that ‘essential’ miRNAs would lead to a paradigm shift, but many co-factors and other metabolites like amino acids and vitamins are essential and can only be acquired via food sources. I suggest the statement should be slightly revised and refer more clearly to cross-kingdom communication and less to nutrition. In Figure 3 the bars marking samples may have a problem in respect to samples 2 and 3 for both panels. The study by Bagci and Allmer 3 does not conclude that there are no plant miRNAs in milk, but rather claims that for the particular samples investigated the plant miRNAs that were found are due to contamination. However far-fetched this may sound, the Cq values above some threshold are, as pointed out, likely spurious, but I believe that this has to become clear from Figure 4, as well; because some may judge the results as incidence for plant miRNAs in human plasma while they were intended to be negative controls. The figure legend could clearly state that results above Cq X are unreliable. The methodology describing RNA sequencing data analysis is not reproducible in its current form and could be expanded upon. Baier et al . 1 provide error bars for most graphs and present the average +/- SEM (=SD/sqrt(n)) for Figure 1 in Table 1. The section variation in the discussion should be revised accordingly. xeno-miRNA and xenomiR is used in the text, but xeno-microRNA is not and the abbreviation xenomiR was not introduced as such. Questions: Why was no spiking applied to the PBMC samples? Would it be possible to provide the quality assessment of SRA samples to see whether the sample SRR3083758 with the most reads has a much lower sequencing quality than the other samples? Perhaps there is some problem with the file which prevents its proper processing by some of the tools and, therefore, not the complete data was mapped. This needs some clarification. References 1.
