Here Auerbach et al report their attempts to validate the data of Baier et al that showed the presence of bovine miRNAs in human plasma samples after ingestion of milk. Baier et al kindly provided the original samples for this study but Auerbach et al were unable to replicate their findings. This study is presented in a very thorough and logical manner and the techniques used are appropriate. Multiple analyses are performed in their attempts to validate the findings; they do not rely on a single detection technique or normalisation protocol. The discussion points are also well considered. Clarity could be provided on the following: The content of the OpenArray. I presume that this was biased towards Human miRNAs. Clarification on the number of miRNAs that are conserved in bovine would be valuable for the reader. In the methods, the OpenArray used a preamplification step but the single probes did not. This was not obvious unless the referenced article was accessed and read. This is a point of difference that affects sensitivity between these assays. With preamplification for the single assays, the Ct values would improve for the low abundance miRNAs and the SD lower for replicates also. The discussion comment on use of differing RNA purification methods might be improved by commenting on why the kits cause differences (e.g. ability to dissociate protein aggregates, lyse EVs etc). A couple of typos- ul used instead of L pages 2 and 3. Also a degree symbol is missing on pg 3 for 22 o C. In all the authors have presented a well considered and technically robust study that adds further fuel to the debate of cross-species microRNA signaling.
