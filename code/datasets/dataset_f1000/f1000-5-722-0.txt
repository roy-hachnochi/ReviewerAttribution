The paper by Pantiukh et al. reports the results of the two novel NIPT approaches for the detection of aneuploidies. The work is performed on a large cohort of 1012 patients, all using appropriate controls. One of the methods under evaluation employs differential methylation status between cell free DNA in maternal blood of maternal and fetal origin. It is a very interesting idea to use this phenomenon for NIPT, which may have led to cost effective and fast diagnosis but unfortunately did not render promising results. However the other method, which is based on the assessment of VAFs of 220 common polymorphisms, is probably more promising. The presented results reached the correlation of 0.74 with the reference, which is still quite modest for the standards of diagnostics, but has potential for improvement with the increase of the number of tested SNPs. Among the disadvantages of this technique, which may potentially preclude it from wide use, is the utilization of sequence capture step which is time and labor consuming. Moreover, precap-PCR may bias the VAF distribution.
