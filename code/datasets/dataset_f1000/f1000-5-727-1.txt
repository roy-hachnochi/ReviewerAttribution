The authors present a normative study for an unstructured test aimed at assessing cognitive flexibility and planning abilities. The methods adopted to obtain normative values are often used in Italy and allow comparing individuals’ performance on neuropsychological tests tapping different cognitive domains. The study sample is similar to that enrolled in other normative studies. However, the authors also enrolled 29 late adolescents (15-18 year-old) in their sample, and this is not usual in normative studies on neuropsychological tests. I suggest deleting these individuals from the sample, as development and maturation of executive processes across adolescence is quite variable and should be addressed by dedicated normative studies. The authors should also consider several limitations of their study, and acknowledge them in their final remarks. For instance, the authors stated in their discussion that they enrolled a “wide” sample, “representative of the Italian population”. I believe that the authors should provide more details about procedures and methods adopted for recruitment of participants, and likely tone down claims about the extension of the sample and its representativeness of the “Italian population”. Moreover, the study did not provide data about psychometric properties of the test such as convergent or divergent validity, test-retest reliability, or inter-rater agreement. I understand that to address some of these properties is outside the authors’ scope, but I believe that at least inter-rater agreement is important to reassure the reader about clinical applicability of the present test. Minor points: the authors should provide more details about the exact instructions for examinees, about time limits, and about the pieces to be used, also to make clear for the reader which types of errors are considered as “misfit” or “incomplete fit”. Info about availability of test material might be useful.
