In the present work, the authors have tested direct binding of secondary antibodies to arrays of human proteins. Readers who use array technology may benefit from the present work, since they will become aware of the problem of signals caused by secondary antibodies and not by the primary antibody. It appears that human immunoglobulins are frequently detected by secondary antibodies, which is a useful finding that would likely also be relevant for other secondary antibodies. The authors have included the original images in the supplement, which is useful for users of the technique. Issues In the Results section, it should be made clear that the arrays were probed with both antibodies in the same experiment, not one antibody at a time. It would be interesting how strong the signals caused by the secondary antibodies are in comparison to signals obtained in the presence of a primary antibody. In comparison, the part 1 image has a much higher background than part 2. It appears that very clear signals were obtained from part 2, but not from part 1. In the part 1 image, there is considerable background and almost all positions have been slightly stained. I would recommend repeating the experiment to verify whether the weak signals obtained on part 1 can be reproduced. Two secondary antibodies were used in the same experiment. Therefore, it cannot be determined which of the two antibodies gave rise to the signals on the array. This problem should be discussed.
