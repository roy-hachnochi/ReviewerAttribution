This study presents data concerning the issue of secondary antibody cross-reactivity towards antigens other than desired immunoglobulins. By screening a high-throughput protein array, the authors establish the amount and identity of proteins detected by commercially available secondary antibodies, a rabbit anti-chicken antibody combined with an AP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody. Title and Abstract : The title might contain the information that two detection antibodies were used. The abstract represents a sound summary of the work performed. Article: The methods used are described clearly, especially by showing a concise work flow as seen in table 3. Data: Results are described appropriate and sufficiently. Supplementary Figures S1 and S2 have very huge size and are dispensable. The sentence about signal intensity differences due to varying protein amounts should be part of the conclusion section and also discussed more extensively. Conclusion : The conclusions drawn are appropriate and concise. Briefly can some information be drawn from the kind / category of proteins falsely detected?
