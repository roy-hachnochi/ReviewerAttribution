This article by Fesler et al. is a timely summary of the state of the art of P53 related regulatory mechanisms with specific emphasis on colon cancer. P53 is certainly the most critical node of oncogenesis and progression. With the rapidly advancing information about the importance of non-coding RNA in the field of cancer biology it is critical to establish an integrated picture that allows us to make working models for regulation. The review has done a perfect job towards this by providing two well designed figures. Overall it is a very timely review of this ever evolving field. It is really appreciated that the authors have provided a bit of introduction on what are miRNAs and what are Lnc RNAs. It will make it easy for readers that are new to this field to appreciate the review. It is intriguing that the authors have provided a glimpse of future directions for the field. Overall I do not have any major or necessary suggestions. However I do have a curious request. Authors may wish to provide insight on if there is any way to integrate the miRNA based pathways to mRNA based pathways and if that has been done for P53 field.
