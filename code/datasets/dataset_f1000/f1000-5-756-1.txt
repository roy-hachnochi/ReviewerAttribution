In this review, the authors systematically summarize the interplay between non-coding RNAs and the P53 pathway, with emphasis on how this affects gastrointestinal cancer. The non-coding RNAs are focused on miRNA and lncRNA, and how these both regulate and get regulated by P53. The review is solid. The authors highlight each of the major miRNA or lncRNA involved with p53 in gastrointestinal cancer in a concise way. Mutant p53 and its effects on these noncoding RNA’s are also discussed. They go into regulation of noncoding RNA or P53, not only by direct but indirect mechanisms and include genes involved in this regulation. They also touch up on noncoding RNA that have opposite effects depending on cancer type and thus, not biased. References are appropriate. The use of tables and figures highlight the key points made for each of the miRNA’s and lncRNA’s and thus, make it easier for the reader to follow. Comment: The summary section is not really a summary of what was discussed. It is more of forthcoming ideas. Recommend adding a few sentences or a paragraph summarizing what was actually discussed since this is a summary section. This can then be followed by what is currently stated such as circular RNA, genomics technology and computational approaches, and the rest, as future approaches. Alternatively, the heading could be changed to “Future approaches” or something similar, if permissible.
