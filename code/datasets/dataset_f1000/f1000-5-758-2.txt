This paper reports the use of cidofovir for treatment of adenovirus infection in 16 pediatric patients, and provides detailed information about the patients’ clinical status, blood viral loads, and renal function throughout the treatment course. I have only one major point for the authors to consider. Most patients survived, and a number had decreases in viral load within several weeks of the start of cidofovir therapy. However, the patient group was quite heterogeneous (one case had cerebral palsy, but no apparent immune dysfunction); in some cases the viral loads rose for a long time before they began to fall; and 4 of the 7 patients who had undergone allogeneic stem cell transplant died. I think the discussion should point out explicitly that it is difficult to conclude from these data whether or not cidofovir provided any clinical benefit. Minor points: Clarify the assay used for viral loads. Is it the Argene assay, or an in-house assay using some components of the Argene kit? Clarify the definition of “viral response”. Is it a 10-fold decrease in titer? Perhaps mention briefly why the asymptomatic patients were treated with cidofovir. It appears that one was a lung transplant patient (considered to be at high risk) and one a SCT patient with recurrent viremia. Figure 2 adds little.
