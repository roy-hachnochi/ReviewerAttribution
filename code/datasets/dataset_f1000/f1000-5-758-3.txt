This is a well written descriptive, retrospective study of a case series of immunocompromised children receiving cidofovir for treatment of mostly probable, few definite or asymptomatic adenovirus infections. Children had different underlying diseases including a few with solid organ transplantation. The series review is transparent, showing viral and clinical evolution as well as renal compromise in association with treatment. Most children cleared adenovirus with treatment but as the authors point out, also in association with improved immunity. Most but not all children clearing the virus improved clinically, a few died despite clearing the virus. Transient nephrotoxicity occurred in near 50% of children, but this occurred in association with other nephrotoxic treatments and was not a major problem. This review adds to the rather limited number of currently available series and although not providing any definite conclusion (clinicians will still have to balance several variables before deciding to use cidofovir or not) it adds helpful information for treating physicians that have to make these hard decisions.
