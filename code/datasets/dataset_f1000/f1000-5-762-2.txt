This is an interesting study demonstrating that ab interno trabeculectomy is an appropriate surgery to attempt to control more than mild glaucoma. Ab interno trabeculotomy is a growing trend in glaucoma surgery, not just with the trabectome device, but also with the dual blade that is recently on the market from New World Medical, and also the Sight Sciences device called TRAB 360. The trend toward ab interno, non-penetrating surgery in patients with not only mild, but even advanced glaucoma demonstrates our aversion for conventional filtration surgery and the significantly high complication rate seen with it. I am grateful to the authors for writing up their large case series of results that mirror a "real world" practice using this procedure. Glaucoma surgeons need to consider expanding the use of this type of technique, knowing that by doing so, they do not rule out the possibility of doing conventional surgery in the future, if necessary.
