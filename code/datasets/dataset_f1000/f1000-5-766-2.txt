In this article Oliver et al. highlight to importance of analytical methods such as â€œmolecular modeling and molecular dynamic simulations" as tools that can significantly increase the interpretation of the functional impact of mutations/polymorphisms currently classified as variants of unknown significance (VUSs). While the topic of molecular dynamics simulation for VUSs is worth discussing, the article could expand on the current limitation of these methods the complexity of these nucleotide changes in e.g. coding and non-coding genomic regions integration with other high throughput technologies and thus increase challenges for multimodal effects in such simulations HIV is given as an example, however other clinical examples, their associated specificity and limitations should be provided to make this article relevant for a wider audience.
