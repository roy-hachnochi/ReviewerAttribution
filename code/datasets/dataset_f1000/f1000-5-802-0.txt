The article is on an important subject for reviews and studies, however it needs major revision. As one looks at the title and tries to understand what the authors wish to share, the expectations given by the title are different than what the article provides. The review methodology mentions the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews – the expectation was that they would be ordered in relation to title, socio-cultural aspects of gender based violence and relevant information, the introduction of the subject as per the title, the frequency of GBV, which socio-cultural aspects affect GBV in the proper order, what are the effects on women’s health, and to what extent. However, as one goes through the article (if one overlooks issues related to grammar, language, and the repetition of sentences) it seems a lot was needed, and that the study format as it was designed executed and discussed is different to the design as per the title. The current structure of Introduction, Incidence, Risk Factors, Attitude aspects (with studies based on interviews, about GBV, visible, invisible), the Impact of GBV on non-pregnant and pregnant women’s health, means that some paragraphs are not really relevant to the title. In addition, there are also references included in the Conclusion section. Overall, in my opinion both the design and execution could have been much better, and the discussion should be more orderly also. The grammar and language should have been looked over, for example avoiding repeated sentences.
