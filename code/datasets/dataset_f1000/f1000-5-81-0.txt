In general, this is an excellent presentation of the capabilities of a new font designed for the measurement of foveal crowding. In relation to terminology, the standard physical and mathematical unit “arcmin” is to be preferred to the ill-formed “minarc”. In the Introduction it should be clarified that eq 3 is derived from eqs 1 2. Are the cited studies of foveal crowding compatible with a 1.7:1 ratio of crowding to acuity? The Vernier acuity limit is closer to 0.1 arcmin than 0.01 deg, and its ratio to its crowding spacing would be much greater than 10:1. According to Levi et al. (1985), the maximal crowding is at 3 arcmin for a ~0.1 arcmin foveal Vernier acuity, or a 30:1 ratio. Fig. 7 caption. “ratio” should be plural in “several spacing:size ratio”. The significance of the invariance of threshold with spacing:size ratio is obscure. It might be clearer to say “threshold spacing of each observer is proportional element size rather than conforming to a fixed spacing independent of element size”. The Discussion should specify what is 6 mm in V1. Is this the diameter of the (circular) crowding zone? In suggesting that the crowding is limited by the number of neurons/mm 2 in cortex, it should clarify that the number of neurons within a 6 mm diameter crowding zone would be roughly 1.5 million just in V1, and perhaps 5 million throughout the visual hierarchy. Is this the number that are expected to participate in the acuity performance? The Discussion should reflect the studies of the Cavanagh on the attentional window hypothesis of crowding.
