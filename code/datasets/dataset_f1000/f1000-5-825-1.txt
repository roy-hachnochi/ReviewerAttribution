I found the title appropriate, and that the abstract represented a suitable summary of the work. I believe that the design, methods and analysis of results are appropriate for the topic being studied, and that for the most part, they were clearly explained. A couple of perceived shortcomings are itemized here. p.3, column 2, line 2. The “but” would be better replaced by “and”. p.5. Figure 2. The dotted and solid diagonal lines on these plots are not identified in either the caption or the text. p.5, Figure 3. It is nowhere explained whose Pearson correlations (PCC) are summarized in these box plots. I suppose that some number (to be stated) of cell lines were profiled in both GDSC and CCLE, and that in all cases, the PCC in the box plots are calculated from molecular data from pairs consisting of the data on the same cell line generated in GDSC and in CCLE. A clear statement along these lines would be helpful. p.6, column 1, lines 1-4. This assertion would have more force if the authors told the reader how many cell lines could have contributed PCC to the box plot of Figure 3a, and how many did do so. Further, I do believe that the conclusions are sensible, balanced and justified on the basis of the results of the study. Finally, I understand that all the data used in this study is available, and this is also true for the code used to generate all the results and figures.
