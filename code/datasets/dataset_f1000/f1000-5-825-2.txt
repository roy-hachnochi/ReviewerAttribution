It is a lot to take/digest the manuscript. I break this story into three parts: In 2012, both GDSC and CCLE released/published drug sensitivity data (both pharmacological and genomic). In 2013, the authors compared the two studies using the drugs in common between two. Their analysis was carried out in a direct fashion which account for variations of both genomic and pharmacological data from the same site (GDSC or CCLE) and found the results between two did not agree. Recently, GDSC/CCLE did an independent analysis and demonstrated that the agreement between two are actually higher (using ANOVA) than what the authors reported. They concluded that the results between GDSC and CCLE were consistent. However, the comparison was only focused on the pharmacological data because the genomic data used actually came from one site. That means their analysis did not include the noise introduced by both sites in this comparison. The authors, again, reanalyzed data by including pharmacological and genomic data from both sites and the conclusions remain as the same as they reported in 2013. I have no problem with their analysis and support their conclusions. With that said, I did find the paper could flow better by moving two sections into Discussion. These are: “Which pharmacological drug response data should one use?” - It seems odd and smell bad that GDSC/CCLE used the data published in 2012 and totally ignored the most current data in their analysis. This could be due to many different reasons. Thus, speculation is not necessary considered as “results”. I would say this will be better justified as “discussion”. “What constitutes agreement” – Again, this is a difficult call. I believe there is no single baseline that can be used to justify consistency. Thus, most text in this section will sit better in “discussion”. Overall, I support its indexation with revision by focusing on the flow of the story and the structure of manuscript.
