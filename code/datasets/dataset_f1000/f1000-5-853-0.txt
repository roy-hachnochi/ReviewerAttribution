This article was carefully thought of by the authors in relation to the current disease burden faced by the world and its people. The concept of FOA as a driving force for better networking on the knowledge of disease burden, has been an area of concern by researchers, health organizations and the various government bodies around the world. Research based information generated by different labs using high throughput information has been the driving force for obtaining large funding, reasons why the published information cannot be freely accessed in some journals. The resulting challenge is the lack of implementation of the right approaches to disease outcomes in LMICs due to low comprehension of the disease epidemiology and genetic factors. There is actually need for world governing bodies to sit at their conferences and make FOA a priority so that researchers in LMICs, through documented information in accessed journals, could collaborate with authors who have published widely in related fields of interest, helping them contain the disease epidemic using the right approaches before it spreads. The world now is a global village and should be treated as such, hence institutions at all ends of the globe should be able to create some form of partnerships for training and sharing data for the advancement of better health for all. The authors actually focused on their indicated topic and brought out related challenges, which suggests reasons for poor approaches to the current disease burden. Their proposals highlight steps which every player involved in decision making at various levels of the disease burden for better health, need to consider for us to attain the health goals put in place. I recommend this article as a document for all involved in the research and health field.
