In this manuscript, Michalko et al. investigates the basis of the developmental phenotypes observed in knock-down (KD) lines of the Arabidopsis ABP1 gene. By analysing segregation of defects in root elongation in the F2 and F3 generation of crosses between three KD abp1 alleles and two recently reported abp1 knock-out (KO) alleles, they conclude that the previously reported phenotypes of the KD lines are not due to loss of ABP1 function. The manuscript is clearly written and the experiments are thoroughly carried out providing an important contribution to the ABP1 saga. Although I sympathise with the authors difficulty in identifying an explanation for how the KD lines can lead to the observed abnormalities, one experiment that should be done would in my opinion be a test of the expression of the closest ABP1 -like genes that can be identified.
