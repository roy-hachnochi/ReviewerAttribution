Title is appropriate and indicates what the substance of the case report is. Unfortunately, there are certain issues need to be addressed. As expected, the likelihood of a successful pregnancy in a woman the age of 40 years and above would be low. Authors need to address the issue as to which individuals are likely to have a successful pregnancy. Genetic, environmental and hormonal milieu and family history, age at menopause in other females in the family need to be addressed. There is no case report in the literature - PubMed - as it is not impossible for women to have a successful pregnancy after the age of 40 yrs of age and hence not a rare event. It would be worthwhile if authors were to analyse all these factors and genetic studies if possible to describe factors contributing to successful egg donation and pregnancy thereafter. Lastly, why did this patient undergo caesarean delivery to deliver her baby? This is an unanswered question.
