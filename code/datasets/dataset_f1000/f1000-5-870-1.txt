All fine â€“ but the conclusions are incorporated in a way that makes them difficult for readers to assimilate. Both the Abstract and the Results need to explain how kin and group dynamics affect breeding success (i.e. which components of fitness are affected, in which direction and to what extent). The authors also need to be clearer about how and why they believe their results affect game and inclusive theory interactions; how they reconcile predictions based on these two approaches; and why they believe that the results of studies of captive animals of this kind provide insight into the evolutionary processes operating in natural populations.
