A well written case report about an unusual complication of a rare disease. The genetic background to this disorder is covered. I think this report will be useful to other clinicians who may rarely see a case of Gitelman syndrome. There is a clear discussion of the medical management strategy used in this patient which lead to an improvement of symptoms and the avoidance of surgery. I think this report adds to knowledge about this rare disease and merits indexation.
