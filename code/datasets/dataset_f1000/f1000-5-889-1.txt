I raised a number of issues with the proposal described in this article. The authors have touched upon one or two in their revision but have ignored the rest by claiming that, “ This paper is meant to be an opinion, not a review. As such, we chose to focus on explaining what the core idea is and discuss its implications.” Implications is what I had thought the authors would offer in the revision. I am not at all sure the authors have teased out the full implications of their proposal in the revision which still remains a ‘trial balloon floating off into the unknown” in the words of my co-reviewer. Moreover, how can one counter a scientific contribution offered as an opinion? As a reviewer, my comments are then my opinion. If the authors really believe in their proposal, they cannot dismiss questions like: Given the overall costs, is the problem worth solving? is there a more cost-effective and environmentally safer way to achieve the same goal? Will energy use in desalination and transport of sea water accelerate global warming? Even if the proposal is technically feasible, is it economically feasible? I find no attempt to tackle these issues and I hold fast to my view that the ‘proposal advanced is unrealistic..’ and ‘its science is unacceptably poor'.
