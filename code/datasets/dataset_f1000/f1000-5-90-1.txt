After 6 months of cyclophosphamide treatment the patient showed significant clinical improvement. Please provide pertinent laboratory data at the time of the patient’s initial evaluation, such as white blood cell count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, antinuclear antibody titer, β2-microglobulin. Please provide relevant computed tomography findings following antituberculous treatment and cyclophosphamide treatment.
