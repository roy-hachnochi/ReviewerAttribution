The authors describe a 5 year old boy with dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (DEB), which is due to a novel mutation in the COL7A1 gene. The case is the first report of a genetically characterized case of DEB from India. It is a well written manuscript which is worthy to be indexed with F1000Research . To understand the new mutation as the cause of severe DEB in the boy, it would be interesting to know what are the differences to other mutations of the COL7A1 gene. In other words, what does this mean on the protein level?
