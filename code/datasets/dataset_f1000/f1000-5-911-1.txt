 EPO, TBI and some more to say In their opinion article, “Is erythropoietin a worthy candidate for traumatic brain injury or are we heading the wrong way? ” Giovanni Grasso, Concetta Alafaci and Pietro Ghezzi address a very important topic. Specifically, they summarize and comment on recent formally negative clinical trials on the use of recombinant human erythropoietin (EPO) in traumatic brain injury (TBI). More globally, they lay their fingers in the wound of numerous clinical trials on neuroprotection and neuroregeneration in brain diseases that failed in translation from preclinical studies to the patient. The authors discuss briefly properties and encouraging preclinical studies on EPO, and then raise the most critical issues of the human EPO trials in TBI, mainly the late administration of the first dose, the short duration and low frequency of treatment - all essentially dictated by not too well established safety concerns. While we fully agree on most of these points, we do not think that the single dose was necessarily too low, as also criticized by the authors. We feel that the dose was likely sufficient but that intravenous rather than subcutaneous dosing should have been used to achieve higher EPO levels in the brain. We would like to add a few comments that we feel – after 20 years of own experience in translational work on the brain EPO system – are important to consider. We had to painfully learn ourselves the downstream consequences of pharmaceutical companies and overeager regulatories drawing fast conclusions out of too superficially or not at all analyzed data. This triggered an avalanche of destruction regarding our large EPO stroke multicenter trial where severe treatment violations of stroke patients in several centers (totally independent of the study medication) explained the outcome rather than EPO 1 . In fact, careful subpopulation analysis of all dead patients revealed that several relevant baseline characteristics (i.e. data obtained before administration of any study medication) were significantly different between groups, always in disadvantage of the EPO group. Most importantly, upon inclusion (before any study drug application), intent-to-treat non-rtPA receiving EPO patients who died suffered from much severer strokes as compared to placebo patients (NIHSS day 1: 20.45.4 versus 13.3 p=0.003). This highly significant prediction of a worse outcome explains the twofold higher very early death rate in the EPO group ( http://www.epo-study.de/index_eng.html ). Unfortunately, the premature jumping to conclusions regarding the EPO stroke trial influenced also one of the TBI trials discussed here: The authors write that “there was concern by the FDA that the initial regimen of 3 daily doses of EPO would impose a greater risk of death. This concern resulted in a modified study design after approximately one-third of the patients had been enrolled in the trial. We did not detect an increased mortality rate with the EPO dose regimen, and the neurological outcome results were more promising than with the subsequent regimen. However, because the original dose regimen was stopped early, the numbers of cases are too small to draw any conclusions” 2 . Even though safety is undoubtedly an important issue, we have to reduce the incredible arrogance of dismissing any trial that shows ‘just signals’ of benefit. How can we expect more in an initial translational step? Being aware that there are no neuroprotective/neuroregenerative treatments out for conditions as frequent and detrimental as stroke or TBI, it would be time to work hard on any positive signals rather than ‘throw the baby out with the bathwater’. And clearly, both TBI trials 2 , 3 show such signals. Regarding stroke, not only the first EPO trial was obviously promising 4 , but also the retrospective analysis of patients from Hannover, the most efficiently recruiting center of the second EPO stroke trial 5 , made the beneficial effect of EPO in stroke again very obvious. Getting back to the opinion paper by Grasso and colleagues, longer treatment duration - over many weeks - may ultimately disclose the benefit of EPO also for TBI much stronger. Clinical studies on EPO in chronic brain diseases (schizophrenia, multiple sclerosis, major and bipolar depression) with extended treatment using high dose EPO over many weeks showed consistently advantageous effects on cognition, motor function, and even reduction of brain matter loss. All these findings were in absence of any appreciable side effects 6 - 11 . Of course, in all clinical studies, the quality of patient care including alert follow-up of individual patients at all times is mandatory 12 . Work on EPO indications outside the hematopoietic system has been difficult ever since. Large studies would be needed with adequate funding. Funding agencies do not provide enough money and direct requests for financing to industry. Industry has not been supportive due to expired EPO patents and many EPO biosimilar producers popping up, increasing the risk of ‘off-label-use’. Protection of the extremely lucrative anemia market includes avoiding the risk of additional side effects in new indications. EPO is a potent growth factor, not a miracle drug, and it is not a causal treatment or cure of brain diseases but it may improve their outcome. Even though doping is an unpleasant chapter in itself, it may be seen in the present context as one of the most convincing field studies ever regarding efficiency of EPO. Who would invest huge amounts of money over decades and risk to be caught by controllers and convicted if EPO were not extremely effective? Despite all frustrations and disappointments: We have to keep trying to understand how EPO acts in the brain and to ultimately exploit this knowledge for the benefit of our patients. Some novel and surprising insight, lending further support to the use of EPO for neuroprotective and neuroregenerative treatment of brain diseases, comes from recent studies showing that EPO increases the number of neurons and oligodendrocytes in the hippocampus by driving pre-existing precursors to differentiate 13 , or from work reporting EPO effects on synaptic plasticity 14 , 15 .
