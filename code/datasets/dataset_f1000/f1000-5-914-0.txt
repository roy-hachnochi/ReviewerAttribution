Karsen et al. presents a paper on the GenABEL project, which is really a software suite that contains 11 different packages. This is a large and impressive project that contains packages that are routinely used by researchers studying genetics. Indeed, this is reflected by more than 800 citations (according to google scholar) for the original GenABEL paper published in 2006. However, the 11 packages presented in this paper have been published previously in some shape or form, albeit (presumably) not in their most recent version. It is therefore tempting to question the novelty of the current paper that summarizes the GenABEL project and describes its user and developer community. Nevertheless, despite limited amount of novel scientific ideas or scientific results in the current manuscript, the authors have clearly put a lot of work into creating a very impressive interactive user and developer community. Furthermore, the paper is well written and it will undoubtedly be highly cited by future researchers. Lastly, to reiterate, the GenABEL is a very impressive large scale project that is heavily used by the community! I therefore think this is overall a nice publication that is certainly suitable for indexation. Minor comments: Abstract: “…developed withing..” - “…developed within..” I think it would be magnanimous if you acknowledged contributors as authors, e.g. under an umbrella term “The GenABEL community”. Leave citations counts out of manuscript, it looks awkward. They will also change. On p. 3 “polyphenotype”, I think multivariate would be a better word.
