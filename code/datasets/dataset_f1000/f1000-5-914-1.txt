This very well written article describes the GenABEL project for statistical genomics and high lightens the great success of the project, that in the years has lead to the creation of an actual scientific community that is spread in several countries worldwide. It is my understanding that the manuscript is aimed at reaching potential new users, but even to old users, unaware of the possible new tools included in the GenABEL project. The methodologies underlining the different tools and their potential applications are well described. Figure 2 describes the extent of the use of the GenABEL website/suite and Table 1 gives a glance of the tools available and on the new versions implemented. It is clear, from the texts, the effort that has taken place and is taking place aiming at bringing together top scientists, software developers and end users with the central goal of making statistical genomics work by openly developing and subsequently implementing statistical models into a user-friendly software. I retain this article, the tools and the information provided of extreme importance to the scientific community.
