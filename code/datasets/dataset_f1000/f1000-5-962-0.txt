The authors have developed an R package to visualise drug response data and make some basic calculations from experiments performed on the Incucyte ZOOM system. The funtions are easy to use and, interestingly, the useful IncucyteDRCSet object has been designed so that it can progressively integrate all data generated. Both the article and the R documentation are clearly explained. I would just make one suggestion on the manuscript. One of the features of the software is that it allows for normalization of the drug response by cell doubling time. A brief description of its relevance could be added.
