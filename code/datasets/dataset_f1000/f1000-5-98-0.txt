Botschuijver et al ., present a well written study that is methodologically sound. They assess the diurnal variation (4 timepoints) in visceral sensitivity in Long Evans (male) rats. They also assess the impact of water avoidance stress on visceral sensitivity in maternally separated (male) rats. I thought it was still worthwhile assessing if there was a diurnal variation in the MS rats. The lack of difference in the control rats should not have deterred them from doing so as there are many studies where changes/differences are seen in man that can never be replicated in rat. Also the authors might want to consider a different strain of rat as different strains may be more responsive to the CRD procedure. Fig 1D-no error bar on 04:00 hours?
