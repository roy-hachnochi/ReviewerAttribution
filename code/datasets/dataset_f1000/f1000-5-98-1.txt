This study is well done and the results are relatively straightforward. It would have been nice to have control responses on the VMR plots for reference so that one could gauge the magnitude of the response to colo-rectal distension, especially, as this was a novel distension protocol. From a methodological point of view their model is of interest because of its ability to allow the animals to move freely; comparisons with restrained animal results would be interesting.
