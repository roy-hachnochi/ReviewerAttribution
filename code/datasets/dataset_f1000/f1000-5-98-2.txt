This is a well conducted study using appropriate methodology providing a clear cut, if negative, data on diurnal variations in visceromotor response to colonic distension. The use of the maternally separated rat model provides validation of the model but raises the question of how diurnal variations may impact on stress induced hypersensitive VMR responses.
