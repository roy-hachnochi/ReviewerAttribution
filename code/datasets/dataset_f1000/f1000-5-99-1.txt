Dowling et al. reinforce the necessity of using more than one reference gene (RG) for qRT-PCR. They show that not only should more than one RG be used for normalisation but that a panel of RGs should be tested at an early stage to identify the most stable group. They demonstrate clearly how perilous choosing a single inappropriate RG can produce anomalous data. While this study was well designed and well performed there are some omissions that would enhance the report by facilitating repetition by others. It would be nice to see a table listing the primer sequences used, expected amplicon size and whether any particular primer pairs are intron spanning. This would be especially useful for the RGs. One other minor point. Presumably testing the integrity of RNA on a 1% agarose gel was under denaturing conditions (e.g. formaldehyde)?
