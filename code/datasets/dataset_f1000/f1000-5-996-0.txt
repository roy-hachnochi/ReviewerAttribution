I’ve looked at the paper and generally it reads well, and doesn’t seem to have many major problems methodologically, other than the fact that normally, for convergent and divergent validity, different scales that measure similar and dissimilar dimensions are used. What the authors refer to as divergent and convergent validity in their manuscript when they compare the Spanish and English versions. This is simply the concordance between the scores of English and Spanish instruments, which gives between 88%-100% concordance. This simply might reflect language proficiency effects. I would suggest, therefore that the authors choose some other term for this than convergent and divergent validity as this is incorrect.
