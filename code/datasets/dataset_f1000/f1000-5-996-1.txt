The paper "Spanish translation and preliminary validation of the Pain Treatment Satisfaction Scale" evaluates the validity of an already published pain treatment satisfaction scale, presented in a Spanish translation, on a Mexican population. After a careful double checked translation, the paper concludes that it is adequate for use in the pre-defined population. This paper is published as a Research note, and indeed, considering the number of items included in the score (39), it can hardly be proposed in clinical practice for repeated measures. If the quality of the translation has obviously been well controlled, it is not the case for the study population. No estimation of the number of subjects required to demonstrate the validity of the score has been made, despite the fact that the authors had comparators against which they could perform this estimation. 174 appears as a very low number for a population including both acute and chronic pain in a vast variety of patients. Indeed, if the translation is accurate, any difference in its validity will come mainly from socio-cultural factors in the population. The authors themselves are indeed conscious of this limitation, but they could have easily corrected it.
