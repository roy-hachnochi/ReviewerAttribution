I think the analysis is appropriate to examine the relative expression of the ATP1A1 and ATP1A2 among different breast cancer cells. The data analysis is standard and appropriate. One helpful thing is to validate the findings in other breast cancer expression datasets beyond this discovery dataset. Another relevant thing is whether the abnormal expression of these genes are associated with varying clinical outcomes.
