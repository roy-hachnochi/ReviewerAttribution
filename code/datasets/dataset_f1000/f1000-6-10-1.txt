Over the past years several papers were published concerning prognostic role of ATP1A1 expression in hepatocellular carcinoma, lung cancer, and esophageal cancer. The authors of the present study show that increased expression of ATP1A1 observed at all breast cancer phenotypes compared to normal tissue. I would like to note that the authors studied gene expression only, but did not appreciate the immunohistochemical (IHC) changes in the content of gene products. In the absence of data of the IHC expression of ATP1A1 , it is desirable to represent the differences in gene expression of ATP1A1 compared to referent genes for membrane transporters ( http://bmcmolbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2199-7-29 ). Given a sufficiently large number of patients included in the study, it is interesting to evaluate the prognostic and predictive value of these findings. But I can conclude that this article is interesting for medical oncologists and molecular biologists.
