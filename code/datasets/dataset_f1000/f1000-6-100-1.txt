Weirather and coworkers have much improved their manuscript. Specifically the rewritten version of the abstract has lowered the probability of misleading readers drastically. There are still three small issues that I’d ask the authors to take care of. Since they are straight-forward, I think the authors can take care of this without further review. So, I’ll say congratulations (from my side). Point 1 (I touched on that in my first review): Regarding Figure 5: Figure 5’s legend says “the Y axis shows the euclidean distance between real relative expression percentage and estimated relative expression percentage”. Therefore I expect one single value for each dataset (the euclidean distance taking into account multiple isoforms). But I see a boxplot (representing of course multiple values). Please clarify what the different data points in each boxplot are. The seven genes? Different subsamples of reads? Something else? I bet that adding one or two phrases to the legend of figure 5 will make it obvious, for readers who were not involved in the research. Point 2: The text and the legend of Figure 5 says “(1/68≈0.15)”, which is off by an order of magnitude. Point 3 (I touched on that in my first review): In the section about alternative splicing quantification (Figure 6), the 10% cutoff, that I asked the authors to use appears to have changed the results, so that they are consistent with my expectations. Thus, this cutoff should be mentioned for reproducibility (apologies if I overlooked it) and the two publications I mentioned in my previous review cited. Again, I do not think this requires re-review.
