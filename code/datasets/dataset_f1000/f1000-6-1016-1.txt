This opinion article by Totomoch-Serra et al .refers to the usefulness of directed sequencing of KCNJ2 by Sanger method for molecular diagnosis of Andersen-Tawil syndrome (ATS), a rare QT long syndrome associating ventricular arrhythmias, prominent U wave, dysmorphic facial or skeletal features and periodic paralysis. Sanger sequencing remains a useful method for directed sequencing of specific clinical syndromes with low genetic heterogeneity as ATS, especially in places where NGS is not accessible. In another hand, NGS is particularly useful and cost effective in inherited cardiomyopathies or channelopathies associated with high genetic heterogeneity (like dilated cardiomyopathy) or caused by mutations in larges genes (as RYR2 or TTN ) where Sanger sequencing remains a long and expensive process. NGS can also be useful at second level when directed molecular diagnosis with Sanger method is negative. In case where ATS is suspected, the approach described by the authors with directed sanger sequencing at first line followed by NGS in case of negative screening is a cost-effective approach for ATS molecular diagnosis. I would only suggest describing in more details the clinical features (including symptoms or family history) suggestive of ATS diagnosis that should direct to KCNJ2 sequencing at first line. Addition of a typical ECG could also be useful for the reader. Comparison of costs between NGS and Sanger sequencing could also be interesting.
