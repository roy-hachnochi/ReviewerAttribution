Review article on “MicroRNAs in the development and neoplasia of the mammary gland” submitted by M.K. Jena deals with how various microRNAs that regulate gene expression through post transcriptional gene silencing are important during development and progression as well as prognosis of cancer of the mammary gland in women. Though I understand it is a mini-review but it has not been written in a very focused and systematic way. There are huge numbers of publications in this field, particularly the role of mRNA in breast carcinogenesis. However, the author cites only 22 references in this article which is highly inadequate to justify the review on the role of miRNA in mammary gland development and carcinogenesis. Author must consult recently published literatures including a recent paper by Thakur et al. (2016) 1 and many of the references therein. There are a lot of sweeping comments have been made which indicates that the author has nothing much to do with cancer specialty. The comments in abstract say ‘miRs are responsible for breast cancer development’. It is not straight forward and clear that miRNA are responsible of breast cancer development. They may be associated with but not directly correlated with cancer development. Similar sweeping comments are many in the text and these need to be addressed properly and the manuscript needs to be elaborative and focused. The presentation of the review article should be made with proper sub-headings on mammary gland development, lactation and carcinogenesis. In summary, I suggest that the article can be considered for indexing only after satisfactory revision.
