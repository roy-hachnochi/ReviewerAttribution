With this review, the author provide a concise literature summary of microRNAs in the development and neoplasia of the mammary gland. For the most part the review is complete and informative. To further improve the quality, the author is advised to address these minor points: Exosomes secreted by different cells of mammary gland carry microRNA. It has been demonstrated that cancer-associated fibroblasts release exosomal microRNA that induce aggressiveness in breast cancer cells (e.g. Donnarumma et al. (2017) 1 ). At the same time, the microRNA present in the exosomes secreted by the cancer cells also play a critical role in the pathogenesis of breast cancer (e.g. Melo et al. (2014) 2 ). Hence, the authors might consider to include these information. The beginning sentence under “miRs in mammary gland” heading needs to be restructured. The presence of miRNA in milk and the role of miRNA in mammary development should be mentioned separately. In the abstract, the sentence “Further studies in this area will help us understand ……” should be “Further studies in this area will help us to understand ……”).
