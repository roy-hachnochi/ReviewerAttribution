I thank the authors for incorporating my suggestions into their work; however, the figures in the paper should be updated to reflect the changes in the shiny app, which were made in response to comment 2 from my initial review: "2. The numeric output of the GAC shiny app is often unformatted R output. For example, on the Super PC Binary Outcome tab below the box plots. It would be better to provide formatted results (e.g. using knitr::kable). Also, the p-values (and other numeric outputs) should likely be rounded to a number of significant digits that conveys the precision of the values."
