The authors did a nice job to develop a web tool called GAC, which is used to explore the association between clinical and genomic data. Essentially, GAC is a GUI of R package ‘superpc’. They not only provided a handy web tool but also published the source code to allow researchers to do some further expansion according to their own specific study objects. The manuscript is well written, but I have some comments: Since the example data is from TCGA and this work aims to facilitate clinicians and researchers with limited programming skills, it is necessary to cite some literature to tell readers how to retrieve and process the TCGA Data, such as TCGA-Assembler (Nature methods, 2014), and it would be better if such tools can be embedded into GAC. The authors stated that ‘superpc' is unable to address the limitation about clinical association based on a binary outcome in the Introduction. But in the Methods section, it said ‘SuperPC for binary outcome follows the same analysis workflow as the other two outcomes’. It confuses me and please explain the details. I find that the calculation will be automatically triggered when changes any one option in the sidebar. That is not an user-friendly experience, especially it happens in the ’Super PC Binary Outcome’ module which can not return the result immediately. Think about that if the users want to change two default options, they have to adjust the first one, wait a few seconds and then adjust the second option, which is not efficient. So adding a ‘submit’ button to trigger the calculation is a better way. Build a user manual page to explain the details of each function and use an example to demonstrate the usage.
