This is an interesting article presenting a process for implementing the SWC/DC model of instructor training to a large, pan-European research community. One statement should be corrected. The description of DC says that "DC designs the workshops to fit into needs of particular domains (e.g. life sciences, social sciences, digital humanities and library carpentries, etc.)." This is inaccurate as DC materials do not currently exist for digital humanities or social sciences (although social sciences materials are in progress and plans for digital humanities curricula are in discussions). Additionally, library materials are managed under Library Carpentry as an independent organization.
