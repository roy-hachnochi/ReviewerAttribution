The bioinformatics study here has reported 215 genes that are putatively involved in terpenoid biosynthesis in Cannabis sativa using available genome and transcriptome resources. This knowledge would predictably accelerate the terpenoid investigations in this specific species, or even broader. The research approaches are clear and sound. The writing is generally logical and organized. So I would recommend the publication of this work as a data note. I would suggest the author to make the following minor changes. 1. The author might wish to clarify throughout the text as to the original “transcriptome” (or “genome”) resources they have used for initial study. For instance, adding the specific link of that file name. 2. In the caption of figure 3, the author claimed “five gene clusters were defined” while in the text, it was “four gene clusters”, the author needs to correct this. Also, it is confused here that some genes clustered are expressed in “Finola” because from the previous text in “introduction” “para 3”, it was said the study was conducted “within the transcripts of the canSat3 reference transcriptome of Cannabis sativa21”. Please clarify this. 3. The 215 gene candidates for terpenoids have been further predicted to express distinctively in tissues and developmental stages. While it is not easy to specifically check the expression pattern of each gene from the currently provided data. It would be great if possible that the author could add this piece of information, which would be valuable for future characterization of these genes. An example study showing the expression pattern of terpene genes would be found in the paper by Wang, et al. 2016 1 .
