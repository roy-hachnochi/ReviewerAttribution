In the present work, 23,630 transcripts were scanned for evolutionarily conserved protein domains and annotated using Gene Ontology analysis. A total of 215 evolutionarily conserved genes encoding enzymes presumably involved in terpenoid metabolism are described on the basis of Gene Expression profiles of NCBI GEO repository. The identification of candidate genes on terpenoid metabolism in Cannabis sativa will ease the future investigations on terpenoid metabolism pathways. It is a small piece of work on bioinformatics analysis of transcripts which present useful information to the plant researcher. Hence, the article can be recommended to be published as a Data Note. I suggest the author make a minor change in the title to be " In silico discovery of terpenoid metabolism associated transcripts in Cannabis sativa" and that the discussion, rather than describing general things, should be modified to discuss the findings in the work.
