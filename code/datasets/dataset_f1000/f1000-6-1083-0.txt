The authors have significantly improved this paper, and addressed all our previous issues and concerns. The paper is now an excellent entry point into the fast-moving and therefore sometimes confusing world of nanopore data analysis. We have detected no new issues that need further amendment. There are of course many further discussion points possible on the future of nanopore sequencing, but the review nicely succeeds in capturing the current state-of-the-art.
