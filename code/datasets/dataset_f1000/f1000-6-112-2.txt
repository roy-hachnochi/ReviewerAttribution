I support the main idea of the article to promote individualized dose finding for toxic drugs. The methodological framework of reinforcement learning is an interesting and promising alternative to the current practice of population based maximum tolerated dose approach (MTD). The following points need to be stressed and/or addressed in the paper: The immediate toxic response must be reliably measurable for the reinforcement learning to work; long term toxicity is as far as I have understood is not included in the current framework. This needs to be addressed, in particular in light of new immune-oncology and targeted therapies where the toxic response is not immediately observable. The time to achieve optimal dosing scheme according to the dose finding algorithm is also of a key importance and must be much shorter than expected survival of the patient. For the practical implementation of the approach, hart boundaries on overshooting must be implemented. This will likely influence the time to optimal dosing for each patient. The title and the conclusions are too strong in my view and need revision. This approach is very promising and I myself am also very interested in its application, but in the abstract and discussion section it needs to be clear that key practical questions are still to be addressed. Strong statements like: ‘DTAT should supersede MTD’ should be removed from the title and abstract and replaced by ‘DTAT is an alternative to current practice’ or ‘Could be a better alternative to current practice for drugs with narrow therapeutic window’ etc.
