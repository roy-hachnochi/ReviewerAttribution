This is a well-written review article and highlights an intervention for a very important public health problem - maternal deaths in low and middle income countries. The article is a very fine contribution to the literature. It could be further strengthened by providing specific recommendations on the way forward regarding maternal death notification, review and response in Bangladesh based on findings from other countries - perhaps, these recommendations could be presented in a table highlighting identified challenges and potential solutions. Similarly, a box or panel highlighting the essential components of the perinatal and maternal death review system in Bangladesh will also be useful for readers. The abstract could be rewritten as a summary of the literature review (highlighting the reason for the literature review, and briefly summarizing each segment of the paper). The abstract and paper could use further editing for typos.
