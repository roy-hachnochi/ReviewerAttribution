To perform their research, the authors have used recognized approaches for the analysis of free and complexed PSA, androgens, estrogens and progesterone in sera of elite athletes and control women. This manuscript is scientifically sound, very well written and informative. A comment on the lack of correlation between cPSA or fPSA and progesterone would be desirable since other authors have shown that serum PSA fluctuates with the menstrual cycle.
