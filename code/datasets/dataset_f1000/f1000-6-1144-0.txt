I recommend adding text to the Discussion to include supporting data for the conclusion that TLR4, TLR2, and their related signaling components shown in Figure 1 are localized primarily to microglia, secondarily to vascular endothelia, and least in neurons. There are several sources of supporting data that should be described and cited. First, and the most expansive, is the RNA-Seq database available at the Barres Lab Stanford RNA-Seq Transcriptome website at https://web.stanford.edu/group/barres_lab/brain_rnaseq.html . The database is derived from the work published by Zhang et al. , 2014 (ref 25). The interactive site provides gene expression levels of most genes of interest, including the TLRs and all the signaling components shown in Figure 1. In agreement with the data in the McCarthy study, Tlr4 mRNA expression levels, provided in values of fragments per kilobase of exon per million reads mapped (FPKM), are highest in microglia (3), second in endothelia (2.3), and very low in all other cell types (~ 0.3-0.4 on astrocytes and OPCs, and ~ 0.1 on neurons). Tlr2 mRNA is abundantly and almost exclusively expressed in microglia (150). All of the downstream co-factors and pathways are predominantly expressed in microglia, with the exception of the side-chain pathway via TRAF3 and IRF3, which is expressed in all the cell types. The cytokine mRNAs measured by McCarthy, and others such as IL-1b and TNFα, are almost exclusively expressed in microglia. Finally, for TLR3, the FPKM values are astrocytes (13), endothelia (9), microglia (2.5), and neurons ( 1.0). Next, the authors should note that earlier in situ hybridization studies showed Tlr4 mRNA expressed in a variety of blood-brain barrier cell types including choroid plexus epithelial cells, meningeal cells, vascular endothelial cells (Laflamme and Rivest, 2001, DOI: 10.1096/fj.00-0339com ; Chakravarty and Herkenham, 2005, DOI: 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.4268-04.2005 ), and within the brain, microglial cells (Chakravarty, 2005). Supporting the microglial localization, a recent article used the very sensitive and specific RNAscope (ACD) colorimetric methodology to co-localize Tlr4 mRNA and Iba1 mRNA (Kashima, 2017, DOI: 10.1073/pnas.1705974114 ) and showed that in the nucleus accumbens, the microglia-TLR4 double-labeled population was the majority (~80%) of all Tlr4 mRNA-positive cells. Finally, the early in situ hybridization autoradiographic work also showed that the TLR4 mRNA expression level was downregulated by LPS at 3 h post-injection (Laflamme and Rivest, 2001), in support of McCarthy’s findings with qPCR. A TLR4-bearing cell population overlooked by McCarthy et al. in terms of LPS responsiveness is endothelial cells, which strongly express Tlr4 mRNA. These cells are the major first responders to LPS (Serrats, 2010, DOI: 10.1016/j.neuron.2009.11.032 ). It is not clear whether this population survived the separation procedure used by McCarthy. The LPS stimulation data in the report are supported by other published data, but the experiment was not performed optimally because the 24-h survival time selected was too long. There is an early response to LPS (0.5–2 h) that is chiefly mediated by cells at the blood-brain barrier, and later responses, indicated by induction of IkB and cytokine mRNAs within microglia (Quan, 1997, PMID: 9380746; Quan, 1998 , PMID: 10378870) might be prostaglandin- or cytokine-mediated (Serrats, 2010). Note that LPS does not significantly cross the blood brain barrier. At 12 h post-LPS, most responses have died down, and at 24 h, the initial LPS-mediated effects have dropped to near zero (Quan, 1998; Serrats, 2010). Nevertheless, the inclusion of LPS data raises another important observation that should be addressed—neurons are unresponsive to LPS. We reported that primary cultured mouse cortical and hippocampal neurons do not show activation of NF-kB pathways by LPS, indicating that they do not possess functional TLR4 (Listwak, 2013, DOI: 10.1016/j.neuroscience.2013.07.013 ). Microglia, in contrast, have a massive response to LPS. McCarthy et al. importantly address the lack of specificity of antibodies. That conclusion is also supported by our work on the NF-kB pathways. We attacked that problem in our study showing that many of the published antibodies for the NF-kB subunits p65 and p50 and their activated (phosphorylated) forms were nonspecific (Herkenham, 2011, DOI: 10.1186/1742-2094-8-141 ). The use of these antibodies had supported the claim in the literature that NF-kB is active in neurons. Thus, we heartily agree that antibodies are not specific in many studies of TLR pathways, especially for immunohistochemistry and especially when epitope levels are low. We endorse the increased demand for rigor in use of antibodies imposed by many journals and by the NIH grant review process. It would be helpful if McCarthy could mention these new demands for rigor, which will raise awareness of the burdens caused by improper antibody use. My main objection to McCarthy study is the poor quality of their in situ hybridization based on use of locked nucleic acid (LNA) probes and digoxygenin detection. I would recommend that future work be done with the new highly sensitive and selective probes from ViewRNA (Affymetrix) or RNAscope (ACD).
