Buonarati et al. have performed a very rigorous biochemical analysis using 6 different antibodies and conditional knockout (KO) mice controls to convincingly demonstrate that the major forms of the L-channel Ca V 1.2 pore forming subunit present in mouse and rat brain are full-length channels of ~250 kDa and C-terminally truncated channels of ~210 kDa. Importantly, the authors' exhaustive analysis using immunoblotting of whole cell extracts as well as immunoprecipitation or surface biotinylation followed by immunoblotting provides no evidence for Ca V 1.2 mid-channel cleavage that would produce ~150 kDa and ~90 kDa bands as reported in Michailidis et al. , 2014 1 . In particular, by employing neuron-specific Ca V 1.2 conditional KO mice as controls in conjunction with multiple antibodies spanning the N- to C-terminal regions of Ca V 1.2, Buonarati et al. demonstrate that the previously reported ~150 kDa and ~90 kDa bands are most likely protein products unrelated to Ca V 1.2 that cross-react with some but not all Ca V 1.2 antibodies. Overall, this study is extremely well executed and thoughtfully discussed to provide a very valuable addition to the L-channel literature. I only have one minor question/comment for the authors. The authors cite previous publications from the Hosey and Catterall groups showing that the ~40 kDa distal C-terminal fragment produced by cleavage of Ca V 1.2 remains associated with the ~210 kDa fragment to regulate channel function (Fuller et al. , 2010 2 ; Gao et al. , 2001 3 ; Hulme et al. , 2006b 4 ). However, these prior studies were focused on Ca V 1.2 cleavage in muscle cells and primarily relied on reconstitution of the association between the 40 kDa distal C-terminal fragment and the ~210 kDa body of the channel by heterologous expression. Thus, it would be interesting if the authors could determine if the ~40 kDA distal C-terminal fragment of Ca V 1.2 is also present in mouse and rat brain and whether this fragment can co-immunoprecipitate with the ~210 kDa fragment. Such additional information could be valuable in understanding the differences in PKA regulation of Ca V 1.2 channels through phosphorylation at S1928 in the distal C-terminus versus S1700 in the proximal C-terminus recently reported by the authors for neurons ( Qian et al. , 2017 5 ) compared to earlier work by others for cardiac myocytes (Fuller et al. , 2010 2 ; Moosmang et al. , 2005 6 ).
