This study addresses an important topic - the gender balance at the highest levels of journal editorial leadership. There data collection and analyses are straightforward and technically sound. While there is value in documenting the gender ratio of editors-in-chief, however, the study doesn't place these results in a greater context. This is both surprising and disappointing given the substantial research on the topic (and very little of which is cited). Why focus on environmental biology? How do these results compare with those from other fields? Why is the observed gender imbalance a problem and what can be done to remedy it? Without addressing these questions I would encourage the authors to move beyond simply presenting the data to interpreting and contextualizing it. This will greatly increase the impact of their substantial effort.
