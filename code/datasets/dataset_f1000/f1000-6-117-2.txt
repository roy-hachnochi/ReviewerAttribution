This article describes an educational module that incorporates the utilization of sophisticated optogenetic techniques but employs fairly low-cost, easily obtainable subjects and apparatus. This article makes the exercises described very accessible to institutions of almost every size and budget. Absolutely stunning details are provided from fly feeding, care, and sexing to constructing the apparatus and Arduino codes. These details not only should allow reconstruction of the experience at various high schools, colleges, and universities but also should allow students and instructors to go further and design their own questions and experiments. Supplementary materials, including PowerPoint slides and a pre/post evaluation instrument, are provided for instructors to use. No data from this pre/post instrument are presented in the article, however, which is the articleâ€™s biggest weakness. Rather, the pedagogical data provided consist of a series of qualitative statements, mostly from high school instructors. The introduction needs to be re-written. It should more explicitly relate issues raised about the development of sensory and motor systems to the Drosophila literature rather than to the mammalian literature. Stylistic alterations, such as avoiding passive voice and multiple clauses, would render it more readable and intelligible. Similarly, the first sentence in the discussion seems inappropriate, considering the actual scope of the model. Some figures need to be re-worked to be more informative. The rolling behavior data displayed (Figure 4) would make a more powerful point if there was some comparison with different lighting conditions or comparing different lines of flies with different constructs. Similarly, Figure 7 would make its point more forcefully if two conditions were displayed on a single graph, say with and without light exposure, such as in Figures 8 and 12.
