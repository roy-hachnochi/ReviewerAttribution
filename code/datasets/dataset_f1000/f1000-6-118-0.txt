Congrats to this global set of young authors from the Wonca circle! Really good application of research method to an important issues. There are some suggestions that would help the authors. 1. The authors say “ present authors hypothesize that SoMe posts are written at lower grade levels than traditional medical sources, improving patient health literacy”. The research method, results, and discussion do not reflect that with no clarity as to what ‘traditional medical sources” are compared with. Reference to previous studies under discussion is referenced to the MedlinePlus webpage on “How to write…” with no clear evidence of ‘traditional medical sources’ readability scores with the FKRF. Printed material and websites would have been a useful comparator vs. consent forms. The comparison of different hashtags and statistical tests seem irrelevant/tangential to the hypothesis or enquiry. 2. The choice of Twitter and assumptions about it ie. small chunks of text making it more accessible are contradicted later when the Twitter limitations of complex readability factor are later related due to small chunks. It would have been useful to relate to global use of SoMe platforms, by population and possibly patients. 3. The method of using the FKRF is not clearly articulated and seems difficult to relate to Table 2 readability score. 4. The conclusion "The sample studied identifies that health care SoMe posts allow for better patient health literacy than traditional medical sources.” seems largely unsupported. Keep it up.
