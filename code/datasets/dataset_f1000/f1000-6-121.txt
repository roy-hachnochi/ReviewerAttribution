            <meta name="dc.description" content="Idiopathic nephrotic syndrome (INS) is one of the most common glomerular diseases in children and adults, and the central event is podocyte injury. INS is a heterogeneous disease, and treatment is largely empirical and in many cases unsuccessful, and steroids are the initial mainstay of therapy. Close to 70% of children with INS have some response to steroids and are labelled as steroid-&lsquo;sensitive&rsquo;, and the rest as steroid-&lsquo;resistant&rsquo; (also termed focal segmental glomerulosclerosis), and single-gene mutations underlie a large proportion of the latter group. The burden of morbidity is enormous, both to patients with lifelong chronic disease and to health services, particularly in managing dialysis and transplantation. The target cell of nephrotic syndrome is the glomerular podocyte, and podocyte biology research has exploded over the last 15 years. Major advances in genetic and biological understanding now put clinicians and researchers at the threshold of a major reclassification of the disease and testing of targeted therapies both identified and novel. That potential is based on complete genetic analysis, deep clinical phenotyping, and the introduction of mechanism-derived biomarkers into clinical practice. INS can now be split off into those with a single-gene defect, of which currently at least 53 genes are known to be causative, and the others. Of the others, the majority are likely to be immune-mediated and caused by the presence of a still-unknown circulating factor or factors, and whether there is a third (or more) mechanistic group or groups remains to be discovered. Treatment is therefore now being refined towards separating out the monogenic cases to minimise immunosuppression and further understanding how best to stratify and appropriately direct immunosuppressive treatments within the immune group. Therapies directed specifically towards the target cell, the podocyte, are in their infancy but hold considerable promise for the near future.">

  "description": "Idiopathic nephrotic syndrome (INS) is one of the most common glomerular diseases in children and adults, and the central event is podocyte injury. INS is a heterogeneous disease, and treatment is largely empirical and in many cases unsuccessful, and steroids are the initial mainstay of therapy. Close to 70% of children with INS have some response to steroids and are labelled as steroid-&lsquo;sensitive&rsquo;, and the rest as steroid-&lsquo;resistant&rsquo; (also termed focal segmental glomerulosclerosis), and single-gene mutations underlie a large proportion of the latter group. The burden of morbidity is enormous, both to patients with lifelong chronic disease and to health services, particularly in managing dialysis and transplantation. The target cell of nephrotic syndrome is the glomerular podocyte, and podocyte biology research has exploded over the last 15 years. Major advances in genetic and biological understanding now put clinicians and researchers at the threshold of a major reclassification of the disease and testing of targeted therapies both identified and novel. That potential is based on complete genetic analysis, deep clinical phenotyping, and the introduction of mechanism-derived biomarkers into clinical practice. INS can now be split off into those with a single-gene defect, of which currently at least 53 genes are known to be causative, and the others. Of the others, the majority are likely to be immune-mediated and caused by the presence of a still-unknown circulating factor or factors, and whether there is a third (or more) mechanistic group or groups remains to be discovered. Treatment is therefore now being refined towards separating out the monogenic cases to minimise immunosuppression and further understanding how best to stratify and appropriately direct immunosuppressive treatments within the immune group. Therapies directed specifically towards the target cell, the podocyte, are in their infancy but hold considerable promise for the near future."

INS is a heterogeneous disease, and treatment is largely empirical and in many cases unsuccessful, and steroids are the initial mainstay of therapy. Close to 70% of children with INS have some response to steroids and are labelled as steroid-‘sensitive’, and the rest as steroid-‘resistant’ (also termed focal segmental glomerulosclerosis), and single-gene mutations underlie a large proportion of the latter group. The burden of morbidity is enormous, both to patients with lifelong chronic disease and to health services, particularly in managing dialysis and transplantation. The target cell of nephrotic syndrome is the glomerular podocyte, and podocyte biology research has exploded over the last 15 years. Major advances in genetic and biological understanding now put clinicians and researchers at the threshold of a major reclassification of the disease and testing of targeted therapies both identified and novel. That potential is based on complete genetic analysis, deep clinical phenotyping, and the introduction of mechanism-derived biomarkers into clinical practice. INS can now be split off into those with a single-gene defect, of which currently at least 53 genes are known to be causative, and the others. Of the others, the majority are likely to be immune-mediated and caused by the presence of a still-unknown circulating factor or factors, and whether there is a third (or more) mechanistic group or groups remains to be discovered. Treatment is therefore now being refined towards separating out the monogenic cases to minimise immunosuppression and further understanding how best to stratify and appropriately direct immunosuppressive treatments within the immune group. Therapies directed specifically towards the target cell, the podocyte, are in their infancy but hold considerable promise for the near future. </div> <div class=abstract-for-mobile> <div class="margin-top-30 padding-bottom-30 research-layout is-centered"> <button class="primary orange-text white-bg bigger-text abstract-expand-button-mobile with-border show" style="display: none;"> READ ALL <span class="f1r-icon icon-14_more_small orange vmiddle big"></span> </button> <button class="primary orange-text white-bg bigger-text abstract-expand-button-mobile with-border hide"> READ LESS <span class="f1r-icon icon-10_less_small orange vmiddle big"></span> </button> </div> </div> </div> <div class=clearfix></div> <div class="article-context no-divider"> <div class="article-abstract article-page-general-text-mobile research-layout generated-article-body"> <h2 class=main-title>Keywords</h2> <p class="u-mb--0 u-pb--2"> idiopathic nephrotic syndrome, minimal change nephrotic syndrome, MCNS, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, FSGS, SRNS </p> </div> </div> <div class=article-information> <span class="info-separation padding-bottom"> <div id=corresponding-author-icon class="email-icon float-left"> <span class="f1r-icon icon-6_email orange"></span> <div id=corresponding-author-window class="margin-top-20 popup-window-wrapper is-hidden"> <div class="popup-window corresponding-authors-popup"> <div class=corresponding-author-container> <div class="popup-window-title small">Corresponding Author(s)</div> <div class=authors> Moin Saleem (<a href="mailto:M.Saleem@bristol.ac.uk">M.Saleem@bristol.ac.uk</a>) </div> </div> <div class="margin-top margin-bottom float-left"> <button id=close-popup-window class=general-white-orange-button>Close</button> </div> </div> </div> </div> <span class="icon-text float-left" data-test-id=box-corresponding-author> <b>Corresponding author:</b> Moin Saleem </span> <div class=clearfix></div> </span> <span class="info-separation padding-bottom competing-interests-display"> <span class=competing-interests-title>Competing interests:</span> The authors declare that they have no competing interests. </span> <div class="info-separation padding-bottom grant-information-display"> <span class=grant-information-title>Grant information:</span> The author(s) declared that no grants were involved in supporting this work. </div> <span class="f1r-article-desk info-separation padding-bottom"> <span class="copywrite-icon float-left"> <span class="f1r-icon icon-100_open_access"></span> </span> <span class="icon-text float-left" data-test-id=box-copyright-text> <b>Copyright:</b>&nbsp; © 2017 Bierzynska A and Saleem M.

This highly specialised property is achieved by the glomerular filtration barrier (GFB), comprising endothelial cells, a unique basement membrane, and podocytes on the urinary side.</p><p class="" id=d4697e161>Damage to the GFB can come from many potential sources, including genetic defects (primarily affecting podocytes), paracrine events (for example, affecting endothelial-podocyte cross-talk or from adjacent mesangial cells), or systemic circulating insults. The last of these can take many forms, including circulating immune complexes, metabolic disturbances (most commonly, diabetes), infections, toxins (for example, shiga toxin in haemolytic uraemic syndrome) and drugs.</p><p class="" id=d4697e164>The clinical manifestation is of oedema, low serum albumin, and massive proteinuria. This leads to numerous consequences, related to circulatory/dynamic effects, and loss of essential circulating proteins.</p><p class="" id=d4697e167>Idiopathic, or primary, nephrotic syndrome is often used to describe the group of patients for whom no specific cause has been identified, and the histology is relatively non-specific. These patients will usually receive immunosuppression without knowledge of the mechanism and be categorised according to response. So the challenge is to understand and categorise the underlying injury at a molecular level and therefore adapt treatments according to the likely mechanism.</p></div><div id=article1-body class=generated-article-body><h2 class=main-title id=d4697e173>Idiopathic nephrotic syndrome current classification</h2><p class="" id=d4697e176>Current classification of idiopathic nephrotic syndrome (INS) is based on observational characteristics. This can be according to response to steroids, which is the usual first-line response, or according to light microscopy patterns of injury on renal biopsy. The commonest biopsy finding, particularly in children, is of ‘minimal change’ nephrotic syndrome (MCNS). This means that light microscopy is entirely normal, importantly not even showing any signs of immune infiltration or upregulation of immune markers. Pathology is seen only at the level of electron microscopy, where effacement or flattening of podocyte foot processes is the characteristic finding in any patient with nephrosis. The next most common biopsy finding (between 10% and 20% of patients) is of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), a description of chronic, fibrotic damage in the glomerulus. Response to therapy often (but not always) correlates with these biopsy findings, in that most patients with MCNS will be sensitive to steroids and most with FSGS will be resistant. However, there are many shades in between these phenotypes, and patients frequently become relapsing, steroid-dependent, calcineurin-responsive, and so on. This reflects our lack of knowledge of the underlying mechanisms and the need for a different approach to this disease.</p></div><div id=article1-body class=generated-article-body><h2 class=main-title id=d4697e182>Genetics</h2><p class="" id=d4697e185>The most concrete advance in establishing the underlying mechanistic cause of INS in recent years has been the discovery that a substantial proportion of patients with steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome (SRNS) have a single-gene mutation causing their disease (<a href="#T1">Table 1</a>). To date, at least 53 different genes have been implicated<sup><a href="#ref-1">1</a></sup>, almost all causing structural or functional defects in the podocyte. Some mutations cause isolated kidney disease, others are part of a syndromic condition. Most are autosomal-recessive, though a few present as X-linked or autosomal-dominant, the latter usually presenting later in life. Some genes have been linked with steroid or cyclosporine sensitivity, such as <i>EMP2</i><sup><a href="#ref-2">2</a></sup> or <i>KANK</i> genes<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a></sup>, though the data are still sporadic and need consistent verification in other pedigrees.</p><div class="table-wrap panel clearfix"><a name=T1 class=n-a></a><div class=caption><h3>Table 1.

The evidence for this remains circumstantial, and the most compelling clinical scenario is that of post-transplant recurrence of disease<sup><a href="#ref-8">8</a></sup>. This is a situation where patients with SRNS who eventually reach established renal failure are then transplanted. Between 30% and 50% of patients suffer from rapid (most commonly, hours or days post-transplant) recurrence of massive proteinuria, and biopsy of the new kidney shows classic foot process effacement. This is presumed to be due to a circulating factor, and a fascinating recent case report described a patient with early recurrence, whose newly transplanted kidney was then removed and re-transplanted into a recipient without SRNS, and the kidney recovered completely<sup><a href="#ref-9">9</a></sup>. It is not known where the circulating factor or factors originate, but the fact that immunosuppression is often effective, and relapses are often triggered by viral infections, points to the immune system (<a href="#T2">Table 2</a>). Both T cells and B cells have been implicated<sup><a href="#ref-10">10</a></sup>; for example, anti-CD20 B cell-depleting monoclonal antibodies are highly effective in some patients<sup><a href="#ref-11">11</a></sup>, and a T helper 17/regulatory T (Th17/Treg) cell imbalance has been described in minimal change disease<sup><a href="#ref-12">12</a></sup>. Another clue to a circulating factor pathogenesis in steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome, where the biopsy shows minimal change, is the lack of immune cell infiltration or activation within the glomerulus itself.</p><div class="table-wrap panel clearfix"><a name=T2 class=n-a></a><div class=caption><h3>Table 2.

There are no indications at present, either laboratory or clinical, that help to resolve this question, though we have made progress in some areas of prediction of CFD.</p></div><div id=article1-body class=generated-article-body><h2 class=main-title id=d4697e1094>Clinical biomarkers</h2><p class="" id=d4697e1097>There have been no consistent clinical cues to either whether a patient with nephrotic syndrome has the risk of becoming steroid-resistant in the future or whether they will suffer recurrence post-transplant. There are weak clinical associations with recurrence (for example, age at onset of disease<sup><a href="#ref-13">13</a>,<a href="#ref-14">14</a></sup>, race<sup><a href="#ref-15">15</a></sup>, serum albumin at diagnosis<sup><a href="#ref-13">13</a></sup> or time to first dialysis/transplant<sup><a href="#ref-13">13</a>,<a href="#ref-15">15</a>,<a href="#ref-16">16</a></sup>). Interestingly, the last two features may point to the possibility that CFD has a more aggressive presentation and natural course, compared with the monogenic or ‘other’ groups. To address the question of whether there are clinical features that pertain to CFD, we hypothesised that patients with the archetypal CFD, those with post-transplant recurrence, would have distinct early clinical features regarding their initial response to immunosuppression. If a patient has initial steroid sensitivity (otherwise described as secondary steroid resistance), they are likely to have an immune-mediated circulating factor causing their underlying disease and therefore high risk of recurrence. On retrospective review of 150 transplanted patients with SRNS, we found that 93% of patients with initial steroid sensitivity recurred post-transplant (odds ratio = 30, <i>P</i> &lt;0.0001), making this by far the strongest clinical biomarker for recurrent disease yet found<sup><a href="#ref-17">17</a></sup>.</p></div><div id=article1-body class=generated-article-body><h2 class=main-title id=d4697e1137>Laboratory biomarkers</h2><p class="" id=d4697e1140>Over many decades, researchers have searched for the elusive circulating factor or factors, but there has been no consistent answer to date<sup><a href="#ref-18">18</a></sup>. Clearly, if the factor were identified, this would be the ideal biomarker to both diagnose and monitor disease activity. There are other rational ways to approach biomarker discovery, based on the fact that circulating blood from patients with active disease is likely to carry the active factor and that we know the most likely target cell of such a factor, the podocyte. Therefore, an approach of stimulating human podocytes <i>in vitro</i> with plasma or serum from disease has been used by ourselves and others, and podocyte damage has been assayed in various ways. For example, we have shown that plasma exchange fluid from patients being treated for post-transplant recurrence causes relocalisation of key podocyte slit diaphragm proteins<sup><a href="#ref-19">19</a></sup> and abnormal signalling and cell motility<sup><a href="#ref-20">20</a></sup>. Torban <i>et al</i>. showed a tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα) pathway-dependent change in podocyte cytoskeletal changes<sup><a href="#ref-21">21</a></sup> and also changes in podocyte focal adhesion complexes<sup><a href="#ref-22">22</a></sup>.

There are studies that support a direct effect of some immunosuppressive drugs on the podocyte<sup><a href="#ref-23">23</a>–<a href="#ref-27">27</a></sup>, though the majority of clinical evidence points to efficacy being achieved via effects on the immune system.</p><p class="" id=d4697e1186>Some newer therapies have been proposed on the basis of direct targeting of either the immune system or podocyte signalling pathways. The most prominent of these are the use of anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies<sup><a href="#ref-28">28</a></sup>, which deplete B cells, and anti-B7-1 monoclonal antibody therapy<sup><a href="#ref-29">29</a></sup>. The latter has been proposed following the observation that in certain experimental and human glomerular diseases the T-cell co-stimulatory molecule B7-1 has been noted to be upregulated on podocytes<sup><a href="#ref-30">30</a></sup>.
