The above research is a very relevant topic of concern as the authors have truly highlighted the advantages of prophylactic antibiotics in caesarean sections in the recent age. Prophylactic antibiotics have reduced the complications of post-operative wound infection, maternal infections, endometritis and pyrexia in caesarean delivery. In this study various drugs as prophylaxis with different durations have been used. But there is no comparative study of prophylactic drug regimes and drug durations for which these drugs were used in the hospital. The correct prophylactic regime accepted world wide is a single second generation cephalosporin ( cefazoline) used within 30 minutes to one hour prior to surgery which is helpful in avoiding postoperative infections. The regimes used in the above study appear to be therapeutic rather than prophylactic. A comparative study highlighting the advantages versus disadvantages of the overuse of the various multiple drug regimes in post operative follow up of these cases would improve the study. Patients who had postoperative complications if any has not been noted in the results, thereby making it an incomplete study. Recommendations = 1.The study needs to be elaborated further. 2.Comparative study of all the drug regimes need to be done. 3. Complications observed in study group should be noted. 4. Graphic representation in the form of a table should be added after comparison of all regimes.
