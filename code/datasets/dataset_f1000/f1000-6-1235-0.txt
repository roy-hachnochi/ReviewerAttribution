This paper is well written and reports findings of an interesting pilot study with implications to clinical practice. Some revisions are suggested below: Introduction: A clear rationale for the study was described which resulted in a clear aim. I would remove the last sentence of the introduction regarding the aim to use the creatine method of assessing whole body muscle mass. This sentence detracts from the main study aim and the actual purpose of the study. Methods: The exercise intervention and the outcome measurements are described clearly and could be replicated. More information should be included about the participants and how they were recruited. Did the radio advertisement include specific information about who should respond? Were strict inclusion and exclusion criteria applied? The reader needs this information to fully interpret the results. In particular, participants' activity levels preceding the study will impact the reader's interpretation of the adherence rate and changes in all the outcome variables. Results: No revisions suggested. Discussion: A large part of your rationale for home based exercise was greater adherence to the exercise regime and this was measured in the study. As such, a paragraph is required in the discussion section comparing adherence in the current study with those of other studies using home, gym or hospital based training programs. The limitations paragraph should acknowledge that this study did not use a control group for comparison and the implications of this on drawing strong conclusions.
