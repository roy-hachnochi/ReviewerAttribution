The authors have investigated the effects of HBET on muscle function. This is an important advance as resistance exercise is known to be of benefit to health and yet (due to reasons mentioned in the paper) it is performed by very few people. I have a few comments on this but overall the manuscript is well written and the data clearly presented. 1) I would like to see a bit more detail on exactly how these exercise were integrated into daily life, e.g. what did you tell the participants to do exactly. 2) The authors mention that it may be that the changes in whole body muscle mass may have been below the detection level of the d3-creatine method - could the authors elaborate and provide details. 3) May be worth citing https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24903908 1 in the discussion about the lack of change in grip strength. 4) I think it would be useful to highlight in the discussion (as you mentioned briefly when discussing the SPPBT results) that these participants were not that old and were very healthy.
