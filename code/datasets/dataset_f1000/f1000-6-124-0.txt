The authors showed a framework to pack up the data, software, and analysis methods, specially for neuroimaging study. The results are reproducible which is the major aim of this paper. While I do think this paper is of interest to the general neuroimaging field, we should also notice that complete replication needs the data, software, and analysis procedures. The major hurdle however is often the data since data release may be sensitive and prohibited by regulations. How would the framework described in this paper be helpful for that case should be discussed. Is it possible to have software securely access the data but not leak the data (meaning prohibiting downloading, transfering out of the database etc)?
