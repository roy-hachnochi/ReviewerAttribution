            <meta name="dc.description" content="Reperfusion therapy decreases myocardium damage during an acute coronary event and consequently mortality. However, there are unmet needs in the treatment of acute myocardial infarction, consequently mortality and heart failure continue to occur in about 10% and 20% of cases, respectively. Different strategies could improve reperfusion. These strategies, like generation of warning sign recognition and being initially assisted and transferred by an emergency service, could reduce the time to reperfusion. If the first electrocardiogram is performed en route, it can be transmitted and interpreted in a timely manner by a specialist at the receiving center, bypassing community hospitals without percutaneous coronary intervention capabilities. To administer thrombolytic therapy during transport to the catheterization laboratory could reduce time to reperfusion in cases with expected prolonged transport time to a percutaneous coronary intervention center or to a center without primary percutaneous coronary intervention capabilities with additional expected delay, known as pharmaco-invasive strategy. Myocardial reperfusion is known to produce damage and cell death, which defines the reperfusion injury. Lack of resolution of ST segment is used as a marker of reperfusion failure. In patients without ST segment resolution, mortality triples. It is important to note that, until recently, reperfusion injury and no-reflow were interpreted as a single entity and we should differentiate them as different entities; whereas no-reflow is the failure to obtain tissue flow, reperfusion injury is actually the damage produced by achieving flow. Therefore, treatment of no-reflow is obtained by tissue flow, whereas in reperfusion injury the treatment objective is protection of susceptible myocardium from reperfusion injury. Numerous trials for the treatment of reperfusion injury have been unsuccessful. Newer hypotheses such as &ldquo; controlled reperfusion &rdquo;, in which the interventional cardiologist assumes not only the treatment of the culprit vessel but also the way to reperfuse the myocardium at risk, could reduce reperfusion injury.">

  "description": "Reperfusion therapy decreases myocardium damage during an acute coronary event and consequently mortality. However, there are unmet needs in the treatment of acute myocardial infarction, consequently mortality and heart failure continue to occur in about 10% and 20% of cases, respectively. Different strategies could improve reperfusion. These strategies, like generation of warning sign recognition and being initially assisted and transferred by an emergency service, could reduce the time to reperfusion. If the first electrocardiogram is performed en route, it can be transmitted and interpreted in a timely manner by a specialist at the receiving center, bypassing community hospitals without percutaneous coronary intervention capabilities. To administer thrombolytic therapy during transport to the catheterization laboratory could reduce time to reperfusion in cases with expected prolonged transport time to a percutaneous coronary intervention center or to a center without primary percutaneous coronary intervention capabilities with additional expected delay, known as pharmaco-invasive strategy. Myocardial reperfusion is known to produce damage and cell death, which defines the reperfusion injury. Lack of resolution of ST segment is used as a marker of reperfusion failure. In patients without ST segment resolution, mortality triples. It is important to note that, until recently, reperfusion injury and no-reflow were interpreted as a single entity and we should differentiate them as different entities; whereas no-reflow is the failure to obtain tissue flow, reperfusion injury is actually the damage produced by achieving flow. Therefore, treatment of no-reflow is obtained by tissue flow, whereas in reperfusion injury the treatment objective is protection of susceptible myocardium from reperfusion injury. Numerous trials for the treatment of reperfusion injury have been unsuccessful. Newer hypotheses such as &ldquo;controlled reperfusion&rdquo;, in which the interventional cardiologist assumes not only the treatment of the culprit vessel but also the way to reperfuse the myocardium at risk, could reduce reperfusion injury."

However, there are unmet needs in the treatment of acute myocardial infarction, consequently mortality and heart failure continue to occur in about 10% and 20% of cases, respectively. Different strategies could improve reperfusion. These strategies, like generation of warning sign recognition and being initially assisted and transferred by an emergency service, could reduce the time to reperfusion. If the first electrocardiogram is performed en route, it can be transmitted and interpreted in a timely manner by a specialist at the receiving center, bypassing community hospitals without percutaneous coronary intervention capabilities. To administer thrombolytic therapy during transport to the catheterization laboratory could reduce time to reperfusion in cases with expected prolonged transport time to a percutaneous coronary intervention center or to a center without primary percutaneous coronary intervention capabilities with additional expected delay, known as pharmaco-invasive strategy. Myocardial reperfusion is known to produce damage and cell death, which defines the reperfusion injury. Lack of resolution of ST segment is used as a marker of reperfusion failure. In patients without ST segment resolution, mortality triples. It is important to note that, until recently, reperfusion injury and no-reflow were interpreted as a single entity and we should differentiate them as different entities; whereas no-reflow is the failure to obtain tissue flow, reperfusion injury is actually the damage produced by achieving flow. Therefore, treatment of no-reflow is obtained by tissue flow, whereas in reperfusion injury the treatment objective is protection of susceptible myocardium from reperfusion injury. Numerous trials for the treatment of reperfusion injury have been unsuccessful. Newer hypotheses such as “<i>controlled reperfusion</i>”, in which the interventional cardiologist assumes not only the treatment of the culprit vessel but also the way to reperfuse the myocardium at risk, could reduce reperfusion injury. </div> <div class=abstract-for-mobile> <div class="margin-top-30 padding-bottom-30 research-layout is-centered"> <button class="primary orange-text white-bg bigger-text abstract-expand-button-mobile with-border show" style="display: none;"> READ ALL <span class="f1r-icon icon-14_more_small orange vmiddle big"></span> </button> <button class="primary orange-text white-bg bigger-text abstract-expand-button-mobile with-border hide"> READ LESS <span class="f1r-icon icon-10_less_small orange vmiddle big"></span> </button> </div> </div> </div> <div class=clearfix></div> <div class="article-context no-divider"> <div class="article-abstract article-page-general-text-mobile research-layout generated-article-body"> <h2 class=main-title>Keywords</h2> <p class="u-mb--0 u-pb--2"> Myocardial Infarction, Reperfusion, Reperfusion Injury, Controlled reperfusion </p> </div> </div> <div class=article-information> <span class="info-separation padding-bottom"> <div id=corresponding-author-icon class="email-icon float-left"> <span class="f1r-icon icon-6_email orange"></span> <div id=corresponding-author-window class="margin-top-20 popup-window-wrapper is-hidden"> <div class="popup-window corresponding-authors-popup"> <div class=corresponding-author-container> <div class="popup-window-title small">Corresponding Author(s)</div> <div class=authors> Alejandro Farah (<a href="mailto:farahale@yahoo.com">farahale@yahoo.com</a>) <br> Alejandro Barbagelata (<a href="mailto:n.barbagelata@duke.edu">n.barbagelata@duke.edu</a>) </div> </div> <div class="margin-top margin-bottom float-left"> <button id=close-popup-window class=general-white-orange-button>Close</button> </div> </div> </div> </div> <span class="icon-text float-left" data-test-id=box-corresponding-author> <b>Corresponding authors:</b> Alejandro Farah, Alejandro Barbagelata </span> <div class=clearfix></div> </span> <span class="info-separation padding-bottom competing-interests-display"> <span class=competing-interests-title>Competing interests:</span> The authors declare that they have no competing interests. </span> <div class="info-separation padding-bottom grant-information-display"> <span class=grant-information-title>Grant information:</span> The author(s) declared that no grants were involved in supporting this work. </div> <span class="f1r-article-desk info-separation padding-bottom"> <span class="copywrite-icon float-left"> <span class="f1r-icon icon-100_open_access"></span> </span> <span class="icon-text float-left" data-test-id=box-copyright-text> <b>Copyright:</b>&nbsp; © 2017 Farah A and Barbagelata A.

Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is the event that causes most deaths or new cases of heart failure (HF)<sup><a href="#ref-2">2</a>–<a href="#ref-5">5</a></sup>. Early reperfusion therapy decreases the amount of myocardium damaged during an acute event and consequently mortality<sup><a href="#ref-6">6</a>,<a href="#ref-7">7</a></sup>. Primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI) has become the optimal reperfusion strategy when performed in a timely manner<sup><a href="#ref-8">8</a>–<a href="#ref-10">10</a></sup>. However, there are unmet needs in the treatment of AMI, limiting the benefits that could be obtained with PPCI, since mortality and HF continue to occur in about 10% and 20% of cases each year, respectively<sup><a href="#ref-2">2</a>–<a href="#ref-5">5</a></sup>. In the current state of AMI treatment, two different stages can be recognized in which decrease of reperfusion benefits and in which the wavefront of necrosis could potentially be aborted. The first stage is the time from the onset of symptoms to reperfusion (<a href="#f1">Figure 1</a>).

The guidelines for the treatment of AMI indicate that the time from first contact with the health team for acquisition and interpretation of electrocardiogram (ECG) must be less than 10 minutes<sup><a href="#ref-13">13</a>,<a href="#ref-14">14</a></sup>. PPCI is chosen for reperfusion if it is done in a timely manner by a trained team within 120 minutes of the first medical contact (FMC)<sup><a href="#ref-12">12</a>,<a href="#ref-15">15</a>–<a href="#ref-17">17</a></sup>. If the FMC occurs in a PPCI center, the accepted delay to reperfusion is 90 minutes<sup><a href="#ref-17">17</a>,<a href="#ref-18">18</a></sup> but preferably would be less than 60 minutes. Since most patients present to centers without PPCI capabilities, door-in to door-out time in the non-PPCI center has to be less than 30 minutes for patients transferred to a PPCI center<sup><a href="#ref-12">12</a>,<a href="#ref-19">19</a>,<a href="#ref-20">20</a></sup>.</p><p class="" id=d16872e299>If the FMC occurs in an institution without primary angioplasty (or in emergency medical services) and the expected delay for transfer for primary angioplasty has an estimated time of longer than 120 minutes, reperfusion with thrombolytic is recommended for patients without contraindications<sup><a href="#ref-17">17</a>,<a href="#ref-21">21</a>,<a href="#ref-22">22</a></sup>. In this case, the recommended time from arrival of the patient to starting the application of thrombolytic is less than 30 minutes<sup><a href="#ref-17">17</a>,<a href="#ref-23">23</a>,<a href="#ref-24">24</a></sup>.</p><p class="" id=d16872e322>But in the real world, the time from onset of symptoms to FMC varies widely, and usually patients wait 1.5 to 2 hours to seek medical attention, and only 66% of patients receive reperfusion within the recommendations of scientific guidelines<sup><a href="#ref-25">25</a></sup>. The variables related to delay from onset of symptoms to the FMC are the following: female gender; older age and those younger than 40 years; previous cardiovascular disease, particularly coronary heart disease; renal failure; and walk-in hospital presentation and geographical location<sup><a href="#ref-26">26</a>–<a href="#ref-28">28</a></sup>. The average time from onset of symptoms to FMC has not decreased in the last 10 years<sup><a href="#ref-28">28</a>,<a href="#ref-29">29</a></sup>. An additional delay is generated when the initial ECG is performed by a general practitioner who takes an average of 23.9 minutes<sup><a href="#ref-30">30</a></sup>. There is a close correlation between system delay and short- and long-term mortality; 1-hour delay in the system involves mortality of 15% at 3.4 years, and a delay of 3 hours increases mortality to 28.1% in the same period<sup><a href="#ref-31">31</a></sup>. Factors related to system delay are transfers from remote regions, presentation in a center not trained in reperfusion therapy, transfers between centers, delay for the administration of thrombolytics, and delayed activation of the catheterization laboratory.</p><p class="" id=d16872e351>Strategies that could reduce the time to reperfusion are the following: education of the general population, generation of warning sign recognition<sup><a href="#ref-32">32</a></sup> and being initially assisted and transferred by an emergency service; as in the case of cardiac arrest, they may benefit from receiving timely CPR<sup><a href="#ref-33">33</a></sup>. If the first ECG is performed during transport, it can be transmitted and interpreted by a specialist at the receiving center. This could allow the system to be activated while the patient is en route to the hospital<sup><a href="#ref-34">34</a></sup>. This might also allow thrombolytic therapy to be administered as a pharmaco-invasive strategy in those patients with a long transport time to the catheterization laboratory. The pharmaco-therapy with aspirin, clopidogrel, unfractionated heparin, and tenecteplase and subsequent interventionism demonstrated outcomes equivalent to those of primary angioplasty but with twice the major bleeding, so it has to be selected only in those patients with expected long delays for PPCI<sup><a href="#ref-35">35</a></sup> and half the dose in the elderly population (<a href="#f3">Figure 3</a>).</p><div class="fig panel clearfix"><a name=f3 class=n-a></a><a target=_blank href="https://f1000researchdata.s3.amazonaws.com/manuscripts/11372/2afc279d-071e-444d-9c99-a619f20342e1_figure3.gif"><img alt="2afc279d-071e-444d-9c99-a619f20342e1_figure3.gif" src="https://f1000researchdata.s3.amazonaws.com/manuscripts/11372/2afc279d-071e-444d-9c99-a619f20342e1_figure3.gif"></a><div class=caption><h3>Figure 3.

Elevated white blood cells, increased platelet activation (size and reactivity), high thromboxane A2 and ET1 levels, hyperglycemia with or without diabetes, and C-reactive protein before reperfusion are predictors of this phenomenon<sup><a href="#ref-42">42</a>–<a href="#ref-44">44</a></sup>. It is possible that some degree of reperfusion injury is always present, but those patients with a short time from symptom onset or with previous angina seem less susceptible<sup><a href="#ref-45">45</a>,<a href="#ref-46">46</a></sup>.

The main event occurring during reperfusion and trigger of reperfusion injury is the abrupt increase of oxygen content in a medium with low pH (acidosis tissue caused by ischemia). In this scenario, the O<sub>2</sub> reacts with hydrogen protons to reactive oxygen species (ROS), causing damage to DNA, protein, and lipid membranes, producing myocardial cell death<sup><a href="#ref-58">58</a>,<a href="#ref-59">59</a></sup>. In addition, ROS have pro-inflammatory effects, causing apoptosis and cell necroptosis<sup><a href="#ref-60">60</a></sup>. At the mitochondrial level, ROS open mitochondrial permeability transition pores, making them susceptible to irreversible damage<sup><a href="#ref-60">60</a></sup>. The damage produced by ROS at the level of the endoplasmic reticulum alters calcium dynamics, which in the context of acidotic reperfusion generates calcium influx into the sarcolemma, producing sustained hypercontraction and contraction band necrosis<sup><a href="#ref-59">59</a>–<a href="#ref-61">61</a></sup>.

Current scientific guidelines do not include reperfusion injury as a therapeutic target. It is important to note that, until recently, reperfusion injury and no-reflow were interpreted as a single entity (<a href="#T4">Table 4</a>) and we should differentiate them as different entities; whereas no-reflow is the failure to obtain tissue flow, reperfusion injury is actually the damage produced by achieving flow. Therefore, the way to treat no-reflow is to obtain tissue flow, whereas in reperfusion injury the treatment objective is to protect the susceptible myocardium from reperfusion injury. Another problem for the evaluation of clinical trials is that it is difficult to detect successful treatment for no-reflow and distinguish it from success in treating reperfusion injury if ultimately the common goal is to preserve the myocardium and there is no diagnosis of any of the phenomena before therapy is applied.</p><div class="table-wrap panel clearfix"><a name=T3 class=n-a></a><div class=caption><h3>Table 3.

There are possibilities to optimize their use. Health teams should continue fighting to shorten the system delay and identify the best strategy according to the context in which they operate. To this end, initiatives such as Stent for Life are expanding around the world. There are working groups that conduct research in basic science, translational research, and clinical research against reperfusion injury, such as the Hatter Cardiology Institute, which (led by Derek Yellon) is making progress in myocardial protection using remote ischemic conditioning. We are working on primary controlled reperfusion and starting a clinical assay using intracoronary dextran plus vein blood through the balloon catheter before opening the artery. See Dextran Use for Primary Angioplasty Protection in Acute Myocardial Infarction. DUPAP Trial at <a target=xrefwindow href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/" id=d16872e1296>ClinicalTrials.gov</a>.</p><p class="" id=d16872e1300>We hypothesized that developing treatment protocols for “<i>continuous myocardial protection</i>” with different drugs, such as cyclosporine or other modulators of inflammation, administered from the time of diagnosis to the patient convalescence at the critical unit, could preserve myocardium during the delay of the system and during the early evolution of the event. To develop procedures of “<i>controlled reperfusion</i>” where interventional cardiologists assume treatment not only for the culprit vessel infarction but also for myocardium could reduce reperfusion injury. The newer concept of “<i>controlled reperfusion</i>” means deciding how to reperfuse (for example, post-conditioning with successive balloon inflations) and which adjunct compound to use during reperfusion (for example, administering to the ischemic myocardium, through dedicated catheters, prior to the opening of the artery, modified blood or enriched with drugs), preparing the myocardium for a more complete and definitive recovery. These two concepts—“<i>continuous myocardial protection</i>”<i></i> and “<i>controlled reperfusion</i>”—open a wide field of research and development with potential benefits that could decrease myocardial damage and mortality.</p></div></div><div id=article1-body class=generated-article-body><h2 class=main-title id=d16872e1325>Abbreviations</h2><p class="" id=d16872e1328>AMI, acute myocardial infarction; ECG, electrocardiogram; FMC, first medical contact; HF, heart failure; PPCI, primary percutaneous coronary intervention; ROS, reactive oxygen species.</p></div><div id=article1-back class=generated-article-footer><div class=back-section><a name=d16872e1 class=n-a></a><h2 class=main-title id=d17076>Competing interests</h2><p class=metadata-entry><a name=d16872e105 class=n-a></a><p id=d16872e107> The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></p></div><div class=back-section><a name=d16872e1 class=n-a></a><h2 class=main-title id=d17078>Grant information</h2><p>The author(s) declared that no grants were involved in supporting this work.</p></div><div class=back-section><a name=d16872e1335 class=n-a></a><span class="research-layout prime-recommended-wrapper reference-heading"><span class="f1r-icon icon-79_faculty_recommended_badge red vmiddle default-cursor"></span><span class="prime-red big">F1000 recommended</span></span><h2 class=main-title id=d17276>References</h2><div class="section ref-list"><a name=d16872e1335 class=n-a></a><ul><li><a name=ref-1 class=n-a></a><span class=label>1. </span>&nbsp;<span class=citation><a name=d16872e1342 class=n-a></a>Global Projections of mortality and causes of death, 2015 and 2030 MORTALITY – WHO.
