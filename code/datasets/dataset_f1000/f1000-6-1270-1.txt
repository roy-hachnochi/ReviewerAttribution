The authors have adequately considered all my previous comments. The paper could be further improved by an English language correction as some sentences are difficult to understand. For example: "However, there are traditional drinks that have alcohol content (Chicha de Jora-Clarito); artisanal drinks of traditional origin with alcoholic content in Peru." "Mothers provide accessibility to the beverages and perceive the risk the drinks have, which will more accurately evaluate this risk." Some further minor corrections: "thus reaching about 28.7% of unregistered alcohol": change unregistered to unrecorded (see WHO wording) "since consumers despite having between 10 to 12 degrees of alcohol, they consider this as a traditional drink". Change "degrees of alcohol" to "% volume". It is also illogical why the content of alcohol would exclude the status as "traditional drink".
