This is an extremely well written submission by Bajorath et. al detailing an important aspect of the inverse QSAR problem, namely the generation of a feature vector optimizing the output of a QSAR equation. An interesting and novel component of the work is that constrained optimization is utilized ensuring generated solutions lie within the domain of applicability of the QSAR model. This paper is primarily of theoretical interest in that due to inherent limitations with inverse-QSAR the technique is rarely adopted as a means of drug discovery. The primary reason for the lack of adoption revolving around the de-novo design of compounds matching optimized descriptor values. The introduction to the paper covers the relevant literature but could be made stronger by discussing the recent work of Gmez-Bombarelli et. al. 1 who use generative models to approach the inverse-QSAR problem. Their work concerns building and optimizing QSAR equations in the latent space of an autoencoder and subsequently decoding optimized points into molecular structures. Although the work by Gmez-Bombarelli is preliminary, it addresses both QSAR optimization and structure generation and would most likely be interesting to readers of the current paper. An aspect of the current technique that could be discussed in the paper is the generation of a family of solutions. Currently, the presented technique produces one optimized feature vector. It would strengthen the paper if the authors discussed how a family of diverse feature vectors (structures) could be evolved using the presented methodology. Overall, the paper in its current form is more than acceptable. The methodology is clearly delineated and sufficiently supported by the included results. Minor points: Figure 3: it would be informative to highlight the optimal point with a particular glyph (perhaps a red star?) Figure 7: Chemical structures look suspect and should be checked
