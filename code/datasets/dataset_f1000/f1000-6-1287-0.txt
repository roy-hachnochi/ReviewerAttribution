This paper describes BlobTools, an open source software package for partitioning of genomic data, principally for contamination control. It is a reimplementation of the Blobology pipeline previously described by one of the authors. The paper makes a compelling case for the usefulness of blob plots, by citing a large number of previous works that have adopted the approach. The operation of the tool and the use cases look well thought out. The manuscript states that the software should work on a UNIX-based operating system, but I had some difficulties with Mac OS. I found I needed to install wget, but then encountered issues with the python installation and pip that I was unable to overcome. Some guidance for Mac users in the instructions would be appreciated, as these do make up a significant number of users of bioinformatics software. I was, however, able to install very easily on a Linux machine. Though the simulated dataset examples are useful, I would have liked to see a use case involving a real dataset, showing the real impact that BlobTools had. It would also be useful if the authors could provide a brief tutorial based around a small dataset (real or simulated). A few minor comments: In Abstract, a typo in final paragraph “dataset,s”. In Introduction paragraph, “The decrease in cost per nucleotide lead” should be “has led”. A little bit the introduction paragraph feels like it was written a few years ago - ie. non-model organisms have been sequenced for many years. Second paragraph: interrogation of genome assemblies… is an elemental step in the genome sequencing process. More a part of genome assembly than sequencing? Second paragraph: “Several reports of HGTs… have been shown…” - provide refererences.
