Zhbannikov and co-workers present the cophesim software that they have developed for simulating phenotypic data using genotype information. The input and output file formats are compatible with many of the most commonly used computer programs for genome wide association studies. The software is flexible, well documented and fills a gap in existing tools, especially for simulating time-to-event phenotypes. The paper is well written and easy to follow, and we only have some minor comments and suggestions. Minor comments Closing bracket missing in the sentence below equation (3) In equation (4), if the user does not provide gene effects then the phenotype is built by the sum of the standardized genotypes for each individual. Could you motivate this choice a bit and explain why it would be useful? In equation (5), the subscripts look wrong. a_i should be a_j In the Linkage Disequilibrium section the term “copula” is used. We do not think most readers of this paper can be expected to be acquainted with copulas and a reference is needed. Consider adding a short paragraph where you discuss limitations and the possibility to add further functionality in the future, including: Dominance effects Probit link for binary data Simulation of correlated traits Alternative ways to simulate LD including a copula approach Check that the following link (at the end of the paper) works: https://bitbucket.org/izhbannikov/cophesim_data/ROC/roc.R (we were able to retrieve the code from https://bitbucket.org/izhbannikov/cophesim_data/src/ )
