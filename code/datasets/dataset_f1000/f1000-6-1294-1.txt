In the manuscript “Cophesim: a comprehensive phenotype simulator for testing novel association methods”, I. Zhbannikov and colleagues from the Duke University, presented a software that allowed to generate genotype data prepared with a genetic simulator for the use in the investigations of the genome wide association study (GWAS) tools. The rational for development of the software is clearly explained. The idea of the study is to use computer simulations to model data with specific assumptions. Similar simulators are known but all of them do not allow simulate survival. There are several other disadvantage with the existing simulators reviewed by the authors. The description of the software is technically sound. The methods section is clearly presented. Dichotomous phenotype are simulated according to the logistic model with the covariates being genetic variants and covariates. Continuous phenotypes are simulated using the linear regression. Survival phenotype is modeled using the proportional hazards with inverse probability method. The details of the code, methods and analysis allow replication of the software and its use by the others. The methods section is clearly presented. Dichotomous phenotype are simulated according to the logistic model with the covariates being genetic variants and covariates. The output formats are compatible with the other applications (Table 1). It is useful example if using the simulator and the other examples are available in the manual. The ROC curve example is also very useful. The information provided is quite sufficient to allow interpretation of the expected results. In short, the Cophesim is a useful tool that can be helpful in the genetic analyses. The article is scientifically sound, the methods are described with details – this article will greatly help the researcher interested in the application genetic analyses.
