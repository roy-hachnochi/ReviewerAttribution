 Summary : Veljkovic et al. have investigated the electronic properties of some known human nutrients and biomolecules. They utilize average quasi valence number (AQVN) and the electron-ion interaction potential (EIIP) as molecular descriptors of the properties of organic molecules (as they have in prior publications). They were able to represent groups of organic compounds according to their basic electronic properties. The authors conclude that simple criterion for the selection of food components for healthy nutrition can be identified, and will serve as a basis for better understanding of the nutrients biological functions in the future. Major Issues: None Minor Issues: This reviewer wonders if Fresubin (being an "unflavoured liquid consisting of protein (milk and soya), fat (soya, MCT, linseed, sunflower and fish oils), carbohydrate (maltodextrin), vitamins, minerals and trace elements.") and human milk compare so favorably (Figure 4) due to similar starting materials (milk proteins, minerals, and trace elements)?
