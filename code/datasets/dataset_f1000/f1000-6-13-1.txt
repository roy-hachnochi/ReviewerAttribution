This paper represents a further publication of a novel approach to defining functional properties of biological molecules. Previously the authors have proposed that the average quasi valence number (AQVN) and the electron-ion interaction potential (EIIP) play a determining role in the biological function of an organic molecule, presumably through facilitating molecular interactions. Calculations of these values are based on the atomic and valence numbers of atoms in the molecule in question. This paper addresses the question of consistency in AQVN and EIIP values in relation to known nutritional function. The data support the conclusion that known nutritionally important substances conform to definite subgroupings of AQVN and EIIP values. The paper raises many questions in the mind of a traditional biochemist not the least of which is how does this form of analysis relate to the protein components of milk for example? It is well known that the nutritional and biological function of milk is not only dependent on the small molecules but is also dependent on the protein growth factors present as well.
