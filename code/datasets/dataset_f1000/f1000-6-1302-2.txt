Ruffle et al., performed RNA-Seq on three AML patients, and identified a number of new chimeric RNAs. They grouped them into reasonable categories, and discussed their generating mechanisms. For some, they performed tag search in larger sets of RNA-Seq data of AML and CD34+ HSCs. In general, the analysis is solid. Multiple levels of evidence were provided for some fusion RNAs (for instance FISH for a Class I fusion). The conclusion is justified. No major issues were noted. Minor suggestions: It would be nice to perform the same RNA-Seq pipeline analysis on bigger datasets, such as the data from LEUCEGENE. It is well known that different software tools behave differently and false positive/negative is a big issue. Would be nice to use another independent software for crosschecking. The METRNL001 Class 3 chimera may be a product of backsplicing if the sequencing protocol is not restricted to polyA RNAs.
