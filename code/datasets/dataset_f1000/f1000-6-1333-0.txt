The manuscript treated about definitive monoaxial external fixation for shaft femural fractures in polytrauma cases. I agree with the choice of Authors for this option of treatment, useful to minimize the surgical duration time and blood loss. External fixation technique is easy and reproducible, but associated with minor complications, as superficial pin infections. This is the reason why surgeons are not encouraged to use this device as definitive solution, and also for the poor attitude to allow an early-weight bearing.
