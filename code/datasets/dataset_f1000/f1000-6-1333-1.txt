This is a well written manuscript on femoral shaft fracture in polytrauma patients treated by monoaxial external fixation as definitive treatment. The sample characteristic are adequate and the study is well designed, I suggest to define more precisely the amount of loss of range of motion when considered as a complication as well as when arhrtomyolisis was indicated. Furthermore, it could be interesting to compare the average duration of the surgical procedure in closed and open fracture groups. The reported duration for external fixator application as initial stabilization device for femoral shaft fractures in polytrauma patients is around 30 minutes. In this study, the average duration is higher (55 minutes). The authors of the study suggested that this difference in duration is explained by the fact that “more time is needed to treat soft tissue and skin”. However, the difference might be the result of using the external fixation as definitive treatment, which requires better reduction and more stable construct. If this is the case, the surgical time might increase also for closed fracture group. In conclusion, this manuscript reported external fixation to be a valid option as definitive treatment for femoral shaft fracture in polytrauma patients. This technique allows early fracture stabilization and eliminate the need of additional surgery for obtaining definitive fracture reduction and stabilization in 78% of the patients. The topic of this manuscript is interesting and it deserves serious consideration for publication.
