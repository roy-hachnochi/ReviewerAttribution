The authors have answered my previous queries. This will be a useful paper for those looking for evidence for funding peer review. I wouldn't say that the NSF approach "reduced the burden to zero" (page 11, second column) as the researchers still needed to spend time on their reviews. It was an interesting approach and could be more efficient. Plus it avoids researchers only "taking" from the system and not giving back. Minor comments Page 7, first column, space missing in "decisionmaking" Page 9, first column, “decreases in early career” add “in” Page 9, citations to Wenneras (first column) and Bornmann (second column) should have brackets around the year not the authors Page 10, second column, “include NIH did cut” needs re-wording Page 10, second column, last paragraph, “Australian” should be “Australia” Page 11, last full paragraph in first column, open bracket with no closing bracket Page 11, second column, last paragraph, Donald Braben suggested it be called “peer preview” rather than “peer review” because reviewers try to predict the future 1 Page 13, second column, our group has recently published a qualitative study of funding peer review panels that included observations on the dynamics between panelists 2 References 1.
