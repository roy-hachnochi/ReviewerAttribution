In my opinion, state of the art of the study has been well presented, and problem statement was also clear. We assume that authors are already familiar with this species indicate by used references. The experimental design was suitable and the data were presented very well. The results have been discussed in a good manner and compared to other previous studies. As known Tor tambra is one of the native species in Indonesia and this species has been cultured. As already mention by the authors that one the main problem in aquaculture is lack of growth rate and low feed efficiency. Therefore, application of probiotic can solve this problem, this proven by the presented data that the feed with probiotic gave higher of growth rate and feed efficiency compared to control. The new innovation of this study is using temulawak ( Curcuma xanthorrhiza ) and kencur ( Kaempferia galanga ) to enhanced the probiotic. Therefore, the finding is very useful for practical use and gives a significant contribution to scientific community.
