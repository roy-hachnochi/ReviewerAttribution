The aim of this paper is to summarize four articles published by the World Endometriosis Research Foundation, aiming to set up the Endometriosis Phenome and Biobanking Harmonisation Project. This is a global initiative with the mission to develop a consensus on standardization and harmonization of phenotypic surgical/clinical data and biological sample collection methods in endometriosis management and research. It provides forms for collection of data related to surgery, clinical, and epidemiological phenotyping characteristics as well as standard operating procedures, processing, and long-term storage of biological samples from affected women. This project will allow data analysis of a large number of cases using the same forms worldwide, and the possibility of sharing the obtained information. This paper offers a clear and comprehensible recapitulation of the standard surgical forms and standard endometriosis patient questionnaires to facilitate their use by the clinicians in the clinical practice. Nevertheless, this paper does not analyze the limitations of the project such as the possible differences in resources and logistics among centers that could affect data collection and implementation of standard operating procedures. The extent and type of data collected and the effort to record data in an online database could be influenced by availability of time, local organizational structures and experience as well as motivation of the surgeon.
