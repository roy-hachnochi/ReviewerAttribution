The paper shows some interesting preliminary results. The authors should be complimented for their good English. The works cries out for more repeats and the authors appreciate this. Within the abstract, and in the text throughout, chemical names should not have capital letters, more importantly some of the compound names need checking, particularly 1,3-heptadiene-3-yne which is in the abstract, it cannot be right. Also check in tables, spelling and also are you sure: 1,2-Benzene dicarboxulic acid, this should be 1,2-benzenedicarboxylic acid 1,3-Butadiyene, do you mean 1,3-butadiene? Likewise 1,2-Butadiyene ? 1,3-Heptadiene-3-yne? Can’t be Dibutyl phatalate should be phthalate, also its other name is 1,2-Benzenedicarboxylic acid, dibutyl ester. Best to be consistent with names, I only draw attention to this case as an example, because 1,2-benzene dicarboxylic acid has been stated to be found, and when they have the same naming, its brings out the thought that the acid may have come from the ester (I say this, rather than the other way around as the butyl ester is a common plasticizer, and can be a contaminant). Longifolrne spelling! And it appears just below, they are the same? Do they have the same rts? Longifolene Phatalic acid, butyl ester, spelling Sesquiphellandrene and beta- Sesquiphellandrene, are both listed are they the same? Table 2,3 Check as above. There are some compounds, which may be speculatively assigned, eg 4-t-butyl-2-(1-methyl-2- nitroethyl)cyclohexane? Are the authors really sure Supplementary : E. coli:5.5-Dodecadinyl-1, 12-diol, can’t be right, check, plus check names of chemicals as above
