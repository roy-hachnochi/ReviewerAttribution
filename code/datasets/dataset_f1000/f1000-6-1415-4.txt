This paper looks at the detection of VOC's produced by Escherischia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans using solid phase micro-extraction coupled with gas chromatography / mass spectrometry. Its seems as though the group only ran this experiment once so while they have pointed out the detection of specific volatiles at differing time points this needs to be repeated to ensure that it is indeed a true and repeatable release from the micro-organisms. The work is outlined clearly and the results listed comprehensively however there has been no indepth discussion surrounding why these volatiles have been produced in vitro, would they be produced in vivo nor an extensive list of references to back this up. While they state Indole as the most important volatile produced by E.coli they do not go into any detail regarding how this would relate to an actual breath test since indole can be released by mouth flora. Also as indole is produced from tryptophan discussion around the levels of tryptophan in the lung and therefore its actual availability to E.coli growing in the lung is pertinent. Growth in a minimal media with varying tryptophan levels would give more insight. It would have also been beneficial to look at the effect of co-culturing these micro-organisms as this may alter the release of the detected VOC's and initiated the production of others.
