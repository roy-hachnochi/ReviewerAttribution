General Comments: This study aimed to identify typical volatile organic compounds (VOCs) produced by Staphylococcus aureus , Escherichia coli and Candida albicans by extraction of cultured bacterial strain headspace using solid phase microextraction (SPME) fibers analyzed by Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS). Although the aim of study is obvious and very relevant data is shown, some extension on utilized statistics is needed. Additionally, a replication and/or validation of findings is crucial. The authors do show that some of the VOCs, e.g. Indole, are revealed at multiple time points, but confirmation of observations by repetition of experiments is recommended. Major Comments: To avoid possible false discoveries a repetition of experiments is recommended. Which (statistical) methods were used in order to compare blank vs. actual samples? Which criteria were applied in order to confirm a ‘match’ between detected volatiles and the NIST library? The authors nicely show the overlap and/or discrepancy between their findings and current available literature, but what about the interpretation of findings? Can the authors extend and/or speculate about possible biological mechanisms behind the revealed VOCs Minor comment: Please consider as reference: Neerincx et al ; Identification of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Aspergillus fumigatus mono- and co-cultures based on volatile biomarker combinations; J Breath Res. 2016 Jan 29;10(1):016002.
