This is an interesting study with a large N. Within the limitations of the methodology, it tells us that individuals with anomalous information reception (AIR) tend to be somewhat more dissociative than those without such experiences. This is consistent with prior literature. The study would have been stronger if the taxometric statistical analysis had been applied to the 8 DES-T items (available at www.isst-d.org), and if the full 28-item DES had been administered, but this would have made for a lengthy survey. The sample population is more dissociative and has more AIR than the general population and this provides interesting information about IONS members and affiliates that I donâ€™t think has been published before. As Dr. Cardena noted, the references could have been more extensive, but I would say they are sufficient for a brief report.
