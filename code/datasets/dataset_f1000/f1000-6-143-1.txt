This is a well written and well researched piece on surgical education. The article reviews current educational theory which is certainly very useful for a surgical audience and also highlights the challenges of teaching in a busy surgical service and postgraduate environment. The model of surgical teaching has been unchanged for decades with the teacher/apprentice model being the mainstay of teaching. While most of us are keen to teach we are not trained as teachers. This article helps provide a framework for teaching in this environment, including techniques for feedback to “close the loop”. Overall a very useful article.
