I thoroughly enjoyed the "Tourette Syndrome research highlights from 2016" article by Prof. Black. It is a very well organised effort to present a succinct summary of relevant research from that year and I would like to congratulate Prof. Black for his dedication in putting this together. I only have some minor suggestions. It might be thematically more suitable to integrate the first paragraph of the sensory findings of the "Clinical and neuropsychological studies" ["Thresholds for externally applied sensory... ...or central sensorimotor processing"] to the "Premonitory Urges" section, as indeed these refer to the same topic. On the reference of the mouse model of Xu et al. ["These mice developed anxiety and increased frequency of grooming rituals."] it might be of relevance to highlight that the abnormal behaviours only occurred after exposure to environmental stressors. On the Treatments/psychological interventions section, it could be relevant to mention that CBIT responders in those trials as measured by the CGI-I were 45% of the total sample. [Data from the cited publication: "CBIT were significantly more likely to be classified as treatment responders on the CGI-I (child = 53%, adult = 38%, combined sample = 45%)"]
