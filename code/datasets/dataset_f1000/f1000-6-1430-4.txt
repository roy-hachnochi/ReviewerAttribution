The manuscript submitted by Dr. Black is a very thorough and comprehensive review of the recent literature on Tourette Syndrome. It is exceptionally well written and organized. There is one error that needs to be corrected. In the following sentence, there is a missing word and simply a citation number. "Another potentially useful approach to TS genetic research was illustrated by 28, who sequenced candidate genes suggested by previous research in order to identify potential functional variants linked to TS." Other than this, I could find no errors or modifications that I would recommend before publishing this manuscript.
