The study determined the effects of aniracetam, a cognitive enhancer, on anxiety and learning behaviors in normal adult mice. Aniracetam was administered orally at least 30 minutes prior to each behavioral test performed. This treatment paradigm did not produce significant differences between control-placebo and aniracetam- treated mice in the six behavioral tests evaluated. The authors conclude that acute treatment with aniracetam does not have cognitive enhancing effects in normal mice, when tested immediately after. It would make it easier for the reader if a diagram with the experimental timeline is included in the manuscript. In addition, I would recommend that the authors discuss the observation that after several daily doses of aniracetam the animals still did not show enhanced cognitive abilities in the last behavioral tests performed. This is important because of a potential cumulative effect of the drug in the last tests performed.
