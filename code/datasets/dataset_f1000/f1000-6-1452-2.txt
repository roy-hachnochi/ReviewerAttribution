This is a fairly well-performed study but it has a serious flaw that isn't really addressed, which is that it uses a single dose. Single dose studies are problematic unless that dose is really well established as the appropriate dose, and it's really not very clear here how or why that dose is chosen. Although the dose chosen is maybe in the dose range people tend to take (maybe double the maximum dose people seem to report), pro-cognitive effects are notoriously dose-specific and it is possible they simply have the wrong dose. Rather than the very extensive behavioral approach, why didn't the authors simply run one task (e.g., fear conditioning) using a range of doses? At the very least the authors need to acknowledge this substantial limitation. The other issues have been mentioned in the other review; in particular, the fear conditioning parameters and scoring methodology are not adequately described.
