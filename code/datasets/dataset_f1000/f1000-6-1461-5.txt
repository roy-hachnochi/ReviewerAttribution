The authors report the molecular analysis of 2 exons (11 20) of BRCA1 in a Sudanese population. The paper is well written. It gives a truncated information about BRCA1 mutations in a population but the work is correctly done; it has to be completed by analysing the whole gene; using HRM method could help them to reduce cost analysis. One remark about reference 1 2, I didn't find information about African statistics which are available in references 4 5.
