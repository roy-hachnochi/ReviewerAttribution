This article presents a tool aggregate which can be a useful one-stop-shop and/or starting off point for analyzing bisulfite data. The authors detail the package and demonstrate its usefulness in an example analysis. Most of the information needed to decide whether to use this package is contained in the article. A notable exception are the "further modules" mentioned in the first paragraph of the Methods section. While it is clearly useful to integrate gene expression, histone modification data and transcription factor binding site information to your analysis, the reader cannot get an impression of whether the package does this effectively. It would be useful to include either an expansion on this topic or better yet to add example analysis with these modules as well, space permitting. If the authors are space confined, it would be useful to point to where an example of this can be found on the web, as I was unable to locate it on the project page. A critical omission from the introduction is a short technical background on bisulfite sequencing and its analysis. The reader has no basis to understand why a "VCF-style file that includes detailed information for each cytosine" (in the Calling subsection) would be useful. Some minor issues were: the phrase "grouping of samples" in the second sentence of the Methods section does not really clarify anything about the function of the grouping module. I would suggest to use "sample group analysis" "Due to its modularity, however" is awkwardly worded and could be better expressed as "The toolkit's modularity makes it flexible, extensible and customizable for users with specific needs". the sentence "Basic steps, e.g. ..." should say "are" instead of "is". "Resembling a common study design," in the Use cases section does not express what I believe is the authors' intended meaning, and could be better worded as "In order to illustrate the results of using our toolkit on a common study design,"
