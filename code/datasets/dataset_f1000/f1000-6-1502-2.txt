Breast cancer and endometrial cancer are two most frequent hormone-related cancers among women. The authors presented a rare case with synchronous primary malignancy of breast and endometrium. This is a well-written case report. It clearly described a particular individualâ€™s history with a disease presentation and progress. One limitation is the patient lost to follow up. It is advised to add pathology images demonstrating their findings. Patients with germline mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes are highly susceptible to breast cancer. These mutations are also related to an increased risk of developing endometrial cancer. Do author consider to perform an investigation in genetic level? It would be adequate to add more discussion in this point.
