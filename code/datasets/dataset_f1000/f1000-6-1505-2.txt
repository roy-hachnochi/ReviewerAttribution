This is an excellent manuscript that will certainly help researchers further understand the liabilities of "good-actors"; compounds that provide structure-interference relationships (SIR) that may not be pertinent to the biology being studied. Notes: Inconsistent is misspelled in Panel B of Figure 3. Though this will need to be experimentally-verified, the sulfonylpyrimidines are almost certainly interfering by SnAr reactions. A literature search to gauge this potential reactivity of the core structure retrieved 100 articles and 1000 reactions. This group is certainly not in the PAINS definitions, but its assay interference potential can readily be ascertained by a quick reaction substructure search. Most importantly, this observation reinforces that lack of PAINS "flagging" is not sufficient to ensure that compounds don't have assay interference potential. The authors may wish to highlight this in their discussion.
