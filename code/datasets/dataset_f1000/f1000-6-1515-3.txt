In this paper, Park et al. knocked down 24 out of 29 alpha-arrestin genes in C. elegans and found that none of them produced a sizable effect on the lifespans of the wild type or the long-lived daf-2 worms. The methods used in this study were sound, and the data quality were up to standard with hundreds of worms assayed for RNAi of each alpha-arrestin gene. I think the work is honest, and the negative results in this paper are reliable. Concerns: (1) I agree with the previous 2 reviewers that it is strange to leave out 5 members of the C. elegans alpha-arrestin genes. (2) I think it is fair to say that none of the 24 genes extended lifespan when knocked down. The statistically significant 10% increase of wild-type lifespan by arrd-3 RNAi is negligible, given the variation of the lifespan assay. The relatively small p-value (0.0045) is blessed by the large sample size (n = 240). I wonder what the p-values would be if the two independent lifespan experiments had not been pooled. (3) I would like the authors to report how many worms were censored. (4) I wonder whether the authors had observed any noticeable phenotypes from their RNAi experiments, in particular, egg-laying defects. Strong egg-laying defects are easy to detect. G-protein signaling and beta-arrestin regulate the egg-laying behavior.
