The authors have partially addressed my concerns. Below I suggest further changes. Change title from 'RNAi targeting Caenorhabditis elegans α-arrestins has small or no effects on lifespan' to 'RNAi targeting Caenorhabditis elegans α-arrestins has little effect on lifespan' Also change from 'small or no effects' to 'little effect' throughout the text. The authors state that they did not study arrd-12, 22 and 27 because of 'unknown technical problems'. It would be helpful for the field to be more specific here. Could they not be amplified? In the results paragraph the authors state that 'knockdown of each of individual α-arrestin genes tended to slightly reduce lifespan in wild-type or in daf-2(-) mutants' This is a little misleading. Change to 'knockdown of specific α-arrestin genes caused a minor reduction of lifespan in wild-type or in daf-2(-) mutants' Change from 'In addition, as we did not test whether RNAi targeting each of α-arrestin genes was effective by using quantitative RT-PCR' to 'In addition, as we did not test whether RNAi targeting of each α-arrestin gene was effective by using quantitative RT-PCR'
