In this manuscript Park et al . performed RNAi knockdown of 24 of the 29 alpha-arrestin genes in C. elegans to ask whether they are important for lifespan regulation in wild type and daf-2 mutant animals. Their data shows that, in their experimental conditions, most alpha-arrestin genes are individually not important for regulating lifespan. Concerns: One major issue with the study is whether RNAi knockdown of the alpha-arrestin genes is working. As some alpha-arrestins are expressed in the nervous system, which is refractory to RNAi, this is a concern. To determine whether the RNAi knockdown is working then Q-RTPCR should be performed. However, this is not a small task for 24 genes, therefore, further experiments using sensitized genetic backgrounds for RNAi or elevated temperatures may tease out phenotypes for some alpha-arrestin genes. This could particularly be performed for the alpha-arrestin genes that when knocked down engender a slight effect on lifespan. In parallel to this, the authors could align the alpha-arrestin gene sequences to ask if there is a common sequence that could be used by RNAi targeting to knockdown multiple alpha-arrestin genes simultaneously. The authors knockdown of 24 of the 29 alpha-arrestin genes. I wonder why they didnâ€™t generate RNAi clones for the remaining 5, especially since they did generate 3 other constructs for their analysis. Potentially, the important alpha-arrestin genes is amongst those not examined. The authors did not report any other behavioural or morphological phenotypes observed by alpha-arrestin gene knockdown. Any information on observed phenotypes would be of interest to the research community.
