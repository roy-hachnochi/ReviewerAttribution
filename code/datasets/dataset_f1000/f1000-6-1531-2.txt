The authors searched renal impairment rate among stroke patients. Thatâ€™s a valuable study especially for ICU units of neurology and neurosurgery departments. Authors evaluated hematoma volume, surgical interventions and hematoma location. But ventricular hematoma can cause biochemical changes so this condition had to be evaluated separately. Cholesterol level, alcohol intake, smoking, seizures (status) and antiepileptic drugs could be the other parameters for haemorrhagic stroke. It is appropriate to index the article in this state.
