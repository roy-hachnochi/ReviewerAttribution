Review “Protein nano-cages: Novel carriers for optimized targeted Remedy” reviews recent trend in use of protein as nanometric tools for drug delivery and diagnoses. Overall it's a well-written, quite accurate review, but needs some revision before to be indexed. Abstract is not clear and contains many conceptual error or typos. - “Since 1980, when the idea of drug-delivery was proposed, various drug-carriers have been developed, including DNA, proteins, liposomes and several other polymer cages, consisting of many well established natural and synthetic nano-particles." This sentence resulted not clear and too confusing: DNA, protein are material for drug delivery systems; liposomes are drug delivery systems composed by lipid. - "All these drug-carriers can self-assemble in the body and can be manipulated for safer delivery into target tissues." This concept is wrong, drug carrier not self assemble in the body. - The term “carrier’s solubility” is not correct, It is a colloidal system in which carrier is dispersed in the medium. - “Science their introduction” is “Since their introduction”. Introduction reports many general concepts regarding the drug delivery systems produced during years. This part contains some information not useful for the general content of the review. A comment/comparison between synthetic and natural self assembling drug delivery systems should be more properly. Introduction of table or image could make the review more clear. The condition for the assembly of protein into nanocage are completely missing.
