The authors present an interesting overview of protein nanocage-based drug delivery systems, which gives the reader a taster of the interesting properties of this class of nanoscale drug delivery system. The review is on the whole well written, but in need of a little editing of the text (examples of the edits are listed below). The review article would benefit greatly from the addition of figures to help to explain the topic visually to the reader. Please ensure the figures have the appropriate citation and text from the publisher (typically something like: "This image is reproduced from XXX with permission of the publisher") Please change the title "Protein nano-cages: Novel carriers for optimized targeted remedy" to read "Protein nanocages: Novel carriers for optimized targeted remedy" The idea of "Drug Delivery" has been around for somewhat longer than 1980, however it is likely the authors intended to include the word "controlled" prior to drug delivery to differentiate this from the typical burst release profiles seen with drugs delivered via injections or oral administration. Please change all instances of "Nano-scale" to read "Nanoscale" "Protein nano-cages are a newly emerging and promising nano-biopolymers." should read "Protein nano-cages are an emerging technology with promise for drug delivery." Please change "and recently they have been applied for the construction of nano-protein cargoes" to read "and recently they have been applied for the construction of protein based delivery systems" Please change "bio-distribution" to read "biodistribution" Please change "nano-cage" to read "nanocage" Please change "nano-particles" to read "nanoparticles"
