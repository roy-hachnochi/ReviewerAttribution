As a member of the evaluation council on economic studies for Vietnamâ€™s National Foundation for Science and Technology Development (NAFOSTED), I am particularly interested in this research as this is one of the key issues we have been facing in recent years. Its merits can also be seen immediately. Some of my comments follow. The authors have shown their heroic act in collecting and preparing the unique data sets at individual levels, which has never been done before. The insights are clear and useful, with potentially practical implications for policy makers like us. I like the fact that they focus on basic measures where and when complexities do not necessarily bring more useful understanding. All data sets are presented, accompanied by R codes, which have made the replication and reproduction of the results both easy and transparent. Having gone through the paper several times, I am now pleased to approve this work. A further comment: for more valuable analyses in the future regarding this theme of research, I would suggest the expanding of the current data sets to include Scopus citation data. I would like to suggest that some more limitation regarding the sources of data and methods. For example, ISI web of science covers less journals than Scopus, or panel data should be better for future research. I wish the authors every success in their future research attempt.
