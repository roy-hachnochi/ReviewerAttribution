This is an interesting article and topic. The article is well written. Research to find new ways to treatment cancer, especially common cancers such as prostate, is valuable. Research on immunotherapy of various cancers with full length antibodies or better than them, antibody fragments such as scFv that have the ability to inhibit the growth of cancer cells is important. The study is well-designed and good valid results have been achieved. Selection of anti-RTF scFv antibody with anti-proliferative and apoptosis effects against prostate cancer cells is promising. But since scFvs have disadvantages in comparison with whole mAb, in vivo study in future studies is recommended. It is necessary to impose the following points: It is essential to the results of the phage ELISA be added. Figures 1, 2 and 3 further explanation needed.
