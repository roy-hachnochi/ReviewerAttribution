Nejatollahi et al. presented in their study a novel human scFv fragment against RTF. The manuscript is well written. The results are demonstrated in a detailed and informative way. The manuscript is only ready for indexing after considering the following major and minor comments: Abstract: Beginning: Would be better to say scFvs instead of scFv. Use the plural from. Methods: library of scFvs instead of scFv; “The anti-proliferative and apoptotic effects of the antibody” please correct to scFv. Results: Please add: of the prostate CANCER cells after 24 h. Conclusions: please add: were greater than IN Du-145 and LNCaP cells. Please write Anti-RTFscFv consistent. Introduction : You describe the properties of scFvs, but the property of human origin is nothing special for scFvs, MAbs could also be human and scFvs could also be of mouse origin. Of course it is and advantage if the scFv is human. The introduction is a bit short, compared to the abstract in length. Normally the abstract is much shorter than the introduction in most of the manuscripts. You could go a bit more in detail about the way of function of the scFvs in the cancer cells (or you can mention this point in the discussion section). Methods: AnnexinV/FITC Assay please specify which well plate you use 6-well, 12-well, 24-well? In best case a negative control should also be included such as a non-binding scFv, to compare unspecific effects and/or a negative control cell line, not incubating the antigen/receptor etc. Make sure to write 1h (1 h, hrs) or 10 mg/ml (10 mg/ml) consistent throughout the manuscript. Please correct: “U-87 MGand A-17”. Please add the concentration unit (100, 200, 500, 1000 scFv/cell), e.g. nM. Cell proliferation assay: Do you used a positive control (100% killing) as blank value? Results: Selection of an anti-RTF scFv antibody: please clarify which clone was used as tested scFv. Figure 1: Please relocate (B) in the figure legend. Figure 2: Please delete title X and Data 1. MTT Assay: It would be great to determine an EC/IC 50 values for better comparison to similar acting scFvs/antibodies. Moreover, the unit of scFv/cell is not usual, in our opinion. Please write the concentration in e.g. molarity. AnnexinV/assay: It would be great if you could also obtain and show the dot blot of the histograms, which is the normal way to demonstrate apoptosis. Because in the dot blots you can compare early and late apoptotic/necrotic cells as well as live cells. It would be nice to have binding analysis of the scFv. Discussion: Did you have any affinity data of your new scFvs? Could you give information about the way of function of the scFvs in the cancer cells. For mAbs it could be ADCC, CDC or blocking of signaling pathways. For scFv-based Immunotoxins its receptor mediated endocytosis and the toxin acts in the cancer cells… It would be nice to have a comparison between the toxicity of the full length mAb and the novel scFv. Are there any data available? Binding analysis of the novel scFv to the used cell lines would be advantageous for the discussion.
