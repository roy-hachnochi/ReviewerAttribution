This tool might be very useful in clinical practice to make tic suppression more objectively measured, and to substantiate the direct results of tic suppression practicing. It is potentially a useful addition to current practice of CBT in tic suppression, and entails a worthwhile initiative to develop this tool. However, I miss information on some aspects: Direct comparison with other potential ways to generate objective quantifiable results; for instance the advantages compared to video-based tic counting. I miss reflection on potential disadvantages of the tool, and limitations of the tool (for instance in practicing in daily life, not only in the lab, is unclear. In the plain text output, I miss summary information across sessions, and f.i. graphs on tic course across sessions that could be presented to the patient and discussed. The latter would be really helpful for patients and therapist The device can in no way be used in more naturalistic sessions outside the treatment room, the authors should speculate about this, and about future developments to make the tool more practical and applicable in different situations and contexts. I miss pilot information on direct comparisons between conventional tic counting and the counting with the aid of the tictimer.
