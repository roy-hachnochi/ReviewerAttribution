The authors evaluated the association between 25(OH)D, BMI, BMD, and fractures in their fracture liason like service in their orthopedic clinic. The relationship between vitamin D, BMD, and fractures has been widely studied in the field, so this study is not unique; however, utilizing low BMD and/or low vitamin D as a reference tool for FLS and FLS like program is a unique idea, so evaluating how it is associated with fractures is an interesting research topic. However, the presentation of the data was not the best. First, in the discussion section, there were a few articles that would could have been referenced. 1) the racial differences in vitamin D biology with respect to bone health. The researchers did not properly present the racial background of their study, but this could be relevant to other researchers. 2) they did not cite the meta-analysis about BMI, BMD, and fractures. After adjusting to BMD, there is a relationship between BMI and fracture differs. Although the methods and analyses were sound and well laid out, the authors did not mention what statistical program was used for the analyses. The interpretation of the data was very confusing at times, particularly with respect to the tables. The formatting of the tables was not good. Traditionally Table 1 is a description of the population. The authors sort of put descriptive data in multiple tables, with different outcomes and/or exposures in the same columns. It was very confusing to read. Please also see edits made to the article PDF here .
