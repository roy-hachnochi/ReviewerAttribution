 General comments This is a cluster randomized controlled trial to compare two educational techniques for NRP training. The sample size is rather small even though the outcome measures are surrogates rather than major outcome measures. Background The NRP program is already web-based. The knowledge part is completed on line with subsequent local skills training. This is not clear from the facts given in the Background section. It is stated that the comparator background section that training has to be done in the capital city but these training programs usually have local hospital based instructors. A local based instructor is used in all Helping Babies Survive programs and would be the best comparator. The study design states that the objective of the intervention is the health care provider not the individual patient. However, the sample size is based on patient outcomes so this is unclear. Training will be done in groups of 10 or more. The group is larger than the usual recommended by resuscitation programs. The masking of the assessors of the practical component is not addressed. The sample size does not take into consideration that only about 10% of the babies will need resuscitation. Comparable studies such as the study by Szyld quoted by the authors have had 10 times as many patients or even more. Other countries such as Chile introduce NRP as a nationwide program and reported decreases in neonatal mortality using standard methods for training.
