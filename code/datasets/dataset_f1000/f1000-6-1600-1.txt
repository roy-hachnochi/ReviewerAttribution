The manuscript is still not fully acceptable. Please see our comments below: Fig. 2.: The conclusion that p110β is not responsible for at least some of the the IRS1–associated kinase activity in L-DKO mice is still not well supported by the evidence. The western blots in Fig. 1K are not convincing, and the quantified western blots in Fig. 1M have large error bars. In Fig. 2B, the p110beta antibody used for IP might be much less efficient than the IRS1 antibody in pulling down the enzyme. The IRS1 IPs should be assayed in the presence and absence of TGX-221, which is highly selective for p110beta in vitro. This assay is not more complicated than the ones already shown in the figure.
