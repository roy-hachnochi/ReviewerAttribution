Chaudhari et al. reported the physiologic roles of hepatic p110a and p85a in regulating insulin signaling and glucose homeostasis. They concluded that hepatic deletion of p110α and p85α (L-DKO) led to mild metabolic phenotype of the L-DKO mice and proposed that lipid kinases other than PI3Ks might compensate for the loss of p110α/p85α by signaling through unknown signaling pathway other than Akt signaling. Since deletion of p85α leads to improved insulin sensitivity and deletion of p110α leads to impaired insulin signaling and insulin resistance, it is interesting to learn that L-DKO mice showed an overall less severe metabolic phenotype compared to the L-p110a KO mice. Although the expression levels of p110b were decreased in the liver of L-DKO mice (Fig. 1E), IRS1-associated p110b levels were comparable between the control and KO mice (Fig. 1G). In addition, notable levels of p110b activity were maintained in the L-DKO mice and insulin treatment can stimulate the activity although it is 50% compared to the control (Fig. 2B). It is unclear why the authors concluded that the intact IRS1-associated kinase activity in the KO mice are not from the remaining p110b. The KO mice showed significantly impaired glucose tolerance and markedly increased fasting insulin levels (Fig. 4). What were the pancreatic phenotype of the KO mice? What were the levels of glucagon in the KO mice?
