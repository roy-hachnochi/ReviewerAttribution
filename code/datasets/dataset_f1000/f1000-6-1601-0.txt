There are two points I want to mention. These are as follows: Use of control in molecular docking: Docking score was used to filter the compounds as antiviral. Since docking score does not exactly estimate the binding free energy, decoys (control) should have been employed for comparisons to support the selection. Calculation of ligand efficiency (LE): There is lack of clarity regarding author’s explanation about LE. LE is usually defined as the average free energy of binding in kcal/mol per non-hydrogen atom 1 . It is fine as it is in the manuscript. References 1.

I confirm that I have read this submission and believe that I have an appropriate level of expertise to confirm that it is of an acceptable scientific standard.
