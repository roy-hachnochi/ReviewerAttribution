The present study by Jain et al entitled “ In silico analysis of natural compounds targeting structural and nonstructural proteins of chikungunya virus ” was undertaken to evaluate protein-ligand interactions of all chikungunya virus (CHIKV) proteins with natural compounds from a MolBase library in order to identify potential inhibitors of CHIKV. The authors have predicted three compounds, Catechin-5-O-gallate, Rosmarinic acid and Arjungenin, to interact with CHIKV proteins; two(Catechin-5-O-gallate and Rosmarinic acid) with capsid protein, and one (Arjungenin) with the E3 which required further in vitro studies to test their efficacy against CHIKV. The study is designed and executed properly, however there are few points which need to be addressed before consideration. The points are as follows: While considering drug like properties, authors have discarded molecules with 2 violations. Why did they not discard compounds with one violation? No control was used in molecular docking? Since the ligands were filtered mainly based on their docking score, ligand efficiency should have been taken as the criteria for selection. From the final three compounds, at least catechin-5-O-gallate and rosmarinic acid are associated with poor absolute oral bioavailability. Then how they can be advanced as drug candidates?
