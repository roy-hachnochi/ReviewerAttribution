This opinion article makes an important contribution to the ongoing and growing discussion of the use of antibodies in research. The main point is that validation goes beyond mere testing and that when selecting an antibody it is of critical importance for scientists to consider the data provided by the manufacturer in the light of the actual experiment it is intended for. This includes considerations of the relevant tissue, cell type and technique as well as the use of proper positive and negative controls. Minor comments: I strongly agree with Referee 2 regarding clarification of the statement ”Antibodies with a defined epitope / immunizing peptide are intrinsically more robust compared to antibodies raised to the entire proteins because the limited size of the antigen increases the chance of reproducible characteristics”. Such statement needs to be accompanied by references to actual data showing this. The current reference 8 is a review. I consider the sentence “and in the meanwhile the manufacturers and vendors do their utmost to deserve the scientist’s trust in their quality” highly subjective. This may be true in certain cases but I do not think that this can be extended to describe the behavior of the entire industry.
