The author provides a good overview of current issues with antibody validation. His proposal for a tiered approach to validation is well in line with suggestions from a recent workshop organized by the Global Biological Standards Institute (GBSI) 1 and also with published guidelines from the International Working Group on Antibody Validation (IWGAV) 2 . My main comment relates to the choice of controls. The author explains that "validation always involves comparison between expressing and non-expressing cells or tissues at identical antibody dilutions". In fact, reputable antibody manufacturers rarely show negative controls in their product specification sheets. This is not surprising since there is no comprehensive and definitive source of information about the distribution of proteins in tissues, cells or subcellular compartments. There are now precise maps for the transcriptome, and some researchers argue that mRNA levels are predictive of protein abundance 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 . However, published data do not provide a definitive answer to this question, so this remains a controversial issue. In my view, the author should discuss the problems associated with finding bona-fide negative controls for application-specific antibody validation. References 1.
