This study aims to investigate the difference of NAFLD among gender. The author described the methodology results, and discussion clearly, but there have some point that need to clarify. The author mentioned in the Introduction part “Various studies have demonstrated that NAFLD is more prevalent in men, elderly populations, and post-menopausal women 14”. Please add more evidence in this sentence! Methods add more details of adjusted prevalence estimation, why the author use this methods for prevalence estimation. (according to the Figure 3) the author described this is a population-based cross-sectional study that was represented to (Northeast of Thailand population). Do they try to use weighted analysis? This wording might not be a reason for the analysis “ignoring the effect of other factors for better handling the covariates in a more sophisticated statistical modeling” Results Table 1, No definition of “Underlying disease” and “Other underlying disease”, so please clarify these terms. Table 2, Please specify “age presence of DM” in the methods For odds ratio or adjusted prevalence estimation, no reason was mentioned “why do the author select only age, DM or other underlying to be in the model” Figure 2 and 3, please check “Other disease”, this is might be “Other underlying disease”. Figure 3, The graph presented sounds, but it might be unclear for interpretation. For example, after accounted for the possible confounder, the odds of DM was increased risk to NAFLD 4 times of crude OR. Moreover, for the other disease, the adjusted OR was lower than crude OR about 3 times. This is means that if people having some other diseases, they tended to having lower NAFLD. But we don’t know what a disease they have! Discussion Please add more details for others age group. Based on the Figures 2 and 3, the author mentioned only age 56-60. However, among 61-65 was greater risk to NAFLD as well.
