The authors surveyed 150 editors for their opinions of the knowledge and skills needed to edit scientific journals. In a modified Delphi process, the editors then rated the importance of dozens of competencies identified in a previous scoping review to create a list of minimum competencies to be addressed in editor-training programs. The survey and development processes seem reasonable and straightforward, and the results have high face validity, raise no concerns, and do not appear to be controversial. The authors accomplished their objective, which was to create an evidence-based list of core competencies that can form the basis for training editors of biomedical journals. The wording of the competency statements is not always parallel or specific, but the thrust of each is clear enough that reasonable people could develop each further.
