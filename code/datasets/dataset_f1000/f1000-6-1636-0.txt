This paper examines the functional properties of missense mutations in Ubiquitin-Like Modifier Activating Enzyme 1 (UBA1) found in patients with X-linked spinal muscular atrophy (XL-SMA). These rare mutations occur in the active adenylation domain of UBA1. To better understand how these mutations could be causing this motoneuron disease, the authors asked whether these mutations affected functional properties of this enzyme specifically UBA1 adenylation, thioester, and transthioesterification reactions in vitro . The data support that only the E557V mutation caused a significant decrease in UBA1 activity. The data were consistent from the different assays that analyzed UBA1â€™s ability to adenylate ubiquitin and transfer of the activated ubiquitin to a downstream E2 enzyme. However, this decrease was not complete and the other missense mutations did not show defects in UBA1 function in adenylation and downstream activities, thus the authors conclude that these functions of UBA1 do not contribute to the disease phenotype. In at least two assays the E557V mutations had decreased enzymatic activity. Does this correlate with the severity of the disease? That is, do patients with the E557V mutations exhibit earlier disease onset or more severe disease phenotypes? Figure 3. In the graph D576A is mis labeled as C576A Figure 3: What statistical test was used for Fig. 3? Figure 5: What posthoc analysis was used after the ANOVA? Figure 4: It is not possible to see the UBA1-S-Ub complex gel shift in the upper gel. It would be beneficial to show them at higher magnification for at least one time point.
