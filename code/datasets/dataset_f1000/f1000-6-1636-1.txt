Balak et al investigate the effect of one recurrent synonymous and three single-family missense mutations in the UBA1 gene, which this group and others have previously linked to X-linked spinal muscular atrophy. UBA1 is the first enzyme in the ubiquitin proteasome system which is responsible for tagging and degrading most cellular soluble proteins. Using in vitro assays, the authors investigated Uba1 adenylation, thioester, and transthioesterification reactions to determine possible biochemical effects of the missense variants. One hypothesis is that the disease causing UBA1 mutations result in loss of ubiquitin activation function. The authors present compelling data that ubiquitin activation and the transferred of the charged ubiquitin to an ubiquitin conjugating enzyme, E2, is not disrupted by the patient-derived mutations. Together the biochemical assays suggest that the mechanism of action may be alternative splicing of the UBA1 mutant gene product or selective ubiquitin transfer unto a yet to be determined E2 enzyme. Identifying the putative splice variant(s) or the aberrant E2 interaction and the downstream targets could shed light on why UBA1 mutations lead to X-linked SMA. This is a well written and elegantly done biochemical study. Minor concern: It is unclear why the first letter in ubiquitin is capitalized throughout the manuscript.
