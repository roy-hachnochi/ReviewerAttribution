The literature review is somewhat improved covering the background of studies such as this. A larger study that has taken place, which still required the self-selection of postdocs to complete the survey, has been discussed elsewhere 1 and it could be worth comparing this data with that. I still however have concerns about the claims this data tries to make, particularly on such a small and biased sample, sharing the concerns of Nick Riddiford's review. This dataset may be a useful preliminary indicator of some of the factors important to postdoc satisfaction, and while I am reassured that much of what appears supports conclusions elsewhere, I am very concerned at trying to draw meaningful conclusions from the work. In addition in the Supplementary data the list of postdoc associations in North America includes groups such as "Science Abroad", an organization of Israeli scientists abroad (which may address the comment in Nick Riddiford's report about the large proportion of Israeli-identifying participants in the survey data), which may not be limited to North America, and the Karolinska Institute, which is in Sweden, in Europe.
