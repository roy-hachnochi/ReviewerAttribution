This is a useful study, limited somewhat by the retrospective nature and patient numbers. CTE is a challenging condition to manage and this offers another valuable and seemingly safe treatment option. I would be interested to know if the authors have a dose preference given their experience for treating CTE. Do they wish to speculate on the mechanism of action of oral minoxidil in hair loss? It may be nice to see some of the scalp photographs of the treatment subjects. Does the visual shedding scale measure DAILY shedding? Clearly a larger study with a standardised dose and a control arm would strengthen the recommendation for the treatment.
