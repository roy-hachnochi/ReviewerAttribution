This article, by Dr. Monneret, presents many very salient points in reference to the article by Viglino et al. I would like to make a minor remark: In section 1, I think the article may benefit from a very brief mention of the biological differences between intermittent and sustained hypoxia - experimentally these exposures yield very different metabolic outcomes, and the mechanisms which underlie these effects (sympathetic activation, oxidative stress, tissue oxygen profiles, etc.) may be quite different in sustained hypoxia as in COPD, versus chronic intermittent hypoxia, as in OSA.
