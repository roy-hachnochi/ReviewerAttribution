This letter is interesting, written in good and fluent English, clearly addressing the limits of a paper attempting to find a link between obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and Non alcoholic Fatty Liver, in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonory disease (COPD). I agree with Monneret that one of the main limit of this paper, among others, is that it is quite difficult to differentiate the impact of OSA from that of COPD in fatty liver prevalence, because of the common respiratory nature of OSA and COPD and the common negative effect in oxygen saturation. Therefore, although the paper has the merit of pointing out that non alcoholic fatty liver disease can be present -and maybe more often present- in patients with COPD, more polysomnographic respiratory profiles should be provided, including oxygen desaturation measurements.
