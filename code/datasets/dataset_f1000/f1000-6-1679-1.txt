Ù‘First of all, Thank you so much to choose me as a reviewer. The research topic is new and very interesting. However, reading this article causes some question Would you please explain more about GEE? Why do you use this analysis method? I think the description of this method is empty in Data analysis Section. Has the researcher have a clinical experience to perform CBT in different subjects? How long did each session of CBT take? And how did the CBT session perform? Individually of in a group? Thank you so much again.
