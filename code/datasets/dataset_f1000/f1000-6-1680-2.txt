Title: Suitable for what you propose. Summary: Insert level of significance .. Introduction: I inserted data from other countries, to situate the reader on the subject in the world and not only in the country being studied. Method: The study used retrospective data with a sample of considerable size. In these data are not registered the experience of caries? It would be interesting to see the association between caries experience and going to the dentist. Why not use your dental history data for more than six months. Did the trip to the dentist in the last six months, in fact, reflect the problem? Results: well described. Discussion: Adequate and associated variables were discussed. I suggest a more consistent conclusion reporting the strategies to be carried out more clearly. In addition, I suggest that perhaps the authors could talk a bit about literacy in oral health that is problematic that comes before all the problems cited in the article.
