The scientific idea of this article to evaluate the adaptability of resin/dentine interface of the most commonly used direct aesthetic restorative material is superb. The article lacks the name of the company country of the main investigated material (flowable composite, Vertise-Flow). Despite the used method is well known for detection of nanoleakage of restorative materials, it is smartly employed for assessment of adaptability of composite at resin/dentine interface. The suggestions is logical but it is preferable to be separate item not involved in context of conclusion section. Summary: The article is presented clearly accurately The study design is appropriate Sufficient details were provided except the name of the company country of the investigated material (Vertise-Flow) The used method for detection of marginal gap is smartly employed The data are reproducible And the unique conclusion is obvious The suggestion is promising for further researches
