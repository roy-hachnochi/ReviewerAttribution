The authors describe the generation of a draft assembly for tule elk in the style of a brief genome announcement. For SNP detection and primer design this assembly is fine. It could e.g. be used in combination with Genotyping by Sequencing on additional individuals. Materials and methods are sound and provided in full. However a quick search of NCBI's taxonomy resource reveals that since June 2017 there is a genome assembly for red deer available https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/10790 . The authors therefore cannot claim to present the first whole genome assembly from the family Cervidae. Please change that statement. Suggested further improvements: Results I would have liked to see a figure for the total amount of sequence after filtering as a simple way of showing how good or bad the sequence run was. Table 1's readability would be improved by getting all figures to align right. I'd also recommend to add another assembly metric to look at the gene content; either using something like BUSCO or by mapping the refseq sequences of a related, well annotated species (e.g. cattle) against the draft genome. Methods Sample collection and library prep I see that each individual has two tissue samples. The authors entered a sample ID into the 'tissue' field of NCBI's BioSample database. I'd recommend removing this and adding the animal ID in the 'isolate' field. Please expand the entries in the 'isolation source' field. It says e.g. "Am. Cyn" which probably means American Canyon. Bioinformatics processing Checking the code I believe the statement "LEADING, TRAILING, and SLIDING parameters were set to 2" should read "LEADING and TRAILING parameters were set to 2".
