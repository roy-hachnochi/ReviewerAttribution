This article describes the generation of a draft genome (40X coverage from 4 animals) of the tule elk (Cervus elaphus nannodes). The research methods are fairly standard for the Illumina sequencing used. At 602,862 contigs, the genome is very prelminary and will require quite a bit of additional work in order for it to be applicable to a wide range of applications. The report basically falls into a category of a genome announcement.
