This is almost entirely a new paper, with very extensive additional analysis. This recognizes the previously noted limitations but uses a modelling approach to address them, taking the paper in a somewhat different direction. While it is important to continue to view the paper as a methodological rather than empirical paper, seen in this light I feel it is much improved. I would prefer that you received comments from someone with greater expertise in the methods used than me, but as far as I can see it now addresses my previous concerns.
