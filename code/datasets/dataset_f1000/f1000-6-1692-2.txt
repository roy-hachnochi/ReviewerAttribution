Despite the small improvements there still remain important issues. The comparison with Burkina-Faso is completely uninspired and demonstrate that the author(s) is not aware at all of the whole image related to Roma population. Another important issue is related to the extremely small size of the sample. Only 135 persons (on average 27 from each region) is extremely unsignificant from a statistical point of view. Also, there is a large number of Roma population that came from Romania and currently live in different EU countries, on a long-term basis; are they included in the same population? Again, the paper still remains a collection of results from official statistics without adding anything new or relevant.
