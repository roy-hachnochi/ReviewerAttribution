While the authors have added some clarity, I remain concerned about the small sample size and other limitations. I don't think they have enough data to draw any conclusions and it is not obvious to me that it has been rewritten as a proof of concept paper. For example, the abstract has, in the conclusions "This paper demonstrates..." whereas I really don't think it does (although in fact, what is concluded is quite well known). I still think it could be revised to be much less ambitious.
