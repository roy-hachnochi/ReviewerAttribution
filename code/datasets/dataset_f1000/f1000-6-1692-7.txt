The main issue is related to the size of the sample and its geographical distribution. It is hard to generalize over the entire Roma minority the conclusions of the study even if the statistical approach is appropriate. The geographical distribution of the Roma population is pretty different over the Romanian national territory. The lack of indication of the geographical area of the subjects of the sample is a flaw. Another issue regards the random walk method for sampling which, in our opinion, is not representative for the entire Roma population. Maybe a multilevel sampling would be more appropriate than a simple random walk. Despite the fact that the conclusions of the study are correct, these are pretty well known to all levels; also these are commonplaces that were specified in the documents of Decade of Roma Inclusion as directions for future action. There are a lot of significant reports that draw the same conclusions (see The World Bank documents for instance 1 ). From this point of view, there is no original approach to the Roma problem in Romania. The conclusion following the Decade of Roma Inclusion is that despite the efforts that there were made, there still remain lots of issues regarding the integration of the Roma population. Also,solving great structural problems of Romania will certainly improve the Roma population situation.
