This manuscript describes that taxonomic and cell-size patterns provided evidence for niche-based contributions to microbial community development on maize leaves across host leaf stages. Although the cell-size trait patterns by SEM for evaluations of microbial communities looks really novel in this area, the criteria for the cell-size trait are not fully described in this manuscript. I recommended that the authors more clearly explain the criteria for the cell-size trait in the text for readers who want to follow the methodology and criteria. From Figure 2, there are many shapes and length of bacterial cells on the surface of maize leaves. However, they were transformed ranks in Fig. 3B and Fig. 5, which were likely classified into size-class unit (SCU) s1~s35 through size-class unit (SCU) by SEM image analysis. Can the authors present the 35 SCUs for readers in the text? Are the SCU determinations based on both cell size and cell shapes (rod or coccus)? I believe that these efforts and explanations would improve the quality of this manuscript for more broad readers including microbiologists beyond many technical arguments.
