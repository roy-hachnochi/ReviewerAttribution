Interesting and useful paper. My quibbles are With the numbers. In the abstract is says “1174 students from 100 countries have registered”. In the introduction, it says “1256 people, from 80 countries, have enrolled.” From the data presented (and the repetition in the Results paragraph) it appears that the first of these is correct – although I have some doubts given the round numbers (100, 80) of countries cited. In methods it merely states that “A suite of courses was developed” – it would be interesting to know by whom the suite of courses was developed and when. Some background would be welcome. The second paragraph in the Results has some lapses in language (“a number of questions were asked to the students”, “the majority of students came as a recommendation from someone else”. The whole paragraph should be redrafted. There is a typo in Box 1 in the longest quote – at the top of the column “but does not” should be “but does not”. There is some repetition throughout – for example, the second paragraph of the discussions repeats some of the second para of the results.
