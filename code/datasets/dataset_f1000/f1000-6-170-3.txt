The institution seems like it is doing wonderful work and represents an interesting approach to open online courses. The courses offered by the institution seem useful and provide a learning opportunity for participants with an emphasis on those in developing countries. The structure of the courses could probably be improved by using pedagogical principles and learning theory with respect to design, but I think that is probably true of most open online courses. It also does not seem to fall within the scope of this research note, and I mention it only because so much attention is paid by the authors to the course design. This note represents what could possibly become a reasonable study of effectiveness of this innovative approach to open online courses, and I encourage the authors to build on this early work by designing a rigorous method and incorporating some analysis of the data.
