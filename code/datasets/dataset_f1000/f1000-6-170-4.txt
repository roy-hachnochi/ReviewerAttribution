This study on "Open Online Courses in Public Health: experience from Peoples-uni" is very insightful as it shares findings of a unique Public health course offered by Peoples-uni. Observations Grammatical expression was a bit poor. I suggest paper should be reviewed by an English expert for better clarity. Flowery languages in the text should be discouraged (eg..."an army of volunteer tutors", "a sister site", "a suite of courses was developed" etc. Result: This statement is not clear "S ome students enrolled in more than one course and we report on enrolments in 1 597 courses " Is this referring to student population or number of courses enrolled in? Furthermore, please take note of typographical errors (eg, OOCs instead on MOOCs).
