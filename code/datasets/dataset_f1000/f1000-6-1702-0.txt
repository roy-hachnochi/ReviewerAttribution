 Is the background of the case’s history and progression described in sufficient detail? Partly Comment: The background fails to describe the ophthalmic diagnostic characteristics of Morning Glory Syndrome. Are enough details provided of any physical examination and diagnostic tests, treatment given and outcomes? No Comment: Case describes only a patient with decreased visual acuity, and nothing specific to Morning Glory. Authors don’t provide information about the clinical eye exam to establish the 3 defining clinical features: i.e., enlarged disc, chorioretinal pigmentary changes around the optic disc, a glial tuft overlying the disc. Decreased visual acuity is insufficient to establish diagnosis. There is no opthalmoscopic findings, no funduscopic findings. The MR findings don’t match those of Morning Glory. Additionally, the MR details don’t mention whether the scan involved orbital cuts. Is sufficient discussion included of the importance of the findings and their relevance to future understanding of disease processes, diagnosis or treatment? Yes Comment: The discussion is the best part of the case report. The relevance is questionable since the case is unlikely to be Morning Glory Syndrome. Is the case presented with sufficient detail to be useful for other practitioners? No Commentary: Detail is insufficient and this case absolutely shouldn’t be available to clinicians.
