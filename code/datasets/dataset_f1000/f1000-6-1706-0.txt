First, it is weird that my comments were not addressed by the authors. Second, I don't see an improvement compared to the first version Mixing microarray and RNA-Seq Claiming the importance of PfEMP1 which makes no sense in in vitro experiments, more over as generally just the exon2 have random expressions. Not explaining why they filter 60% of the genes away, and figure 3 suggest less than 1700 genes were used. Why not using a different dataset, as another reviewer mentioned to prove the results. Third, the code should be made available. Fourth, a lot of little things. The dataset was over 48h, from 0h - 48h. Genes are expressed, not proteins.
