This Opinion Article by Serge Nataf is a brilliant synthesis; it integrates seemingly unrelated observations to build a coherent model that explains unsung relationships between natural “homuncular” autoimmunity and nervous system development. Nataf’s model of the co-evolution of the immune and nervous systems is seminal biological thinking that bridges evolution, physiology, clinical medicine, health and disease. Readers will respond with challenges, experimental tests, and new understanding.
