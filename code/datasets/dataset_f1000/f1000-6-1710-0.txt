The correspondence is a comment directly related to “A study of problems encountered in Granger causality analysis from a neuroscience perspective 1 . I completely agree with the authors that there are interpretation issues of Granger causality (and by the way also a lot of wrong use/wrong adaptation in the field) and therefore the whole concept has to be applied with care. But – like the authors clearly stated in their comment – Stokes and Purdon uses 1) a version of frequency-domain Granger causality which is a least sub-optimal and 2) the results they were able to show by means of simulated data should be a general problem not only occurring in the case of neuroscience data. Therefore, I explicitly support the comment of Faes, Stramaglia and Marinazzo. The comment is well written. Basic information concerning the concept of Granger causality and in particular the frequency-domain approach are given (including the coverage of related literature). The main idea behind the paper of Stokes and Purdon and the reason why the authors felt the need to comment on this paper are clearly stated. Then, the simulations of Stokes and Purdon are repeated using an updated Granger causality implementation and a combination of spectral and causal information. Technical details are given, results are correctly presented and well described, and conclusions are drawn. I do not have any major or minor concerns.
