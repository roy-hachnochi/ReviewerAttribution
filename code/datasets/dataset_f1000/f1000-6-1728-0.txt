I’m generally satisfied with the authors' response, although I really hoped to see more previous-years data than just one year before the event - in my opinion the case for the “doldrums effect” becomes progressively more convincing the better you can show that these conditions were indeed really unusual. Also, next time, please consider using some form of graphs rather than tables to illustrate this type of data (perhaps a scatterplot of wind speed vs temperature, points colored by month?... Or, overlaid temperature and wind speed line graphs for the event time vs previous years?)
