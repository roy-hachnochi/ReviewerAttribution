This is a compact report of an unusual bleaching episode, presenting an interesting hypothesis that it could have been caused by anoxia during atypical doldrums conditions. Both are valuable for improving our understanding of factors affecting coral survival in times of changing climate. While there is no way to rigorously prove that the doldrums hypothesis is true, it certainly seems reasonable (and the wording throughout the paper is appropriate – there is never a claim that doldrums actually caused the observed bleaching). That said, the paper would greatly benefit from expanded characterization of the doldrums episode, beyond tables 1 and 2. Is it possible to make wind speed and temperature graphs for broader range of dates (start in April) and compare that to conditions in the same time in previous years? This might show what was actually the most unusual – early temperature anomaly, low wind anomaly (by the way absolute values in Table 2 are not very informative without knowing how much below typical they are), or a combination of the two? Come to think of it, wave height could be a better proxy of water movement on the reef than wind speed, if it is possible to get that data (from satellite?). Minor things: “Tissue mortality beginning in the center of the colony typically indicates anoxia, which often occurs in aquaria with inade- quate ow or oxygenation (pers obs)” – I am not quite happy with the word “typically” used in a statement supported by nothing but personal observation… Can you please try once more to look up literature on this? (this is why my answer in "partly" to the literature citing question). This would also strengthen the doldrums case. “The bleaching mortality index was calculated following [16]” – as far as I can see, this index is not actually used for anything in the paper, so maybe it is not necessary? If keeping it, please expand a little: “The bleaching mortality index was calculated by [doing this and that], following [16].”
