The case is well described and interesting. I have only a few minor observations: On page 3, line 1 and 2, consultant and consultation is repeated several times: I would also use synonyms to avoid repeating the same words At least the use of some acronyms must be explicitly expanded, eg ABG, BP, HR Line 11 page 3: "b / l" must be written in full
