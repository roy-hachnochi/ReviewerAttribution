The work describe the whole genome sequence of wild species of Oryza coarctata species that exclusively grow under saline water and thus will be an important source of salinity tolerance genes. These genes can later be used to introduce salinity tolerance in commercial cultivars of rice. The authors used Illumina and Oxford nanopore sequencing platforms to generate 372.48X data. The genome sequencing methods seems good enough but authors have discussed very little about the annotation of the genome data. I can understand that there is word limit under Data Note in F1000Research, but still by looking at the discussion, I think analysis portion is weak point in this paper. Authors should provide a comparative note on the genome of Oryza sativa and Oryza coarctata. How this species is tolerating such a high saline conditions, which kind of genes/osmoregulators are involved in this adaptation should be discussed along with comparison to O. sativa . How many different genes were predicted should be mentioned. Authors found approximately 1605 non-coding RNAs? I am not sure, what are trying to tell here, this number should be high as per my opinion. There are some minor mistakes like; in the affiliation the word “Delhi” is not required. The word, “Primary” should be inserted in the first paragraph last line of Introduction. So the correct sentence will be "...in the primary gene pool...".
