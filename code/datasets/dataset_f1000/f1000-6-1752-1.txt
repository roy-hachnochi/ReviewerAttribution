The authors provide a concise summary of the figures that go into estimating the number of neurons in retina, LGN, and V1 that are involved in a visual discrimination task. There are clearly a number of assumptions that go into such a calculation, but the authors do a good job of stating these assumptions explicitly and citing the relevant literature. One exception is the figure that 90% of RGCs project to LGN (specifically dorsal LGN in this case). This figure will also depend on eccentricity because the proportion of parasol and midget RGCs (which do project to dLGN) depends on eccentricity. In peripheral retina, the fraction of dLGN-projecting RGCs is far below 90% in primates. With this relatively simple fix, I think this short paper will provide a nice reference for calculations of cell counts in the early visual pathways.
