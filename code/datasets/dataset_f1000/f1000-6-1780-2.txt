I. - In introduction there is only little information regarding of nuclear expression of p63. - It doesn't mention about cytoplasmic p63 expression. What is significance function of p63 in tumor progression or disease progression? It written in result and analysis. - In introduction you haven't discussed yet about the incidence of triple negative breast cancer in the worldwide, Asia or Indonesia ? II. In the methods, to classify TNBC morphology into Basal like and non Basal like, based on only, antibody (CK 5/6) but you didn't perform EGFR staining. Which is one of the marker of TNBC. - Is there any reference about the scoring of intensity and the percentage of positivity of expression of p63? - Is there any reference about imunoreactive score? III. In discussion, there is also no information about cytoplasmic p63 and its role in disease progression. - Researcher only stated that cytoplasmic p63 expression has predictive value to classify breast cancer into TNBC and there is no comparison of p63 expression sensitivity and specificity with other TNBC marker as like CK 5/6 and EGFR which has been routinely used.
