Different methods are used in determination of the leached-elements from dental restorations intra-orally are reported. Some of these methods have been performed both in vitro and vivo , using different analytical techniques. They were carried out via surrounding media, such as distilled water or artificial saliva. However, these methods still having some reservations and almost take a great effort. In the present article, the author used very simple and new technique for measuring the leached elements from amalgam restorations via fabricated polymeric night guards for the tested patients suffering from bruxism. The concentrations of the leached elements after removing the night guards were measured using SEM with EDAX spectroscopy. In my opinion, the article is accepted for publication after answering the following questions: The results of EDAX (Fig. 5) have detected the Hg, O, S and Ca elements. The author did not address the sources of sulfur and calcium where they came from? It is known that the amalgam contains some other metals such as copper and silver and yet none of them appeared in the analysis. Why? It is well known that hydrogen has no spectrum in analysis by using EDAX technique and hence the paragraph in the discussion section (page 6) begins with" However, hydrogen was not detected……..….. case of hydrogen 25 " must be deleted. In the future, the author must do the same study on patients who do not have bruxism for comparison.
