This article published by Jens Freese et al. discussed the potential explanations of metabolic epidemic from the viewpoint of the metabolic flexibility sharped by evolutionary through millions of years, and a combination of present-day continuous food abundance, sedentary lifestyle, and psycho-emotional stress. In their manuscript, Jens Freese et al suggested metabolic programs relying on fatty acid and ketone body oxidation are most of the time shut off due to modern lifestyle and have to be reintegrated in order to overcome the obesity epidemic. The storyline of ‘Survival the most flexible’ section could be more clear if the description could be more concise and focusing on how evolution sharped the metabolic flexibility. For example, the content of ‘It’s all about survival: Why evolution shaped metabolic flexibility’ seems discussed the interplay of metabolic programs in brain and other organs (e.g., skeletal muscle and adipocytes) which could be combined into the first section. The sections regarding uricase mutation could also be more straightforward by describing the importance of this mutation (e.g., more efficient metabolism of fructose and fat stores) in the way of evolution. In the section of ‘Sedentary lifestyle’, the authors described a modern lifestyle which is opposite to the ‘The hunter and gatherer lifestyle’. Accordingly, this section could also benefit from a more concise storyline by comparisons such as sedentary behavior vs foraging mode. Besides molecular-level evidence, there are also quite a lot of epidemiological evidence has highlighted the importance of environmental, and behavioral (dietary and sedentary behaviors) factors in the progress of metabolic health outcomes. Incorporation of these evidences will provide more insight into how to re-cultivate of suppressed evolutionarily metabolic programs and make the proposed model more convincing and readily understood for the researchers in the field as well as the general readers.
