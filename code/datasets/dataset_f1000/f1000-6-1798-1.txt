Thanks for the opportunity to review. In this manuscript, the authors validated the LACE index on identifying high risk elderly patients in a selected Portuguese population. 1407 patients were retrospectively recruited to evaluate the performance of LACE on its associations with the risk of readmission or death in 30 days and 90 days. The results were consistent with several similar international studies and the authors suggested that the LACE index should be used with reservations. The study is well designed and the manuscript is clearly written. The methods are reported in a standard approach and the results are sufficient in supporting the conclusions. One suggestion: since 90-day outcome is studied, the authors are suggested to add in the results on 90-day readmission or death into Table 2 and Figure 4. In Methods (study population subsection, first paragraph second sentence), the authors mentioned that they included all “acute” patients, so please define “acute” and explain why these patients from the Internal Medicine Service were studied (for example, are they are subset of all internal medical patients?). As shown in the results that “admissions were predominantly emergencies (99.6%)”, the authors need to clarify the actual inclusion criteria.
