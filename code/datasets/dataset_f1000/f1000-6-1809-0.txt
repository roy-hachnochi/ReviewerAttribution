Thank you for giving me this opportunity to review this article. The review is well written and focused and gives a good overview of the subject and possibility of utilising coffee husk gasification for sustainable energy in Uganda. I only made a few notable observations which are outlined below: There are some sections with bold and factual statements which needs to be backed by literature. An example is on page 2, paragraph 2, where uses of rice husks in Uganda are discussed. Another example is this sentence from page 4: With the exclusion of biomass, whose energy contribution is significant, the other sources contribute ~5% of the countryâ€™s total energy consumption. Some factual statements are referenced but the authors can go on and find some statistics on coverage - an example is page 4, second paragraph. This sentence on page 5 is not complete: Currently, the (Figure 5 and Figure 6) 15 Make this sentence more clearer in meaning: The annual generation of coffee husks in Uganda is estimated to be 46.6 M tons per annum, rising from 172 M tons per annum reported in 2004 - what is rising here? The energy needs to be solved are distributed around Uganda and so also is the cultivation of coffee. The authors need to consider the logistical and economic implications of their proposal and recommend how the gasification plants and energy produced will be distributed for the benefit of the rural peasants who are currently using firewood as source of fuel.
