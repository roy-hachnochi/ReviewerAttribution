Although this manuscript is showing a web platform to look at genes involved in PCOS patients in oocyte, cumulus cells and granulosa cells, some concerns should also be considered and is not addressed here. Bias can be obtained because of the method of RNA isolation, purification and RNA amplification that may be different between published papers. The datasets were validated using cellular specific gene expression but nothing is mentioned about cellular contamination, reference genes (housekeeping genes), ... Because the data are classified by study using raw values for specific gene for each sample, it becomes highly difficult to grasp meaningful information. It would have been helpful to further analyze the data and not only showing the raw data of each sample. In conclusion, it seems to be a good platform to run a quick analysis looking at several studies.
