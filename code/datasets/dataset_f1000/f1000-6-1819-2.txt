The authors present interesting data about the possible associations between socioeconomic status (night-time lights and industrial density) and chronic respiratory diseases. The manuscript is well written, the methods and the results sections are adequate, and should be of great interest to the readers. Overall, it is an important study, but their limitations are not mentioned. For example, ecological studies do not permit cause-and-effect conclusions or evidence that risk-modifying factors are related to risk of the disease , since they do not link individual exposure histories to individual outcome events. Thus, I believe the authors can provide a paragraph on the limitations of the study.
