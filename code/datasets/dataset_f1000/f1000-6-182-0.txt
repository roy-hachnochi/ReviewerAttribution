TITLE: Too long. Summarize as: Prevalence and risk factors of low back pain among public technical institute staff in Kurdistan Region, Iraq. 1 ABSTRACT: Sample size (n=70) is rather small, potentially leading towards possible spurious associations (wide confidence intervals). P values should be presented with exact values, not p0.05. Should include limitation of the study due to small sample size. Add keywords. INTRODUCTION: Accepted. Please correct typhos. METHODS: Study design is accepted. Sampling was flawed: initially it appeared to be sampling from two populations (academic and support staff) but later only simple random sampling was applied. Sample size estimation was not done; hence, the sample size obtained (n=70) is very much an under sampling error, leading to possible spurious associations. Questionnaire validation was not done properly: back translation from Kurdish to English language was not done. Statistical Analysis: Too short. Need to elaborate on the logistic regression modelling approach. RESULTS:Table 1 is accepted. Figure 1 is incomplete (asterisks for significant associations were not indicated on the figure). Table 2 on logistic regression should include the Naegelkerke's R square. DISCUSSION: Generally accepted. However, need to mention the limitation of the study and the possible spurious association between smoking status, job tenure, and LBP. Since there was no mention of the variance explained by the two independent variables on LBP, there should be a short discussion on other possible determinants of LBP among these workers. CONCLUSIONS: Generally acceptable. However, need to emphasize the importance of ensuring adequate sample sizes in future studies to avoid under sampling and associated statistical issues.
