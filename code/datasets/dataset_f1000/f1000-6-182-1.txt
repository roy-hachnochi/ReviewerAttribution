Title: rewrite the title and make it short Abstract: Add background of the study. Accepted Introduction: Accepted Methodology: Accepted Analysis and results: Multiple logistic regression, It is actually binary logistic regression analysis. Figure 1, it is not well fitted. Either delete it or present in cross-table. Insufficient description of logistic regression analysis, please, add model fitting information, sample size, GOF etc. Relationship between LBP and smoking appeared to be spurious because of very wide 95% confidence interval. Please, recheck smoking status and LBP in cross table to see the optimum cell frequency. Conclusion: Accepted.
