The tool provides an interesting feature to help declutter visualizations of biological networks using localization information. Some comments: It would be good if the names of the used databases was stated in the last paragraph of the introduction. The tool would be more intuitive for new users, if it provided descriptions the various colors used on the site with the same explanation as in the paper. For example, the colored boxes that represent localizations in the search results and the dot colors used for the protein visualization on the cell map. It is unclear from the paper all the types of interactions might be shown in the represented networks. Also, it is unclear from the paper, what happens to the network visualization in the cases where the identified proteins are present in multiple locations.
