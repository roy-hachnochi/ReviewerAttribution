The authors describe a tool for visualising PPI networks in the context of the subcellular localisation of the searched protein. I have twice tried to review this paper and both times the http://cell.dallago.us link gave me a MongoDB error. I have therefore had to review the paper without being able to view the tool. This is not satisfactory. I was unable to test the conclusions about the tool and its findings. The tool uses a static interaction compilation database (HIPPIE) as the source of PPIs. Did the authors not consider using the PSICQUIC web service, which gives the users considerably more options as to where to source their PPI data from, and also allows the visualisation of protein-small molecule interactions and also potentially the site of action of protein-drug interactions, also available via PSICQUIC. It would also allow the data to be as up to date as the latest release of each database, which will be more frequent than releases of HIPPIE. I am not clear where the subcellular location data comes from. This may be obvious to regular users of CellMap but not to me, an should be stated in the paper for other user who do not know this.
