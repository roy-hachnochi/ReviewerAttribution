The rationale behind the study is well explained and on the most part the methods are described in full. Importantly the authors provide full details of experimental design, including power calculations and planned statistical analyses. They also propose the use of sequential design which is very unusual in preclinical research, but can be used more widely. Overall there are no major concerns regarding the planned study but the report would benefit from additional detail and clarification in a few places as detailed below: The authors do not specify what will be their primary endpoint and what will constitute secondary analyses. The study is powered on the Staircase test which would imply that this is being taken as the primary outcome. The title and abstract should be amended to clarify this, and the latter should also have details of the secondary outcomes that are being assessed. The abstract would benefit from additional details on the age and sex of mice used. Page 2: The authors indicate no grants were involved in supporting the work. It is possible to clarify therefore exactly how the work was supported, since presumably the funds had to come from somewhere. Page 5: Clarify if a homeothermic feedback system used to maintain body temperature. Page 5: Clarify if modified diet provided to aid post-stroke recovery and on similar lines if fluid replacement instigated. Page 5: Clarify why systemic analgesia not used. Page 5: Clarify how dosing regimen decided on. Page 5: Clarify why only male mice being used. Page 6: For rotarod clarify why best run being used rather than average. Page 6: Please specify endpoints (days post MCAo) when animals are perfused. Page 7: day 5 has not been previously specified as an endpoint. Have the authors pre-specified sufficient outcome-neutral tests for ensuring that the results obtained can test the stated hypotheses, including positive controls and quality checks? Yes
