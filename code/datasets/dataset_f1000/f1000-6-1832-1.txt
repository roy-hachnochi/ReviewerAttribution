Here the authors describe evaluation of three immunosuppressant drug immunoassays on the Roche Cobas e411 analzyer. The authors evaluated the performance of assays for cyclosporine, tacrolimus and sirolimus on the system, which included imprecision, linearity and functional sensitivity studies as well as method comparisons and lot-to-lot comparisons. They compared the assay performance to the performance of the same assays on the Abbott immunoassay system and to LC MS/MS assays for the same analytes. I have a few comments that, if the authors could address, I feel would strengthen the manuscript. In the methods section, it’s not clear to me whether the measurements were performed using the Roche, Abbott and LC-MS/MS methods on the same day. It is mentioned that some specimens were stored prior to analysis. Could the authors clarify this? What are the immunoassays and LC-MS/MS methods traceable to? Is there a standard? This information would be helpful. The authors mention that the Roche assays were calibrated five times over the course of the study. Is this in fitting with the manufacturer’s recommendations? How does this calibration frequency compare to the Abbott system? The authors should discuss the limitation of performing imprecision studies using only one lot number of reagent. The authors should include a description of the LC MS/MS method that was used. There is currently no mention of this methodology until the results section. There are several grammatical errors throughout the manuscript and I would recommend that the authors read it through carefully to correct these.
