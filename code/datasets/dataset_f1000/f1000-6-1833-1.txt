Well written report assessing the issue. Methods clearly described. Agree with general comments of the first reviewer. In addition to Dr. Burnett's editorial comments, I have several additional suggestions. On page 4 in the Characteristics section, please clarify whether it's 31 or 32 studies reviewed. In Tables 2 and 3, I suggest the column entitled "Targeted/Vaccinated" be inverted so that the numerator and denominator are in the appropriate relationship in the column. I find that the provision of costs in Table 3 is not really helpful to policy makers. As written, the text just describes facts but does not provide an interpretation of the implications for other programs. Also, I'm not sure comparing SIV programs that use different vaccines, in different countries, is very helpful either. The cost per immunized person is very contextual. Clearly, the SBV programs are limited to HPV whereas the SIV studies are a mlange of vaccines and approached. Perhaps there can be more discussion of how this (and the related social issues) could skew the results.
