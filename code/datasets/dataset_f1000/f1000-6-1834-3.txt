This study aims to examine the cultivable denitrifying microbial consortia from marine environment near deep-sea shipwrecks in the Gulf of Mexico. The authors hypothesized that the shipwrecks could influence the microbial population involved in denitrification. The methods used in this study, however, have not adequately tested this hypothesis, as no control samples were obtained. On the other hand, the authors were able to report enrichment of two interesting bacterial consortia, one of which appeared to perform denitrification at a much faster rate than that measured for most known industrial microbial consortia, providing an opportunity to study these bacteria in more detail in the future. If I understood correctly, only a single water sample from each location was used for the denitrifying Biological Activity Reaction Test, allowing to isolate a denitrifying consortium per sampling site. It is likely that these bacteria occur in a patchy manner in the environment, thus further sampling may reveal very different denitrifying consortia. Broadening the sampling effort is needed to test if either environmental factors or presence of shipwrecks affects the diversity of denitrifying bacteria.
