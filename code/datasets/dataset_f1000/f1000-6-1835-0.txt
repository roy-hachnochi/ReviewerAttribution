Whitefly ( Bemisia tabaci ) is becoming a global hazard for crop and ornamental plants. Identification of correct species is always better for the implication of best control strategy. In this regard, the effort made by Boykin et al for speedy and accurate identification of B. tabaci species complex is very significant. Additionally, the dataset developed with enriched quality is also very useful for whitefly biologist working in the area of evolution, mitochondrial genomics and crop management. All the bioinformatics tools used to generate this refined dataset are ideal to make such analysis.
