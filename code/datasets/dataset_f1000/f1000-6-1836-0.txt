The authors have presented the growing burden of hypertension in Thailand and its association with the socioeconomic status. The paper is relevant to the current scenario of increasing burden of Noncommunicable diseases. I have a suggestion, please add the reference: Kearney et al. (2005) 1 to the reference number 4. Since, this study is about hypertension, it would be nice to explain more on the diagnosis criteria used for hypertension. The result section of the abstract is not very clear.
