Comments: Language in abstract is unreadable, especially in the results part. Please provide the sample size for each stage of sampling, if equal sample size strategy was used. What is the ultimate sampling unit? If household, were all individuals in the selected household included in the survey? Did the analysis take into account the multistage sampling design? If not, the present estimations were not reliable, as sampling error might get probably underestimated. The results for every study year are much similar, and the SES effects on HT should not change during short period. So, what is the point of annually independent analysis?
