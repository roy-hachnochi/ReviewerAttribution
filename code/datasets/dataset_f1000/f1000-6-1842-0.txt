The authors report results of a pilot study looking at postoperative administration of acetaminophen in reducing the incidence of postoperative delirium (POD) after cardiac surgery in elderly patients. I believe that the authors are asking an important question whether adequate or superior pain relief is associated with reduced POD rates after cardiac surgery. Concerns: It is not clear to me why this pilot study is referred to as a feasibility trial. Both dexmedetomidine and acetaminophen are used routinely in many cardiac centres. Please comment. I would strongly advise against quoting outcome measures as percentages of patients, you have 3 patients per group, e.g., quoting 2/3 (67%) is misleading. The authors found that DEX group received twice as much opioids compared to the other groups. It is in contrary with previous studies identifying opioid sparing effects of DEX. (e.g. Anaesthesiology 2016; 124(2): 362-8; Lancet 2016; 15;388(10054): 1893-1902), however, it could be contributed to small sample size and the DEX administration protocol. Please comment. If I understood correctly DEX was given until extubation or for 6 hours postoperatively. Not a standard administration practice for DEX. Please comment on rational for this design. With respect to pain relief after cardiac surgery, spinal/epidural analgesia has been associated with superior pain relief and significant opioid sparing effects, however, there are no studies that have shown a reduction in delirium rates with either of these techniques. Please comment if acetaminophen may have some intrinsic properties other than analgesia in reducing POD after cardiac surgery.
