Although this study is considered a pilot trial, the small number of patients 12 divided into 4 groups is a serious flaw in methodology. The interpretation of the data is completely meaningless not even as a feasibility study. I believe this study should not be more than a run-in phase for a proper pilot with reasonable numbers. I do not recommend publication in F1000. Thanks.
