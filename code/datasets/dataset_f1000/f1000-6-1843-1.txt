This is a well structured paper that clearly describes the community consensus building required to ensure data interoperability in the wheat community. Given this is the second revision of the manuscript, this work is relatively mature and there is little for me to add in way of suggestions to improve the manuscript. Having said that, the manuscript may benefit from further expansion on how both the recommendation itself and specifically the curation of the ontologies in AgroPortal will be maintained in the future. It may also be interesting to add a section on how this work may be disseminated and made useful to stakeholders outside of the Wheat Interoperability community, given that this work has arisen out of an RDA working group.
