This paper is the outcome of a well designed and executed research plan. It has clearly reviewed the current literature and background of the research, and the objectives of their research, and clear explanation of materials and methods which can be used and replicated in similar research work on different fishes. The statistical analysis applied for this type of research is simple, logical and interpreted very well. The results are given based on the clear and measured outcomes of the methods applied in the experiment which is applicable and reproducible in similar research work on the induced and artificial propagation of fishes (especially on freshwater fishes). The conclusions are clearly based on the measured and practically approved results, with no particular limitations being addressed. This article is good enough to be indexed with its present condition, and I did not find any problem in the English language used,.
