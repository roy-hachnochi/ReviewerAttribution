This research was well done and provides valuable analysis and insight into an ongoing challenge that is faced in monitoring fruit fly quarantines. One point of note is the base developmental threshold reported for the Medfly DD model of 53.3 F should be 54.3 F. I am not sure if this was a typo in the manuscript or if it was carried through the calculations. This would likely impact the length of the PQL for the degree day models in both the lower and higher latitude areas, but I do not think that the results would be dramatically different. I recommend that this be checked and revised if necessary. In my opinion, the ABS models do provide an improvement to the estimations of Predicted Quarantine Length and can be a beneficial tool in the regulatory area.
