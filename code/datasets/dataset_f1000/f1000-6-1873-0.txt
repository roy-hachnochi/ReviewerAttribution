The work of Aibana et al. is highly relevant regarding TB treatment outcomes in Ukraine. The authors have made an excellent improvement considering all previous corrections made by the reviewers. The article is well-written and the results are critical for the guidelines of the national TB program. Nevertheless, I have some very minor revisions that can be easily amended. I think these corrections would improve the quality of the manuscript. Abstract: In the results section, you added "Frequent alcohol use (OR 1.81; 95% CI 0.93 - 3.55; p 0.08) and smear positivity (OR 1.75; 95% CI 1.03 - 2.97; p 0.04) were also associated with poor treatment outcomes." However, the p value of alcohol use was 0.08, and cannot be considered to be statistically significant. I would rather change the sentence to: "Smear positivity (OR 1.75; 95% CI 1.03 - 2.97; p 0.04) was also associated with poor treatment outcomes." Methods: M960 system should also include: (Becton Dickinson Microbiology System, Sparks, NV, USA) if it is the case. "For the multivariate model, we included baseline variables previously known to be associated with poor outcomes (age, sex, HIV, high alcohol consumption, homelessness) and any variable associated with poor outcomes at p value less than 0.2 in the univariate analysis." Should it not be less than 0.5? Results: In the first paragraph two sentences (340 and 75) start with a number. You spell out numbers at the start of a sentence. Discussion: "We found that majority of TB patients were identified through passive case finding, which may also contribute to poor treatment outcomes." change to "We found that the majority of TB patients were identified through passive case finding, which may also contribute to poor treatment outcomes." References: I think outdated references such as Schluger et al , 1995 and Volmink and Garner, 1997, should be deleted.
