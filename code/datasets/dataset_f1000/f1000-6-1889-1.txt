They use very large cohorts for the study. The authors found an accumulation of hematological neoplasia in the US cohort. This circumstance is probably due to a selection bias, as the attending physician is a haemato-oncologist. The accumulation of malignant skin tumours could also be caused by a photosensitisation due to mast cell activation disease, as many patients suffer from a rapid skin reaction to UV light. The present work would be proposed for publication, not least because there are still only a few working groups in this area and there is a strong unmet scientific need for further investigation and information in mast cell activation disease.
