A novel study which introduces a novel method for prenatal detection of CF. It is based on the direct quantitative amplification of the CF gene to determine the percentage of targeted DNA fragments (CF mutation sites) in maternal plasma. Avoiding the need for standard parental carrier testing, the proposed procedure is positioned to reduce the number of invasive diagnostic procedures (amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling) without compromising the total CF detection rate. The study is well-designed and the results are carefully interpreted. The conclusions drawn are adequately supported by the results. The few associated limitations of the proposed technology are properly highlighted by the authors.
