Very interesting topic and study design. Very well written. I approve this article without changes. I have the following minor comments: "Constitutional symptoms accounted for 17.3% of all visits; divided into asthenia, fever, anorexia and malaise, responsible respectively for 46%, 40% and 12.5% of the complaints in this category." - Not clear what was the prevalence of malaise, if you would like to report. Interesting that hematologic malignancies were only 5.8%. Is this cancer center focused in solid tumors? We know that hematologic cancers are less prevalent, but usually the patients are more ill. What was the prevalence of patients on chemotherapy? Recent surgery? Radiation? What was the rate of admission? If possible would be interesting to know if any specific complain or cancer were more likely to be admitted. I know this was not the focus of this paper, but this might interesting for second project.
