The authors present a study protocol to develop a fully-automated contouring system based on deep learning neural network to identify target delineation of Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) gross target volume (GTV) in liver CT images. The protocol of the study clearly describes the data selection and the manual contouring procedure. However, the level of details provided to develop the auto-contouring system based on neural network should be improved. For example, the authors should provide more details about the architecture of the chosen neural network and additional information about the neural network input data that they are expecting to use. The content of the paper is an acceptable scientific standard and therefore it is suitable for publication. Authors should provide more details about the automatic data analysis workflow.
