This paper tries to provide clinical protocols for the registration translucent zone of teeth. Study design is good and paper preparation was accurate. I am wondering whether you have some idea on the opalescence of teeth correlated with translucency of teeth. In Figs 5 and 6, you might have found opalescence property of teeth. If that is possible, we can map the translucency and opalescence of teeth simultaneously.
