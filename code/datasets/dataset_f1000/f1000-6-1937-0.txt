This is a well written report on a timely and important research topic, directly connected to the current US opioid epidemic. Overall, the methodology is sound and the findings are interesting. One limitation of the data collection that could be addressed in future studies is the focus on one single keyword (fentanyl): a quick search using brand names (e.g., oxycodone, oxycontin) and slang terms / street names usually associated with this drug (e.g., ox, ocs) produce many additional hits, including at times associated with illicit person-to-person sales. The authors carried out a scrupulous investigation of the clearnet domains associated with the links discovered on Twitter â€“ I wonder if a similar analysis could be carried out on the Dark Web (often associated with the illicit sale of drugs): this would require significant changes in the data collection infrastructure thus I can only expect it could be done in a follow up study.
