An up-to-date and innovative methodological approach of a possible global problem of illegal trade of pharmaceuticals via the Internet is absolutely useful. The main messages are in accordance with the scientific literature. The concern highlighted by the Dr. Marvin D. Shepherd regarding the dissonance between the introduction and the other parts of the publication is real and similarly I suggest the reconsideration and rewrite of that part. Also it would be advisable to include the comparison of the legal and illicit use and highlight the sources of fentanyl products or fentanyl containing products (outpatient and inpatient settings). Beside the counterfeit fentanyl crisis another possible public health danger is hitting the health care system of the United States is the shortage of multiple drugs including opioid drugs as well (e.g.: fentanyl) necessitate the use of alternative supply channels (e.g.: importation of drugs outside the U.S., internet pharmacies) make the health sector more susceptible to illegal and counterfeit products. Beside the network science the Big Data type of analysis is a novel and hopefully in the future a routinely used methodology to identify and monitor illegal vendors and their connections in the field of illegal internet sale of pharmaceuticals. The more detailed description of the method or even the representation with a figure would help the understanding of it. The characterisation (e.g.: ordering is possible, LegitScript or VIPPS NABP legitimacy, products being sold, prescription requirements) of the identified online pharmacies would have highlighted the illegal internet sale of fentanyl products more accurately. Moreover the inclusion of comparison of the results with the literature data regarding other social media platforms or the simple google search methodology would give a more complete picture of this public health danger.
