The title of the manuscript seems to me appropriate, the summary is clear enough as to the purpose of the study. The design is adequate and sufficiently explained. The discussion chapter is balanced in such a way that it will be able to draw the attention of the scientific community on this emerging arbovirus in the region of Latin America. Further Comments: - If some of the contributions for non-Latin American countries (the United States, Canada, Australia, Norway, Thailand and others), were carried out in a Latin America country or in their own country, please say the reason for including them in the bibliometric analysis. - Although the bibliometric analysis that was performed apparently fulfills the objective of the study ----but it includes results of non-Latin American countries---it would have been interesting to know if the scientific production of nations of other regions of the world share the concern they should be taking into account more the emergency and re-emergence of this arbovirus. - It would be appropriate to discuss, by the authors, that Brazil probably is the main contributor to the issue because its budget for science is one of the highest in Latin America, and not because it suffers in a greater proportion of this problem, or if there are other reasons. - It would have been desirable to consider some regional bibliographic databases such as LILACS and IMBIOMED, and not just English-speaking ones for a best bibliometric analysis, or to indicate why they were not taken into account. I have read this submission and believe that I have the level of expertise to indicate that the study has the sufficient scientific standard
