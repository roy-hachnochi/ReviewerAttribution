This is a well documented case report which may contribute to our knowledge on the clinical consequences of chromosome 18 abnormalities. I suggest to accept the MS for publication on condition that the authors consider a major and some minor remarks for modification. Major remark The routine cytogenetics description is too short. Nothing is written about the percentages of the "mosaic cell lines” (as the authors write), although one of the unique characteristics of ring chromosomes is their dynamic nature. As a result of mitotic difficulties, a ring chromosome is subject of additional cytogenetic mutations, resulting in continuous generation of secondary aneuploidy cells. Accordingly, this dynamic mutations series may manifest themselves as "mosaic cell lines”, however, the survival of such cells as cell line, as well as the explanation of their presence being "cell lines” is questionable. I would recommend to refer to this wildely accepted explanation for the presence of differentially shaped chromosomes in patients with ring chromosome, at least as an alternativ possibility. (e.g. Kosztolnyi G: Does "ring syndrome" exist? Hum.Genet. 1987; 75:174-179) Minor remark Some peculiarity of the case should be highlighted with more emphasis. E.g., Detecting a chromosome abnormality in a patient at the age of 32 is rare – it should be highlighted in the paper. Also the extreme severity of the somatic and mental underdevelopment should be pointed on abstract.
