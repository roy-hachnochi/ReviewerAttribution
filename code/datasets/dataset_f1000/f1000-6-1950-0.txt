I have read this submission. I believe that I have an appropriate level of expertise to confirm that it is of an acceptable scientific standard to publish as a research note, however in case of a full manuscript it needs more scientific investigation on the variation of soil respiration as well as CO2 fluxes and soil microbial activities under specified environmental conditions.
