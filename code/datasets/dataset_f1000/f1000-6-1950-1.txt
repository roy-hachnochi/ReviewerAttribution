1. Why did the authors select Phylazonit biofertilizer? Does it contain any methanotrophs bacterial spp. or any electron acceptors? Didn’t find the composition. 2. Why not investigate the CO2 production rate with varying levels such as 0.5%, 1% and 5% substrates application in soils? 2. What were the initial content of organic carbon, total nitrogen, soil pH, redox status (Soil Eh) and microbial composition of the collected 24 soil samples? 3. How did the researchers control the pressure within the glass bottles during the experimental period? 4. How did the authors maintain moisture levels or water filled pore space uniformity in the 24 soil samples containing glass bottles? 5. Why didn’t you collect the gas samples evolved from the soils in glass bottles at varying time hours? 6. Why didn’t you follow the light/dark conditions in the Incubator where the glass bottles were kept? 7. All the Figures are not clear, no contrasting colors or bullets with lines used to differentiate the treatments. 8. How were soil microbial activities assessed? Methanogens and methanotroph’s relative intensity were not found in this script, which are the major focus related to the current research topic.
