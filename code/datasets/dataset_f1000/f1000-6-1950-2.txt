Bautista and Matyas observed unexpected results in Chernozem soil respiration following the different fertilizer treatments. I think, the values of Dataset 2 could be directly included in the main content of the paper, if possible. The title of Dataset 1 should be "Average values for various properties of Chernozem soil". I have answered ‘partly’ to the question ‘ Are all the source data underlying the results available to ensure full reproducibility?’ as soil ecosystems are very diverse and results could vary under different environmental conditions.
