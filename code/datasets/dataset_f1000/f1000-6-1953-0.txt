This was a cross-sectional study that explored factors associated with hypertension (HT) and pre-hypertension (Pre-HT), respectively, among a sample of population in a single city in Venezuela. The merits of this paper included a very detailed description of the sampling methodology and a clear demonstration of main results. However, factors that contribute to increasing level of high blood pressure (BP) have already been well reported in many existing literature, and thus the novelty of the research question in the current study seems to be limited. As the study identified different sets of factors associated with HT and Pre-HT in the two separate logistic regression models, I would suggest conducting a sensitivity analysis using the BP values as dependent variable in a multiple linear regression model. This could provide further evidence to illustrate a picture showing how variables currently identified for both HT and Pre-HT are linked with BP values. The seventh paragraph in the Discussion section (page 9 of 13) argued that household physical activity was found as a protective factor for pre-HT. However in Table 4, the variable was leisure time physical activity ( p =0.05 ) . On this particular variable, the authors can add more texts to describe what is defined as a "moderate physical activity" so that people who are at risk for higher BP can be benefited in adjusting their physical activity level from the findings of this study. The title of the paper highlighted dysglycemic states and HT; however, this was not closely reflected by the main results of the study.
