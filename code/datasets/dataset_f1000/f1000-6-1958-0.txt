The authors performed some additional experiments and rewrote some parts of the manuscript. This improved the article. I am still not overly enthusiastic about the study, because the provided evidence for the several storylines is quite thin. However, I realize that for the type of presented data it is hard to get more convincing results, and believe that also this type of data deserves to be indexed. Therefore, I recommend indexing of the article, although I simultaneously advise the readers to read all reviewer's reports so that they have an understanding of the critical issues of the study.
