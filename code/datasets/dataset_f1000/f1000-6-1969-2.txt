The new figures and text are very helpful and address our questions. The use case works well, except for the small problem described below: For the ORA step: p - ORA.dotplot(resORA, category = "Category", count = "Count", size = "Size", pvalue = "pvalue", sort = "pvalue", p.adjust.methods = "fdr", numChar = 60, top = 50) + scale_colour_gradient(low = "red", high = "yellow") gives an error: Error in `[.data.frame`(EnrichTab, , c(category, size, count, pvalue)) : undefined columns selected This seems to be because there is no column in resORA called "Category"--the GO terms are the rownames. We could work around this problem by adding: resORA$Category - rownames(resORA)
