This manuscript announces the availability of genomic sequence data from Phytophthora cinnammomi strains DU054 and WA94.26. This is a useful resource for researchers interested in this important pathogen. The authors have deposited and made available the raw sequence data in SRA and their assemblies in GenBank, which is commendable. The genome annotation and protein sequences do not appear to be deposited in GenBank, however. This does not preclude publication, but when discussing predicted genes in the manuscript, the authors should be up-front about this or provide full details of the annotations in supplementary data or deposit them in some public repository. One oversight that the authors should be aware of is the previous publication of two genome sequences of this species, one of which (MP94-48) is from Australia. See Studholme et al . (2015) 1 . So, the authors' assertion (in their Conclusions section) that this is the first genome assembly from an Australian strain should be revised. The authors should also include those two assemblies in their comparisons of assembly quality metrics. And also please revise the several other mentions of previously sequenced genome throughout the text in the light of the additional two previously sequenced genomes. Also, it would be interesting to assess how similar or different all these four available P.c. genome sequences are to each other, e.g. by calculating pairwise ANIs. Some specific points that should be addressed around the methodology: Why were reads mapped against the human genome? Why should contamination from human DNA be more prevalent or likely than from other organisms? The authors make good efforts to remove contaminating Paenibacillus sequence reads. Interestingly, we also observed contamination of Phytophthora genomic DNA with this bacterial genus. However, the authors go on to claim that the data contained "highly quality reads not belonging to ... bacterial contaminants". Their approach does not remove non-Paenibacillus bacterial contaminants. Please cite a reference to support the claim that "heterogeneous data can increase redundancy in genome assemblies". It is not entirely clear what this statement means, precisely, and in any case it is not self-evident and needs to be supported by peer-reviewed publication. The use of BUSCO version 1.22 is questionable, given that versions 2 and 3 are now available. Furthermore, rather than using the general Eukaryote set of BUSCOs, the authors should use the Stramenopile set. The completeness of the genome assemblies is rather poor (only 65% of expected genes are present intact in a single copy). It would be useful to compare/benchmark this against other available Phytophthora genome sequences. For example, our recent sequencing of P. ramorum genomes, we found around 81- 85% of Stramenopile BUSCOs were intact and single-copy in each genome (See PubMed ID 28243575). Towards the end of page 4, the authors claim that the "preliminary annotation ... is valuable". I agree and would go further to say that not just the annotation but the genome sequencing per se is valuable. I would also suggest including a brief explanation of how/why the presented data is valuable. The authors say that their annotation is valuable, but the annotation has not apparently been deposited in a public repository. Therefore, please either make this valuable resource available, or remove the claim that it is valuable. Some very minor points: In the Introduction, it was not obvious to me what is meant by a "Botanical Province". Please consider explaining this term. Please add an apostrophe after "manufacturers". At several places in the text, the authors write "parameters" when they really mean "parameter values" or "options" or "switches". Please check and revise. Please write "high-quality" not "highly quality". On page 3, the authors say that no gene expression data are available for this species. This is untrue, since EST data (i.e. expressed sequence tags) are available. Furthermore, in the SRA, there are several RNAseq datasets available: Illumina HiSeq 2000 sequencing; RNAseq analysis of germinating cysts of Phytophthora cinnamomi 1 ILLUMINA (Illumina HiSeq 2000) run: 46,420 spots, 4.2M bases, 3.5Mb downloads Accession: ERX709652 Select item 14623972.

Phytophthora cinnamomi library 2 ILLUMINA (Illumina HiSeq 2000) runs: 38.5M spots, 7.7G bases, 4.5Gb downloads Accession: SRX124559 ​​When quoting N50 values, please include the units. For example, the N50 for DU054 was 9,951 bp or nt. The authors refer to (on page 4) "more complete annotations" of several species. Among these examples is P. lateralis and a citation of our paper (PubMed 23678994) about the sequencing of this species' genome; however, I would not agree that its annotation is "more complete". On page 3, second paragraph, the authors write "the available genome". It is not the "genome" that is available; rather it is the "genome sequence". Once the authors have addressed all these issues, I would be very pleased to see this indexed.
