The work was carried out professionally and resulted in good draft genomes of two pathogen strains belonging to Phytophthora genus. In my opinion, this article is an important contribution to future studies about the molecular mechanism involved in Phytophthora -plant interaction. Particularly, in the first steps of pathogen adhesion, where the virulence factors related to this are little known.
