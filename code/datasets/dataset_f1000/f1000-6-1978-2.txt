Childhood abuse is under recognized phenomena in Pakistan. This research is good effort to link childhood adverse experiences with impulsivity and identity. but there are few confusions/questions. Some detail of ACE questionnaire should be mentioned. Explain sub-variables in ACE in terms of questions. Is every single question of ACE is a separate variable? how we can say that if a person say yes to a single question that means he or she had a adverse childhood experience? Only Frequency and severity of an experience can determine its intensity. Literature review is poor. Objectives and hypotheses are not mentioned in article. I have serious concerns regarding result/analysis section. Relationship should be analysed with correlational analysis first and then go for regression analysis to confirm the relation while identifying significant predictors. Analysis is very much confused as I canâ€™t understand that what variables are described as predictors and which one are outcome variables. According to Table no3 impulsivity and identity are describes as predictors/independent variables although according to title and literature ACE are predictors and impulsivity and identity related variables are outcome variables. So according to the purpose of research results are wrong. If author has something else in mind please explain it. If author will mention objectives and hypotheses and then give analyses according to hypotheses then reader can understand what actually author want to explore. Discussion is poorly written. please relate your results with existing literature
