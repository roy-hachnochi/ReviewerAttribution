The authors present a method to measure cellular complexity in different species by examining fractal network properties. This is potentially a very interesting method, yet there are several things which should be addressed: As this is a methods paper, it would be nice to see how this particular method of measuring cellular complexity relates to others. There is no benchmark presented for the comparison of results. It may not immediately be obvious to readers how fractals relate to complexity of an organism. The method illustrated in Fig. 1A could be more clear for readers who are not familiar with fractals, showing an example of how box-counting is actually carried out, and how this relates to complexity. The results presented in Fig. 1 could be discussed in greater detail. It is not clear why there is a fairly noisy relationship between fractal dimension and degree exponent between species within different evolutionary backgrounds. Could this variance be due to the data that were used? Though it is possible to measure cellular complexity with this approach, it is not clear why this method is of particular value, and what purposes it would serve aside from the example presented. The addition of more relevant context in the introduction and conclusions could help with this.
