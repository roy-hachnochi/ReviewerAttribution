This is an interesting observation of a relatively high concentration of a multi-species predator guild on corals that were initially spared from crown-of-thorns seastar (COTS) predation. The ultimate demise of "guarded" Pocilloporids may have been due to a high density of starving COTS (at the peak of an outbreak) feeding on whatever coral was left and overwhelming mutualistic crabs in the process. The overall impact of the butterflyfish, in terms of coral mortality, was most likely lower compared to COTS. It is unclear whether this was a widespread occurrence or a one-time observation. A brief description of the feeding behaviour of COTS and butterflyfishes (relative contribution to coral mortality), as well as the defensive behaviour of Trapeziid crabs will be useful. METHODS: Change Pocilloporida eydouxi to Pocillopora eydouxi. SUPPLEMENTARY IMAGE 1: Feeding scars are not clear in the pictures.
