The authors have conducted a systematic review to identify if regional versus general anaesthesia is superior for post-operative pain for distal wrist fractures. They correctly show that there is an evidence gap in the literature, and cannot provide recommendation from their data. The study is well conducted, but the contributing trials are all small and have sufficient heterogeneity that it is simply not possible to draw any conclusions, other than more trials need to be done.
