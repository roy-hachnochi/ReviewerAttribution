The article’s title suggests focusing on the elderly but the studies mentioned do not refer especially to the elderly. Although the authors are right in saying that wrist fractures are more common in the elderly it is not clear in the studies mentioned; I suggest to remove “elderly” from the title. In the text it is rightly mentioned. It is interesting that the article shows a relative lack of information in the literature on this specific wrist fracture treatment. I agree with all the conclusions drawn by the authors about desired further studies; important that is noted that rebound pain in the aftercare phase is higher in the regional group than the multimodal group of patients; this provides us an important “mirror” to our daily practice!
