A fatal case of IE caused by Aerococcus urinae, in a 75-year-old man with a bioprosthetic aortic valve is presented and discussed. Very precise and covering comments have been given by reviewer 1. Microbiological data should be examined thouroughly and extended. Language correction seems indicated. The following comments can be added. 1) Abstract: It is always important to also having focus on more rare etiologies of IE. In the abstract it is stated that the mortality rate is high. This is suggested to be modified to: Initial descriptions of collections of IE cases with A. urinae demonstrated a high morbidity and mortality rate, whereas a recent Swedish epidemiological study could not retrieve this. 2) Introduction: Dukes criteria should be mentioned. There is not a species named Streptococcus viridans. Recent diagnostic improvements should be included, especially MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. a gram-positive, catalase-negative 3) Case description: Specific description of PM electrode findings should be given. A more detailed disease timespan is desirable. Microbiological data are very scarce. Blood-culture system and number of positive bottles should be given. Likewise identification criteria and susceptibility methods and results, including MIC values of relevant antibiotics should be given. A thorough microbiological examination of the manuscript seems indicated Aerococcus urinae should only be fully written the first time 4) Discussion 16S is slang: it should be partial 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis
