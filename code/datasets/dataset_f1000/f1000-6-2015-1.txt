The authors studied anti-influenza HA IgG antibody levels using a multiplex assay in adults who exposed to H3 viruses previously and/or received influenza vaccination and demonstrated that stalk-reactive antibody recall responses induced by seasonal H3 viruses and CpG ODN can be enhanced by IL-15. The manuscript is generally well written and clearly presented. It may be helpful that authors could add a bit more discussion as to how IL-15 with/without CpG activate the B cell recall response leading to the anti-stalk antibody production.
