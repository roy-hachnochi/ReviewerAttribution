The authors provide an overview of the current state of use of genomic technologies in the UK, comparing this with other nations as well as considering the wider implications of implementing such technologies for clinical practice and everyday life. The use of association data by some companies or tests (rather than direct genomic data) is not dwelt upon in the section on DTC genetic testing although this is highlighted in the referenced literature. The distinction is one which is not always clear to the public and relates directly to the question posed at the end of this section about the lay person's genetic/genomic literacy and how well-equipped they are to evaluate such tests themselves. Some consumers also use DTC testing from an Ancestry point of view and do not initially set out to learn medical genetic information from the test. However, tools which put related users in touch with each other can sometimes lead to disclosures of more medically-related information, such as recommendations about screening for inherited conditions. The authors rightly highlight tensions between genomic data donated by patients to research endeavours on an altruistic basis and the possibility of a resultant financial benefit to organisations who provide capital, resources or facilities to support such endeavours. This is juxtaposed with the concomitant lack of value in being unable to share data for comparison and interpretation. Finally, they draw attention to the great need for further research into the impact of these technologies on society as a whole - from a variety of perspectives - particularly focusing on the experiences of end-users, be they patients, consumers or citizens. Understanding the needs and concerns of these stakeholders is vital to successful delivery of services in the future.
