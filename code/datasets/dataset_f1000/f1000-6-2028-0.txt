"All the colonies were similar to avirulent type, as the appearance was white or cream-colored, irregularly-round, fluidal, and opaque on CPG medium" - if they were avirulent i.e. incapable of causing a disease, then how did bacterial wilt occur in the field? I suggest you exclude the last paragraph of the discussion concerning access or rather lack of access to a sequencing platform. To overcome this obstacle, researchers in low-income or developing countries should collaborate with those in the developed world (my opinion).
