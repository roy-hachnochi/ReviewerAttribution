The article by Niederer et al. on the "Identification of organic pigments in tattoo inks and permanent make-ups using MALDI TOF MSâ€œ is very well written and discusses a new approach for the detection of potentially dangerous organic pigments in tattoo inks. The new method applying LDI- and MALDI-TOF MS is a big improvement as compared to those applied so far and will be of great help to authorities in their responsibility to regulate the use these pigments in tattoo studios. The importance of the availability of such methods is underlined by the very strong increase of persons with tattoos or permanent make-up in the last years. The applicability of this new identification method was clearly demonstrated in the many years of testing it with real life samples. I do not have any suggestions for improving the text and the figures. They are perfect in my opinion the way they are. Only the title could be improved by stating the use of LDI-TOF MS next to MALDI-TOF MS.
