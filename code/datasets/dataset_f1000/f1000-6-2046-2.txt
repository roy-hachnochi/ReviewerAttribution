Kemperman and McCall present a Shiny App that is a straightforward extension of their Bioconductor mirComp package, creating the plots provided by the package with sliders for the options of the plotting functions, using a suite of microRNA qPCR test data. Major There are some shortcomings in the app that initially made me think it would still be necessary to use the Bioconductor version directly: * I couldn’t find documentation or an option in the app on how to use one’s own data with the app (use case 1 from abstract). **update** I found the “custom” method option, but only by trial and error – this option should be emphasized within the app * I also couldn’t see documentation on how to add a novel algorithm for comparison (use case 2 from abstract). **update** I think I understand now that a novel algorithm would be applied prior to uploading the data to the app, but please clarify this in the manuscript and app * The figures don’t have axis labels or captions, so one has to look up the miRcomp vignette and reference manual to understand them It would be helpful to state in the Introduction and on the web app page who the intended users of the app are, and who it’s not intended for. It would also be helpful to state in the Introduction how the “simple expression and quality matrices as input” would normally be generated, with specific instructions both for generating (e.g. pointing to documentation for the methods already in the tool and how data from added methods should be formatted), and for uploading to the tool. This should also be coupled with explicitly stating that the tool does not perform normalization of miR expression data (or, better yet, incorporating normalization into the tool), and that the tool only assesses already normalized miR expression data. The point of this comment is to make it clearer up front to a reader whether or not the tool is for them. As the app takes simple expression and quality matrices as input, it would be helpful to point to instructions on how to prepare these matrices. It would seem that this requires using the R/Bioc command line, so the app may facilitate the comparison of methods but not remove barriers to usage. Again, it should just be clear up front what requirements to the user are for the intended use cases. This may be outside the scope of the paper, but the tool would be of greater use to wet lab biologists if they could upload raw data, do the comparisons provided by the app, then download normalized data. This would probably significantly expand the number of potential users. I understand from the introduction that the tool intends to expand on methods for testing qPCR normalization used for miR expression data. But it would be helpful to state how the app is actually specific to miR expression data – is it just that it provides miR datasets for benchmarks? Or are some of the normalization methods miR-specific? When trying out the app at https://laurenkemperman.shinyapps.io/mircomp/, I constantly got the message “Disconnected from the server. Reload” I had to run the app locally to test it usefully. The authors may need an upgraded shinyapps.io account to support public usage. When reloading, all changes made to the settings are reset. Minor With qpcRb4 as the first method, I get an error “need finite ‘ylim’ values”. I haven’t checked through all the plotting combinations.
