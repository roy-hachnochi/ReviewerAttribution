This is a well-written and interesting approach to considering the funding of expert biological infrastructure funding. Using UniProt as the test case, 12 models of funding and sustainability are investigated and discussed. Funding of infrastructure in life sciences is an incredibly important and pressing problem as increased levels of data generation and computational analysis accessing highly structured and integrated digital data are flooding the research environment. The paper, far from being a generalized overview or editorial, dives deeply into an investigation of alternative funding models. It will be very useful to the user and to the funding communities to have this outline of different approaches. While I see overlap between a few of the funding mechanisms, the more important impact of the paper is that careful thought has gone into considering a range of mechanisms. While adequate linkages to data resources are presented, I think it would be a useful addition to add a table of sources and the particular result from that resource that is included in the discussion. Authors state all data to reproduce are included in the study, but actually the data are extracted from external reports. That said, all data for the evaluation presented in Figure 3 are available in the study. This is a minor quibble. The challenge for important, comprehensive, and extensively used resources such as UniProt, the Model Organism Databases, and others is that while they are essential infrastructure for advancement of scientific investigations, no one agency or organization wants over responsibility. The effort to globally fund digital infrastructure will require cooperation and consideration of many parties. This paper reports on the issues and possible solutions
