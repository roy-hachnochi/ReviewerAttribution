This is primarily a software pipeline article, showing how to use the Bioconductor edgeR package to analyze RRBS data, but to a certain extent is also a methods paper, as to my knowledge this is the first proposal for directly analyzing count data rather than converting to either ratios and using a beta-binomial, or to logits and using conventional linear modeling. This is an interesting idea, and should be explored further, but for this manuscript the main goal is to present the software pipeline. The authors progress through each step of the pipeline, clearly describing each step as well as providing code (and links to the underlying data), so readers can easily understand the process and get some hands on experience as well. The code is clearly written, and as straightforward as one could expect for a relatively complex analysis. However, I would prefer to see more consistent integration with other Bioconductor packages. In particular, when reading in the raw data, the authors use a clever trick to account for the fact that not all samples have reads for the same genomic positions. This step could just as easily be accomplished using the Bioconductor GenomicRanges package, which is intended for manipulating genomic data. In fact, the authors use GenomicRanges later in the pipeline to subset the methylation data to just gene promoter sites, so it would be more natural to start with a GRanges if you will need one later anyway. Otherwise this is a good article that clearly shows how one could use an innovative method to analyze RRBS data using the edgeR package.
