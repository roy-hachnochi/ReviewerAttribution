This manuscript described META-pipe as a cloud-based workflow for marine metagenomic analysis. The computation-intensive analysis is parallelized via a distributed Spark-compatible infrastructure. The unique feature of META-pipe is its support of heterogeneous cloud environment for job execution, including those available from academic institutes and commercially available AWS. This is the 2nd version of the manuscript. The authors have addressed all remarks raised by the previous reviewers. A few minor remarks are listed below: Use cases-End user section: Cannot evaluate the application without a valid ELIXIR AAI login credential. Should either provide a demo account or a recorded screencast for the review purpose. Discussion-Limitations section: "(or be added to an EGI based VO)": What's "VO"? "requires that access guarantees (SLAs, OLAs)": the first appearance of acronyms (SLAs, OLAs) should be spelled out and/or include links.
