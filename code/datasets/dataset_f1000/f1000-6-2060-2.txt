The article describes the setup of a multi-cloud architecture that can support the execution of META-pipe jobs for marine metagenomics data analysis. It is intended for a technically inclined audience and focuses on the different configuration steps required for the setup of a complex computing architecture involving several clouds in several countries. The purpose is to be able to open the META-pipe service to a large number of ELIXIR users. Several cloud middleware have been configured (Openstack, OpenNebula, Amazon). The description of the infrastructure is clear and additional links to github repositories or online documents allow the reader to fetch extra technical information. Remarks : In the introduction, the authors indicate that the design goal is to make execution mangers (sic) portable and that the setup and maintenance of execution mangers (sic) is easy. The authors state that these goals are achieved because all state is maintained on central servers. This section is not completely clear and should be rewritten to highlight the advantages of the central servers architecture. Emphasizing the fact that the META-pipe environment will be pushed from a central server to the execution clouds could clarify things. In the chapter concerning the META-pipe executables and dependencies (page 4), it could be interesting to better describe these dependencies. These dependencies are downloaded from the artifact server but no technical information is given about this server (for example : location, size of the downloads). Are the reference databases provided by the artifact server ? The infrastructure is articulated around a central server hosting the configuration of META-pipe. This creates a single point of failure. It could be interesting to describe the actions that are taken in order to have a more resilient system. In the META-pipe job execution paragraph, the input data is downloaded to a data structure (page 5, col 1, line 18). What is this data structure ?
