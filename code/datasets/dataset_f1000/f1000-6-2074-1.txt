The article 'Using bio.tools to generate and annotate workbench tool descriptions' describes the software tool ToolDog. ToolDog improves the interoperability of bio.tool-deposited entries within workbenches by converting their descriptions into formats that are compatible with workflow standards. ToolDog is a convenient addition to the existing capabilities for the integration of bio.tools entries with workbench environments. I found Figure 2 particularly interesting, describing the metadata coverage descriptions from two of the main Galaxy servers. Do you have the raw data with which this figure was created? It would be good to have it openly shared. Figure 2 illustrates the problem of the significant lack of completeness in crucial metadata descriptions of Galaxy tools. My main recommendation for this article would be to provide a step-by-step guide on how to run ToolDog using a self-contained example. I feel unable to test the tool because I do not know how to download the metadata from a bio.tools entry and need to set up my python environment, download the code and make it work. This article, although it is geared toward a programmer audience, it would be hard to test/reproduce for someone who is not a seasoned python programmer. I would thus recommend a beginner's guide for those of us who are not so technical. Other than that, I am glad to see all the source code adequately deposited both in github and Zenodo for the snapshot image for this publication. The MIT license is also commendable as it allows free reuse and modification. Finally some minor corrections: Link in the first paragraph of the results section ‘of a significant portion of the tool description ’ is broken Link on the second paragraph of the results section ‘ https://github.com/khillion/galaxyxml-analysis/annotate_usegalaxy’ is broken Discussion section bullet point #3 ‘such web service’ == such as web services
