This is an interesting approach to the vexed question of whether or not it is worthwhile publishing in the now ubiquitous, and commonly regarded inferior, open access journals. The authors have convincingly demonstrated that to get more citations it is. Whether or not this will translate into more prestige points towards selection and promotion for e.g. faculty positions has to be evaluated later. However these are early days to judge this rather novel open access experiment.
