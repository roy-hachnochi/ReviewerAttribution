This study has offered some potential values on characterization of cellulose-degrading microbiota from termite guts and soil. However, it lacks the basics of experimental design. Two termites were selected, but only one soil sample was included, and also only one termite gut sample was included. The major issue was no replicates (biological and technical) in this study. All results, discussion, and conclusion were from one sample which does not make much sense in a scientific publication. I doubt about how much the conclusion was reliable based on 1 data point from each sample. Therefore, I do not think this manuscript can be indexed as a research paper.
