This is an interesting manuscript which captures some of the barriers in Indonesia preventing widespread adoption of vasectomy. The science is sound and the commentary interesting; however, in its current state, the article requires grammatical review and correction prior to publication. There are errors throughout the text beginning in the abstract. The other clinical comment is that the author's report a guideline suggesting semen analysis be performed 1 month following the procedure, this is not the case for all guidelines (AUA suggests 8-16 weeks).
