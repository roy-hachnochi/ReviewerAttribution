The present case report describes an impressive clinical improvement of a patient suffering from a metastatic paraganglioma. The case is well written and documented with images. The good news is that the treatment is a combination of temozolomide and propranolol at high doses, old drugs from which the safety profile and side effects are well known. It is noteworthy that the improvement was kept even after 7 months of lanreotide removal. Lanreotide remains one of the choice drugs as standard treatment for metastatic paragangliome, although with high side effects, and only limited success. While temozolomide is commonly used for brain tumors, the novelty is the concomitant treatment with a beta blocker, propranolol. The authors explain the results based on the antiangiogenic properties of propranolol, decreasing HIF-inducible transcription targets according to previous papers published elsewhere. Propranolol would decrease HIF protein levels, and thus the activation of hypoxia target genes, among them, angiogenic factors, such as VEGF, FGF, PDGF, EPO, and metalloproteases. The advantages of the use of propranolol and temozolomide derive mainly from the long experience as therapeutic agents. Both are old drugs, and therefore, the safety profile and side effects are well known. In this context, we can state that if they are proven effective in tumoral cases difficult to manage. For rare diseases where therapeutic options are scarce and with not very successful results, outcomes like the one reported here have to be seriously considered and spread in literature, since patients may get an enormous benefit. On top of this, the proposed treatment is cheap, and with minimal side effects. However, this is a case report, and to be sure that the treatment really is effective, we need more knowledge derived from other cases.
