Salvatierra Florez describe the development of software tool and web interface for analyzing only Chikungunya sequences. The idea is very interesting but I have some different concerns about the utility of its application. It is not well documented that Chikungunya virus can persist in human for many time In the title it must be underline that the system is to identify Chikungunya virus only and maybe in the text (discussion section) the eventual possibility to expand it The authors have to better describe the requirements about the sequences used in this tool It is important in phylogenetic analysis to identify the algorithm used but no mention has been made in the article, no model choose in a case of maximum likelihood algorithm and so on I think that in this form without detailed informations for users it is not possible to accept. After major revision, this can be a useful and detailed guide.
