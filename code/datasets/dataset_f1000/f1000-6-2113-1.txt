The authors present two python-based packages for the analysis of ring conformations in molecular systems and for the visualization of the related data. The tessellate package implements various algorithms for the detection of cycles of different size (5 to 8 included) and represents a handy tool, which pairs nicely with its visualization counterpart, Montage, to produce and analyze aggregate data regarding the structure of the cycles. I tested the code, which is freely available, and was able to reproduce the examples reported in the article. I think that these packages will prove useful and that this article should be indexed in F1000Research. Some comments regarding possible (optional) improvements : 1) tessellate can not only be run as a standalone command, but can also be used as a python module. This can be beneficial to the interoperability with other libraries, and probably a couple of lines could be added to the text to show an example of how to do that. 2) if possible, it would be helpful to sort by size the elements of the histograms generated by Montage, so that at the bottom of the stack is the largest population, followed by the second-most large, and so on. 3) regarding interoperability: output in the pandas data frame format would be probably a useful addition.
