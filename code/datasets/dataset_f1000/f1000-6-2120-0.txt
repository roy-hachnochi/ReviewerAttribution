We believe that the extension tools for BioNSi, which are presented in the paper, provide useful network tools for biologists. Still, we suggest several improvements that are listed below. The feature to compare between two networks is useful for the user, however more detailed explanations on how to work with it and how to visualize the differences between networks are missing. We would like to suggest that this feature will be integrated in the BioNSi application. We would like to suggest that manual changes in the node states in the visualized network will affect the resulting node color in the simulation. Uploading an expression data file with negative expression values (log2) is currently not applicable and should be corrected. The names of the edges in the “Edge Table” panel are not informative and it is difficult to relate between the graphics and the table. In the example “toy1” network, there are two edges with the name “Edge_0” and one with “Edge_1”. The option to “Destroy Network” exists in two places in the top menu: in the “BioNSi” tab and in the “Edit” tab. Please note that it worked properly only when activated from the “BioNSi” tab.
