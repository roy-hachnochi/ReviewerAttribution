The revised article answered most of my reservations with the first version, some minor clarifications are still needed. The sentence explaining the merging process of multiple pathways is not clear and seems to merge two different sentences: "nodes contained in several entities often have alternative pathways are fused into single node". What happens if gene A is associated to genes B and C in one pathway and to genes C and D in another? Will we obtain: a single node merging A,B,C, and D? a node merging A and C, and separate nodes for B and D? 4 different nodes? I assume the authors selected the later solution, which facilitates the mapping of external data (as each node corresponds to a single biological entity), but increases the complexity of the network. Is that correct? Regarding the mapping of external data, I understand from the answer of the authors that the provided csv file will map official gene symbols, HGNC IDS, as well as KEGG-IDs. It is clearly stated in the documentation, but could deserve a comment in the paper, along with the fact that unmapped nodes will be assigned the value 0. While the misleading use if asynchronous in table 1 has been fixed, the text referring to this table in the introduction has not been updated. A closing parenthesis is missing on page 4: "(e.g. GEO or ArrayExpress".
