The authors discuss the article by Benjamin et al., 2017 and their proposal of p .005 as a possible solution to the lack of research reproducibility due to the high rate of false positives in the literature. The article reviews the current debate topics on NHST and contributes to the reflection on how to advance towards a Science that allows accumulating valid scientific knowledge. Suggestions: Write down at the end of the article a simple example where the result is interpreted with NHST and with the Bayes factor and the utility of JASP is presented.
