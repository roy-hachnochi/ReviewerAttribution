This is a timely and well organized synthesis of the debate ignited by Benjamin et al . ’s , 2017 influential paper which is still going on. My only suggestions are the followings: - to add a legend to the acronyms in Figure 1, e.g. ES, CI, etc.; - to correct the statement that the JASP software allows only a Jeffreys’s Bayes Factor given that in the present .8.4.0 version, the user can also choose informed priors based on Cauchy, Normal or t distributions; - I think that a final synoptic table related to the information offered by the different statistical indices, i.e., p value, CI, Bayes Factor H1/H0 , Effect Size, etc., could help the readers acknowledge the different informational value among them and consequently to choose those ones which answer better the questions they ask their data.
