This commentary, very well written by the expert Eleftherios P Diamandis and his colleague Clare Fiala, is based on the last article of Phallen et al. who described a method for early cancer diagnosis by using circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) sequenced without knowledge of tumor mutations. In this commentary, the authors examined step by step the feasibility of this approach for detecting small, asymptomatic tumors, based on previously published empirical data. They nicely showed that measurement of ctDNA for early cancer diagnosis is problematic, not only due to the limited capability of deep whole genome sequencing to reveal mutations, but because the amount of circulating tumor DNA retrieved from a 10mL blood draw will be extremely small, or even nonexistent, thus making efficient diagnosis of cancer unlikely. This commentary, very well documented, is important in the liquid biopsy field and needs to be indexed to understand the current opportunities and limitations of ctDNA as a biomarker for early detection of cancer.
