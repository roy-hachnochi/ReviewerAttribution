The manuscript by Bhargav and colleagues describes a novel homozygous frameshift insertion mutation in a known microcephaly gene in a family segregating autosomal recessive primary microcephaly. Whole exome sequencing was used to identify a mutation underlying MCPH phenotype. Overall, the manuscript is written well. Authors have presented the data in a professional way and I have no reservation to approve this submission.
