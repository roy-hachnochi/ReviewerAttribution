Thank you very much for the opportunity to review this interesting and well written report. My comments for the statistical analysis and discussion are listed below. Statistical Analysis: Word comprehension and gesture productions – a Multivariate Analysis of Variance using group as the independent variable and gesture and word comprehension as the dependent variables. A follow-up analysis using the different lexical categories would then be appropriate. In the Word Production Analyses – the authors note that “We also found that preterm children use less Verbs and Functors at all age. Nouns increased over time, and full-term children show a systematic increase of Verbs and Functors from 18 to 24 months, and a decrease of Nouns over time [20 months: t(38)=2.25, p 22 months: t(38)=2.29, p0.05].” This is a bit confusing. Does this indicate that the preterm infants lost some of the nouns that they were producing (e.g., parents reported that they produced 25 nouns at 20 months but then only 10 nouns at 24 months?). The information in this section appears contradictory with regard to the noun data reported. Discussion: It seems to point to the children having initially slower language acquisition but then they must demonstrate a faster rate of growth at some point (or the full term infants demonstrate a slowed rate of growth) since there is not a difference in words and phrases by 24 and the only different in vocab was at 16 and 18 months. While the authors state this later on in the first paragraph, this is not immediately clear. I would recommend starting with something that states that although there are initial delays the preterm infants appear to catch up. The authors should put in a couple of more sentences to discuss what is meant by “qualitative aspects” of language abilities and why it mattes that preterms seem to have differences in these aspects of language later in in development.
