This is an interesting and clearly written article on using a machine learning method (random forests) and medical students to form "hybrid" predictions of disease progression in MS, specifically the conversion from RRMS to SPMS. The article claims that the results are a proof-of-principle that combining machine learning and human predictions is better than either approach alone. The main strengths of the article are its clear writing, the reproducbility of the experiments, the clinical importance of the application, and topical nature of the subject, as machine learning for clinical prediction is such a hot topic that integration with the clinical workflow is a critical area of study. The main limitations of the article are that only clinical parameters were used to perform the predictions, and the longitudinal nature of the data was not used to its full benefit. To realize the potential of machine learning for MS prediction, imaging parameters should be included (there is good literature on MS prediction using imaging), and examining changes over time is important for both machine (eg, using recurrent networks) and human raters (examining clinical changes over multiple time points). The article places some importance on having the computer and humans using the same set of input parameters, but I do not feel that this is warranted; the data should be selected to be most appropriate for each approach. Given the above limitations, it is difficult to generalize the findings to say that hybrid predictions are better than either machine learning or humans. This could be true, and the article provides some support for that, but more work needs to be done to provide strong evidence.
