The manuscript is interesting and intriguing, since it opens new possibilities in MS prognosis combining human expertise and "artificial intelligence". I do not understand why medical students have been chosen instead of (young) neurologists who may have additional skills in the specific task. Apart from this aspect, the manuscript is well written and easy to follow. Deserves publication.
