The authors apply a differential PCR method to discover and identify differentially expresses genes between control A. gambiae populations and populations adapted to cadmium. 14 differentially expressed transcripts were identified and annotated upon sequencing. While the RNA extraction and initial cDNA synthesis were executed properly, I'm worried about the follow up steps and the verification of up- or down regulation. Major Issues: Second stage PCR of 40 cycles may introduce tremendous bias in fragments that differ in PCR efficiency. After so many cycles only shorter fragments will be preferentially amplified. This may inpart explain why so few DEGs have been identified in this study. All other competing DEGs with lower efficiency will be lost. The GeneFishing technique is outdated. I would rather recommend SSH, microarray analysis or RNAseq. All of these techniques would give a much more complete picture of gentic differentces in the Cd adapted populations. It is essential to verify DEGs using for instance QPCR. I used to work with differential PCR screening, and quite a number of the initial leads were false positives. So, an independent second method should be used to validate the DEGs Most of the identified DEGS are associated with rRNA indicating that the dT-ACP 1 primer was not specific enough to target mRNA. This is very worrying and confirms my 1st issue raised. In conclusion, these are very preliminary data generated with an out dated system.
