In their manuscript entitled, “Patent foramen ovale closure versus medical therapy for stroke prevention: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials” Tse et al. performed meta-analysis comparing patent foramen ovale (PFO) closure device with medical therapy. The authors concluded that PFO closure device reduces the risk of stroke with comparable transient ischemic events. However, PFO closure devices are associated with higher rates of atrial fibrillation/flutter. The reviewer would like to commend the authors for their work. The topic is timely as 3 randomized controlled trials were published. Overall, the manuscript is well written, and data is presented clearly. Satisfactory statistical analysis was performed. I have enumerated my concerns below. 1. First line introduction needs a citation: “The association between the presence of a patent foramen ovale (PFO) and cryptogenic stroke has been established by previous case-control studies.” 2. Please use abbreviations at its first use including clinical trial names. 3. As mentioned before, the authors could have provided more information on several more impactful variables including atrial septal aneurysm, size of the shunt. Additionally, effectiveness of the closure was missing 1 . 4. While listing complication rates, the authors should also focus on venous thromboembolism rates post-procedure.
