The authors have to be commended for their succinct meta-analysis of the recently appearing three papers regarding randomized trials concerning closure of the patent foramen ovale (PFO) for secondary prevention after ischemic events. Under adverse events it should be mentioned that in the RESPECT trial there was a significant increase in pulmonary embolisms (12 in the PFO closure group and 3 in the control group) and deep venous thromboses (5 and 1, respectively). The groin compression after the procedure may be performed too tight or too long and account for some venous thromboses or pulmonary embolisms. Two of the pulmonary embolisms are listed as a complication of the procedure. Nonetheless, this is of concern and merits some discussion. I also suggest to briefly raise the question of primary prevention in cases with a high-risk PFO. After all, a relatively simple intervention could and should prevent even the first stroke. Please cite and briefly discuss the 3 similar meta-analyses that have appeared in the past weeks: Lin et al. (2017) 1 Shah et al. (2018) 2 de Rosa et al. (2018) 3
