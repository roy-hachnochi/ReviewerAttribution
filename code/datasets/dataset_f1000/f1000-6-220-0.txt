The authors present a comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis of the effect of citrus-based products on urine profile. The paper is supplemented by the PRISMA flow chart and forest plot charts to present their results. Although their search strategy is good, they should have used other terms such as 'kidney stones', 'stones', 'ureteric stones' and 'calculi' too. They have only used the term 'Urolithiasis' which could potentially miss on other relevant studies. As a limitation of any systematic review the authors are correct in acknowledging that their is likely to be a publication bias. Similarly, the long term effect of the use of citrate-based products in not know from this study and whether their results translate into a reduction in stone recurrences remain unknown. A recent cochrane review on the use of citrate salts on prevention and treatment of calcium containing kidney stones in adults showed a reduction in new stone formation and stone recurrences in these patients 1 . Overall the paper reads well and is a nice summary on the use of citrate based products on urine profile.
