 This work determined mitogenome sequences of nominal subspecies of all five known species of Megathymus and Agathymus mariae and constructed the phylogenetic trees of the main Hesperiinae groups, the results confirms that Giant-Skippers (Megathymini) should not warrant a subfamily rank and that the monophyletic Megathymus splits into two species groups. In addition, the reconstructed mitogenomic phylogeny is fully consistent with morphological and behavioral similarities between the closely related species of the genus Megathymus. Overall this interesting work deserves to be published and indexed. The manuscriptâ€™s writing is good with an appropriate title and other content; the design, method and analysis is generally correct though some phylogenetic analyses should be more robust. If the work considers the molecular dating of the Megatheymus divergence by molecular clock method, and incorporates the analysis of relevant earth environmental factors, the results and significance will be more remarkable.
