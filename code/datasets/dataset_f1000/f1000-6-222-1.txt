This paper is an interesting contribution to our understanding of the evolution of Megathymini and the phylogentic placement of the tribe within the Hesperiidae. Using mitogenomes of all recognized species of Megathymus, the authors confirm morphologically-based species and species groups. Moreover â€“ they identify a deep mitogenomic divergence between lineages that correspond with important life history traits that define species groups.
