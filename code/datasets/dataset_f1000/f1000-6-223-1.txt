Thank you for the opportunity to review this paper. Studies of this kind are vitally important as Viet Nam builds its infrastructure for the treatment and management of NCDs. The paper is interesting and technically sound. There is scope to expand the statistical analyses to control for a range of factors but only if these data were collected for example, BMI, diagnosis of an NCD, whether the child was underweight or overweight. The only suggestion I have is to add to the discussion regarding the recent moves to train an expanded workforce in nutrition and dietietics. HMU is the first university to run the Bachelor of Nutrition degree and this expanded workforce will in the future build capacity for the delivery of nutrition counselling services in a range of settings. Knowing that clients are willing to pay for the service will contribute significantly to sustainability. In addition, some discussion or speculation on whether this would negate the contribution of universal medical insurance would contribute to the discussion. While I know that the review is meant to focus on the scientific content there are some content issues that need to be addressed Abstract: I would be more general with the Dong described 96100 is too specific for the analysis performed and would be better cited as 96000 add in USD to the $ amount quoted. page 3 Western Australia is not a country and so this sentence needs to be adjusted.
