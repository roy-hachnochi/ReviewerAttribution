This research study has been well documented and technically sound, with regard to statistical consideration. The analysis employs standard techniques and sample size has been reasonable (N=429). The report of results should be welcome as the need for healthcare and related data has become increasingly imperative. The authors of the work have presented interesting findings, especially the significance of a small amount of spending, roughly $4 for one-time counseling service, and $42 for one-year package of services, both significant at conventional statistical levels. Apparently, there are rooms for the authors to report more insights since I can see the opportunity for controlling for some of the most influential socio-economic demographic factors, such as income, or physical state, such as BMI, where conditional probabilities computed from appropriate modeling efforts can potentially be insightful. I was also a bit surprised with the fact that the rate of approval for use of ICT apps and devices has been quite low, and this reality will be in and of itself an issue worth exploring as they are critically important in today's age of information, and help reduce counseling costs. All in all, this is a good and useful study, and I am happy to approve it for indexing by F1000Research.
