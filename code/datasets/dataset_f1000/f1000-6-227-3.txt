Picopore is a well written package that installs quickly and easily, has clear guidance on its use and addresses a relevant issue in Nanopore sequencing at this time. The tools function as described (certainly on OSX). I have some reservations about reporting speed in terms of reads/s. I would like to see metrics which take in to account the number of bases being processed per unit time as I suspect the alternative compression options will perform differently by this metric. I also have some reservations about the use of some modes of picopore compression. Users will need to think carefully about the application of modes which are not immediately compatible with existing tool chains. Given recent announcements from Nanopore with respect to provision of off line base calling I suspect a better long term storage of data will be as simple raw files with an associated fastq.gz.
