This Research Note reports on an interesting and potentially useful exercise to identify and to prioritize candidates for target-based drug development in Plasmodium. The whole approach is relatively straightforward and provides a list of candidates to think about, not more, not less. Additional considerations could subsequently be applied by others to home in on reasonable targets to focus on. Overall, this short report was worth publishing, but would benefit from some revisions outlined below. Specific comments: How many genes are experimentally essential in both species is mentioned in the text at a relatively late stage of the presentation. It would be helpful to mention it earlier, e.g. in the legend to Figure 1 (the number of red dots). At some point, the author focuses on enzymes as targets. I do not think that enzymes are the only druggable targets. But if that's what the author wants to focus on, the term "enzyme" should be defined. Is it just based on the GO term associated with these genes/proteins? 40% sequence identity is still a lot, and may be too much if active sites are even more highly conserved. Moreover, in this conext I also agree with point 2 of the referee report by Gregory Crowther 1 . While I agree with Gregory Crowther's comment 3 1 about the relevance to drug discovery of the data in Figures 3 and 4, I still find this analysis interesting and not superfluous in the context of the overall story presented here. Figure 2: I share the confusion with Gregory Crowther 1 with respect to the math here. The text at the bottom of page 3 clearly suggests that 245 = 30+83+151, which of course cannot be. This needs to be fixed/clarified. References 1.

I confirm that I have read this submission and believe that I have an appropriate level of expertise to confirm that it is of an acceptable scientific standard, however I have significant reservations, as outlined above.
