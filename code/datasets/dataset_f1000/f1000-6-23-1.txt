This paper analyzes genome-wide data on gene essentiality from two apicomplexan parasites: Plasmodium berghei (the cause of malaria in rodents) and Toxoplasma gondii (the cause of toxoplasmosis). The paper is a new analysis of previously reported data (rather than a presentation of new wet-lab results), which is fine. Those whole-genome datasets are so rich that the papers with the original data cannot possibly cover every interesting angle, so I am happy to see interesting follow-up papers such as this one, which offers additional insight into the datasets. The following comments go from broad to specific. Broad While the analysis is interesting, I’m not fully convinced that it advances malaria drug discovery in important ways; it might actually be most useful as an investigation of basic apicomplexan parasite biology. Target-based drug discovery researchers are certainly glad to know whether particular genes of interest (corresponding to specific enzymes or pathways in which they have expertise) are essential or not. However, the figures present genome-wide trends that, while interesting, don’t seem that helpful in prioritizing possible drug targets. Figure 1 is probably the most relevant to drug discovery. It shows that genes found to be essential in one species (P. berghei or T. gondii) are more likely to also be essential in the other; thus, P. berghei genes not covered by the Gomes et al. (2015) screen 1 are fairly likely to be essential if their T. gondii orthologs are essential. Figure 2 shows a prioritization exercise which is not incorrect, but I don’t think sequence similarity to human proteins is an especially useful criterion. (This is also a limitation of Table 1, in my view). The hope is that we can avoid toxicity by targeting parasite proteins that are dissimilar to human proteins; however, overall sequence similarities tell us very little about whether a parasite protein will have any binding pockets (each of which represents a small part of the total amino acid sequence) that, in three dimensions, closely resemble any binding pockets of human proteins. Figure 3 shows gene expression data at the level of transcripts and proteins; I don’t think this information really applies to drug discovery. (For example, I don’t think anyone should say of a particular target, “Well, this isn’t highly expressed; maybe it isn’t a good/essential target after all.”. If I recall correctly, some excellent targets such as DHFR and PfATP4 are not expressed that highly) Figure 4 shows that some functional classes of proteins have a higher percentage of essential proteins than others – but I don’t think this helps us choose possible drug targets either. Even the right-most categories have plenty of essential genes, which is why, for example, there is interest in targeting fatty acid metabolism, the second-lowest category in terms of percent essentiality (see, for example, Shears et al. 2 ). Likewise, the unimpressive-looking “transport” category (~52% essential) includes PfATP4, a red-hot target of current Plasmodium research (see Wells et al. 3 ). Drug discovery researchers do not usually think in terms of the big broad categories shown in Figure 4, so knowing percent essentiality by category won’t help them much with target selection. The above observations lead me to the overall recommendation to revise the paper in one of two ways. Option 1 is to emphasize the drug-discovery stuff less and the basic biology more. Option 2 is to enhance the drug-discovery theme by addressing my concerns about the figures (i.e. explaining why they are more relevant to drug discovery than I’m giving them credit for) and/ or adding analyses that have clearer, stronger relevance to drug discovery. The paper does not currently try to combine the essentiality data with genome-wide predictions of “druggability” (which are hard!), but perhaps a collaborator could be enlisted to help with that. In general, most proteins (including most essential proteins) are not that druggable, so essentiality information in the absence of druggability information does not get us that far down the drug-discovery road. Specific Figure 1B: The legend says that green dots represent “non-conserved” proteins. I think that only conserved proteins are shown in this panel, and the green dots are proteins that are neither essential in both species nor nonessential in both species. Please check. Figure 2: Aside from my above-mentioned concern about homology to human proteins, it might make sense to show the arrows as follows: 710 = 289 = 245 = 151 = 83 = 30, thus showing the winnowing of the targets with additional criteria. In its current form, the figure initially led me to think, incorrectly, that the 245 genes could be split into subgroups of 30, 83, and 151. Figure 3: For 3A and 3B, the transcriptome data (relative abundance) don’t seem to correlate that closely with the proteome data (detectable or not). For example, essential gene expression in the sexual stages looks low at the level of RNA in 3A but average-to-high at the protein level in 3B. Are such discrepancies surprising/interesting? Discuss in the Discussion! Also, briefly define dN and dS (nonsynonymous and synonymous substitutions; 3C) somewhere in the paper. Also, to improve clarity, consider using one color for the bars corresponding to the asexual stages and another color for the bars corresponding to the sexual stages. Figure 4: Others must have done analyses like this for other (non-apicomplexan) species, e.g., of bacteria. Please compare the Figure 4 data to previous work in the Discussion. Also, why did the “cytoplasm” category come out as statistically significant? Are there a huge number of genes in that category? Can a paragraph be added to the Discussion on what sort of specific work might follow naturally from the present analysis? That would help readers appreciate the significance of the present work.

Not approved Fundamental flaws in the paper seriously undermine the findings and conclusions This Research Note reports on an interesting and potentially useful exercise to identify and to prioritize candidates for target-based drug development in Plasmodium. The whole approach is relatively straightforward and provides a list of candidates to think about, not more, not less. Additional considerations could subsequently be applied by others to home in on reasonable targets to focus on. Overall, this short report was worth publishing, but would benefit from some revisions outlined below. Specific comments: How many genes are experimentally essential in both species is mentioned in the text at a relatively late stage of the presentation. It would be helpful to mention it earlier, e.g. in the legend to Figure 1 (the number of red dots). At some point, the author focuses on enzymes as targets. I do not think that enzymes are the only druggable targets. But if that's what the author wants to focus on, the term "enzyme" should be defined. Is it just based on the GO term associated with these genes/proteins? 40% sequence identity is still a lot, and may be too much if active sites are even more highly conserved. Moreover, in this conext I also agree with point 2 of the referee report by Gregory Crowther 1 . While I agree with Gregory Crowther's comment 3 1 about the relevance to drug discovery of the data in Figures 3 and 4, I still find this analysis interesting and not superfluous in the context of the overall story presented here. Figure 2: I share the confusion with Gregory Crowther 1 with respect to the math here. The text at the bottom of page 3 clearly suggests that 245 = 30+83+151, which of course cannot be. This needs to be fixed/clarified. References 1.
