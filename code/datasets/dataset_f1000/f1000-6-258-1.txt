This paper has some scientific merit in providing new information about species composition of eel in Aceh waters and in using COX1 gene as a marker. As such I find it suitable for indexing after major revisions: Authors need to highlight in the Introduction the existing information/status about eels in Aceh waters. In addition, they need to relate the study on existing eel trade (domestic or export) in the area if any since this is the main threat for the said species. The paper of Asis et al. (2014) 1 would help enrich the objective of this paper. The reference DNA sequences used in the paper/trees are not clear. Did the authors established their own reference sequences for cox1? This should be indicated or made clear. References 1. Asis AM, Lacsamana JK, Santos MD: Illegal trade of regulated and protected aquatic species in the Philippines detected by DNA barcoding.

I confirm that I have read this submission and believe that I have an appropriate level of expertise to confirm that it is of an acceptable scientific standard, however I have significant reservations, as outlined above.
