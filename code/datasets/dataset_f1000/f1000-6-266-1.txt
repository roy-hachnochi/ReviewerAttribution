This study evaluated adherence to ICS prophylaxis in asthmatic children by using weight of canister as a means to determine inhaler compliance, by calculating doses used by using a regression equation based on canister weight. The authors conclude that in the absence of an inbuilt dose counter, weighing the canister was a useful means of improving adherence to daily treatment with ICS. Detailed comments: There were 52 children participating in the study. However, with each follow up visit (n=3)the number of canisters measure reduced progressively (44, 33, 23). Was there loss to follow up or did these patients fail to return their canisters? Could these patients be used as their comparative group in terms of asthma control over the period of follow up? For the subjects with the 11 canisters that had remaining medication, was their asthma control affected by non compliance? It may be more appropriate to use the term ‘used’ rather than ’discarded’ canisters. Under the paragraph: adherence assessment. Some editing of sentences may improve readability: Parents were asked to ‘return’ the ‘used inhalers at the 8 week….. ‘The weight of the canister was replaced in the regression equation’ to “The number of remaining doses of remaining doses was extrapolated by using the weight of the used MDI canisters into the regression equation as shown:……..
