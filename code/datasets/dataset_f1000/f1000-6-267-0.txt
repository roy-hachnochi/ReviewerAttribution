Microsurgical excision of sciatic nerve schwannoma with good outcome The authors reported an interesting case of sciatic nerve schwannoma in a 69-year old female, who was symptomatic for two-years, magnetic resonance imaging revealed presence of a mass lesion causing expansion of right sciatic nerve. A provisional diagnosis of peripheral nerve sheath tumor was made. She underwent micro-surgical excision using a sub-gluteal approach, intraoperative expansion of the sciatic nerve was observed, and nerve fascicles were carefully separated from mass lesion and well circumscribed lesion was excised, with physiological nerve monitoring. Histopathology was suggestive schwannoma with amelioration of symptoms 1 . Schwannoma is a benign peripheral nerve tumor of Schwann cells origin, that usually presents as a slow growing, solitary, well circumscribed mass. The sciatic nerve involvement represents less than 1% of all schwannoma 2 . Peripheral nerve sheath schwannoma symptom relates to alteration in the function of nerve and surrounding muscle and neurovascular bundles, and mostly commonly present with paraesthesia or pain of insidious onset and progresses slowly 2 - 4 . Pain is a much more common symptom than motor deficits. Pain due to sciatic nerve schwannoma may simulate chronic sciatica pain produced due to a prolapse of lumbar herniated disc. Physical examination may reveal the presence of a lump along the course of the sciatic nerve, which is tender, have mobility along the transverse axis but limited along the course of the nerve, and with a typical positive Tinel sign. However, pre-operative diagnosis cannot reliably in most cases (even with magnetic resonance imaging) distinguish among schwannoma, neurofibroma, or plexiform neurofibroma, but aids in delineating shape, size, location, extent and relation with parent nerve and adjacent neurovascular structures and muscle. Imaging plays a limited role in distinguishing among peripheral nerve sheath tumors. Magnetic resonance imaging may show presence of fusiform mass with characteristic tapering cephalad and distal ends, fasciculation sign and split fat signs 3 - 4 . The mass is located eccentrically, well-circumscribed, and shows isointense signal on T1-weighted images and hyperintense signal and peripheral rim demonstrate hypo-intensity signal representing capsule T2 weighted images 3 - 4 . The diagnoses of sciatic nerve schwannoma depends on MRI of sciatic nerve carried out in the event of normal MRI findings of lumbar spine, but the patient still complains of the persistence of sciatica-like pain. Treatment of epineurium encapsulated tumour is microsurgical excision with careful preservation of the sciatic nerve fascicles. Histopathological examination of resected specimen confirms the definitive diagnosis 1 - 5 . Kim et al. analysed 397 cases of peripheral nerve sheath tumor, out of which 91% were benign and the rest were malignant. A total of 251 were located in the brachial plexus region or upper limb. 141 benign lesions were related to brachial plexus tumors, and the rest (110) belonged to upper-extremity benign peripheral nerve sheath tumors. In contrast to upper limb, the peripheral nerve sheath tumor involving lower-limbs included 32 cases of schwannomas and 53 cases of neurofibroma 5 . References 1.
