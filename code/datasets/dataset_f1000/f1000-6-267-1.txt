I congratulate the authors on an interesting case report. It is a well written report but I would like to suggest a few additional points. Since several such case reports have been published earlier, it would be interesting if the authors could add a 'review of literature'. A single tabulated format with some interesting characteristic, such as the exact location of the tumor along the course of the sciatic nerve. It would also be interesting to see a small table with other 'sciatica mimicks'. Personally I have seen lumbosacral plexus tumors presenting with sciatica. The article may be accepted for indexing with these minor additions.
