I found this paper very interesting but hard to follow at times. The 2 nd column of the discussion seems to be at bit contradictory. The authors give possible mechanistic explanations for their observations then draw attention to the many uncertainties in the final paragraph. My own view is that these uncertainties are so large that it is too speculative to comment on biological mechanisms. The sex and country differences are apparent in the figures but it would be interesting to comment on these in the discussion. Can anything be explained by aggressive public health campaigns in Australia? Specific points What is the scaling of the x axis of Figure 1? Different colour codes are used in Figures 1 and 2 which I found confusing Are educational and prevention campaigns period effects? I would have thought that they are cohort effects, because the age group that they affect is likely to be important Should sunscreens be mentioned? Their possible role in melanoma has been analyzed in several studies Can anything be deduced about latitude effects?
