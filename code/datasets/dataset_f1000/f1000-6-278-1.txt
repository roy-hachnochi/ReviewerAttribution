This manuscript reports on the re-running of two PCA analyses presented in an earlier publication Li et al 2008). The authors confirm the PCA results presented in the original paper and point out two minor differences. The analysis looks solid and carefully executed. There a few aspects that could be improved: What I missed a bit was the justification why only the middle Eastern and European subsets were reanalysed. Also, the authors motivate their reanalysis so that they can use these individuals as controls for their PRECISESADS study. I was expecting the authors to go slightly further: do they have control samples? Where do they map on these PCA plots? If they match the location of those from the HGDP, I agree that it is an excellent indication to go further with their study cases. I think these points would further our understanding and go beyond the partial re-analysis of a published data and reporting identical findings. Would be very helpful for the readers to see for every analysis step where did the authors use exactly the same tool as Li et al and where do they differ? If at some point different tools were used, were the parameters set to be identical? How close was the pruned subset of SNPs when analysed by them and by Li et al. ? The title and abstract reflect well the study content. The methods and results are clearly explained, the data are available and the analysis is provided in full details in a Docker container. Study motivation could be better explained and the conclusions in terms of consequences for their future study could be more detailed.
