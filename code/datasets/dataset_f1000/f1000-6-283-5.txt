Associative learning and memory is a very interesting topic. Jin-Hui Wang et al. summarize associative memory cells in their formation, features and functional impacts. The review is well finished. I have the following suggestions: 1. P1: The definition for associative learning: ”Associative learning is a common approach for information acquisition” is a bit too general. I suggest that using “Associative learning is the learning of associations between events” to replace it. 2. Give a definition for “associative memory cells” and provide evidence to support “associative memory cells”. 3. P2: Since “In the studies of cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying associative learning and memory, animal models in fear conditioning, eyelid-blinking conditioning and operant conditioning are used”, the following description for associative memory cells should be advanced using these models. The present description for associative memory cells is a bit too general.
