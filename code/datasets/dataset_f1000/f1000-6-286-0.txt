The authors have addressed all of our concerns in an adequate manner. Importantly, all uncertainties resulting from methodological problems of the irisin measurements in the included studies are now clearly named in the re-structured discussion. There are three minor issues left: (I) + (II) The authors used the term “molecular weight” two times (page 16, last paragraph) when addressing “concentrations” or “circulating levels” of irisin. (III) Again, not the similar molecular weight of irisin compared to leptin, insulin, and resistin makes a biological function of irisin likely but the similar circulating concentrations (discussion page 15).
