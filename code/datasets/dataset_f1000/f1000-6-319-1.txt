The software is adequately explained and is a useful tool for a specialized task, fitting the format and section of the F1000. It is great work given that this was all completed during the hackathon. However I would suggest some polishing of the readme on the Github. This will still not make it any easier to use for not expert users, but for this purpose it would be ideal if the authors can add a short software readme as supplementary to the manuscript. The citation I have provided with this review points to a paper for the BioDocklets software that includes a manual that the authors could use as example. Other than that this is a great article that provides a very useful tool integrating key aspects of two important databases for the community.
