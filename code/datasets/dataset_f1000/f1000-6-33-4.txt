Overall the paper by Nikolaev et al., is well written and an interesting part of the photo- and biochemical realm. The paper provides very promising results and a unique way of analyzing structure functionality. I am interested to see what other results arise and the how the applications indicated can be strengthened. I have just a couple of minor suggestions that may help to understand the described subject a bit better. In your abstract please name some examples of real applications. The methodology and computational analysis was a little over my head and difficult to follow. However, the proper audience for this paper may be for those with a stronger foundation of computational analysis and programs indicated in the paper. Archaerhodopsin-1 is misspelled on page 2. Best wishes to this group and any further work that will be done!
