Interesting case. It would be more interesting if authors can comment of the role played by mirtazapine in curing the adipsia. One of the side effects of mirtazapine is increased thirst. Mirtazapine increases dopaminergic neurotransmission and dopamine has role in the modulation of thirst. On reviewing some of the case reports which deals with adipsia and psychiatric disorders (depression, schizophrenia), the treatments or intervention (electroconvulsive therapy) used have one thing in common. They all increase dopaminergic activity, supporting the hypothesis that deficiency of dopamine or lack of dopaminergic activity may be playing role in the pathogenesis of adipsia. Adipsic hyponatremia is uncommon in patients with psychiatric disorders. Hence secondary causes like tumour, histiocytosis, sarcoidosis involving the hypothalamus should be ruled out. An MRI of the brain with or without contrast would be the most appropriate investigation of choice rather than a CT head without contrast. Patients with adipsic hyponatremias associated with psychiatric disorders will have a normal ADH response and an appropriate increase in urine osmolality. References 1.
