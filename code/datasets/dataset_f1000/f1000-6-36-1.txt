I am disappointed to see that most of the issues identified in the original manuscript remain unaddressed including grammatical mistakes. e.g. The current literature on folate transporters as drug targets has not been discussed, including information on their essentiality. Using keyword and BLAST based searches will miss and misidentify folate transporters, thus more sensitive HMM profile based methods should be employed or please provide a justification for not doing the same. Many sentences identified as unclear in the previous report remain unchanged. I would request authors to provide a point by point response to my previous comments. I would be very happy to reconsider their response.
