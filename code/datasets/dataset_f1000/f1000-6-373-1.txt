 General Comments: The authors present a case of a patient who has accidentally ingested a cleaning agent and has long lasting oral taste and sensitivity problems. Major Comments: Although interesting, this case does not add much to the understanding of the underling mechanism. We do not learn what the composition of the cleaning agent was. The pictures are not really pathological. Tongues are like faces, they have a wide variety of individual differences which are not always pathological. The images suggest that the complaint and the neural damage can be seen. I do not think that if you would give these pictures to 5 ENT specialists without any history they would label them as pathological (unlike a clinical image where no text is needed and everybody knows the diagnosis). Finally, the authors mix two things that do not fit together. There is an average case report and a general overview about taste testing. I think this is a kind of not suitable mix. The overview is too short and superficial and not critically discussed. The case report is not well discussed (as the discussion is about taste tests and not about the case). There is no further lab tests done for the case to rule out other diseases (Vitamin deficiencies, Sjgren, metabolic disorders, etc..). 1.5 year follow up is short for taste disorders. Recovery of severe dysgeusia takes up to 2 years (see reference [1])
