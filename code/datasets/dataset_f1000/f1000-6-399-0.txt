When the title presented was as “induced by water and inorganic nutrient”, I was expecting different watering different regimes. It comes to no surprise that the control will have least significant effects on the plant growth since it received no fertilizers. If the authors would have applied the same fertilizing regimes on the rainfall fed, then they would have stronger arguments that water did influence the onset of flowering. The same opinion is applied to the treatments in the glasshouse. Obviously, no watering on fertilized plants will gives devastating effects on the seedlings. However, if they would had expand the watering regimes to different volumes such as 1,2 and 3 L for example, giving some stress induced conditions to the seedling then perhaps they could gives a strong conclusion that watering was the main effects in inducing flowering. Their arguments fall towards more on the watering rather than the fertilizing as this comprise the main treatments. The results presented with comment “Finding providing evidence of the beneficial effect of water supply and fertilizing (for the first time)” for me is hardly surprising or new. Many plants that are put into cultivation must go through cultivation studies to determine the optimum agronomic practices, and basically water and nutrients are beneficial to obtained optimum yield. What I would like the author to stress on, since few studies are put into the cultivation of miracle fruit is the emphasis on the best fertilizing regimes for its growth. For me, by chance the 2L water did induced flowering as compared to the rain fed plants. In my opinion, the rain should had been measured. In the future, when this plant is plant in the field, how will they expect to provide 2L water or are this recommended for indoor pot plant? Nevertheless, this paper is recommendable since we need as much baseline data for the cultivation of this underutilized plant.
