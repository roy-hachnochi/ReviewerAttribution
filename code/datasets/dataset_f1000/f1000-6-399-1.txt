It was a great and pleasant surprise for me to read such a well-documented paper. The results obtained by the authors are revealing the intensive research conducted in the almost 3 years of experiments, and those results are properly highlighted in the content of the present paper. The documentation was also very detailed and thoroughly done, which demonstrates the authors' involvement in the chosen topic, as well as their dedication to it. Through their research, the authors managed to shorten the juvenile phase (ending with budding) at Synsepalum dulcificum from more than 36 months to 21 months with simple daily water provision, while when suitable fertilization scheme was combined to daily watering, first flowering occurred at an average age of 23 months and at 16 months old for early flowering individuals. In the article it is also stated that the first fruiting occurred at the average age of 24 months. These achievements shorten almost to half the vegetation period for Synsepalum dulcificum, which means that this miraculous plant has the chances to be bred and produced on a large scale very soon. My hope is that the authors will continue their research, for in the near future we would be able to find a way to produce it in other parts of the world.
