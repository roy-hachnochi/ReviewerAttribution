The present report describes the distribution of rd8 lesions found in commercial C57Bl/6NTac mice. While the presence of such lesions has been known for a while (Mattapallil et al. 2012, the uncited Simon et al. Genome Biology 2013 1 ), it is to my knowledge the first such quantitative description, with as well the first report of the higher prevalence of lesions in males compared to females. I would suggest to replace Figure 1 with a composite fundus image indicating the extent of the retinal field which is examined (an approximate angle should be indicated), as the retina is rarely observed up to the ciliary margin, especially in a first-line phenotyping as the IMPC pipeline. As some animals may have only peripheral lesions, they may or may not be taken into account depending on the retinal field examined. As animals are essentially affected in the inferior hemicycle, I think Figure 2 is misleading. The panels should rather be 0, I1/S0, I2/S1, I3/S2 and I4/S4. It would also be better to include fundus images that illustrate the various grades of scoring. The difference between males and females is large, and considering the number of animals, should be significant, but it would be better to use statistics. The flecks scores raw data are provided, but it would be useful to provide a comprehensive set of images illustrating the full spectrum of lesions. Were the lesions randomly distributed in cohorts, or were some cohorts more affected than others?
