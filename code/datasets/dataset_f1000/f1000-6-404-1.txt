The report is interesting in describing the Crb1 /Rd 8 phenotype; however, the genetic analysis is still essential to use and to verify the status of the mutation since other genetic defects can lead to a similar retinal phenotype on different mouse background strains. Limited references were included. Because Crb1/Rd8 is a recessively inherited gene, it can significantly play a role and the defective Crb1 protein can interact with other retinal proteins that lead to degeneration and go undetected because of its regional effect.
