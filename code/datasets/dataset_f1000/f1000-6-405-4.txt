This was a very well-written manuscript and quite relevant to our current times since there is a definite push for open science in academia. This is becoming increasingly necessary as we continually acquire larger data sets. I have a few comments and suggestions. I would replace the words “the whole enchilada” under the headline “Open science requires significant Investment”. I would also replace “so on” in the same section. Instead of the headline “Broader impact of open science is uncertain” may I suggest something along the line of: “Open and broad communication could impact open science”. In the section “Open Science requires significant investment”, it is suggested that a key cost of open science is time, which is reasonable. However, one of the points is that “time to produce scripts with a sufficient level of robustness and documentation to be useful to others”; this point is less reasonable. I believe with or without open science, this should an integral requirement of all scientists and so this last point should be omitted. Your three first points to propose to enable open science more effectively are valid, however, you don’t circle back to these in your final discussion. May I suggest using instead the points that you end with, such as: Finding a way to properly cite open codes or data available through open sources Developing a reliable, robust tool to track utilization of open science (note: similar idea to 1, but goes one step further) Universities need to support infrastructure to implement FAIR data principles This way you end with developing the points that should enable open science. All these are suggestions. Should the authors decide to ignore them, it will not dampen my enthusiasm for this well-written manuscript.
