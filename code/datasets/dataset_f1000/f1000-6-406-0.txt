There is so little information on awareness of common STIs in countries like Bangladesh that it is great to see that the authors included syphilis and gonorrhea in their assessment here. The study is strengthened by the nature of the survey which appears to be a nationally representative household sample (albeit from 2011, but that is OK given how little data we have from this region on this topic). My major question is about the conduct of the interviews themselves, especially given that I suspect a lack of privacy might have been one challenge, especially for women who might not have had much autonomy in some households (this may be presumptuous of me, so I would welcome the authors' provision of details). How were the women approached? Was a standard interview format used? Were the interviewers male? Was there any effort to match interviewers by sex? These are important considerations if we are to judge the results as representative and significant, and we need to know more about the methodology in general.
