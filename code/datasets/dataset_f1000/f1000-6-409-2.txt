Summary: This review clearly demonstrates the need for more studies investigating the role of autophagy in respiratory disease. It is good that the authors added some unpublished data into the review article as support of evidence. Major comments: Figure 2 can be improved. Eg: at the arrow between Autophagy and Cell Growth/ECM release, the authors can add the words increase energy resource so the readers understand the association between Autophagy and Cell Growth/ECM release. Authors should consider adding ‘Genetics’ into the figure. The authors could add ‘circadian rhythm’ into the figure with a ‘?’ to show that it is a factor for further investigation. For the collectively structural changes of airway remodeling, please include smooth muscle hyperplasia (James et al . 2012; Am J Respir Crit Care Med). In the autophagy and fibrotic airway remodelling section, the paragraphs could be rearranged. Eg do not split TGFb1 between the paragraphs. The section about circadian rhythm seems to be a better fit in the Therapeutic strategies: Novel autophagy modulators section, as it is something to further evaluate as a potential target. Are there any genetic component as evidence of autophagy in COPD? For example: Chen et al. 2015; J Formos Med Assoc. Should have a reference for the sentence regarding TGFb1 leads to accumulation of ECM. ECM could be abbreviate earlier in the article.
