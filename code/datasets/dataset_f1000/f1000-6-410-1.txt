This is a remarkable report on three patients with ALS who improved after treatment with penicillin G and hydrocortisone. This treatment was based on the observed beneficial effects of this treatment in patients with ALS and syphilis. The authors hypothesize, this effect of treatment is a result of reduction of GABAergic overstimulation by penicillin G. However, all too often neurologists have seen astonishing improvements in uncontrolled studies. Therefore this treatment should be tested in a randomized controlled trial. Before embarking on a large scale trial, I would like to suggest to start with a small efficacy study in patients with ALS in whom the respiratory function is decreasing. The primary outcome in this trial could be the maximal inspiratory pressure which is a well known surrogate marker for disease progression in patients with ALS. In trials in patients with ALS few placebo-effects have been observed, which means that a quick answer is possible to the question whether or not this treatment improves respiratory function. Moreover, there are no safety issue in such a study. Clinicians owe to their patients with this devastating disease to test the effects of this treatment with high priority, since there are presently no other promising therapies.
