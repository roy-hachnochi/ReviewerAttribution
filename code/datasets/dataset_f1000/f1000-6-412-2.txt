 The authors report the ocular profile of a rare but an important systemic disease, which adds relevant information to the literature. The study highlights the choroidal tubercles as hallmarks of miliary TB. Providing fundus photographs would add value to the manuscript. Four patients did undergo both fundus photography and OCT. But the authors havenâ€™t described the OCT findings in any of these. Another reference may be added; Sharma et al. 2012.
