The data presented build on the authorsâ€™ earlier studies of reversal of apoptosis. They provide useful information documenting changes in gene expression following 5 hours of exposure to ethanol, an apoptotic stimulus to primary mouse liver cells. The findings only make sense when taken in combination with the authors previous work, which provides a compelling case that the recovery from apoptosis in indeed occurring, and the manuscript documents some of this by reprinting figure panels from an earlier publication in Figure 1. My only minor comment is that, at least in some cells such as neurons, cleavage of caspase-3 can be a regulatory signal that does not herald cell death, but may influence biological processes such as synaptic function.
