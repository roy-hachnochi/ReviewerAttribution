This study unravels the gene regulatory network that seems to be involved in the process of anastasis. It is interesting that the authors found various genes that appear to participate in ethanol-induced anastasis, suggesting that the dynamic reconstitution of gene regulatory networks might be a prerequisite for rescuing cells from the brink of cell death. Overall, this work is worth being indexed. However, I would like to see the following points in the research addressed, before approval: Anastasis is a developing concept rather than an established one. It would be better to show the expression dynamics of caspase-3, PARP, and ICAD at all analyzed time points (Cont, R0, R3, R6, R24, and R48). In addition, why don't the authors show apoptotic DNA fragmentation to make sure that all the analyzed cells in the anastasis stage definitely underwent apoptosis? I may have missed noting this, but there is no statistical analysis of the gene expression changes observed in the microarray data. In Fig. 2B, the expression levels of several genes seem different in the same time point replicates. It would be better to show the genes that were induced or suppressed during anastasis, along with the statistical significance of the differences. Given the importance of understanding the mechanism of anastasis, it would be better to verify the data obtained from microarray analysis, by using quantitative PCR or Western blotting.
