An interesting case of orbital metastasis of lung adenocarcinoma is presented. Lung cancer is one of the leading causes of death globally. Adenocarcinoma occupies the first place in epidemiological frequency (50%) is also one of the most frequent types of tumors in non-smokers. They are classified into 4 histological types: acinar, papillary, bronchialveolar and the mucin secretory variety. The adenocarcinoma originates from mucoproductive cells. Adenocarcinoma metastasis to the orbit is infrequent. In the orbits most of the tumors are primary, but they can also reach the orbit by contiguity. At least 50% of patients with orbital metastasis are unaware of the existence of a primary tumor. Metastasis is less frequent than ocular metastasis. Apparently, there is no predilection for any specific orbit and their bilateral appearance is rare. The most frequent orbital metastasis are breast, lung and orbit. They have been described a 5 types of clinical syndromes associated with orbital metastasis. The first type is mass syndromes. In more than 50% of cases. This syndrome causes displacement of the eyeball. The second type is infiltrative. The third type is an inflammatory type. The fourth type of metastasis is called functional and is frequently located in apex orbital. The last type is silent, does not produce symptomatology. The use of fine needle aspiration biopsy is an excellent option when orbital metastasis is suspected. Finally, the patients with orbital metastasis are not candidates for orbit surgery for extirpation of the tumor mass. The realization of surgery does not offer a cure. In cases of slow-growing tumors, the extirpation of metastasis and the primary tumor may improve the prognosis. Management strategies include radiation therapy. Sometimes the use of radiation therapy results in vision recovery.
