A major deficiency of the report is the lack of characterization of the tumour. Whilst the CT imaging is convincing for a lung primary it should at the very least be commented whether the tumour was non-small cell (and ideally whether adeno-, squamous or neuroendocrine) or small cell -the HE slide is suspicous of the latter, although I am not a pathologist. Ideally it would have been established if it were TTF1 positive supporting a lung origin. I am surprised that the smoking status of the patient is not reported. The sentence: "Orbital metastatis as the initial presenting symptom from a metastatic lung lesion is a rare entity, occurring at an incidence of approximately 7%" - the denominator 7% of what? - I suspect orbital tumours. Metastasis spelt incorrectly The sentence: "Poor management also increases the odds of progressing the tumor stage." is incorrect: the disease stage is already IV. What I think they mean is that patients may become too unwell for anticancer treatments and the visual impairment worse and harder to palliate. Funduscopy should be fundoscopy "PET scan is a rapid viable model for assessment tumor staging8" PET scanning would only be considered if simpler imaging modalities failed to identify a primary site, as in a lung cancer, staging is already M1b I remain troubled by the 7% figure which is repeated in the discussion. If orbital metastasis really occurred in 7% of all cancers it would not be regarded as that rare. Reference 2 does not give any evidence for the 7% figure quoted, does not give the denominator (either) and I can't see any evidence for the 7% figure quoted in reference 1. The outcome for the patient is not described with sufficient detail, including length of survival.
