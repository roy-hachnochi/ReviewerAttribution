This paper expands on a previous study (Ref 32) and shows that the number of inter-residue coevolutionary relationships can be correlated with the evolutionary conservation of a protein site and protein family. The authors applied four different algorithms to calculate the coevolutionary relationships between sites and an overall trend observed in this study is confirmed by different methods. Interestingly, the absolute scale of site conservation for sites with the same number of coevolutionary relationships can differ drastically between methods (for example McBASC and MIp on Figure 1). I wonder if the sets of pairwise correlated sites overlap between different methods. I would also suggest using MISTIC server which can provide information on conservation, coevolution and structure mapping. The relationships between coevolution and diversity of protein families is interesting and intriguing, can it be related to the quality of alignments, one of the major factors defining the accuracy of coevolutionary detection algorithms? It is important also to discuss the difference between covariation and coevolution, the latter is not necessarily the cause, see some recent studies: PMID:25944916).
