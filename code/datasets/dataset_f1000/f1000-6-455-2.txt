The authors provided indirect evidence that peroxiredoxin-6 does not undergo sulfhydryl oxidation when human pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells are exposed to PDGF but this protein undergo sulfhydryl oxidation when these cells were exposed to H 2 O 2 . It was concluded that protein carbonylation is more sensitive target of ROS during ligand/receptor-mediated cell signaling than sulfhydrul oxidation. Major comments: I believe that the conclusion of this study is too general and the authors should restrict themselves to the main findings of this study and do not extend their observation beyond one type of cells exposed to one growth factor (PDGF). In addition, the authors used an indirect method to assess sulfydryl oxidation rather than a direct measurement. Moreover, the authors did not provide evidence in the current study that PDGF actually produced carbonylation of Prx6. This data is required to document the differential oxidation response of this protein to these two interventions (H2O2 vs. PDGF exposure). Finally, the authors need to provide data as to the time course of Prx6 oxidation in response to H2O2 exposure. They have only shown one time point.
