In the review by Saas et al., the authors discussed the collective knowledge of the metabolic status of pDC. Despite the fact that data on this subject are rather scarce, the authors prepared an interesting manuscript. They also included a section about the role and function of pDC which created a more comprehensive source of information. Comments: Abstract needs more clarity, i.e. “Recent data support the idea that the glycolytic pathway (or glycolysis), as well as lipid metabolism (including both cholesterol and fatty acid metabolism) may impact some innate immune functions of PDC or may be involved in these functions after Toll-like receptor (TLR) 7/9 triggering. Some differences may be related to the origin of PDC (human versus mouse PDC or blood-sorted versus FLT3 ligand stimulated-bone marrow-sorted PDC).” If the authors want to keep this in the abstract they should probably mention what the differences are. Please consider rearranging and shortening the Introduction to avoid repetition. When talking about the role of mTOR in pDCs, I think there is no need for a detailed introduction to mTOR – there are many recent authoratitive reviews on this subject. The authors should refer to one of these. For example, a review by David Sabatini. The language of the review can be confusing at time. For example, the following sentence should probably be deleted for the sake of clarity: “After differentiation in the bone marrow, PDC are released into the bloodstream for homing to different lymphoid tissues. Thus, PDC isolated from blood of healthy donors or patients consist in PDC migrating to these tissues.” The authors should make an attempt to reference original work rather than other reviews. For example, “Localizations of PDC in other lymphoid organs, such as Peyer’s patches of the gut”. Instead of Li et al. (2011) 1 , please cite the paper by Contractor et al.(2007) 2 .
