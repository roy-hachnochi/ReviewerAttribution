This review by Saas et al. reports on an original question, rarely addressed in reviews: the role of metabolism on the innate functions of plasmacytoid dendritic cells. Authors have performed a very good job summarizing current knowledge in the field. They very extensively present the molecular and functional pathways involved in PDC biology, and the possible interactions with various metabolic pathways. This way represents the current state-of-the-art. A large number of references are cited, in the field of general PDC biology, including important founder papers, as well as in the field of metabolism, and the role of metabolic pathways in PDC. We only have a few comments on the manuscript: The discussion of PDC implication in disease could be expanded. In particular, authors could discuss the role of PDC in the tumor microenvironment. It is known that metabolism plays an important role in tumor development and antitumor immunity. Can this also be through affecting PDCs? Is there a crosstalk between PDC biology, metabolism, and tumor progression? Several articles in the past few years have addressed the function of PDC in cancer and could serve as a basis for a discussion. Other diseases could also be discussed in more details, in particular autoimmunity. Indeed, the pathways involved in PDC activation in disease context may be slightly different from exogenous purified TLR ligands, due to the diversity of stimuli and the complexity of the inflammatory microenvironments. Figure 2 is a bit too dense and confusing. We suggest to clarify it removing or reorganizing some of the information. The article should also be edited for better English.
