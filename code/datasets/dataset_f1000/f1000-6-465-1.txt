The rational and the objective of the Brassica Information Portal is well explained. Its complementarity with existing data repositories including genomic data repositories and tools and in particular its role as an important repository for Brassica Phenotyping Data is clear. Its relation to other Phenotyping Brassica repositories could be further discussed as perspectives. BIP makes good use of the current standards for plant phenotyping data, in particular MIAPPE and Cropontology. By being implicated in the current evolutions of MIAPPE, the BIP team demonstrate its will to ensure interoperability of this system with international standards. This is important for long term sustainability. The data submission process is well described. It shows that significant efforts have been made to ensure data quality and to ease data managers task. Data consistency between population, ontologies and trait datasets should be ensured with the chosen mechanisms. Data citation is well ensured by a DOI generation for datasets. BIP use modern and proven technological solutions, like Elasticsearch, Nginx web server, rich BIP Web Service API backing the whole user interface and allowing user or programatic interaction with the system. For the technical description of the software tool to be fully sound, the following points should be improved. The role of BIP in the BrAPI should be further described. In the Author Contributions, BrAPI is cited but it doesn't appears elsewhere in the text. Some technical description could be improved, for instance "universal search" isn't very clear. This paper shows very well the development process of the BIP information system. The current status of the system is clear. Its perspectives could be further discussed regarding FAIR compatibility, Open Data including data licences policies (CC-by). Alongside this point, BIP team curent opinion on distributed phenotyping information system, backed by the BrAPI, could be discussed.
