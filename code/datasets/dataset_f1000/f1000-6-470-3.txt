This is an interesting way of presenting a familial case of renal disease from the patient perspective. The case illustrates how a new diagnosis of monogenic (Mendelian) disease can impact on the family, by firstly clarifying the underlying cause, and being able to discuss in more detail the prognostic and genetic testing implications. It also illustrates the powerful impact of the rapid improvements in genetic sequencing technologies, and how these have translated into clinical practice. It is worth emphasising that this will have impact on all clinicians treating renal (and other) diseases, who will need to keep up to date with the current screening technologies and interpretation/limitations of the data generated. In the UK routine whole genome sequencing of patients with rare diseases is being rolled out, so there will be more cases like this being uncovered and requiring counselling. One key issue touched upon is the ethical implications of testing younger family members, who may (or may not) develop disease much later in life. The consensus at the moment is to wait until the young person is of an age to make the decision to test independently, unless there are treatment implications of knowing earlier in life. With this particular mutation this is unlikely to be the case, though cases of TRPC6 mutations have been reported to present with proteinuria as early as 6 years of age. Another ethical consideration of whole exome or genome sequencing is of finding completely unrelated potentially pathogenic mutations. This needs careful pre-counselling before the test is done.
