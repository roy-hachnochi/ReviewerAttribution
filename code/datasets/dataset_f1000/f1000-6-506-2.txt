My major concern with this study is that title and discussion are not relevant to the data presented. There is no justification to link this study to neuropathic pain or painful diabetic neuropathy. Perhaps more appropriate title would be: “Mitochondrial dysfunction in an animal model of Type 2 diabetes may be involved reduction in neurosteroid synthesis “
