The authors have addressed almost all my comments. However, there is still one mistake in abstract need to be corrected. i.e., Results: "....A total of 33/42 facilities reached the goal for on-time appointment keeping". The number should be 31/42 according to Table 2 and Discussion section. I think this manuscript is ready for to be indexed after correcting one minor error as stated above.
