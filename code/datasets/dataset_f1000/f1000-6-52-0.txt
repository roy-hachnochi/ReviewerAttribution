The article is very well written and discusses the implementation of a valuable tool for the community. The use of Docker is currently very popular, and the combination with CWL/WDL is very good. I have a minor comment for the on-line tool and the presented workflows (https://dockstore.org/search-workflows). Currently, there does not seem to be description for the presented workflows. Example: https://dockstore.org/workflows/ICGC-TCGA-PanCancer/wdl-pcawg-bwa-mem-workflow "No description associated with this workflow. " This makes it difficult for users to select a workflow. Adding a short description would be very helpful.
