The illegal trade of the counterfeit alcohol is the growing problem in many European countries 1 . Especially cause worries about recent growth of the infiltration the counterfeit alcoholic beverages into online markets and social media platforms 1 . The paper written by Neufeld and coauthors addresses the relatively new phenomenon, which did not have much space in the scientific literature: the illegal internet trade of the counterfeit alcohol in Russia 2 . The topic itself is extremely important from a public health perspective, because consumption of alcohol surrogates and counterfeit spirits was identified as one of the major contributor to alcohol-related deaths toll in Russia 3 , 4 . Therefore, this paper is the helpful contribution to fill up this gap. The authors reasonably argue that the internet market of the counterfeit spirits has become an important trade channel of the unrecorded alcohol in Russia, which poses risk to human health due to toxic chemicals, such as methanol; and, also undermines the measures of the alcohol control policy, introduced in this country over the last decade. The scale of this problem is well illustrated by the case of the mass poisoning in Krasnoyarsk city (Siberia) in 2015, due to consumption of the falsification whisky bought on the Internet, which killed almost 30 people. According to newspaper reports , over 6.000 bottles of Jack Daniels were seized in this city, which contained a mixture of methanol, ethanol and the water. In relation to this, the Russian government should consider a number of potentially effective approaches addressing to the problem of the counterfeit spirits, including raising public awareness of the life treating danger, posed by these products, and also taking the legal actions against the people, offering counterfeit alcoholic beverages for sale on websites and social media platforms.
