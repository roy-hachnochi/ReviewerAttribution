Overall this is an important contribution. A few relatively minor concerns: 1. The term "proven" is used quite a bit. It may be better to use the more qualified "shown" or "demonstrated." 2. The paper by Moloney and colleagues (2011) demonstrates quite clearly that rates of hypnotic use are high, not really tied to insomnia diagnosis, and often chronic. This may aid in making the case in this article. 3. In addition to mentioning the ACP guideline, even the recent AASM guidelines for prescription hypnotic use state that evidence for using hypnotics is overall low. 4. There is often causal language that may be more strong than the evidence warrants. For example, it is not clear that the role of hypnotics in suicides is causal. Certainly, anecdotal evidence suggests that people overdose on sleeping pills, but the cited report has a whole paragraph about suicides that makes mostly circumstantial connections. Clearly there is a relationship, but the causal role of hypnotics is not so clearly demonstrated. 5. If hypnotics don't produce benefits, then why do people keep taking them? For example, even if the medications do not directly impact on sleep, there may be evidence that the effects on suppressing memory may outweigh the effects on sleep. So they may not actually improve sleep much but reduce the memory or perception of sleeplessness. If this reduces the discomfort associated with insomnia (i.e., it removes your memory for the events) then it could potentially have some sort of reinforcing benefit in that regard. Just saying that there are no benefits may be a bit oversold. 6. The "Detailed estimates" section does not actually include detailed estimates. Rather, it provides several general estimates for a number of specific pathways by which hypnotics could induce harms. Perhaps this section could be better labeled.
