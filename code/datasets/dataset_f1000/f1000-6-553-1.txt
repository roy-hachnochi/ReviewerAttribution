Interesting Case. In the attached video, the phenotype would most likely fit into ataxia/ wide based gait/ cerebellar origin in my opinion and think that the term parkinsonism might be misleading. Other than the mentioned tremor were there any other features to suspect extrapyramidal disease? Were there any other variant of currently unknown significance on the exome?
