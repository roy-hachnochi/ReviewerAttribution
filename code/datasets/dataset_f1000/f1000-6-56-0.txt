In this manuscript, Chandler et al described in detail how they used the Nanopore sequencing technology to assemble the mitochondrial genome of Nippostrongylus brasiliensis. They also annotated the mitochondrial genome and did phylogenetic analysis among a selected group of nematodes. In addition, they characterized the Nanopore sequencing features for this genome. Overall, the authors have demonstrated that they can produce the complete mitochondrial genome from their Nanopore sequencing dataset. The authors were able to recover the mitochondrial genome from a genomic DNA library due to the much higher copy number (often hundreds or thousands of times) of the mitochondrial DNA when compared to the nuclear genome. This approach has also been extensively used to recover mitochondrial and chloroplast genomes in whole genome shotgun libraries. In principle, it should work for any type of sequencing technology. The Nanopore sequencing technology is relatively new and is still fast evolving. In this case the technology does not seem to me to have a clear advantage over the Illumina or other sequencing approaches on mitochondrial genome assembly. In additional, the authors eventually used the Illumina data to do the error correction to make the final assembly. Nevertheless, the authors have presented a complete genome assembled from a combination of Nanopore and Illumina data with a full description of how they did this. Not considering the novelty or significance of the work, I think the mitochondrial genome is properly assembled and annotated. The results are clear and the manuscript is well written.
