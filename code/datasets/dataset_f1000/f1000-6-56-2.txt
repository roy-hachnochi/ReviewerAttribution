The paper describes the sequencing of the mitochondrial genome of the Nippostrangylus brasiliensis with the novel Nanopore sequencing technique. To the best of my knowledge this seems to be one of the first mitogenomes that have been sequenced with this technology. The annotation of the genome and its use for phylogeny and taxonomic identification have been discussed. Another group has sequenced the genome (including the mitogenome) has been sequenced using another NGS strategy. While this seem unfortunate its actually good for this study otherwise no reference data would have been available for comparison and error correction. I'm missing an analysis of the error rates of the sequencing without the correction that has used the read data from the other study. I'm wondering if the combination of data from MiniON sequencing and short read sequencing strategies might be a good general strategy? The paper is well written and needs only a few corrections and additions. Details are given below. Abstract: ========= The term "electrical consensus sequence" might be puzzling for uninformed readers. Introduction: ============= "L3" is also difficult to understand for non experts. Maybe add 'stage'? "highquality" missing space MiniON sequencing ================= "R7.3" Can you explain what this means? "89% pores" is unclear to me. What are "2D reads"? Scientific justification ======================== "strict maternal inheritance": nothing in biology is strict. Check for paternal leakage or doubly-uniparental inheritance. The term "read until" methodology is unclear. DNA extraction and library preparation ====================================== Explain the abbreviation PBS Error correction and circularisation ==================================== It needs to be explained what the custom script is doing. "Repeated sections of the linear contig were merged... " What happens with true repeats? Since not all readers might know the color chartreuse I would suggest to order the colors as in the legend. Mitochondrial genome annotation =============================== I'm wondering why automatic methods for genome annotation have been ignored. Not saying that the applied approach is wrong. When you use cmscan you need to state the used model as well. "tRNA... codon sequences" Do you mean anticodon? How about non-canonical start codons? How do you define "plausible" in frame stop? For the truncated tRNAs there are examples known for Enoplea: see http://dx.doi.org/10.4161/rna.21630 and http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biochi.2013.07.034 Phylogenetic Analyses ===================== References for RAxML and trimAL are missing. Event Mapping ============= "Event information" Specify what an event is. "per-group" and later on "signal groups" You should reformulate this. Currently its a bit confusing. Why pentamer? What is an ideal signal trace? Raw Signal Mapping ================== Has Graph Map been referenced? Discussion ========== Are you really sure that the sequence is "error free"? In the end of the paper you write that its of "high enough quality...".
