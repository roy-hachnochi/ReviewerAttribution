The article is interesting and it can be indexed after revision. Suggestions for revision as follows: The introduction is too long and it needs to be shortened. The majority of the concepts in the introduction should be in the paragraph of the discussion. A further paragraph regarding the surgical techniques and the insertion of the lumbar catheter should be added in the Results section. Details of the surgical technique are in the Introduction section. 17 patients had post-operative misplacement of the lumbar catheter with no symptoms nevertheless the authors conclude that intraoperative image guidance is suggested in all procedures to avoid misplacement of the lumbar catheter. The authors need to report the literature data regarding the misplacement of the lumbar catheter and clinical symptoms related. I agree that further randomised clinical trial with a large number of patients can clarify the utility of intraoperative image guidance during lumboperitoneal shunt insertion. The conclusions need revision.
