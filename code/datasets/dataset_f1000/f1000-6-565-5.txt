Authors claimed that using a fluoroscopic system may reduce the risk of misplacement of the proximal catheter. However, they did not see any spinal cord injuries or other complications due to misplacement. In conclusion section this needs clarifying. Misplacement rate was given but this was emphasized as a technical complication, not a harmful cause. The second vital point is that it is unclear the meaning of misplacement according to this article. It should be clarified “misplacement”. Did they use this term as the inserting vertebral level or the end position of the proximal catheter? Figure 1 showed wrong insertion points, but in the introduction section this was defined as “misplaced inside thecal sac due to migration”. Besides, position of the patient doesn’t change vertebral levels due to anatomical landmarks. For example, in lateral position, superior iliac line passes L-4/5 level like in anatomical position. Authors should give some strictly defined methods using fluoroscopy, positioning and evaluation to allow replication by others. Following clarifying these points, this article may accepted for indexing after reviewing of the revised version.
