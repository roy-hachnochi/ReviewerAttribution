Newman and Easteal 1 challenge the findings of Dong et al 2 on the evidence of a limit for human lifespan. They highlight rounding errors and inappropriate selection of data. These errors have been documented in a series of communications to Nature 3 - 6 and in a recent article 7 questioning Dong et al’s results. Newman and Easteal provide code to reproduce their results, which is highly valuable. Newman and Easteal state that “we fit log-linear models to age-specific mortality rates”, which, called the Gompertz model, is common practice in demography for some ages (usually between 30 and 90). However, the authors do not fit a Gompertz model to the age-specific mortality rates (denoted m x by demographers). Instead they fit log-linear models to the age-specific probabilities of death (which demographers denote by q x ). They do so to estimate the Maximum Survivable Age (MSA), as can be seen from lines 950-989 of the provided code. There is a fundamental problem with this approach. A linear model fit to the log probabilities predicts probabilities exceeding one at high ages. To avoid this fallacy, Newman and Easteal postulate that the MSA is the age when their model predicts a probability of death of one. This is arbitrary and unconvincing, especially in light of evidence suggesting that age-specific probabilities of death reach a plateau at advanced ages at a value of about 0.5 8 - 9 . Although the authors acknowledge this evidence, they disregard it. Moreover, they fit their model using the Ordinary Least Squares approach, which assumes normally distributed errors that are identical over age. This is an assumption that does not hold, implying that their estimated coefficients and standard errors are not correctly calculated.
