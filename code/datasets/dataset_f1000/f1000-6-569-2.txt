This manuscript challenges the recent findings by Dong et al . that human lifespan has an upper limit and proposes that human lifespan is rapidly increasing. While I am quite convinced by all the problems the authors identified in the analysis performed by Dong et al . and by the maximum survivable age of about 125 years the authors estimated for humans, I am not convinced at all by the claim that maximum reported age at death is expected to rise over the next century. In particular, I do not understand the rationale of removing Jeanne Calment from the analysis. This data point has been validated. Contrary to the authors' interpretation, the mere existence of a lifespan of 122 observed 20 years ago without being even approached since then seems to indicate that some saturation in the maximal age at death is occurring. It is required to estimate the probability of not observing older ages at death for 20 years under different scenarios of increasing trends in maximal age at death. Detailed comments: p. 3 second column 3rd paragraph l. 1: Remove "significant" p. 3 second column 3rd paragraph l. 1: Should be "Calment", not "Clament"!
