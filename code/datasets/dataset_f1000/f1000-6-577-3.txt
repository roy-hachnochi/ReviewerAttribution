The paper by Courtial et al. describes the cross-reactivity of two commercial antibodies produced against the mammalian forms of ERK for the scleractinian coral Stylophora pistillata. This should open new perspective for the study of ERK signalling in response to different environmental cues. The paper is clear and well written, however it lacks of some references. In the Introduction, the authors should cite other invertebrates where ERK signalling is known to be conserved and regulated by environmental cues, for example Ciona intestinalis (Castellano et al, PlOS One 2014, Castellano et al, Open Biology 2015). Similarly, in Results and Discussion, when the authors say that .. "a single orthologue of ERK is present in these cnidarians, as opposed to the two genes encoding ERKs in most mammalian genomes”, they should specify that also in other invertebrates, only one ERK form was found (Russo et al, JBC 2004; Castellano et al, PloS One 2014). Also the use of the MEK inhibitor U0126 was assessed in C. intestinalis (Castellano et al, Open Biology 2015). Finally the authors pay attention along the text to some errors, i.e. change “Thr2020/204” with Thr202/204, and “through this medium” with “through this method”.
