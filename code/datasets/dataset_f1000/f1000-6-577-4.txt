The manuscript provides first insight into a putative MAPK in the coral Stylophora pistillata. Experiments include protein extraction and immunoblot analysis. Overall: The experiments that had been performed are properly designed. However, the manuscript lacks sufficiently-detailed information, as well as controls (protein loading). Conclusions are premature or should be re-phrased. Detailed points of criticism: Title “orthologue” is inappropriate. Should be “homologue”. Methods P3 “small rubbins selected” – please be more specific about size and sampling: “tissue removed from coral”: be more specific. Tissue primarily from the surface, how deep was the cut into the material? (I suggest to include a schematic figure incl. scale-bar). This information is important because inhibitors (e.g. UO126) will only diffuse over a short distance, i.e. not reach deeper layers. P4: “extensive washing”: duration and number of solution changes missing Fig.2B: “% or control” rather OF control. The error bar in the control sample is irrelevant, as it is defined as strictly 100%. There is no documentation of protein loading (e.g. Coomassie-stained membrane after immunodetection). The U126-independent intensity of the ERK-Signal is insufficient as control. Conclusions: “…antibody can be used…in different experimental or environmental conditions” This conclusion is premature. As a minimum, the authors should perform an induction experiment. The inhibitory approach (U126) only evidences that a MAPKK is the upstream regulator. Coral research community will only benefit from the antibody and the current study if dynamic ERK activity responses can be monitored.
