Hello Colombo et al. , Firstly: I am so very sorry for such a late review. Anyway, the new manuscript looks much better. Thanks for the revisions. I just have one nitpick: in Figure 2 you show the p-value distribution over the range (0, 0.05). Perhaps I missed something, but I'm not sure I completely understand the value of showing over this interval rather than the whole interval (0, 1). Does it have to do with the normalization adjusting p-values specifically in this range? Regardless -- nice work and congrats!
