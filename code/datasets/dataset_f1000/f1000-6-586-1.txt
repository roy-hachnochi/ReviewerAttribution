This paper introduces a RNA-Seq analysis pipeline, Arkas, which combines currently available tools typically used in RNA-Seq studies. The novelty of this pipeline is the encapsulation of tools needed to prepare the data, run quality control checks, analyze the data and perform secondary analyses. This is especially beneficial for investigators new to RNA-Seq analysis with little experience navigating through computational tools. The authors take care to outline the rationale behind creating an easy-to-use interface and how this will increase reproducibility and consistency across RNA-Seq studies. They emphasize the importance of consistency with versions by showing differing results between two Kallisto versions. However, there are some minor limitations also found in this study: It would be beneficial to include quality control checks at the beginning of the pipeline to generate data regarding the inputted sequencing files. It would be interesting to see more processing time information to show the benefit of using this pipeline compared to similar methods. As is discussed, the inclusion of lncRNAs increases the amount of potentially interesting results from this pipeline. However, the authors have chosen to ignore microRNAs, an important regulator of cellular function. The inclusion of microRNAs as a default option in this pipeline would provide even more potentially interesting results. The normalization steps and Figure 2 should be discussed in more detail. Specifically, expand on the reasons for choosing these two methods and the differences between the methods and their outputs. In addition, a note about how a user should select a normalization type would help new users. Whilst the authors suggest that the integration of Docker will help produce reproducible research methods, the in-depth look into Docker is unnecessary, as no data has been provided to show its benefit above other options.
