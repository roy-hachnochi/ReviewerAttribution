I commend the author for a thorough revision of the manuscript in the light of reviewers' comments. I had three significant concerns previously. The first was about methodology, and the author has addressed this with more details and description of the method. The second concerned omitting mention of 'real time peer review in the open' as an option, and including 'open platforms'. Realtime open review is now mentioned. Open platforms are retained, but it is mentioned that they are an unusual (or 'fringe') case of the meaning of open peer review. The final major concern was about conflating editorial selection with peer review, and the author has now nicely clarified this distinction. My more minor concerns have also all been addressed.
