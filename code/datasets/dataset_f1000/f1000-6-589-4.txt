The article is timely and relevant. The authors are correct in stating that there is little attention given to adult drowning across the world. This type of epidemiological study is crucial as a first step to developing effective strategies for intervention. I would like to see more explanation on how rural versus urban settings were determined as well. In regards to distance of incident to homes, it should be stated that since it was measured visually by data collectors there may be some issues with accuracy. More clarification on self-reported swimming ability would also be helpful to better understand the validity of that variable. Iâ€™m cautious about the use of the Wikipedia source cited in the discussion. Overall the article is well developed and methodologically sound. Conclusion drawn appropriately from the data.
