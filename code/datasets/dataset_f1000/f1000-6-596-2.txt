The RNA-Seq Viewer tool is well motivated and clearly described in this article. RNA-Seq Viewer does a good job of combining data from multiple public sources into a single coherent visualization and interface. There is a great need for more tools like this that make use of the huge amounts of public genomic data available. I found an online example of RNA-Seq Viewer here . It would be very useful if this link was included in the Abstract so that potential users can quickly try out the tool. Although beyond the scope of a 3-day hackathon, in the future it would be valuable to turn this tool into a fully hosted web app so that no download or command line knowledge would be required.
