 Yes, the current literature is cited. The discussion points out that acromegaly is associated with insulin resistance and Laron dwarfism is associated with insulin sensitivity. While both are true, growth hormone deficiency is also associated with insulin resistance, which may be a state that is more analogous to partial GH receptor blockade which would be induced by pegvisomant (Johannson et al , Metabolism 44:1126, 1995 and Alford FP, J Endocrinol Invest 22: 28, 1999, among other sources). The study design is appropriate and conventional means of assessing insulin sensitivity are used. Generally sufficient details of methods and analysis are used. It would be useful to know the age adjusted normal ranges of IGF-1 levels for the subjects in the study to better understand their levels compared to a normal population. Subjects were asked to continue there normal levels of activity, it would be useful to know more about this since exercise can dramatically affect insulin sensitivity. The statistical analysis and interpretation appears to be appropriate. The appropriate source data are available. In the conclusion, the authors note that the results are surprising in light of the known effects of GH in two extreme circumstances (acromegaly and Laron dwarfism) but do not cite the substantial literature suggesting insulin resistance in growth hormone deficient patients from other causes. Partial GH receptor blockade may more closely mimic the GH deficiency of hypopituitarism (which is often partial as well) and thus these results may not be as surprising as the authors assert.
