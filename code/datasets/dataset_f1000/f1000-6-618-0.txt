The authors submitted a revised version of their manuscript and took into account my main concerns. However, I still have some minor issues to share. 1) The Tulip assembler require a set of seeds as input, but the authors did not mentioned how those seeds were obtained. 2) Table 2 refers to a dataset of 11,344 nanopore reads (representing 17X). Does it represent the entire dataset (R7.3 and R9 runs)? In the first version, the authors reported a dataset of 2.05Gb (representing a higher coverage, ~200X). Please clarify this issue by, for example, adding a table which describes the produced dataset and the input dataset used by each assembler. 3) The filter parameters of the NUCmer output are not mentioned.
