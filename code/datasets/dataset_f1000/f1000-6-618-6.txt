The authors presented de novo whole-genome assembly of a wild type yeast isolate using nanopore sequencing. They tried three different approaches to assemble the genome: using Illumina reads only, using both Illumina and nanopore reads in a hybrid approach, and using the only nanopore reads for assembling and Illumina reads for polishing. The third approach resulted in the most contiguous assembly. In they work they use nanopore datasets made with R7.3, R9 and R9.4 chemistries. Although they used a correct procedure for genome assembly it would be interesting to compare their results with the following methods in the third approach: Using minimap+ miniasm assembler in combination with Racon consensus tool and PILON Using Canu + racon + PILON Try to polish nanopore assembly using Nanopolish In addition, it would be valuable if they make their data publicly available to enable others to reproduce their results.
