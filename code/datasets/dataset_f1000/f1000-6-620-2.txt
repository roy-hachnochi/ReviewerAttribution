Ogbuago and coworkers provide a small study on 19 HIV-HCV coinfected individuals that were treated with an 8-weeks course of sofosbuvir and ledipasvir. Overall, the SVR rate is 95% with only one individual not responding who was in-adherent. The study, although small, adds knowledge to the existing literature. Minor comments: The authors should point out more clearly that they are dealing with a difficult-to-treat population here: A high percentage of AAs, high levels of IDU, and high BMI. This values the results even more. In the Introduction the authors should point out that DAAs have changed treatment paradigms in HCV, but that 12 weeks treatment duration still proved to be the threshold hard to beat. It only worked so far with this regimen presented here. It will however change with new compounds. In the discussion, the description of the ION-3 trial is slightly inaccurate: The non-inferiority of the 8-weeks regimen was an endpoint of the study. The 6 mil viral load threshold was a post-hoc-analysis.
