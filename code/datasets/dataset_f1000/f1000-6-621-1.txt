The manuscript identified a number of SNPs in GWAS as risk factors for PCa in various European populations as well as defined SNP-SNP interactions, using PLINK software, with nucleic acid samples from a New Zealand cohort. The approach which authored used to find a gene x environment marker for aggressive PCa gene x environment interactions can be adjusted statistically, however, it is highly impossible in practicality. The manuscript compiled most of recent literature available on the subject and propose justified discussion on the research question. Since I do not have sufficient expertise in statistical analyses used to elaborate the key findings of the manuscript, I am reluctant to comment on the authenticity and validity of conclusion.
