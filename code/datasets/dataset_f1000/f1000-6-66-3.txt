This article addresses a critical element in the research process that involves humans. Their goal of adapting a technology for use in clinical research for the purpose of consent is laudable and to be encouraged. Innovation is desperately needed. The authors may wish to consider the following as they iteratively seek to improve their paper 1. The centrality of consent is incontrovertible. What the authors propose here is a radical solution that has enormous infrastructural and resource implications. The paper would be more compelling if the authors demonstrated that there was a systematic problem in how consents are currently obtained and that, in theory at least, that this method would address these problems, in particular the issue of the need for changing consents. 2. The IT requirements around clinical trials in particular is already substantial. The notion of a parallel process for all of the data management systems and then for consent sounds particularly daunting. Is it possible that the two systems could be integrated? Otherwise I fear that this approach has limited feasibility. 3. I'm sure the authors would agree that a trial among a group of research-literate participants is very different to typical research participants. One critical element around proof of concept is not the IT/software capability but whether participants would even use such an approach once, let alone multiple times. As it stands the current study is pre-proof of concept perhaps.
