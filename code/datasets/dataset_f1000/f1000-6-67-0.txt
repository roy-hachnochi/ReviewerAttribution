I would like to congratulate Falleno et al. for their fantastic work encompassing a comprehensive review of the Trabectome - utility in unique and common circumstances, using OCT to measure outflow after treatment and describing a training modality to enhance surgeon readiness to increase success and avoid complication when adapting this surgical technique. I might add that in practicing the surgical technique and using the intraoperative gonioprism, surgeons can introduce a blunt cannula to simulate introducing the handpiece in the eye to better visualize how an instrument looks under gonioscopic view. This article also advocates an extensive pig eye experience which can be incredibly useful. The authors site the training decreases operative time and likely potential for complications with more advanced, pre-procedure training. I also commend the authors for explaining the use of trabectome in non traditional indications. Trabectome has the advantage of not implanting hardware and a potential for lowing IOP with a lower risk profile than traditional glaucoma surgery. It is important to recognize that the trabectome likely only treats one area of resistance where more distal resistance in some patient might limit the benefit of this surgical technique.
