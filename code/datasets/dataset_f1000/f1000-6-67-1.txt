This well written paper is an extensive and excellent review of the outcome of glaucoma surgery after trabectome procedure worth publishing. Also training strategies are reported like performing surgery in a pigs eye model and practicing visualisation of the trabecular meshwork in cataract patients. Some minor remarks The authors claim, that 180 degrees of the trabecular meshwork is removed during surgery (see "Surgical and training methodologiesâ€œ). This is probably not the method which is used by all trabectome surgeons. They should explain the guidelines of the manufacturing company or the experience from the early studies where the removal of less trabecular meshwork was used or advised. Most of the literature is based on a large databank managed by the manufacturing company. Only few patient series exist which are not part of this databank. This could be commented by the authors and they could point out or stress which papers do not rely on the Neomedix databank. The authors estimate that a trainee needs to perform surgery in 29 eyes to master the technique. To enable the reader to follow this interesting statement, the estimation process could be explained in more detail. The index of the literature should be revised between numbers 51-55. The numbers are not correct.
