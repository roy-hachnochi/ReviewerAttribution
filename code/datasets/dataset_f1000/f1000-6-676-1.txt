This is a brief research note that is under review. It refers to an independent reanalysis of data from another research group was done for a controversial study on non-local consciousness. The reanalysis used a non-parametric permutation. The only thing that I do not understand clearly is the results. It appears that the results of 25 session (different subject pairs) divulged a significant p-value of p = 0.006 in a group analysis. Next, it is explained that four out of the 25 sessions were independently significant at p0.05 two tailed. I am a bit confused. I guess this means the greatest significance was seen at the group level, and at the subject level only four subject pairs showed significance. I am not sure I am understanding this correctly. Please make sure it is very explicitly stated to avoid the confusion I have had.
