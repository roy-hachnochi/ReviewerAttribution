This case report described a presumable rare inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (IMT) in the terminal ileum leading to an ileal conglomerate in a patient previously treated for Wilmsâ€™ tumor. Overall the case was well-presented with adequate discussion. However, the diagnosis of the tumor and the conclusion are not supported by the histology or immunohistochemical staining pattern, and therefore further studies are necessary in order to reach a definitive diagnosis. Detailed comments are listed below: The findings are not diagnostic of IMT in this case based on the morphology of the tumor, lack of ALK1 expression, and diffuse h-caldesmon staining which is more typical for a smooth muscle tumor such as a leiomyoma or leiomyosarcoma. The rich lymphocytic infiltrate also raised the possibility of an EBV-associated smooth muscle tumor if the patient is immunocompromised. An EBER in-situ hybridization would be helpful to further evaluate for this possibility. Again, the diffuse and strong h-caldesmon staining of this tumor is very unusual for IMT, and is not supportive of this diagnosis. All of the reported h-caldesmon positive IMT cases have only focal positivity. In my opinion, a FISH analysis for ALK1 translocation is necessary to reach the diagnosis of IMT in this case. In Figure 1A, there are 3 arrows and it is not clear what one of the arrows is pointing to. Please clarify. In Figure 2A, please add an arrow to indicate the mass. For both A and B, please modify the background so that it is a solid color without blood or other materials. Please provide a 3 dimensional measurement of the tumor in gross description. More discussion on the differential diagnosis of IMT based on histology and immunohistochemical profile is recommended.
