The authors present a method using NMR to determine MOSH and MOAH in cosmetics and cosmetic raw materials. Overall this work is important, as it provides a complementary approach to screening methods such as GC-FID. I have only a few comments that the authors are invited to comment on: Clear deviations of NMR versus LC-GC-FID results are described in the paper, for example MOAH amounts are lower by the NMR method. However, no direct comparison on the same sample is reported, which would strengthen their argument. The need for a confirmatory approach in foods and food raw materials, albeit using GC-MS, has recently been reported by Spack et al in Food Additives Contaminants, 2017 ( http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/19440049.2017.1306655 ). This reference should be included on page 10, after the paragraph “…. LC-GC results should be complemented by the NMR-approach (or alternative confirmatory technique such as GC-MS) to perform a suitable risk assessment,……..”. I am not certain if NMR is the appropriate methodology to determine PAH4, as it will not achieve the required sensitivity / specificity, so less focus should be placed on these compounds. I would suggest that the authors rather identify specific aromatic hydrocarbon markers to possibly identify the origin of the “contamination”, which would be a next step in the research approach.
