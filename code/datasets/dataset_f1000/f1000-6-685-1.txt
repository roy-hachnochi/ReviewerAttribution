 Major comment WIth the current data provided, I am not convinced we are dealing with an allergic reaction: No bacteriology results are provided: are we not dealing with chronic infection? Macroscopic picture of intraabdominal findings during reoperation after 2 months is missing I am not sure Fig 1 is sufficient to determine an “allergic foreign body reaction”; moreover the authors do not use the histological aspects in their argumentation for an allergic reaction (last paragraph of the discussion); do we have other lab results or patch testing available? How do we explain the retroperitoneal inflammation if the problem arises intraabdominally on the ventral abdominal wall? Is the patient allergic to prolene, monocryl, polydioxanone or other parts of the mesh? Was patch testing performed? The advice of an allergic/immunology specialist is needed Minor comment The authors should give (a) reference(s) on the higher rate of recurrences and reoperations with physiomesh after lap ventral hernia repair; are there any comparable findings described as in this case during reoperation?
