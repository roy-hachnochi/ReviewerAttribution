The data note reported was produced by 150bp paired-end Illumina sequencing of genomic DNA prepared from the sugarcane variety CP-96-1252. A raw data set of 101 Gbps was generated and made public available.The authors did not present assemblage data which would be useful for the research community interested in sugarcane genomics. Sequence coverage was not stimated but it seems to be under 1X. Sugarcane commercial varieties are hybrids between Saccharum officinarum and Saccharum spontaneum. These two parents are highly complex polyploids with ploidy varying from 8-12. In general, the hybrids conserve ~75% of the S. officinarum and 15% of S. spontaneum intact. Around 10% of the hybrid genome are chromosomal recombinants between the two species. This complex situation makes it very difficult assembling large non-chimeric contigs especially using short insert shotgun sequencing. The high quality data set presented in this data note is of value for those interested in recover short gene regions of interest. Because sugarcane genome sequencing dataset is very scarse I recommend the publication of the note presented here as a source of genome data for the sugarcane community.
