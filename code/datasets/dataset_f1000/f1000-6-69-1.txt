The present study suits the Data Note format and can be a useful resource for future studies centered on Cannabis sativa. I find the bioinformatics approach sound. I have one suggestion for the author. How about enriching Figure 1 with a representation of GO/pathway enrichment analysis for each cluster (for example with ClueGO in Cytoscape; Bindea et al., 2009 1 )? The interest around this multi-purpose crop is increasing and recently transcriptomics data have been published for a fiber variety too (see for example Behr et al., 2016 2 ). The approach described in this note can be applied also to other varieties in the future and/or to other tissue types. References 1.

Not approved Fundamental flaws in the paper seriously undermine the findings and conclusions The bioinformatic approach presented in this study is potentially highly interesting, providing to scientists a useful data set to investigate the different pathways activated in Cannabis sativa at different developmental stages, and in different organs. I would only ask to the Author if some of the gene sets identified could be further divided into sub-clusters: e.g. there is a “green” area in Fig.1 – cluster 4 in leaves and flower buds (about in the second quarter from above). On the opposite, this area is "red" in cluster 5 – first quarter. Could be these results interpreted under the light of the considerations exposed in the discussion?
