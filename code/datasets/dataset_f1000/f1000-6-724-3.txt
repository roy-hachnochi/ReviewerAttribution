The manuscript by Diana Zala, Mathieu Boissan and colleagues is a well-written, thorough, and timely review of the literature on the biological relevance of nucleotide channeling, focusing on ATP and GTP. This piece has three strong aspects. First, in order to the build a case for the importance of spatial and temporal regulation of NTPs, this review provides a range of biological examples from basic metabolism, to membrane trafficking, to specialized subcellular structures. Second, the coverage of literature encompasses both the classical papers in the field as well as the insights from the recent publications. Third, the Authors nicely elaborate on the evolutionary link between the biochemical abundance, subcellular localization and specialized functions of NTPs. Hence I strongly endorse the publication of this manuscript. I have two suggestions. Recently a milestone paper was published suggesting that ATP may, in fact, act as the biological hydrotope 1 . Given that the cytoplasm is a very crowded environment the high concentration of ATP increases the solubility of macromolecules. The authors should discuss this novel, additional role of ATP in the cell. Also, I recommend including the example of glycolytic enzymes that are shown to assemble into a non-membrane bound compartment in in vivo synapses under stress conditions 2 to maintain the necessary levels of ATP. Minor comment: For a clearer overview, include the chemical structures of ATP and GTP next to cartoons in Figure 1, and the formulas of the intermediates in glycolytic pathway in Figures 2 and 3.
