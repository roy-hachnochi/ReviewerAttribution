This is a very careful study of the physical states of cellular membranes of different organisms under well defined and physiological conditions (e.g . temperature). The experimental approaches are well explained and performed in the most precise manner. This type of analysis, together with the recent study performed by Niko, Klymchenko and coauthors (Scientific Reports) using a different probe, provide a clear cut and most informative picture of the geography of cell membranes and should be very useful in the future for membrane biologists. Clearly, the plasma membrane differs from intracellular membranes by its high order state. As simple as it may seem, this result is fundamental and has been overlooked in the past as compared to other ideas and models of cell membrane organization, which are compatible, but which put the emphasis on nanodomains, which remain difficult to capture. Note that in addition to the cholesterol gradiant, other parameters could also contribute to the increase in lipid ordering along the secretory pathway; most notably lipid remodeling, where the acyl chains of some bulk lipids tend to become more saturated at the PM as compared to organelles of the early secretory pathway.
