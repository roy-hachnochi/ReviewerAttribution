This well-written and organized manuscript addresses an extremely timely topic in drug discovery. The authors starts defining the basic concepts of polypharmacology and polyspecificity. Then, in a very clear and didactic manner (using nice illustrations), propose a general and intuitive mathematical approach to quantify the degrees of both concepts. It is clear from the manuscript the mathematical relationship of polypharmacology and polyspecificity (e.g., paraphrasing the authors “the two sides of the same coin”). The new measures address at some extent data incompleteness that is a major issue of chemogenomics data sets. As the authors point out in the Conclusions, this paper sets the ground to implement these metrics to public or private chemogenomics data sets. In particular, I found quite innovative and clear the edge-colored bipartite networks introduced in this manuscript. I strongly support indexing of this paper. Minor suggestions to further improve the manuscript: The term “frequent hitter” related to polypharmacology can be added in the Introduction. Comment on the effect of drug concentration in chemogenomics data sets. For instance, adverse drug reactions, and drug-interaction networks in general, will depend on the drug concentrations. Page 4: Include reference related to the statement: “Recent work from Shoichet’s group at UCSF …”. I believe the authors refer to the paper published in ACS Chem. Biol. 2015 1 . This manuscript is not included in the Reference section of the current version. Spell out "UCSF" (University of California at San Francisco).
