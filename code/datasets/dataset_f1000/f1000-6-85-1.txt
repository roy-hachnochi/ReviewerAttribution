From my point of view, the authors have made relevant changes to the paper and have met all the requests previously suggested. In a way that was reviewed by the authors, it was clarified the cut-off points used for the color discrimination, contributing to a better understanding of the results. In addition, the discussion has improved. Thus, I believe that now the paper should be accepted for publication.
