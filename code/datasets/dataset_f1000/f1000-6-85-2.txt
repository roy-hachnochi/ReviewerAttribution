I found the manuscript was improved but still have some concerns. 1. Outcome Cutoffs There are some difficulties to understand the Outcome Cutoffs section. The authors should state clearly how they determined and calculated the cutoff points. I also suggest explaining what the values in parentheses represent and what IQR means (interquartile range). Although the authors mentioned ‘(mean + median + IQR + upper and lower limits)’, the plus signs in this phrase seem a bit odd. 2. The Results Section Please clearly compare the thresholds with the cutoffs values. Not only the median thresholds for smokers, but those for normal observers also exceeds the cutoff values in the deutan and tritan tests, don’t they? I think that the cutoff values might be too strict (low).
