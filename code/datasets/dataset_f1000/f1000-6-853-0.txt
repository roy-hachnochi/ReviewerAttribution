This is a well-organized and well-written study of the important topic of the neural and psuychological effects of menstrual hormonal variation. The observation of both behavioral (reaction time) and event-related potential measures suggest that the neural changes may be important for everyday behavior and emotional responses. What was the recording reference? This is important for interpreting the ERP waveforms. It appears the plots are baseline corrected; is the large ramp over frontal polar channels a result of this? It looks like there was a large negativity before the stimulus, and that the positive ramping is actually a recovery following a large stimulus-preceeding-negativity that returns to baseline during the perceptual process. Addressing these minor points will improve this already solid manuscript.
