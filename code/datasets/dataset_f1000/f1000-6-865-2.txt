Mr Ali and colleagues present a study that revealed the mean platelet volume and platelet distribution width as good parameters to predict uncomplicated malaria parasite infection.The manuscript is well written and presented. The analysis of the results is adequate and correct. Some minor points should be reviewed: As the authors used several statistical tests to compare the results between cases and controls, it is important to make these tests explicit for each p-value presented in the tables, as a footnote. The title of Table 5 is not clear. In fact, Table 5 compares means (SD), and non-median (IQR). In the last paragraph of the Discussion section the sentence "...parameters formalaria-infested blood..." should be changed by "... for malaria-infected blood...".
