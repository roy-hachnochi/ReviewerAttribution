This white paper presents a framework for integrating computational proteomics into ELIXIR as the result of a strategy meeting on ‘The Future of Proteomics in ELIXIR’ that took place in March 2017 in Tbingen (Germany). The meeting discussions lead to six priority areas: Multi-omics approaches; Proteoforms and PTMs; Quality Control (QC) activities; Data analysis workflows and cloud computing; Protein quantification and statistics; Metadata, standardization, annotation, and data management. The priority areas are well aligned with the current ELIXIR platforms: Data platform; Tools platform; Interoperability platform; Compute platform; Training platform and can be integrated into ELIXIR. The paper is well structured and written. Minor change: On page 7 of PDF version of paper, paragraph "2 - Tools platform ...": "it is worth highlighting that there are around 350 tools proteomics tools represented in this resource already", the first "tools" should be removed.
