Proteomics has reached a point in which bioinformatics is of paramount importance for the process to extract the maximum information out of the enormous amount of data obtained in practically any study. The scientific community in general and proteomics in particular is eager to get new and effective solutions that may implement that way. In this white paper manuscript, Vizcaino et al. explain the ELIXIR initiative and the importance of integrating proteomics in this European Research Infrastructure. Authors cover in a detailed way what was covered on the meeting that took place in Tbingen (Germany) on February 2017 under the name “The future of proteomics in ELIXIR”. The paper is well written and structured. Conclusions are clearly stated.
