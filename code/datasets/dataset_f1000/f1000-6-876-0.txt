The article advocates research software openness presenting four recommendations to improve research software visibility, re-usability, and transparency. I really like the article and I think it is important to open research software. Please find below my feedback. (Overall, I agree with the comments of Milad Miladi): In my opinion, the title does not reflect the content of the article. The focus is on adopting OSS and supporting the provided four recommendations to help to develop better software for better research. Currently, only the second part (supporting the provided four recommendations to help to develop better software for better research) is reflected in the title not the part about OSS. I am not sure everybody is familiar with the open registry platforms. Thus, some more information regarding them or a link to background information would be nice. I think recommendation four should include documentation.
