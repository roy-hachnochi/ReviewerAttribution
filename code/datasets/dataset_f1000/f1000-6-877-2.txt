The authors presented detailed data across groups of smokers with and without COPD and healthy non-smokers. Data are well presented and methodology is detailed. I have 3 comments/suggestions. The title is very long and need to be more concise. Suggestions: "Physiological and biological characterization of smokers with and without COPD" . The authors used FEV1/FVC fixed ratio of 0.7 to diagnose COPD among their smokers. Would the data be different if they used both criteria of having FEV1/FVC less than 0.7 and less than the lower limit of normal to diagnose COPD? Data presented for CPET are the peak values. Data at standardized work rate or ventilation can give better characterization of in-between groups differences.
