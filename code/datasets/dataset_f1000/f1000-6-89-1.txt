The coupling of amide hydrogen/deuterium exchange (HDX) with mass spectrometry has been successfully used for the determination of protein dynamics. Recent studies 1 - 2 have shown that this method can reach high protein sequence coverage (80%) in the study of GPCRs. However, frustrations exist, such as the confusion of the HPLC method and the inconsistency of the use of detergents. In the opinion article, Zhang discussed three critical technical aspects that should be carefully examined including 1) bottom-up MS analysis, 2) the use of detergents, and 3) the proteolysis strategy. Particularly, the author expanded the discussion on the problematic use of CHAPSO/DMPC for the membrane protein solution. The author claimed that this solution could form positively charged ions and interfere with MS analysis. In addition, the author raised their concerns of the presence of Na + and K + in the buffer, which could encourage the production of ion-added peptides and hinder MS data interpretation. It is an undeniable fact that the DIA MS/MS strategy has been highly successful in bottom-up proteomics analysis. However, the application of this method could be very challenging due to the limitation of the development of bioinformatics tools. Therefore, the authorâ€™s statement that DIA could improve MS/MS analysis independently is open to argument. Nevertheless, the combination of DDA and DIA is preferable, which would further improve sequence coverage in bottom-up proteomics analysis. Recently, there have been advancements in top-down proteomics analysis. GPCRs are low-mass proteins (~40 kDa) and it is feasible to obtain high resolution of MS/MS data when using the ETD fragmentation method. When coupled with bioinformatics tools, top-down proteomics analysis can be used to determine protein topology 3 . The author may consider the potential use of top-down proteomics analysis on GPCRs.
