The manuscript entitled ‘CASAS: Cancer Survival Analysis Suite, a web based application’ by Rupji et al describes a web server, a shiny R based tool for interactive survival analysis and visualization. They provide several kinds of survival analysis with detailed explanations and example data sets. The web application is easy to use and is likely to be useful for many researchers. I tested each of the examples and found that they work as described in the manuscript. If I add one comment, I found that the CASAS doesn’t support analysis of multiple genes at once, which is necessary when one wants to identify prognostic gene(s) from omics data. The authors may discuss this point and refer to an example of web servers that support the analysis of multiple genes (i.e http://appex.kr ).
