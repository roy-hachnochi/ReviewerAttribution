Authors of this article attempted to facilitate the routine survival analysis for clinicians and general health science professionals by building a web based survival analysis software with underlying R programming. Because survival data has increased usage in clinical research, this work is useful to fill out the gap of survival analysis for researchers without training in statistics and programming. But given a number of limitations, its practical value is questionable. Due to the following multiple missing components, this article does not look complete. This reviewer suggests major revision to improve its usability: The first missing component is the test of model assumptions. The validity of the proportional hazard assumption was not described. The second missing piece is the detailed description of required data format. For example, some practitioners may label event/censor as “1/0”, while others will write “not censored/censored.” What is the requirement for the data file header? For missing values, some may leave it blank, others may write “missing” or “unknown.” These things are all trivial for statisticians but useful for clinical users to know and bear in mind. The authors may add a separate section to emphasize the correct format. The third missing piece is a comprehensive example. Although some figures were shown, potential users may look for a detailed example to follow. The authors had made the point that this software can perform certain survival analyses, but they failed to explain/illustrate how to perform these analyses. A major revision is necessary to answer the question of “how” in an example that looks similar to majority of the users’ data and analytical needs.
