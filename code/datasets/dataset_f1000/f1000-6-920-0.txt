Stimulation of the auricular branch of the vagal nerve for the treatment of chronic pain has been reported in the literature. Percutaneous electrical neural field stimulation has been approved by the FDA and is classified as a minimal-risk device for the treatment of chronic pain. The exact mechanism is unknown, yet it is believed that the external ear contains branches of cranial nerves that project to brainstem nuclei involved in pain processing. Dr. Fraser and Woodbury provide an interesting description on the use of PEFNS for two cases of sympathetically-mediated pain. Editorial Comments Introduction: The authors gave a detailed description on the pathophysiology of fibromyalgia and CRPS. The authors should consider providing a brief description on the mechanism of action of auricular stimulation. Case 1: The authors should consider stating that PENFS did not provide relief for pain from sacroiliitis and no need to further discuss other management (RFA). Does the author have any data on objective improvement in pain after PENFS therapy for case 1 (fibromyalgia patient). Case 2: The authors should consider providing information regarding sympathetic-mediated symptoms and signs of CRPS for case 2 and if PENFS treatment reduced any of the sympathetic-mediated symptoms and signs. The authors should consider providing a table for treatment modalities performed for case 2 and outcomes (as done for Case 1). Discussion: The authors should consider discussing any potential side-effects from PENFS (exp. vaso-vagal response). The authors should consider providing a more detailed explanation of the mechanism of action. This is a fairly new device. There is evidence that it works on the NTS, RVM, hypothalamus, amygdale and spinal cord.
