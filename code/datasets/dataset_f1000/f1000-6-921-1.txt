This manuscript describes the use of the tammar wallaby as a model for use in spinal cord injury research. The uniqueness of this animal is the fact that it is a bipedal mammal similar to humans when assessing gait either through walking (hopping) or swimming. Additionally, the tammar wallaby has similar properties in regeneration as the authors’ have previously shown in Monodelphis domestica . Several outcomes measures are used including behavioral assessment as well as fluorescent tracing to demonstrate regeneration. These outcomes clearly show that positive results are only seen when the SCI is done early on in life during a “permissive stage” of regrowth and not during the “non-permissive” stage of the animal. Specific Comments: This is a well-written manuscript and provides compelling evidence for the use of the tammar wallaby as a model for SCI in a bipedal animal. Although limitations are discussed including this one, the survivability of animals in this model for assessment is a big issue for the use of the tammar wallaby. This will have to be addressed and improved in order for the use of this animal as a valid model for SCI regeneration. However, the use of the tammar wallaby in future studies is well-supported based on the data and conclusions in the paper.
