This paper report is very interesting as it discusses on the antimicrobial activity of the plants from a specific area in Perak, Malaysia. Although the authors tried a simple experiment as the first study to these plants extracts, further investigations need to be done to evaluate this. The extraction method used is appropriate but the authors should explain why choosing only the methanol solvent. Other researchers have different solvents to extract these familiesâ€™ plants such as ethanol[ref1] - 2 . Different solvents should have different level of metabolite compounds. In addition, the discussion in the paper is too short to explain the results. The authors should explain Figure 3 with the notation of B and N(-) in those dishes. What are these? If B and N(-) as the controls, these should be mentioned in the experiment part and explained in discussion. These can be used to compare the inhibition zone between the methanol extracts and why they perform similar result.
