By stating that their model is an endothelial barrier in vitro model rather than a blood-brain barrier model, the authors have addressed my main concern. Considering that they submitted this work as a 'Note', defined as a small, often preliminary study, I believe it is suitable for indexing at F1000. I, nevertheless, encourage them to consider my previous minor comments on their follow up studies.
