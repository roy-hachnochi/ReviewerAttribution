Although the article is interesting and the data clear, I believe the authors are overstating the findings. First, HUVECs are not considered a good model for blood-brain barrier anymore. They used to be a favorite one because they are a human cell line, however, they are not of cerebral origin, and deviate considerably from the behavior of cerebral endothelial cells. They could fix this by calling their model an "endothelial" monolayer instead, or repeat the experiment using "real" BBB cell lines (i.e. hCMEC/D3, which is commercially available). Also, they report the TEER values (which by the way the correct units should be resistance (ohms) times area (cm 2 ) rather than dividing by it) before the start of the experiment, but they should also measure the integrity of the monolayer at the end of the experiment, to rule out that the amount of S. cerevisiae crossing is due to rupture of the monolayer. This assay is also hard to interpret in the absence of a negative control - in fact, S. cerevisiae has been traditionally used as a negative control on this type of assays! Would inert beads also cross? Would any other organisms cross at the same rate? Maybe they can check this by using fluorescent beads and measuring fluorescence on the bottom. Or if easier to do by CFUs, they could add another organism known to not been able to cross and count CFUs. Overall, it is a nice preliminary report, one worth the time pursuing. Considering this was submitted as a Research Note, I believe is appropriate for indexing once they address my comments above.
