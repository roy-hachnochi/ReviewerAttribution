The paper titled “Case Report: Lupoid cutaneous leishmaniasis mimicking verruca plana” makes a significant contribution to the field because of its rarity. The topic is important. According to my opinion the background of the case’s history and progression described in sufficient detail and details provided of any physical examination and diagnostic tests, treatment given and outcomes are enough. In addition the case is presented with sufficient detail to be useful for other practitioners. Figures are useful. In conclusion, the paper is novel and the work delivers what it promises. My overall evaluation of the paper is positive.
