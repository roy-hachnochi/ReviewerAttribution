This paper describes an R-package, haploR , which queries bionformatics databases. The benefit of the package is an ability to incorporate these queries into workflows in R, rather than using a web interface. The haploR package seems useful, but the paper is lacking sufficient detail in several areas. The Bioconductor project (bioconductor.org) contains a wealth of resources for querying various sources of annotation from R. The paper should discuss how the haploR package provides features that are not available in existing resources. The types of information available in HaploReg and RegulomeDB are not well described. Why were these particular resources selected for this package and how do they differ from each other? The "future work" section mentions adding other web tools to the package in the future. What additional information will be provided by those tools and how were they selected for inclusion in the package? I was able to install the R-package and follow the examples given in the vignette. However, these examples would benefit from more explanation. In the HaploReg example, querying the database with two rs IDs returns results for many additional rs IDs. Why is this? Why is the first element returned by getStudyList() blank? In summary, the authors have provided a potentially useful R-package, but they need to include more explanation of how this package will benefit the bioinformatics community.
