In my view as a referee, this is a good article and suitable for publication. I would give some recommendations as follow: Please review much more on migrants policy and the state direction to arrange this problem. Please fill in the gap between the state policy and the situation of this problem. With regards to research findings please state and recommend to policy suggestions. Due to the results of his/her finding indicated that two factors were associated with access to health service among the cases, the first that they experienced illness during the past year and the second was marital status which related the previous research and evidenced. So I would suggest to author to contribute his/her own idea to respond or support the two findings as causes of problems in this article. I do agree in this article and feel acceptable after correcting as I have recommended.
