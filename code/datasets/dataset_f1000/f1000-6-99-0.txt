If this article is just a speculative one, it doesn't matter. But, if it is a scientific article, I think the paper needs modifications, in light of the suggested items below: What is the importance of this paper? Aim is clear, but any scientific work must add to science; to develop science. So that, I suggest if the researchers specify well the role of first and third person in perception's fields, topics. Give examples in specific research fields, and the effect of their perception types in developing science, and then relate this with previous studies and theories, in the light of definite methodology. In the advancement of science, all roles are important; the demand is to specify each one role, (1 st third person perceptions), in the light of related scientific works. Finally, scientific article depends on: Introduction, methodology, results, and conclusion after analysis. - We suggest, reviewing this site: humancond.org/_media/papers/johannson05_third_person_effect.pdf , it's a pdf file about Neuwirth and Fredrick work in. (2002) who found both first- and third-person effects when studying the perceived influence of news (example field here is in Political Science). - Another one: in Wikipedia, discussing the scientific topic and its history, with many references. - Finally, another example in the media field, at: http://www.rcommunicationr.org/index.php/vol-5-2017/155-mcleod-et-al-2017-thinking-about-the-media , discussing: Third-person Perceptions when individuals see others as being more affected by harmful media content than they are themselves, in the light of psychology, sociology and political science. I hope you find these helpful, with all my appreciation.
