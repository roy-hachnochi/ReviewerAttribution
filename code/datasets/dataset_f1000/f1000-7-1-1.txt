In this article, the authors suggest that flu vaccine could elicit antibodies against BKB2R. This, in turn, would lead to BKB2R activation and, therefore, activate/reinforce pro-tumoral pathways. The suggestion for the possible generation of anti-BKB2R antibodies comes from an in silico work of the authors and is supported by the observation that BKB2R monoclonal antibodies inhibit influenza virus replication in cell lines (data from a patent). These considerations are not solid enough to advise against the flu vaccination of cancer patients. Moreover, the authors should clearly state in the text that there are no experimental data yet supporting their suggestion for anti-BKB2R antibodies production upon flu vaccination. The authors suggest that BKB2R antibodies would activate the receptor. However, reasoning in the same way, these antibodies should also inhibit BKB2R, or mediate immune response toward cells expressing this receptor, thus showing anti-cancer properties. This latter is another point of view that should be considered in the discussion. Taking together, these considerations suggest that advise against the flu vaccination is premature, while further studies that aim to clarify if the vaccine against influenza A viruses could elicit agonistic antibodies for BKB2R are needed and could have an impact on flu vaccination choice as well as on cancer treatments.
