The manuscript presented by Chang and Lai describes a collection of CHH neuropeptide genes in over 100 crustacean species. I read with interest this short report and could appreciate that a majority of neuropeptide studies have been limited to decapod crustacean species previously. In addition the presence of neuropeptide transcripts in other divergent crustaceans including those from basal lineages (copepods and branchiopods) are presented. Like in their previous work (Chang and Lai, 2018, BMC Genomics 1 ), a broad sampling strategy was followed. Here the approach was across multiple crustacean lineages, which allows for drawing conclusions on the evolutionary trajectory of CHH genes and their potential functional role during life histories. Although the paper describes a single finding, it is a valuable asset, as it provides an inventory of a high-quality list of carefully curated CHH neuropeptide transcripts for future functional studies. The paper is well-written and concise, and definitely fits with the scope and eligibility of the F1000Research guidelines. As a minor comment: it would be good to describe how the tree in Figure 1 was made in the legend.
