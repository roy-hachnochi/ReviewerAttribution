It is clear from the response of the authors that they disagree that my criticism is relevant. And therefore they have chosen not to change their paper to accommodate these. In fairness this would have required a substantial rewrite. I believe my comments remain appropriate. However, I have also taken into account the more positive responses from the other reviewers. I have hence decided to agree that the paper can be indexed - even though it makes less of a contribution than what I would have liked.
