The paper ultimately promises more than what it delivers. It presents the results of an analysis which has resulted in a set of characteristics of predatory journals derived from a scoping review of recent studies. However, the final discussion section is extremely disappointing. There is no attempt by the authors to add much value to the rather fragmented results found through the review. Part of the problem is that the characteristics listed are treated as equally weighted. Most of the authors who have written on the phenomenon of predatory journals in recent years have attempted to end up with a set of fairly authoritative and even 'objective' criteria that would by themselves be sufficient to classify a journal as predatory. Some of these characteristics would include referencing fake indexing, fake impact metrics, not being indexed in the DOAJ's and a few more. In order to get to a 'consensus' view of what are the key characteristics of a predatory journal, a simple listing of all possible characteristics will not take us much further. It is perhaps then not surprising that their recommendation is for a consensus type meeting where experts could work towards a consensus definition. More to the point: in my view to get to the kind of end goal of a consensus or more widely acceptable definition, would require a more theoretical or at least conceptual framework that is embedded in some of the work on scientific communication and publishing which stipulates what good practices in (journal) publishing are. Unfortunately this paper does not help us much on the way to this goal.
