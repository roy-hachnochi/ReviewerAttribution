 To authors This work reports the description of a giant virus with cross-reactivity and genes in common with retroviruses. The authors propose to describe the first giant retrovirus obtained from human cells. This work is very preliminary, and it is unfortunate not to have the complete genome of this virus. The reviewer is very supportive of this preliminary work. However, he thinks that, at least, the RNA polymerase sequence of the giant viruses, for which there are primers that have been described for mimiviridae, would be added, which would give a much higher value to this paper. All in all, this is a work that can attract the attention of the scientific community to an interesting emerging hypothesis.
