First of all it is interesting that the authors use the newly started SPOR registry. 1. The paper needs language improval. I have at least 50 changes in abstract, introduction methods and results sections. Write in past sense etc Use neutral Words when describing results 2. Patients less than 65 years are normally not included in studies on hip fracture as they are normally a different entity. Trauma and pathological fractures!!! Are they included? More statistics; GA group is; 2190; C is 202 and; NA is 11247. Can they really get results when comparing the Groups ? 3. Have they excluded pathological fracture? Reoperations? 4.In results and figures p values are not clear!!! Does pertrochanteric fractures have higher motrality rate? 5 Do they have any results on cemented prothesis in cervical fractures? Mortality rate. 6 Time to surgery; Cut off at 24 h. What do they know about delay 24-36h which is considered ok in f.ex. UK? 7 ASA is a crude preoperastive scale, not capturing low hemoglobin, dementia, malignancy and living conditions. Nottingham hip fracture score captures these please comment 8. Discussion; are there any previous reports from Scandinavia or Sweden addressing the topic? The routine in Sweden seems to be neuraxial anesthesia. This is not the case f.ex. in the USA. Discuss differences?
