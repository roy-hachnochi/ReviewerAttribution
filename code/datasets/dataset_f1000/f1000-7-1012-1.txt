Currently there are no biomarkers for AD used in clinical practice. Current methods for evaluating patients only allow for diagnoses of probable AD while definitive diagnosis can only take place at the time of post-mortem examination. This study aims to identify much needed biomarkers for AD in CSF using mass spectrometry. The authors used tandem mass spectrometry to measure the concentrations of 30 CSF-specific proteins, which they previously identified, in patient specimens. The patient cohort included those with mild cognitive impairment, mild, moderate and severe AD, as determined by the MMSE and CDR ratings. The authors identified one candidate protein, neuronal pentraxin receptor -1 (NPTXR), as promising in its ability to differentiate MCI from moderate and severe AD. Independent assessment of NPTXR concentrations in patient specimens using an ELISA confirmed that concentrations of this protein are lower in CSF from patients with moderate and severe AD compared to control patients. This manuscript is well written and I only have minor comments, which I will outline below. In the results section, the authors state that the reproducibility of the assays for control samples and clinical samples was 20%. It is unclear to me what this refers to and it would be helpful for the authors to clarify, especially since the data are not shown. How was cognitive level assessed for the patient specimens used for the ELISA measurements? It appears that these specimens came from a different institution than those used for the mass spectrometry analysis. If a different assessment scheme was employed for these specimens, this could be confounding. I would suggest that the authors comment on this.
