AD is the most common neurodegenerative diseases. Unfortunately, there no molecular biomarkers for the disease yet. In the present study the authors used a well described cohort of AD patients to identify new protein-based biomarkers in CSF that can determine the progression of AD. The procedure was based on identifying potential protein biomarkers from Human Protein Atlas (30 brain-specific proteins were selected) and design analytical method based on MS for their determination in CSF. After careful examination of clinical specimens, the authors identified a new biomarker that was validated with ELISA, the NPTXR. The authors did not find any correlation of the potential biomarkers tested (including NPTXR) with the status of ApoE polymorphism. Finally, the limitations of their study are well-described. A major limitation as noted is the absence of normal samples for the analysis of the potential biomarkers. Although not entirely required for this study, analysis of normal CSF samples will help to identify biomarkers for AD diagnosis. However, the authors validated NPTXR in control samples with ELISA assay and found not statistically different levels between controls and patients with mild cognitive impairment. In conclusion, the present study is well-designed and adds new information on the development of new AD biomarker. It will worth in future studies to examine the levels of NPTXR in other neurodegerative diseases such as Parksinson to determine the specificity.
