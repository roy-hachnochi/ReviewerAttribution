 Poor introduction – introduction is one of the important thing in the manuscript. In the introduction part, the authors should discuss the ‘fibers’/ cellulose/hemicellulose or pigment component inside the leaf. The major constituent inside the leaf. Besides that, the authors should discuss about the treatment of NaOH and previous work regarding various type of treatment. Insufficient data on the characterization part – the author should carried out more characterization for supportive data for morphological characterization. i.e atomic force microscopy (AFM) analysis. How did you determine/indicate the decolourisation occur? Please include the image that show colour changes for both species before and after treatment with NaOH. Page 1 – Abstract – Methods – Please include the SEM analysis of leaves to observe morphology after and before treatment of NaOH. Page 4 – The authors mention that “the solutes were dried thoroughly before being ground into a powder to be analysed using SEM”. Unfortunately, there is no condition or sample preparation included in the manuscript. Page 4 – FTIR analysis – Please change “….treated (NaOH) bamboo…” to “ ….treated (1.0 M NaOH) bamboo…”. Page 4 – FTIR analysis – What does it meant by “Different results are achieved…..the peaks have almost disappeared .” The peak is still presented after treated with NaOH but the peak intensity is decreased?. Besides that, the authors did not explain clearly regarding each peak is referred to which part structure of constituent. i.e. CH 2 and alkenes (C double bond). Based on the Fig. 3 and Fig. 4, I could not find any differences of spectrum in the range of 4000 – 2000 cm -1 . There no conclusion provided in the manuscript.
