Ref: Chemical characterization of bamboo leaves (Gigantochloa albociliata and Dracaena surculosa) by sodium hydroxide treatment This article describes a chemical characterization of bamboo leaves ( Gigantochloa albociliata and Dracaena surculosa ) through sodium hydroxide treatment. The topic is interesting, but it requires a revision according to the following comments: Introduction: The authors should state the novelty and significant of the study in their manuscript. Methods: ‘All other chemicals and reagents used were of the highest commercially available purity’. Instead, authors should state purity of each chemical and reagent used in the study. Methods: FTIR should be in separate section from solvent extraction method. Details description of FTIR and SEM instruments should be included in text. Results: FTIR spectrum should be improved. Only important peaks should be labelled in the spectrum. The spectrum should be improved in terms of resolution. Results: SEM images should be combined together, so a clear comparison could be made. Discussion: More discussion and explanation should be added in text to increase scientific values of the article. CONCLUSIONS should be included in the text.
