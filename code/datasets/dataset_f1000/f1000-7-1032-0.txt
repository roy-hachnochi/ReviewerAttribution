Rivera-Herrera et al. reported the analysis of CHEK2 c.1100delC in a population selected following the NCCN criteria, very well detailed in table 1. The MS is clearly written and thus, easy to follow. Specific comments: The actual nomenclature for this variant is of CHEK2 c.1100del. It might be important to have the information of the ethnic origin of the probands analyzed since this pathogenic variant in common in Northern-European countries and to make a population conclusion it is critical. The number of patients analyzed it is low based on the expected frequency in the northern countries that may have the highest, 0.5-1,16%, while it is expected based on the databases 100 times lower in Latin populations 1 . Although in Brazil it is reported 1.76%, based in 1 out 59 probands analyzed, a number still low to analyze a cohort of 131 patients and extrapolate to a population frequency. The above comment does not deny the importance of the testing since the family diagnosis it is always very valuable for the counselling the relatives. In methods it is very necessary to show the capacity to detect a positive mutation for CHEK2 c.1100del since a few reasons could account for a false negative result. The authors should include the DNA sequence profile for this positive control, in the case it was done. A brief explanation of the method used for BRCA1/2 , as the patients were selected for not being a carrier of a mutation in those genes.
