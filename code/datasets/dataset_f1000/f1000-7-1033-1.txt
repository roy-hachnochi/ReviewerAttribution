Authors report an aCGH based comparative genomic hybridization approach/case report to detect copy number variations CNVs) between genes/genomic locus of Plasmodium falciparum field isolates (Pf-isolate-1 and Pf-isolate-2) from the Indian Sub-continent. This is an experimental case study reporting major amplifications and deletions in Pf-isolate-2 in comparison with Pf-isolate-1 using a tiling array-based comparative genomic hybridization approach. Authors have used this approach to get a real picture of the genomic variations between the two isolates related to the disease severity. Authors have identified CNVs in all the chromosomes in Pf-isolate-2 with most of the deletions have been seen in sub-telomeric and telomeric regions of the chromosomes that comprise off variant surface antigen family genes. Apart from the subtelomeric regions, other parts of P. falciparum chromosomes have also shown CNVs. Authors have identified some novel variations, like an amplification of 28kb region (249817-278491) of chromosome-8, which covers for three genes two of which codes for conserved Plasmodium proteins with unknown function (MAL8P1.139, PF08_0122) and tRNA pseudouridine synthase, putative (PF08_0123). Also, amplifications in regions harboring genes like GTP cyclohydrolase I (GCH-1, PFL1155W) and ribosomal protein, L24, putative (PFL1150C) of chromosome 12 were seen. While authors have successfully used their approach to demonstrate the CNVs between the Pf-isolate-2 (an isolates from severe malaria case) and the Pf-isolate-1 (an isolate without severe malaria complication) very little efforts were made to understand this difference in terms of how these CNVs actually explain the disease severity case. This make the manuscript observational/case study type in nature. Nevertheless, this manuscript has provided a glimpse of P. falciparum chromosomal changes that may be associated or responsible for disease severity associated with P. falciparum infection in the field. It has potential to stimulate focused investigations to understand the role of specific amplifications and deletions in severity P. falciparum infection cases.
