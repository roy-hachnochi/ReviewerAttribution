Should real-world data be more freely available? Of course it should, it is impossible to disagree. But, "I think you'll find it's a bit more complicated than that". Use of observational data for drug safety (among other things) is crucially important. However, many things are critical to make this happen. High quality research training with access to excellent statisticians. A research system that doesn't depend on impact factor and no benefit for getting an 'interesting' result. Quality peer-review. Lots of funding to do important work of this kind. An educated audience capable of critical analysis of complex study designs. Brexit not gutting the MHRA. Close links with the EMA. Affordable access for academics to access the data. And yes open data would help but who has the time to rerun the analyses of other groups who have proven themselves trustworthy when there are probably more important things to do? There are also risks. Anti-vaxxers on a mission to identify spurious drug-effects. And vitally loss of public trust. Yes there are surveys showing public support for access to their data but we have already made a mess of this with care.data and can we risk that again? Especially when pharma or profit-driven companies are promoting it? In a world ever more driven by conspiracy theories and paranoia this seems a big step at the moment. Yes real-world data should be more open. But at the moment it is only one of many important battles to fight.
