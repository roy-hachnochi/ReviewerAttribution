In the study titled “Analysis of pluripotency marker expression in human glioblastoma multiforme cells treated with conditioned medium of umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells”, the authors investigated the effects of UCSC on the expression of pluripotency factors in GBM cells. The authors showed an increased expression of SOX4 and OCT4 in GBM cells treated with CM when compared to untreated cells. The work presents numerous limitations, and does not have scientific relevance that justify its indexing. For example: The authors evaluated the gene expression only at the RNA level, however, the ideal would be to evaluate also at the protein level in order to obtain more conclusive results. In addition, the authors evaluated a limited number of genes related to CSCs. I suggest evaluating a greater number of genes to confirm the results presented here. The authors also should access other parameters in the cells besides gene expression, such as resistance to therapy, proliferation and viability. It is also very important analyze which factors in the CM could be responsible for the effect presented in this work. I strongly suggest that the authors use a positive control for qPCR reactions, such as GBM cells treated with CSC inducers. In the discussion the authors say that “the up-regulation of this set of genes is associated with poor outcome in terms of tumor malignancy”, so in my opinion it would be interesting to perform an in vivo model to testing the effects of these treated cells in terms of tumor formation and malignancy. In view of these considerations, I do not consider the work apt to be published in F1000 Research.
