The present study mainly showed the effects of MSC conditioned medium in glioblastoma multiforme cells. Authors found that MSC-CM promote the expression of pluripotency markers in T98G cells, like SOX4 and OCT4, but not NANOG. The research has limited novelty and integrity. Main concerns are listed below: Serum free medium were used to acquire the MSC-CM for 24 hours in this study, authors should test the cell viability of MSC in this state for a better assess the quality of CM. All the gene markers were tested in mRNA level in the manuscript, protein levels should be added. Only a small number of cells were regarded as cancer stem cells, especially in commercial cell lines. MSC-CM increases the original stem cells to express pluripotency markers or it could induce non-stem cells to express these markers still unclear. What is more, whether CM would affects cell functions after the increase of these markers still unclear. All these date are needed to be completed or discussed in the manuscript. As authors mentioned in the discussion, various researches has been tested to clarify the interactions between MSC and cancer cells. Based on the existed results in this paper, limited novelty also decrease the quality of the manuscript. The background of the pictures in Figure 1 should be changed and the scale bar should be added. The statistical analysis should not be used on its own, as the study is not good and qualified enough/
