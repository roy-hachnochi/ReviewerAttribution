Associative memory cell is a new term to describe the special groups of brain neurons that play the critical role in information/signal acquisition, integration and storage of exogenous associated signals. In this review Dr. Wang has provided a comprehensive picture of these cells, their working principle and modulation. I think this article provides new insights into improved understanding of molecular/cellular mechanisms of cognition, emotion and behaviors. The manuscript is well written and the figures are nicely presented and make sense. I recommend publishing this paper in this journal. Following are some my questions and hopefully authors can appropriately address them in this article. What are the basic phenotypes of the “associative memory cells”, are they glutamatergic, GABAergic cholinergic, or others? Do these “associative memory cells” play the unit function such as acquisition, integration and storage of exogenous associated signals? Have these “associative memory cells” a special distribution in the brain? Do these “associative memory cells” form the specific circuits that are closely associated to the cognition and emotion? What changes of these “associative memory cells” in the diseases that exhibit cognitive deficits including Alzheimer’s disease, drug addiction, schizophrenia.
