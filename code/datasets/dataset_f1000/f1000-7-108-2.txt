This is a timely review on an important topic, associative memory. The first author is a leader in this area. All the figures are well presented. Figure 1 is very informative. I only have a few minor concerns. It will help if the authors can include a table to summarize key literature related to this topic. Are there any differences in cellular signaling mechanisms between primary and associated memory? If so, a table to summarize similarities and differences will be very useful. Do glial cells play a role in associative memory? No pain, no gain? Is pain also associated with this type of memory?
