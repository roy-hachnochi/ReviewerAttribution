This is a case report on Cutaneous granular cell tumors. They should remove that they occur on the extremities as their case is actually on the truncal region. Why did they include how the slides were processed? This is useless information. The only novel part of this is the dermatofibroma-like morphology but overall I do not feel this case report adds much to the literature. What margins did they take on the excision? How long was the followup on the patient?
