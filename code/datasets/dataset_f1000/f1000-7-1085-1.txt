A case of granular cell tumor, with usual and typical presentation has been described. The manuscript needs English editing. Introduction : The importance or novelty of this case has not been clarified. Case report : Why was patient referred to pathology department? Explaining method of IHC, is unnecessary. Figure 4a and figure 4b are identical, but authors have mentioned that these are 2 different slides stained with 2 markers. The quality of photos are not acceptable, photos with higher resolution are required. Discussion : More explanation about “granular cell dermatofibroma” and methods of its differentiation from “granular cell tumor” seems necessary. A lot of IHC markers (such as CD68, CD57, and NSE) have been used but no data on their utilities have been given. How can these markers be helpful in differentiating “ granular cell tumor” from other entities? This term seems to be wrong: “granular cell tumor with dermatofibroma”
