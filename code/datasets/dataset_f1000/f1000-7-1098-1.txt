The data used in this study is available by not from the source noted in the paper. The data is available from the Cancer Imaging Archive (https://wiki.cancerimagingarchive.net/display/Public/TCGA-STAD) not from the GDC portal as described. The results section states that DICE coefficients are used for comparison of the machine segmented lesions and human segmented lesions which serve as a model of truth. However the results are reported as: "The error obtained (mean +/- standard deviation) for the eight datasets of the 3-D images is 91.54% +/- 5.26%, with a maximum value of 97.31% and a minimum value of 83.47%. I believe these may be the calculated DICE coefficients and not "error" estimates. Errors between the two segmented lesions this large would indicate complete failure of the technique. In general the techniques proposed are not novel but rather application of well known and proven techniques to a small data set.
