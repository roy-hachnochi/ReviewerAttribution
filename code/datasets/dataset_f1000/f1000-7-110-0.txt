The authors had a good idea and implemented accordingly. Despite of that, scientific information is weak and reproducibility in not ensured with the information provided 1. The goal of the study is not enough clear: Two phrases are used to describe the purpose: a. “This study describes the process of creating and describing a dataset that contains information on the food preferences and purchases of a group of people living in Colombia. An important aspect of the dataset is describing the sodium and sugar content of each food product and featuring and sorting out the nutritional information available in the Colombian market. b. The purpose of the study is based on capturing the preferences of users in self-service stores. Which is the exact main goal? Describing the process of the data set or communicating the results obtained? 2. Methods a. This publication should be improved by giving much more detail about sample. Sample calculation and or sample size adequate to conclusions is missing. Purchasing habits is directly related to socioeconomic status, culture and habits. It is not possible to know the population represented in this sample. (characteristics of the population are not detailed) b. The authors say “All food items were classified based on their sodium and sugar content (based on WHO and FDA recommendations)”. Food groups and food classification should be described in detail to better understand Figure 3 3. Conclusions I suggest to first clarify the aim of the study to obtain the main conclusions. It would be expected to summarize the main outcomes in this section I recommend the authors to write two scientific communications. One considering the process only and another one focusing on results
