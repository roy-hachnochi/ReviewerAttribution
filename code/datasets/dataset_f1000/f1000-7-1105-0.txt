The author describes the creation of a Bioconductor/R package for generic visualization of 2D protein diagrams. The tool does not address 3D visualizations or visualization of protein sequences or alignments. Rather it allows the user to view the position of protein annotations within an arbitrary number of proteins. By default, UniProt sequence identifiers and associated annotations are supported. The demonstrated examples depict protein domains/motifs and phosphorylation sites. Identifying a set of proteins to view from the Gene Ontology via bioMart is also demonstrated. There are likely to be many additional useful queries that could be achieved by similar bioMart queries. The package leans on ggplot2 functionality for the actual drawing of each protein schematic. The drawings consist of simple elements: colored rectangles and circles that can be nested, overlaid, and labeled. A few simple use cases are illustrated. The writing is brief and straightforward. The code is available under an open access document. I was able to install the package and run through the examples in the paper in a few minutes with only minor difficulties. In particular, I had trouble getting this line to work in the example: ``` output - getBM(attributes = c('uniprotswissprot', 'hgnc_symbol'), filters = 'go', values = 'GO:0004707', mart = ensembl) ``` Perhaps some problem with the way the single quotes are being encoded in that section? Overall the tool is quite basic but also appears to be customizable. I anticipate it could be useful to many who wish to automate visualization of protein drawings and integrate these with visualization of various types omics data.
