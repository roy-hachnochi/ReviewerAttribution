The article provides a good overview of the topic. I would suggest the following adjustments / comments: Following this statement “Owing to the mechanism of data collection and experimental design, RWE studies generally cannot yield definitive causal inference because of the many confounders of variability.” I think it would be good to reference Eichler et al., “Bridging the Efficacy–Effectiveness Gap.” 1 . About the implications of moving from traditional RCT to RWE and the implications that comes with this. i.e one should actively consider the confounders, not only identify that is a potential problem. Table 1: Being the co-author of the article : “Deriving more value from RWE to ensure timely access of medicines by patients” 2 . I think this would be an appropriate reference. I would suggest that this would add the following perspective: The structured search to identify the relevant real world data sources as an essential step for successful RWE execution. Table 4: In the planning phase it is essential to understand the confounding factors that may impact the outcome question of interest in order to take this in to account in the study design / evaluation of the RWE study.
