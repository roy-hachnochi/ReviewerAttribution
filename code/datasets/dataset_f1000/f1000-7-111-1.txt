Some minor changes and additions would be worthwhile: Page 3: 2nd paragraph, last sentence: Owing to the mechanism of data collection and experimental design, RWE studies generally cannot yield definitive causal inference...." The word cannot should be changed to may not. It is a matter of discussion whether one can impute causality vs causation from observational studies (see Berger et al. 1 ) Page 5: Discussion of Phase 1-3 Clinical Study Design and Table 2: RWE can inform clinical study design in other ways including assessing size of recruitment pool of patients with different sets of inclusion or exclusion criteria; estimating treatment effect size for sample size estimation; simulating trials in advance; and recruitment of sites. Page 7: Table 3: Next to Electronic health/medical records, Flatiron Health should be added to the list data owner/curators. They are currently working with the FDA on data quality issues. Page 8, Table 4: Next to communication, the authors should cite the various ISPOR publications on the subject Including: - Caro et al. 2 ; - Recommendations from the joint ISPOR‐ISPE Special Task Force on real‐world evidence in health care decision making, co-published in 2 papers in ViH 3 and PEpi and Drug Safety 4 ; - Wang et al. 5 , 6 .
