This article addressed to the effect of L-tryptophan and root exudates as inducer for the production of auxin, phytohormone by inoculated bacteria. Many works have been completed with PGP rhizospheric bacteria but naturally occurring indigenous bacteria can provide a better results in comparison to rhizospheric bacteria. In present article: Introduction This section of article is written in constructive manner to fulfil and provide the basic idea behind the use of bacteria for plant growth and phytohormone. It also summarize the role of endophytic bacteria for betterment of plants through various mechanism those are helpful for agriculture. Methods Authorâ€™s used basic (biochemical analysis) as well as molecular methods for the characterization of isolates that confirm the authenticity of identification of bacterial spp. Author mentioned the proper site of isolation with given altitudes so in future said work can be replicated with samples. All methods are explained properly with size of samples and other chemicals that satisfy the requirements if any one likes to duplicate the work in future. Result Characterization and phytohormone production results displayed by author are acceptable. Authors tried to evaluate the effect of endogenous bacteria, isolated from rice, on maize as well as effect of maize root exudates on bacteria and its colonization. Present article is a preliminary stage for the future prospects of isolated bacterial isolates as biofertilizer. Authors have to go further to test both isolates in field condition to use these endogenous isolates as biofertilizer. Suggestion: Author may add statistical analysis in Figure 2, 3 and 4 so results will show the significance of analysis.
