I thoroughly enjoyed this manuscript, except for two paragraphs. First, on Page 2, right column, the following sentence should be incorporated into another paragraph or eliminated as it is awkward standing alone. "Martino et al. (2017c) review screening instruments and rating scales for TDs; see also (Augustine et al.2017; Martino Pringsheim, 2017)." Second, on Page 5, the paragraph that starts, "A small (N=34) RCT of guanfacine showed no meaningful difference in effects on tic ratings or clinical impressions of improvement between the drug and placebo groups (Murphy et al., 2017)" is incorrect. The study that Murphy and colleagues did was using EXTENDED RELEASE guanfacine, which has significantly less bioavailability than immediate release quanfacine. The point of their study was that the extended release preparation was ineffective, not that guanfacine was ineffective.
