The authors have addressed my concerns. I appreciated the additional references and explanations to some of the points previously raised, including better contextualizing of this work in prior literature, as well as the comparisons between the use and effectiveness of the IDP between postdocs and PhD students. I do think additional studies on this topic will be helpful in order to appropriately train various populations of researchers. The edits to the figures indicated (Figure 2 and Supplementary File 3) are also very helpful to clarify the analyses made in particular for the Likert scale data. I would have been curious to see how race, ethnicity, U.S. citizenship, and other variables in Supplementary File 3 affect the responses to the IDP process, but that may not be possible with this sample size. Overall, I think these edits significantly improved the publication.
