Thank the authors for their revisions, the clarity of the article has increased. We have some additional thoughts regarding our initial review: Our first point was clarified. Thank you. However, the source of the 38.4% is still unclear. The author’s now make clear they are only including the 99 people who completed IDPs. However, 41 people (out of the total 183 people) say that it is useful, which would be 41%. The corrected heading in Supplemental Figure 3 now states the percentage, but does not include the N. We still wonder if the IDP effectiveness is clearly stated/defined. The data (e.g. the numbers) are clearer, however, the definition of effectiveness could be clearer. The questions that respondents are asked are about “helpfulness,” and effectiveness is inferred. We agree with Reviewer 2, in that the authors should provide additional context from the literature regarding this aspect. My recommendation would be to further parse out the two issues: 1) effectiveness alone (e.g. career preparation) and 2) effectiveness and mentor relationships.
