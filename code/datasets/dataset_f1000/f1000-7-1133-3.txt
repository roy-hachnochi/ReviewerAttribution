Molinari and colleagues present a detailed methodology to functionally access cilia structure in KV vessels of zebrafish. I am especially impressed with the details provided, methodology setup and the clarity of the images in this manuscript. Suggestions: It would be beneficial to readers if authors provide an image of the "relief slides/ imaging chamber" used for mounting. What type of microscope was used? Upright or inverted? An image of the actual zebrafish in the imaging chamber/ slides on the mounting stage of the microscope would also provide additional information about the set-up. What type of objective was used? Air or oil objective? Additional information on microscopy could be provided. A more in-depth detail on optical sectioning using structured illumination (I presume using an Zeiss Apotome 2) would be beneficial. Which program was used to calculate cilia length? Fiji or Image J? Please provide some additional details.
