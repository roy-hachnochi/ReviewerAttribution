Molinari et al. presented a detailed description of the method they have developed to assess the function of ciliopathy-related genes using the zebrafish KV as a model system. In particular, they developed this method to image fluorescently labeled KV cilia such that (I assume) the morphology of those cilia can be analyzed. Overall the description is well written but a little more detail is needed to allow the readers to reproduce and use this method in their own studies. My major questions are as follows: The KV cilia are either motile and immotile. I think the method in this manuscript is primarily addressing the morphology of cilia, but the authors did not present any method of analyzing the ciliary morphology after the illustrated imaging process. It would be critical for them to present their quantitative analysis of ciliary morphology based on the fluorescent images, to ensure the completeness of this manuscript. It is not mentioned how many embryos were placed into each glass vial for immunostaining and the volume of staining solution for each sample. This is also pertinent to the quantitative analyses, as I wonder about the typical sample size needed for the quantitative analyses. I think the intro and the discussion needs to be edited by a native English speaker to ensure there is no grammatical error.
