This paper needs major revision. I would make the following comments. Introduction : 1. In final part, you said “Furthermore, a second objective was …”, however I cannot find your first objective. What is the first objective of your study? I think you should change this part to “The objective of this study was to analyze GSPCs cultured in PRF osteogenic differentiation predicted by CBF-α1/Sox9 expression ratio. The hypothesis of the current study is that GSPCs cultured in PRF can increase the CBF-α1/Sox9 expression ratio during osteogenic differentiation.” 2. The reason that why you do this research in necessary in Introduction section. And also please add the that is the problem of current and past research regarding relationship of osteogenic and CBF-α1/Sox9 ratio? Methods: 3. The materials section is too long, you can try to simplify this section. Discussion : 4. The answer of hypothesis of this study should be included in the discussion section. 5. The discussion about the experiment method and selection of material is necessary. There was no discussion why expression differences existed. The authors need to discuss based upon the mechanism otherwise the paper is going to be a laboratory report. 6. Please add the clinical implications of your study and clinical significance of the findings in discussion section. 7. What is the limitation of this study? You should indicate at this section. Figure : 8. Fig. 1 and Fig. 3: Please indicate which pic is A, B, C……. and H, I. 9. Fig. 2 and Fig. 4: Please add the SD (standard deviation) to your bar graph. And if possible also add the results of statistical analysis to your graph.
