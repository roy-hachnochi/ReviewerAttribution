This is an extremely interesting study that proposes a novel quantitative methodology for classifying HIV patients by viral load patterns. The authors propose four computable characteristics of time-varying viral load patterns and a novel classification algorithm. They demonstrate their approach by classifying a group of 1,576 HIV positive patients into five categories based on viral load patterns. This is an extremely well written interesting paper with excellent figures. The proposed methodology has great importance and utility for both research studies and clinical programs. My only very minor comments are: For the descriptions given in Table 2 for mathematical notation. I suggest changing the description of "refers to a single patient" to "refers to a specific patient". Equation 10, please clarify what the denominator means; i.e., how does "positive" differ from "true positive" or "false positive". In the paragraph on page 6, under the heading Analytic terminology, editing is needed on line 8, where it says: clusters. interchangeably.
