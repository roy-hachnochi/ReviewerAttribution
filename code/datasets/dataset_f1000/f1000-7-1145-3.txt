The article describes EpiLog, a software tool to model artificial development of epitelial tissue through cellular automata with hexagonal cells. EpiLog provides a high degree of customization through the graphical user interface. This includes: (a) model definition, such as CA size, logical models and initial states; (b) simulation settings, including updates (synchronous or asynchronous/probabilistic) and (c) perturbations on single cells or regions. The article provides two simple use cases to introduce the user to the software. First, a model of lateral inhibition process is presented in FIg. 1. Second, a developmental model of Drosophila eggshell. Minor revisions: The article would benefit by the following: background section with related work and description of CA/artificial development software tools, with brief description of similarities and differences; a more advanced use case described in details (for the advanced reader).
