The manuscript by Banik et al. describes the isolation and further characterization of protease activity of partially purified protein fraction from the leaves of Moringa oleifera . The manuscript is well-written with detailed description of materials, methods and results. It, indeed, identified the protease activity with sufficient detailing. It has the potential for future investigation of biochemical characterization and functional relevance of this plant derived protease. However, there are a few concerns, as pointed below: In Figure 2, it is apparent that the first lane is not a part of original figure. Adding a separate lane in an otherwise complete picture is not accepted. A repeat experiment with all the lanes is suggested. The referencing requires to be more elaborate. The discussion should describe potential application of the findings, based on literature review. Addressing these issues will strengthen the acceptability of the finding described in this manuscript.
