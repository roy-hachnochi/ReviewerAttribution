The introduction is currently almost entirely factually correct, but could do with editorial review of the English used. This is beyond the responsibilities of this reviewer. Specific remaining comments: Pain assessment: I don’t understand the word ‘nullifying’ in the first bullet Demographic information: without knowing the distribution of SE groups in the catchment area of the hospital, what does this information on income groups add? Assessment of symptoms, 2 nd paragraph: “None of three… except fever and rash” Rephrase this The first two sections of the discussion can be shortened considerably, and perhaps moved to the introduction? Laboratory diagnosis of HFMD: Diagnosis remains necessary to assess quickly whether an outbreak is EV-A71 associated, which would warrant stricter prevention and mitigation measures The paragraphs on treatment and vaccination can be deleted. Not sure why antihistamines would be required. HFMD cases and local weather/climate: this section is too long and speculative.
