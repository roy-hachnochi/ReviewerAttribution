I thank the authors for addressing a number of my comments. I still think the discussion is too long and deals with a large of number of topics that are irrelevant to the data presented, being a clinically diagnosed first-time outbreak of HFMD in Bangladesh in a single hospital. There is already a large body of available literature on HFMD. This manuscript adds the description of an outbreak or upsurge in Bangladesh. That is what needs to be described and interpreted / compared with other outbreaks. There is no need in this publication for the discussion section to provide a general review on HFMD or to provide extensive general recommendations on HFMD diagnosis, treatment and prevention. The fourth paragraph of the discussion is an interpretation for which the authors present no data, this shouldn't be in a scientific publication. Sections on laboratory diagnosis, specific treatment and vaccination are not needed in this report. The list of principal findings should also be limited to findings from THIS study. In the introduction, rephrase the sentence on "pollution free environment". HFMD prevention is through avoiding contact with infected persons and their secretions and excretions through hygiene/hand-washing and distancing (e.g. school closure or sending sick kids home).
