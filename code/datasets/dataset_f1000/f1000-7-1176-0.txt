While I agree with the sentiments of the authors that there can be instances where a conventional sample size calculation may not be appropriate. I do have an issue with the generalisations they are making from a single trial to studies costing $30m. The gold standard for an assessment of efficacy right or wrong is a formal hypothesis test. There is a need to definitively show evidence of clinical effect for most interventions. The example that was quoted in the paper is a cheap intervention. Low cost interventions may be anticipated to observed small effects: so small that the expense of undertaking a clinical trial could be prohibitively expensive. I have recent experience of two trials investigating low cost interventions in the U@UNI trial and the PLEASANT trial. 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 In both these trials the interventions could be shown to be cost effective (or cost saving). It could be contended in both the sample size could have been based on cost effectiveness. In summary, therefore, there is merit in what the authors are suggesting but there needs to be consideration as to when the arguments could be applied.
