I agree with Dr Amin that this a very valuable study, describing 1% of national (USA) mesothelioma cases, that were not part of the SEER database. In the revised version the outcomes of this prognostic factors study have been discussed in detail, while the limitations of the dataset were clearly addressed. The results from previous prognostic factors studies are mostly confirmed. The prognostic data of patients with peritoneal mesothelioma, who received combined modality treatment, are considered especially important and may well assist in drafting guidelines for this selected group of patients.
