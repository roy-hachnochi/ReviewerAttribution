888 cases (out of 1400 cases) enrolled in the NMVB, representing around 1% of all mesothelioma cases (occurring from 1900 till 2107) in the US, are being used for this prognostic factors study. Comparing the distribution of patients in this study with epidemiological studies suggests that over-representation of surgical and peritoneal cases may be present in the series presented. Multivariate analyses in a skewed population may give rise the wrong conclusions, and statistical/epidemiological advice is needed to assure that the conclusions from current analysis are valid.
