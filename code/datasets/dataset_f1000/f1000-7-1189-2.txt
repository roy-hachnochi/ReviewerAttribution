Prostate cancer (PCa) is still a significant health problem in UK and across the world. Though a small minority of patients progress to aggressive forms, the absolute number is quite significant due to the high incidence of PCa among men. Therefore, investigation of molecular mechanisms of PCa progression is very important and will hopefully unravel novel therapeutic targets. Alternative splicing (AS) has been shown to occur in over 94% of genes in humans. It is therefore a crucial level of gene regulation and not surprisingly involved in virtually every physiological and pathological process. AS de-regulation has been implicated in many diseases, including cancer and in particular PCa, and interestingly, many times it has been shown to drive cancer pathology independently of transcription. Since androgens are main players in PCa, the idea of analysing global changes in AS in response to androgens is very welcome to the field. The authors found 10 times more AS isoforms regulated by androgens than previously reported in data from cell culture, most of them occurring through alternative promoter mechanism. They have confirmed and validated part of these changes. They have also analysed the isoforms changes between adenocarcinoma and normal tissues as well as during progression through the Gleason stages of PCa. This is a very well thought and executed study, with may informative results. I have a suggestion for the discussion part: one issue in global analysis of splice isoforms is which ones are causal (ie maintain and aggravate the phenotype) and which ones are just associated with the pathological progression; while a full answer to this would need experimental evidence on each individual splicing event, could the authors discuss 1-2 examples, if possible, where the changes at protein level (either sequence or expression level of a particular isoform) would hypothetically have a causal role
