The article provides an overview on the ELIXIR AAI. It is written on a very high level of abstraction. The described system integrates services deployed in many different countries and organisations on one side with federated users on the other side. The requirements that lead to developing the system are outlined, all the important technical components are described and justified with respect to the requirements. The section about the policies that describes the duties of the involved parties and their legal / organisational interplay amongst each other is very short, and therefore incomplete. In the uptake section the authors prove their success with the number of registered users and the impressive number of available services. The strength of this article is its high level of abstraction. This allows non-technical people to get an overview of the developed method. The downside of this is that many technically hard points that had to be solved were not able to be mentioned. From my perspective a few points deserve additional work: Policies: You are following the AARC policy starter pack. I think the article would benefit, if you even if briefly - mentioned all the relevant policies in the field. Trust: You mention services that accept users authenticated elsewhere in the world. How was it possible to convince these services to trust other identity providers and/or group-managers in foreign countries that a given user is in fact the one he claims to be. Finally, a lessons learned section will help others to reproduce the presented method.
