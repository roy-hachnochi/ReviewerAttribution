I think this paper contributes very much to the discussion what to do about reducing alcohol problems in society among adult people. It shows in the world there is little effort to focus these problems in an integrative way, using evidence based interventions as the ‘three best buys’: reducing advertisement, availability and raising taxes. Authors did their job accurate. I just have one comment: The paper focuses on adult people. In the research were, as far as I know only reviews that address adults. Why do the authors do not discuss the gap between the policy used focussing youth and the policy focussing adults? For example the research carried out by Karen Schelleman at your own university shows small evidence for effect of city-based actions in the Netherlands (Karen Schelleman-Offermans, R. Knibbe, E. Kuntsche: Preventing Adolescent Alcohol Use: Effects of a Two-Year Quasi-Experimental Community Intervention Intensifying Formal and Informal Control. Journal of Adolescent Health 54(3) November 2013; Karen Schelleman-Offermans, R. Knibbe, M. Derickx H. van de Mheen: A Process Evaluation of a Community Intervention to Reduce Youth Drinking. Sucht 59(5):249-259 January 2013). The thing is many countries are focusing only on youth, I think that is the main reason there are so few researches about community interventions in the adult world. This is the reason why I chose ‘Partly’ in the first question: accurate: Yes, but in my view not complete. Paying attention to the gap between the policy regarding youth and regarding adults would improve the paper seriously.
