The paper entitled "The antimicrobial activity of alcoholic extracts of leaves and bark from two varieties of ”Sangre de Drago” compared with the antimicrobial activity present in the latex of the same species" describes some chemical analysis and antimicrobial properties of the alcoholic extract and latex form a medicinal plant from Ecuador. The topic of the paper is interesting but there is little additional information compared with previously published reports. Additionally, the purification methods and physiochemical analysis are simple and insufficient to provide useful information. The paper should not have the results of standard microbiological parameters accepted by Ecuadorian institutions. Minor points Before considering for indexing, the paper requires a lot of improvement in style. The authors should pay attention to the references. References 8 and 9 don't correspond with the text. Page 3: This should be eliminated "Under the same conditions, the physical chemical constants of the crude latex of Sangre de Drago samples were determined. For the determination of the refractive index, a Clean-Prison series 003021 ABBE refractometer was used. pH determination was carried out in a Metrohm potentiometer, type 1.744.0010." Page 4, thin layer chromatography results are insufficient to identify taspine as indicated in the text Page 5. The methods utilized to detect E. coli are not adequate.
