- There are some sentences where the text says "7 genes", or "13 genes". While this is fine, it is good practice to print "nrow(prioritised_hits)" or similar to show to readers that, yes, there are indeed the stated number of genes. - My suggestion for "linkOverlaps" was to do something like: linked - linkOverlaps(pchic, snps_hard, tsss, use.region="same") ... which would give you the physical interactions between the SNPs (linked$subject1) and the TSS's (linked$subject2). I only mention this for future reference, as this may be more convenient in some settings.
