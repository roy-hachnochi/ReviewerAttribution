The article highlights about the bibliometric analysis of scientific works in the area of machine learning, published in Scopus indexed Journals during the period of 2007-2017. The manuscript is well written. However, I have following suggestions to make: Correction in title of Manuscript: Exploring machine learning: A bibliometric general approach using SciMAT Tool Definition of Machine learning should be incorporated in the introduction Part. Authors can refer and cite following articles: PMID: 23740390 1 and PMID: 28302041 2 Apart from mass mortality events, the quality of water, segment clients in private banking, automatically classify text, production of crops, the machine learning applications are also widely used in the Drug designing in pharmaceutical industries, academia and research. Authors should mention the same in the introduction part of the article and can refer and cite the following articles with PMID: 22346230 3 , PMID: 26526829 4 , PMID: 28382857 5 , PMID: 29256344 6 Methods: As the data set is collected from Scopus, the same should be cited in the manuscript. The original source of SciMAT Tool should be cited in the manuscript. The authors must elaborate more about the basis of division of the data set. It is mentioned that the time interval divided into six smaller periods: 2007–2009, 2010–2012, 2013–2014, 2015, 2016, 2017. As the division is not uniform. Was the gap made such a way so as to have comparable number of articles in each one of them only? The machine learning algorithms are widely used in robotics and pharmaceutical properties prediction. They can also be included in conclusion part. Apart from SciMAT, are some other similar tools available? Can the comparative analysis of results using the same data set from different tools be done to know that how conclusive the reported results are? This can be included as future prospect of the current research.
