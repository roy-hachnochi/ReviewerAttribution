It is hard to assess what the findings truly mean, because the study population is not a representative sample of the general child population of the area studied. It is a study of children admitted to hospital with clinical findings suggestive of EBV infection who are shown to have had the infection (the ‘numerator’), expressed as a percentage of all children of the same age admitted to the hospital (the ‘denominator’). It is therefore not true prevalence, but the prevalence in hospitalised children. The numerator is potentially affected by factors that influence the referral of children to hospital and the clinical decisions to admit them. The denominator cannot be said to be representative of the general population of children. Changes over time in the prevalence rate could be affected by changes to the numerator, which is what the authors have assumed (i.e. more children affected by EBV); or by changes in the referral or admission practices in respect of children with symptoms suggestive of EBV infection; or they could be affected by changes to the denominator population. To illustrate the latter point, an increase in admissions of children with non-infective diagnoses, eg injuries, would tend to reduce the rate of children with EBV per 100 children admitted overall. It is also impossible to know how to interpret how the authors’ data on ‘prevalence’ compare with those reported by other studies, because the sampled populations may be quite different. For example, reference 21 reports a study of people in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) which comprise a representative sample of the US population (and which may therefore be quite different from a hospitalised population). The authors cannot do anything about the nature of the subjects studied by them; but they can describe and discuss this as a potential limitation of the study.
