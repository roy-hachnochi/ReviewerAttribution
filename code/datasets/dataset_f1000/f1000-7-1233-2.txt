Photoreceptors undergo immense oxidative stress throughout the life of an organism. However, it is not clear how these neurons cope with such stress. This manuscript attempts to tackle this question by assessing the role of RNA-DNA hybrid resolution and DNA repair mechanisms during stress. They identify some novel findings, including inefficient DNA repair in photoreceptors and depletion of ATM (a sensor of oxidative stress) levels by P20 in mouse retina. It is also interesting to note that depletion of ATM can have a protective effect in the rd1 mice. These studies also indicate a possible difference between murine and human retinal response to oxidative stress, hence, a different phenotype in mouse models of human RP. The manuscript is well written and sufficiently explained. However, there are few minor concerns that should be addressed: 1. The ONL staining in Fig 2E may represent cone nuclei. It would be interesting to comment on the possible involvement of cones in this response. 2. Are the cells used in some experiments primary vascular fraction? If so, were they synchronized as there is a comparison between retinas (post-mitotic neurons) and proliferating cells for oxidative stress responses. It would help to clarify or acknowledge such differences.
