 The title of this study is misleading to focus on effect of number of antenatal care (ANC) on the other risk factors for developing of Pregnancy induced hypertension (PIH). In fact, number of ANC in this study was also just one risk factor. No results in this study that showed the correlation of ANC and other risk factors. The title of this study should be changed to Risk factors of Pregnancy Induced Hypertension in Lao PDR as in the Questionnaire. More risk factors such as new partner in multiparous pregnant women, Several medical conditions (Chronic hypertension, Diabetes Mellitus, Renal disease), Pregnancy with increased placental mass should be included in the questionnaire. At the present time, new 2016 WHO antenatal care model with a minimal eight contacts is used instead of the previous one with only four visits because the latter resulted in a 15% excess of perinatal deaths (some may be from PIH) compared with former one (Dowswell et al 1 ). So, using the previous WHO ANC recommendation may give some misleading results. The methodology of this study is technically sound and easily replicated by others. In the discussion section, please explain why gravidarum, pre-pregnancy BMI, socio-economic factors were not the risk factors of PIH in this study. Please define the difference between Received adequate information about PIH and Received Inadequate information about PIH .
