The reviewer wishes to thank the author for the edits introduced in the most recent revision. It might be helpful if the names of antimicrobials considered in the analysis were listed in the Abstract. Also, the sentence "Not all positive associations were statistically significant" probably needs editing as the term "positive associations" usually implies that they are significant. Perhaps the penultimate sentence in the Abstract could be replaced by something like "Several types of analyses relating STI screening intensity and changes in minimal inhibitory concentrations were performed, and the associations found to be statistically significant varied between the different analyses."
