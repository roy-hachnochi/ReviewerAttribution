The reviewer wishes to thank the author for revising the submission. In the most recent submission, the author chose to mostly report those findings in the Results section that show the effect of screening for azithromycin and cefixime MICs, but not ceftriaxone MICs. In the earlier response to the reviewer queries, the author wrote: “we have assessed Spearman's correlation between percent reporting screening for any STI in the previous 12 months and MIC for the three antimicrobials in the following year (2012): Azithromycin: Rho 0.45; P=0.141 Cefixime: Rho 0.31; P=0.325 Ceftriaxone: Rho=0.64; P=0.026” “We also assessed Spearman's correlation between percent reporting screening for any STI in the previous 12 months (2011 survey) and the fold change in geometric mean MIC for the three antimicrobials between a) 2005 and 2013: Azithromycin: Rho 0.77; P=0.003 Cefixime: Rho 0.82; P=0.001 Ceftriaxone: Rho=0.61; P=0.034” "b) 2009 and 2013: Azithromycin: Rho 0.33; P=0.299 Cefixime: Rho -0.50; P=0.100 Ceftriaxone: Rho=0.58; P=0.047" The reviewer thinks that choosing to focus on those results that stress the effect for azithromycin and cefixime MICs, but not ceftriaxone MICs could be viewed as tendentious, trying to exhibit the effect of screening on MICs for the antimicrobial that is currently used in the treatment of gonorrhea. The reviewer would suggest to give a more balanced account of the results in light of all the findings.
