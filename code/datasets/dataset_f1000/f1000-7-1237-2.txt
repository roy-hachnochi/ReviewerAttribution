The reviewer wishes to thank the author for the revisions and the additional analyses performed. It appears to the reviewer that the results stated in the the Abstract and the results of the additional analyses in the response to the earlier reviewer comments are not fully compatible. The main finding of the paper, stated in the Abstract is: We found positive associations between STI screening intensity and increases in minimum inhibitory concentrations [between 2007-2013] for cefixime and azithromycin, but not ceftriaxone.” At the same time, according to the author’s response: 1. “we have assessed Spearman's correlation between percent reporting screening for any STI in the previous 12 months and MIC for the three antimicrobials in the following year (2012): Azithromycin: Rho 0.45; P=0.141 Cefixime: Rho 0.31; P=0.325 Ceftriaxone: Rho=0.64; P=0.026” Thus the only significant relation between screening levels during the previous year and MIC is for ceftriaxone, unlike the relation between screening and increases in MIC reported in the Abstract. 2. We also assessed Spearman's correlation between percent reporting screening for any STI in the previous 12 months (2011 survey) and the fold change in geometric mean MIC for the three antimicrobials between a) 2005 and 2013: Azithromycin: Rho 0.77; P=0.003 Cefixime: Rho 0.82; P=0.001 Ceftriaxone: Rho=0.61; P=0.034 Thus the relation between screening and increases in MIC between 2005-2013 is significant for all the three antibiotic classes, unlike the case of the increases in MIC between 2007-2013 reported in the Abstract. b) 2009 and 2013: Azithromycin: Rho 0.33; P=0.299 Cefixime: Rho -0.50; P=0.100 Ceftriaxone: Rho=0.58; P=0.047 Thus the relation between screening and increases in MIC between 2009-2013 is significant only for ceftriaxone, which is exactly the opposite of the case of the increases in MIC between 2007-2013 reported in the Abstract. Overall, the findings stated in the Abstract reflect the results of some of the analyses, while other analyses yield different results. The author needs to think of a way for framing the results to accommodate all the findings.
