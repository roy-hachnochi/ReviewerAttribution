Approved with notes: In the ‘Introduction, the final sentence of paragraph 1 is not related to the previous sentence. I suggest that the authors need a statement about the direct and indirect influences of heavy metals on ecological environment and aquatic organisms. In ‘Methods’, I suggest that the authors describe the reasons for selecting a sampling location. In ‘Methods’, I suggest that the authors describe the reasons for selecting gills and stomach as a sample organs. In ‘Results and discussion’, the authors have not described a discussion based on results in “Heavy metal content in seawater” and in “Heavy metal analysis in gill and stomach. The authors used heavy metals of Pb, Hg and Cd, why use these three heavy metals as indicators, not other heavy metals, maybe the authors could be explain the reason?
