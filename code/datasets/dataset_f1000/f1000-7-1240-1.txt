This paper uses a mapping analysis to summarize machine learning literature from 2007-2017. They create a dataset by extracting papers and conference material from the Web of Science collection using the keywords ‘machine AND learning’ which resulted in 41,962 records. They used CiteSpace to visualize the data in several different ways: publications per year, co-authorship network, country network, institution network, co-occurring subjects and keywords, journal co-citation network, etc. The presented graphics include a wealth of information using various node sizes and colorings by year. The work is clearly and accurately presented with some current literature cited. The methods are clearly defined and their dataset and project files to recreate the research are given in a link. I think the paper gives an interesting overview of the directions of machine learning and important researchers, research hubs, and domain topics. It also presents a study that can be followed for looking at any research area. I would suggest doing another proofread, but find the article to be technically sound and interesting.
