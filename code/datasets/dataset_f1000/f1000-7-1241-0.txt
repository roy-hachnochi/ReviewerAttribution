The United Kingdom Collaborative Trial of Ovarian Cancer Screening was a high-quality randomized clinical trial evaluating trans-vaginal ultrasound screening (TVUS) compared to a multi-modal screening (MMS) with Risk of Ovarian Cancer Algorithm (ROCA) testing based on CA-125 measurements followed by ultrasound when indicated compared to no screening in 202,546 women of average risk of ovarian cancer. After 7 to 11 rounds of screening and up to 14 years of follow-up results trended toward benefit with ultrasound (HR = 0.91 [95% CI, 0.76 to 1.09]) and MMS (HR = 0.89 [95% CI, 0.74 to 1.08]) 1 . A comprehensive quality assurance program for TVUS was undertaken 2 . This current paper is the result of an audit ordered by the trialâ€™s Ultrasound Management Subcommittee of seven sonographers reporting rates of visualizing both ovaries of 89% after an accreditation program done by UKCTOCS in 2008. Eight experts reviewed 357 archived, static images centrally stored that also had measurement markers recording ovary dimensions. The mean visualization rate upon review for both ovaries fell to 67.2% with a range of 47.6 % to 86.5%. The range between the experts was 47.3% to 88.3%. The trialists are to be commended for the design and conduct of this impressive ovarian cancer screening trial which shows some evidence of stage-shift and mortality reduction but after many rounds and long follow-up in a large group of women. The quality assurance plans in place to train and monitor TVUS results is impressive. While the technology dates to 2008-2009 and highly-selected experts might do better, the results of this audit strike a cautionary note about the rate of probably unavoidable non-visualization of ovaries with TVUS in post-menopausal women. They call for expanded efforts in automated analysis with machine learning. Improved technologies or biomarkers are also needed to realize the promise of lowering ovarian cancer mortality with early detection.
