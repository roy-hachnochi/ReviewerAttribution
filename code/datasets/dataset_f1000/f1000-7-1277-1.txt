I will not summarize the work again, as this was already done in the careful reviews of the first two referees. These referees have identified a number of issues that were only partially addressed in the current version of the manuscript. In particular, the generality and interpretation of the results, given that they are based solely on simulations, need to be addressed better, as pointed out earlier. Moreover, a number of relevant references are not discussed, and it is hence not possible to understand how the present manuscript complements the voluminous literature on the subject. The \mu in Eq. 1 is a multiplicative factor, from what I gather from ref. 6. This is not clear. Why is \sigma in the exponent in the definition of sigma*? It is unclear that with N = 210 the effects of different degree distributions can be clearly observed. With this number of neurons finite size effects are likely still strong. In particular, the effects of a heavy-tailed distribution will likely only become apparent with more cells. The effects of driving neurons by synchronous input have been noted before, by Selinas and Sejnowski, and many others. As the previous reviewer points out, it is unclear what is different here. Similarly, the hypothesis that hub neurons can synchronize a population has been suggested before, eg. Bonifazi, et al Science, 2009 1 , and many others. The currents in Figs 2A and 4B are nearly periodic. I would not expect this, unless they were generated using a mother process. In this case, the observation is actually a consequence of higher order correlations, ie. a common, synchronous input from many neurons that drive a response. Since it was unclear how the correlations in the inputs were generated, I could not tell if this was the case. However, this needs to be clearly explained. The first two reviewers have made extensive comments. These were not addressed adequately. I believe these should be resolved before moving forward.
