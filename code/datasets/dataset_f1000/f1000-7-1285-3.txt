I read with interest the manuscript entitled: “ Aloe barbadensis Miller leaf exudate is a potential treatment for bovine mastitis ” . The manuscript is very interesting. In general, I found clearly written and only a few typos and errors were found as listed in the attached file that already were corrected. I did not understand why in the discussion of antimicrobial activity, the authors cited only the results of concentrations between 500 and 1000 ug/mL. In the methodology cited, the use of six concentrations between 500 and 4000 μg/mL. I think the authors should consider the possibility of Aloe exudate being toxic to epithelial cells as it showed toxicity to the MAC T cells. I suggest making a cytotoxicity test for this cell before suggesting this exudate as a disinfectant. Overall, I believe that this otherwise very good manuscript could benefit of a minor revision before indexing in F1000Reasearch. I have attached a commented copy of the manuscript for the authors to consider in the revision.
