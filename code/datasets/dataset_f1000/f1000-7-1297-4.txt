This paper presents a well-designed and comprehensive evaluation of widely used clustering algorithms for medium-sized 10x Genomics scRNA-seq data. Clustering is a highly active area of research in scRNA-seq data analysis. With so many published clustering tools available, it is often difficult to choose the most appropriate tool. This paper attempts to address this problem by systematically comparing the performance of 12 commonly used clustering tools. The evaluation results should serve as an important guide to bioinformatics practitioners. This paper is a very useful contribution to the field.
