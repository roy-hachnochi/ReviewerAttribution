The title of this manuscript describes exactly its contents. The validation of a S. cerevisiae malate dehydrogenase 2, Mdh2, antibody for use in western blots. The study is informative and complete and clearly shows that, of the three antisera tested, the third antiserum is of highest specificity. In total lysates, no cross reactivity is found to related proteins Mdh1 and Mdh3. Conditions of sample preparation and western blot analysis are well described and should ensure for reproducibility. The only thing that could further enhance reproducibility is information on how much protein or culture OD600 equivalents were loaded per lane.
