Thank you to the authors of the paper for their time and effort in addressing comments in the previous revision. In the previous review, the following major comments were requested to be addressed: 1) extending the differential expression to more than two labels, 2) a suggestion of using dot plots over heatmaps, 3) a request for benchmarking execution time, and 4) a clarification of costs. Admittedly, the first two points could be interpreted as extending and not delivering the specific tutorial that is being replicated. In this light, Seurat tutorials are a de facto standard and making them available "as is" in this notebook environment adds great value to the community. I look forward to the community extending these notebooks with additional functionality but seeing how this works is not needed for the indexing of this manuscript. Execution time for each step is now given in the notebook for major steps. Costs are clarified as part of the conclusion of the manuscript. These corrections and actions address the requested points from the previous review.
