 Title: Ok, it represents the article well Abstract: Ok, it provide the central idea about the article precisely. However, authors can expand it a little more. Keywords: Authors should arrange them alphabetically Introduction: At the end of first paragraph, authors suggested about available transcriptomic data. I believe there they can add some references of available transcriptomes related to the topic. Overall, it has been written fine. VIGS: Authors provided all the required information related to this technology. However, there are some bioinformatics tools, which helps in the selection of target fragment within the gene. They can add these too. Expressed sequence tags (ESTs): Ok TILLING: Ok CRISPR Technology: Ok Conclusion: Ok, Nicely written. To summarize, the review by Singh et al. presents our current knowledge of many genes deciphered by reverse genetic technologies: VIGS, EST, TILLING and CRISPR. The tables represents ample amount of information in a well-organised way. Overall, the Review provides a useful compilation of subject matter related to addressed topic in a coherent way.
