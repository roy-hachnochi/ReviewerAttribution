As much as the manuscript is compellingly written and there certainly is a good possibility that loss of dystrophin in vascular cells might contribute to DMD, there is no direct experimental evidence to support the notion that VSMC dystrophin loss is the route cause of DMD - as claimed in the title. To make such a claim, experiments involving VSMC rescue of dystrophin in mdx mice or other versions of mdx mice needs to be performed. Targeting of ERRb2/4 in VSMC is also not performed. Furthermore, myotubes isolated from mice may not be a system complex enough to address this question. As much as utrophin expression is measured, compensation by some other structural proteins in not considered. As such the intact utrophin levels might be sufficient to maintain differentiation of myotubes. Overall, its premature to claim that VSMC dystrophin deficiency in SMC is a root cause of DMD without direct experimental evidence. â€‹
