This manuscript suggests the possibility that the lack of dystrophin expression in cell types different than myofibers is the cause of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). In particular smooth muscle cells are proposed to be the cells responsible for the disease. The idea that DMD is not necessarily due to a lack of dystrophin in skeletal muscle fibres is interesting but of course it challenges a plethora of previous studies and needs to be demonstrated properly. The main issue with this study is that the claims are not supported by results. At the end of the Introduction it is stated that “The aim of this investigation was to identify the function of NRG/ERBB signalling in muscle and, as it phosphorylated -DB1 in the DAPC complex, determine if it had a functional role in muscular dystrophy by identifying downstream signaling targets…”. Clearly the manuscript fails to show this as only a very short dataset is provided. To support the claim of the title the authors should provide evidences that …“Even though dystrophin is lacking in skeletal muscles of Erbb2/4 dKO mice, they do not show dystrophic symptoms”…This crucial point is mentioned in Discussion by citing the ref paper #20 which anyway does not include any information about a lack of dystrophin in muscles. The suggestion that the lack of dystrophin in smooth muscle cells (or blood vessel cells) is causing the disease is speculative and it is not supported by the data provided. A solid set of data demonstrating that the dystrophin expressed in smooth muscle cells (or other blood vessel cells) only (ie not in myofibres) is sufficient to rescue the pathology should be provided. Clearly a proper set of experiments in vivo is needed to support the authors’ claim.
