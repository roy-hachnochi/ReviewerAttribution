This paper concludes that the root cause of DMD is the lack of dystrophin in smooth muscle blood vessels. The only result to support this is their use of ERBB2/ERBB4 knock out myotubes which are negative for dystrophin. In the abstract under results they imply that there are data from the double mutant mice but results are not presented. There is just one analysis in mytotubes showing dystrophin absence. In vivo, this signalling could well be compensated for and dystrophin may be expressed. In the original article on these mice (ref 20; Esther et al 1 ), this signalling is compensated for by agrin in vivo at the NMJ. No comments are made about dystrophin being absent in the muscle of these animals nor their muscle phenotype . Thus this report does not contain sufficient evidence for the conclusion which is based on one blot from a cell line.
