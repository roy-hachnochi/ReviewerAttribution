The paper by Emmanuel van den Broeke critically discusses definition and use of the terms central sensitisation and pain hypersensitivity. As stated by the author, the term central sensitisation has become increasingly popular, and seems to become over-used, if not mis-used. At times, it is important to reflect upon the origin of terms, and to track how meaning and use have changed over time. Evidently, we do not have to hold on the past, and definitions and use may change as science advances. The paper of van den Broeke is timely, and provides essential reading for many. It is an ideal paper for scholarly reflection and group discussion. It nicely traced the origin in meaning, and the various changes in definition. It critically analyses interrelationships with other constructs, and potential disadvantages. Notwithstanding, it does not provide definite answers. Probably, that is not possible, but I would suggest that the authors reflect upon what should be the way forward. What do they recommend to readers and researchers. Most importantly, seems to be a precise use of the term, and to avoid confusion in meaning. Indeed, as pointed out central sensitisation can be used to describe a phenomenon or to describe a mechanism. This is confusing and may result in circular reasoning: central sensitisation explains central sensitisation; In that respect, I have learned to make a distinction between at least three ways of using scientific terms: (1) as a result, (2) as an explanation and (3) as a procedure. Central sensitisation as a result refers to the phenomenon, most often as the result of a specific procedure. Indeed, there are some experimental procedures that induce the phenomenon. Finally, an scientific endeavour is to provide explanations, often mechanistic explanations, for the phenomenon that results from particular experimental procedures. In times of confusion and overuse, it is useful to come back and reflect upon what exactly is meant by someone.
