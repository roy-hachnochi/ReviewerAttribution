The intention and the action performed to support the intention of the human-being is supported by the impeccable coordination of the peripheral nervous system (PNS) and the central nervous system (CNS). Any disruption in this coordination, for example dysfunction of afferent or efferent pathways or injury in the spinal cord or neurological disorders affecting the functioning of brain, affects the normal functioning of the human body. The individual becomes paralyzed and is unable to perform the simple day to day activities of walking or talking. Brain computer interfaces (BCIs) have been developed to help such individuals, where BCIs aim to bypass the dysfunctional pathways and interface the external mechanical or electrical devices with the functioning brain of an individual. Both non-invasive and invasive BCIs have been developed: in non-invasive BCIs non-invasive neuroimaging techniques are being used to acquire brain signals from the surface of the scalp while in invasive BCIs electrodes are placed on the cortical surface of the brain or inserted in the brain. The invasive technique where the electrodes known as microelectrodes are inserted in the brain records spike signals either from a single neuron, known as single unit activity (SUA) or from a group of neurons, known as local field potentials (LFPs). In this article the authors have done a great job in summarizing the technical challenges faced by researchers during recording neural signals invasively and have discussed the different approaches developed to solve these problems. Given the recent media interest in the application of BCI as a tool for the means of communication and rehabilitation of paralysed people, several entrepreneurs have invested huge resources in developing BCI. The authors have applauded such efforts and have presented a bright outlook on the effect of such interests on the development of BCI for real world applications.
