I enjoyed reading this interesting, relevant and well written article. I think that's it's great strength is the focus on hubris in scientific discovery - an area that is currently not written much about. I liked the examples and the arguments and I think they are convincing. If there are any areas for development maybe the authors could say a bit more about one of the really interesting points that they mention but don't develop -that is teaching humility, this is a really great and novel idea in hubris research and I like the idea of approaching it from a Socratic or Aristotelian perspective. Good luck I hope this work gets indexed.
