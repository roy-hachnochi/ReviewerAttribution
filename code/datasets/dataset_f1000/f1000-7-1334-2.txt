In the paper entitled “Caucasian and south Asian men show equivalent improvements in surrogate biomarkers of cardiovascular and metabolic health following 6-weeks of supervised resistance training” you had the aim to investigate the cardio-metabolic response to resistance exercise training in South Asian and Caucasian population. The work is well written, and presents very interesting data, however a have a few issues to clarify. Major The whole introduction is based on the fact that SA’s are cardio-metabolic different from CAUCC’s, so why you hypothesized no differences would be found in the results? Why only male participants were enrolled in the study? You would have more complete results and an avenue to discuss if women were tested. Data of muscular strength gain could be more clear in a table or graph. It is not mandatory, however I feel that the authors could explore more about cardiovascular data and their relationship with the metabolic data. For example, changing in rest and recovery heart rate and heart rate variability with the RES training. Methods Participants section: Performance measurements (upper and lower body) should be in a specific section, and would be appropriate to provide more detailed information. “A single-tailed within-group comparison revealed a required sample size of 15 per group (alpha set to 0.05 and power at 0.95). Therefore, the presented data should be considered as hypothesis generating.” Should be in statistical analysis section. Minor Page 5: “Neither was there any change within in the CAUC”. Small writing mistake. Page 8: “however, the CAUC group showed demonstrated higher strength at POST than the SA group”. Small writing mistake.
