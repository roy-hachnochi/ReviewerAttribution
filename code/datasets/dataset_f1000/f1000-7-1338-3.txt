FastQ Screen by Wingett and Andrews is a tool to map a sample of sequenced reads against a panel of reference genomes. The tool is comprehensively documented and is available from the authors' web site and via Github. I have personally used this tool since 2011 and it is incorporated in the quality control pipeline for our core facility on all sequencing runs. The tool has been used to detect contamination from a panel of commonly used genomes, and to estimate the contribution of sequence from mixed genome samples. It is also used to detect rRNA contamination in RNA-seq protocols. Recently the ability of FastQ Screen to filter individual reads has been incorporated into our single cell analysis pipeline. The article is clear, well explained, and gives interesting use cases. Minor correction : In the legend of Figure1 - 'Reads either i) mappped' should be 'Reads are either i) mapped' 'ii) mapped uniquely' should be 'iii) mapped uniquely' '(light red) or multi-mapped' should be '(light red), or iv) multi-mapped'
