Wingett and Andrews present FastQ Screen for mapping sequencing reads to multiple genomes with the goal of identifying the genome of origin. FastQ Screen is well documented, open source and freely available via GitHub and their own website. I have been using the software routinely as part of my NGS pipelines for several years and find it to be an invaluable QC tool. Sample mix ups, if from different species, are easily detected. I have also found FastQ Screen useful as a proxy indicator of rRNA contamination in total RNA-Seq, due to rRNAs being similar between related species, they show up as multi-genome aligned reads, thus identifying samples for further processing. I therefore have no reservations in recommending FastQ Screen for indexing. Suggestions: Each lab or facility will have their own unique requirements for genomes to screen against, but having a suggested “starter set” of genomes may ease the burden of installation / configuration for first time users. The bowtie website has some pre-made common, bowtie indexed, genomes for convenient download ( http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/bowtie2/index.shtml ). Or more comprehensively, Illumina’s iGenome project contains a wide range of bowtie/bowtie2/bwa indexed genomes ( http://support.illumina.com/sequencing/sequencing_software/igenome.ilmn ). One of the most useful features of FastQ Screen is its compatibility with MultiQC, where multiple samples are plotted together for assessment of entire sequencing runs or batches. Mentioning this in the documentation would alert users to this very useful feature.
