Baron, Stickel, and Weeks present a well-written article describing the newly-developed R package (Mega2R) as an additional tool to the robust Mega2 data-reformatting software. Mega2R helps alleviate problems in handling huge genetic data by allowing the user to specify regions of the genome, genes, or markers that will be included in the analysis. It keeps the genotype data in a compressed format when reading from the Mega2 SQLite database to efficiently overcome the memory restrictions of R. It includes several functions that allow a user to carry out additional association tests, outputs Mega2R data as a VCF file with other related files, converts data frames into GenABEL-compatible format, and enhances GenABEL by supporting additional input data formats. Mega2R is indeed a useful R package for genetic analysis. I enjoyed reading the manuscript since the authors have clearly described what a user can do through Mega2R. I have a few minor comments and suggestions below: Add a schematic diagram of Mega2R showing the different functions and how they interact with the SQLite database. This will visually help readers understand this article. For future enhancements, would it be possible to have a Mega2pedgene function that allows the user to choose between using reference/alternate alleles instead of major/minor alleles? This may allow Mega2R to facilitate analysis involving datasets from different populations. Is the chunk of 1,000 markers at a time in building the VCF file a fixed value? Or will you allow the user to select a particular number in the future? Indicate the format of the genotype matrix, e.g., normal format (markers in columns and individuals in rows), based on your examples. Will Mega2R be back compatible or will it only be compatible with R 3.5.0 onwards? Typographical error (retruns)
