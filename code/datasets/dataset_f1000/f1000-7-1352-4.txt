Weeks and colleagues described a very useful R package to access multiple data formats and facilitate its integration with R packages. This package is based upon its predecessor MEGA2, which is highly cited and used in genetic data analysis. This tools is long overdue. While numerous statistical genetics methods are being developed, only a minority of them have really a usable interface. Due to the metadata that modern genetic datasets needs= to store, many of the files are not stored in a rectangular format. Parsing these files and making them analyzable in R is often the most time-consuming part to code but is the key for the development. The package filled in this gap and make easy the development of useful softwares. I only have a few minor comments: 1) The software is unique and useful, but the existence of other packages that can read and parse genetic datasets in R should be acknowledged. For example, VariantAnnotation package in bioconductor and seqminer in CRAN can both randomly access tabix indexed VCF/BCF files. 2) One of the major strength of the package is to facilitate statistical genetics method development. So it would be helpful if the authors could give a toy example on how to make use of applyFnToGenes to handle a user defined statistical tests.
