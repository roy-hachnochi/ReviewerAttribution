The article titled "Long-term preservation of biomedical research data‚Äù by Navale et.al, is a timely article that highlights the need for a long term strategy for preservation of data products generated from research projects. Often times a lot of time is spent in the initial activities of a research project which involves data collection, processing, analysis, sharing and publishing but substantially less time is spent in curating the data, making data reusable and finally long term preservation of data products. The paper presents a strategy for long term data preservation which the authors have broken down into multiple stages. This reviewer agrees with the strategy and the overall presentation of the strategy in the manuscript. There is, however, one important challenge in long term data management that this reviewer felt has not been covered adequately which is the economics of long term data preservation. Determining which data products are preserved and for how long is an important part of the puzzle. Additionally, the economics of long term storage along with who the stakeholders are and what the incentives for this to happen is also important. The article would be made better with these additions.
