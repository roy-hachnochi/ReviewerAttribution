This is a timely scientific undertaking and stands as an important, original contribution to the body of research on data preservation in the context of big data, biomedical research, and data management/archiving. Furthermore, the research makes important links to key underpinnings and research covering data quality, modeling, along with metadata, and ontologies. Much of the big data research to date has focused on algorithmic work, visualization, and related topics, whereas data preservation and archival research has been driven largely from the context of institutional repositories that are not necessarily storing big data. This paper bridges these two research areas, using the OAIS model as a platform to weave together these topics, and provide salient discussion about keys pillars of covering preservation planning, administration, ingest, data management, archival storage, and access. The research is further contextualized by the FAIR principles that seek to ensure that data not only findable and accessible, but also interpretable and reusable. Further, the authors hone in on the role of data modeling, metadata, including the provenance model and ontologies. The writing is excellent, the synthesis of the literature and integration of other research is solid. Additionally, the diagrams are illustrative. (Note, this my first review in this system, and I am super excited and pleased to have had the opportunity to serve as a reviewer for this original research, and eager to share with colleagues. In fact, have already shared this link with colleagues, so they can include this piece as a key reading across related courses as our academic quarter at Drexel is almost underway).
