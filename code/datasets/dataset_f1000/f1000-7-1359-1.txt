Wandeler and colleagues provide here an excellent and comprehensive review on DTG-based maintenance therapy, even though this review will lack the latest communications on the topic (at IAS 2018). Nevertheless, the conclusions they make are in accordance with what is currently admitted by experts in the field and worldwide guidelines: DTG monotherapy lead to an unacceptable virologic failure (VF) rate (because of 50% of emerging mutations to the class) whereas dual therapy has an excellent efficacy and no VF with mutations to the class. I only have minor comments or questions: Results: (page 4) Can the authors provide any data on the impact of CD4 nadir on VF during monotherapy (as described by Wijting in the DOMONO trial)? (page 8) Authors should give more explicit conclusion on this paragraph “The only variable that contributed to explaining the between-study heterogeneity in both the 24 and 48-week analyses was treatment strategy. When including this variable, the tau-squared were reduced from 1.17 (95% CI 0.33-2.19) to 0.00 (95% CI 0.00-1.11) in the 24 week analysis and from 1.37 (95% CI 0.54-2.15) to 0.00 (95% CI 0.00-1.00) in the 48 week analysis. The inclusion of other variables did not impact the estimates of tau-squared.” Discussion: (page 9) Please provide some references (at least one) for the impact of M184V on viral fitness (this one is of interest for DTG-based regimen: doi: 10.1097/QAD.0000000000001191) (page 9) I think authors should provide some data on VF (%, emerging mutations) during switch from a triple therapy to another one (in order to have an “historical comparator” for dual therapy) (page 10, “In addition, more data on the activity of DTG-based simplified regimens in compartments other than blood are needed.”) There are some references for mono- or dual-therapy in the genital tract (Hocqueloux et al. 1 and Gianella et al. 2 )and CNS (Doco Lecompte et al. 3 ) (page 10) Authors should cite recent reports (all communicated at the IAS 2018 in Amsterdam) confirming their conclusions, even though they cannot include them in the analyses: two randomized-controlled clinical trials on DTG monotherapy (Braun et al. 4 and Hocqueloux et al. 5 ), the extended follow-up of the SWORD trials at week 100 (Aboud et al. 6 ) and results of the GEMINI trials (Cahn et al. 7 ). References: (references 25 and 28) I think two references (Gantner and Bonijoly) are duplicates (as they are based on the analyze of the same database; Bonijoly et al. have included more patients / with longer duration of follow-up than Gantner).
