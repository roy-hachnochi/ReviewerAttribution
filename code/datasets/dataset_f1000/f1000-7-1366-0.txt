This manuscript represents a valuable contribution addressing a timely and relevant problem in epitranscriptomics analysis. Indeed, several RNA editing analysis studies have been reported so far in the literature but reliable standard operative procedures for evaluating "differential editing" are still missing. However, the methodology presented raises some relevant concerns that need to be adequately addressed: 1) A basic question... how to label a site as edited? An editing level of 1% is enough? But this can be detected with a very high coverage. In other words different coverage levels in different samples may greatly affect the estimate of the number of editing sites. 2) The differential analysis is based on the EPK parameter which is related to the number of observed editing sites (regions). I have serious concerns on the metrics used in consideration that the extent of editing is variable and its detection somehow dependent on the coverage. For example, lets say we have 1000 shared editing sites, with editing level at 10% in one sample group and 80% in the other. If I understood correctly, the metric used considers only the number of editing sites and not the editing level. So, in this case any differential editing is detected. Please clarify. 3) In order to carry pout a reliable comparison only inter-samples common sites should be considered... If different set of editing sites are compared in different samples I believe that this may introduce a serious bias affecting the results. The Authors should address this issue. 4) I am not convinced that 100% edited sites are to be excluded. Many of these are validated through comparison with the relevant genomic sequences. 5) The description of metrics for the island/cluster differential editing is not clear.
