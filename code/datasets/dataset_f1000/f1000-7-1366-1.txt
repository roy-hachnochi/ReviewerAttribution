Currently, more research has focused on human RNA editing. This software is very useful in detecting human differentially edited sites and islands. However, I suggest the authors to add some brief description about RNAEditor in the method section, which will be helpful for understanding how to handle and analyse RNA editing via RNA seq data. Besides, the authors should provide the required hardware configuration for running DREtools, and the run times when analysing each testing sample.
