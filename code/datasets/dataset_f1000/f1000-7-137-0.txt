The authors addressed two important aspects related to Alzheimer's disease: 1) accuracy of mortality rates, and 2) nutrition as a risk factor. However, the experimental design presented in the current version of the manuscript fall short in addressing both issues. Several important shortcomings in the experimental design and interpretation of the results render this manuscript unacceptable. For example: The authors compare or use different variables in the study but does not present a power analysis to support that the number of participant is sufficient to draw any conclusion. It is unclear how nutritional status relate to the death certificate. The introduction is confusing as to what is the gap in knowledge and the relationship of the proposed questions. The main limitation of death certificate is that, in the case of AD, the diagnosis is not confirmed (i.e. neuropathology).The authors did not address this major limitation. Who completed the MAN? A caregiver? How this data was collected? Cancer patients need to be segregated from the data since may have contributed to the only difference observed; phosphorus level. The participants are not segregated based on stage of AD (i.e. mild, moderate, severe). It is expected that the stage of the disease will affect their nutritional level. The discussion section addressed issues not supported by the data or even related to it. For example: Tthere is no data on the use of any of the drugs mentioned by the research participants. How is this information relevant to the study? In summary, in the present form, the authors do not have any supporting data for the interpretations and conclusion presented in the manuscript.
