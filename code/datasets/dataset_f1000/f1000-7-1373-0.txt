The authors describe a case of an acute postoperative pulmonary edema Type II (POPE II) that required high frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) support in a 14-year-old girl undergoing elective adenotonsillectomy. The manuscript is interesting, well presented and documented. The discussion is well articulated and appropriate. The clinical case demonstrates how even an adenotonsillectomy surgery can lead to major complications such as intraoperative hemorrhage and postoperative pulmonary edema. My considerations and suggestions for the authors are: The authors could specify which anamnestic elements they used in the preoperative evaluation of the girl's OSA condition. Why was the general anesthesia accomplished with a sevoflurane inhalational induction supplemented with intravenous propofol and morphine, when at the patient's age an exclusively intravenous induction could be performed? Was this anesthetic choice made on suspicion of a high airway obstruction from very enlarged tonsils? Did the transition from conventional ventilation with a PIP greater than 40 cmH 2 0 to HFOV with a MAP of 28 cmH 2 O involve any cardiovascular changes? During HFOV ventilation, for how many hours was the MAP set at 28 cmH 2 O? Based on my level of expertise in the subject matter, I believe the manuscript can be indexed.
