This is a case report of a 14 yo female developing severe POPE type II following elective tonsillectomy. The severity of the edema required treatment with HFOV. The case report is well written and referenced. I have few questions or suggestions for the authors: I believe the manuscript would be enhanced if more details regarding what screening questions for OSA were or were not asked in the pre-operative period. Why are pre-operative hemoglobin and hematocrit obtained? Why did it take 45 minutes to notify the staff anesthesiologist of the ongoing blood loss of 250 mL? Why was morphine given to a patient in respiratory distress? The discussion is excellent and complete. My only suggestion would be to move the second paragraph to the end of the discussion. Thus you are highlighting the unique features of this case report first and finishing be ruling out other potential causes.
