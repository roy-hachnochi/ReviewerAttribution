In this paper, the authors have presented and provided use-case examples for an R package that allows the estimation of the number of infections spread via travel, given information on the prevalence of disease in the sending location and the rate of flow between two locations. Although the paper builds on a published method, it should provide some additional detail about the method in the introductory sections. Specifically, in the section titled "Exportations" on page 3, the authors say that "the method assumes that the incubation period T_E and the infectious period T_I follow specific probability distributions." More explanation of the modeling assumptions will allow potential users of this package to make an informed decision about whether it will be useful to them without going back to the original manuscript in which the method was described. In addition, the reuse of "T" to indicate the rate of travel in the paragraph above and the incubation and infectious periods is confusing and should be changed. From reading the paper and looking at the github repository, it seems like it is completely up to the user to specify the distribution of the incubation and infectious periods. One potentially helpful addition to the package would be the addition of data with estimates of these quantities for different pathogens where available, along with citations/dois for the data source. This would make this more user-friendly and amenable to rapid response.
