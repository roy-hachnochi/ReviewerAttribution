I congratulate authors for the successful management of this case. This case report is well written still I have some comments for the same. It requires editing by someone who is proficient in English. Can authors describe what would be the probable reason for narrowing of right pulmonary artery ostia? what was the position of the arch of aorta, right or left? Looking at follow up image the stent seems to be protruding into the main pulmonary artery. Does there are any signs of hemolysis? Can authors explain about the approach to the patients with ostial right pulmonary artery stenosis and advantage vs disadvantages of surgery vs stent? I also have doubt of considering the lesion as peripheral branch stenosis of pulmonary artery. I think better word would be right pulmonary artery stenosis or RPA ostial stenosis. Why authors have decided to do two stage approach? why not single stage approach?
