The paper reports a rare co-occurrence of atrial septal defect and branch pulmonary artery stenosis and is worthy of eventual indexing. The expression and syntax should be improved by editing, by someone who is proficient in English. The assertion that "no similar case has been reported" should be removed. In the past, the association of atrial septal defect and branch pulmonary artery stenosis was reported (Lloyd et al., 1994 1 and Rao et al., 1995 2 ), although the subject of these papers did not allow for detailed description.
