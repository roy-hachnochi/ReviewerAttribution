Very good written article about the author's experience with the use of hyaluronidase in preventing skin necrosis after dermal filler infiltration. Their protocol is clearly stated and the pictures are very representative of the clinical course of the two patients treated. Discussion could be more complete by citing further authors. Thanks for your effort.
