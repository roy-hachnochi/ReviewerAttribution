The authors of this study aimed to retrospectively evaluate the utilization of published long-term follow-up guidelines from 2012 for adult allogeneic transplant recipients. This was evaluated in a single institution amongst the fifteen providers at that location. The authors conclude the following Survivorship focused providers are more likely to adhere to the recommendations of the guidelines However overall adherence is incomplete amongst all providers and thus further efforts are needed to improve upon this Suggestions One of the major limitations of this study includes limited study period. At least 2+ years of additional patient volume can be added to this analysis that is likely to further clarify areas that are routinely being limited and if there has been any performance improvement in survivorship assessment. Details regarding clinical practice may also be helpful. While authors do note that patients were evaluated at 2 year followup, it would be helpful to know standard practice at the institution i.e. are patients transitioned back to oncologists, primary care etc for followup as several of the long term followup needs as noted by the guidelines, are apart of routine non-transplant long term management, thus reflecting the lack of adherence to all 13 categories. This is alluded to in the discussion regarding proposed strategies. For provider year of practice â‰¥10 years vs 10 years was utilized as cutpoint, however the guidelines themselves have been out for ~ 6 years. A difference based on more recent adapters i.e. 5 years may be a better cut off as their practice may be different than those who have been practicing a certain way even prior to guidelines being updated. The authors noted that there were gender differences in the survivorship care. What did the authors think was the etiology of this?
