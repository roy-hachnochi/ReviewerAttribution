Firstly I must say this is an interesting article on an emerging subject. In respect of current literature review I think the author has included the relevant evidence. However there are few descriptions missing in the methodology 1) It is stated that RSL recruited the participants by direct contact. Then the question is what the selection criteria was used? 2) Similarly how was the volunteers selected? 3) Although it is stated that no prior knowledge was tested, it is mentioned under 'location" that their theoretical knowledge was tested to be solid which contradicts with the previous statement. I think we need to know how was the knowledge was tested eg / questionnaire is so need a publish the same 4) The article says that the participants did not have any US exposure but managed to identify the sonoanatomy which I find quite difficult to believe. As a clinician who teachers this for different levels of clinicians, they need to be taught how to identify the sonoanatomy especially the reference point (saccrum as the flat surface on the image and the LS view should me paramedian etc) when marking the spinal levels. So I think we need more information on the same. 5) Usually these scans are done using the curvilinear probe due to depth requirement but it is stated that they used liner probe, hence again the question of the selection criteria of volunteers need to explained 6) It is stated that total of 15 volunteers used. so what the provision made to account for the difference between the volunteers scanned in the analysis ? 7) It states that RSL decided the marking as correct or not, again the reader need to have a more description re what is meant by correct position how was it determined ?
