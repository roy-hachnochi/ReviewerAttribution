This article explores the effect of spatial filtering on the decoding accuracy of BOLD fMRI data. The authors conclude that a spatial bandpass filter corresponding to a difference of Gaussians of 6mm improves the decoding accuracy. Abstract: 'Reported evidence' is clumsy phrasing how about something like 'previous research'. Use of 'matches' is also ambivalent: do you mean the analysis was similar or the results? Please state the main result and not just that it is similar to that obtained for V1. Introduction: The term spatial frequency is used frequently, whereas the difference of Gaussians is described in terms of a FWHM. The units of spatial frequency are 1/mm, so if you are describing band pass filters, cut-offs etc in terms of spatial frequency then please convert to the correct units. Stimulus and fMRI data: Please give slice orientation of fMRI acquisition. I believe it was axial, but Figure 1 could mislead people into thinking it was coronal. Figure 1 caption: gaussian-Gaussian. fMRI data analysis: prior masking - prior to masking Results and Conclusions: These are given with little discussion. Why do you think the decoding accuracy is so much higher for music than for V1. Some discussion of existing literature would also be welcome, also of papers which do not reach the same conclusion as the authors (ref 1).
