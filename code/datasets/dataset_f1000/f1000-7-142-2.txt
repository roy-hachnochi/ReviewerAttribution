This is a good note, replicating previous results from vision to audition - and therefore showing that band-pass is an effective strategy, not specific to visual columns. Method: You set a GLM to get beta estimates per genre for each run, and use this (z-scored) for decoding. You mention that you included temporal derivatives, were these ones used in any form? (note you can also correct the hrf amplitude estimates using the temporal derivative https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3896880/) You used a within-subject leave-one-run-out cross-validation; as you know I'm sure, Gael showed that LOO tends to be biased (https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.05201). If I understand correctly, that means that the classification is done with 7 betas per class, predict 1 (and rotate). Obviously, that is an issue as K-folds will lead to an even smaller number of beta to use. I don't know if that's addressable here, but worth mentioning the issue (and even better do an alternative sampling scheme if you think it's feasible).
