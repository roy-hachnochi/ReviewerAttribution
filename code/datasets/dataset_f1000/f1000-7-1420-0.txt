The case report is quite informative, well written. Clearly and easily understood. The subject is addressed obviously and the diagnostic procedures are to clarify the point of interest. The results are professionally discussed and the conclusion that calls for early diagnosis to minimize the progress of dental loss and periodontal deterioration is of great interest. I think the authors should have clarified did they or did not restore the missing teeth. Also I would recommend a longer time of follow up to the case to ensure the condition of the permanent teeth after their eruption and to assure that its eruption time is not affected by the periodontal condition.
