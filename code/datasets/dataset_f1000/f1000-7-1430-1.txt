The authors have tried to work around the title as the other reviewer suggested for clarification but still, the results are inconclusive because the N value is small for behavioral studies. Hence it cannot be concluded that the behavioral results are negative. The theme of the ms is an exploratory investigation by the n=5 based on the priori power calculation. A higher n and conventional stat methods would strengthen the results. They claimed that the priori power calculation is appropriate however this type of test is suitable to interpret the existing data not generated data. In addition, looking at the raw data (Excel spreadsheet), there is one out of 5 off in the lesion size/time. They need to increase N values to identify and exclude outliers. Another point to discuss is that, as shown in Fig. 1C, the stroke lesion is not affecting mPFC but rather more lateral somatosensory/motor cortical regions. Hence, main effects on locomotion, rather than depression behavior, would be expected as shown in MCAO models. It would be important to address the stroke location with additional images or overlay.
