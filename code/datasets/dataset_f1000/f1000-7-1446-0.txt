This is a small study, containing very little data. Sample sizes of only three plates (n=3) per species are insufficient to draw conclusions. With such a small sample size, all one could hope would be to draw conclusions at the population level, but that is all but impossible since there is almost no information on the populations of origin, and designations such as “VIII Regin, Chile" or "Regin Metropolitana, Chile” are unintelligible for anyone not familiar with Chilean geography. Also, some explanation of the pre-treatments would be useful. Why does it need pre-treatment? Why that pre-treatment specifically? Do the authors have data from un-treated seeds? Chemical scarification is expected to have influenced GT50. Specifically, to shorten it, since scarified seeds germinate faster. Therefore, it is not clear how meaningful these figures are. Moreover, GT50 calculations are a little obscure as presented. Were unviable seeds taken into account? There was a sizeable amount of seeds lost to fungi. Where those discarded? Please specify.
