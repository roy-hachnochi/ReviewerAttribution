The paper is interesting and adds to the medical literature of Arbaeen Ceremony which has been poorly addressed from a public health research perspective. We hope this paper will serve as a key reference on health aspect of Arbaeen Ceremony in near future. A few minor issues should be addressed before the manuscript is published. The reference list needs to be revised, we note some misplacement error. For example, in the third paragraph of the introduction (p 3), “Based on the statistics of 2017, the number of Iranian pilgrims taking part in the Arbaeen ceremony was 2,320,000”, the reference given for this is number 16. However, ref 16 (Ahmed et al.) was published 8 years ago in 2009. Also in the paragraph that follows, “on the basis of the Mutual Memorandum of Cooperation between the two countries of Iran and Iraq, Iran is committed to providing health services to other pilgrims in addition to Iranian pilgrims”, the reference cited is number 4, which is about Hajj and Umrah and cannot the correct reference. Repetition is another issue, some information are repeated unnecessarily. The authors may consider language editing. A useful reference that the authors may consider quoting is--Al-Lami F, et al. Pattern of morbidity and mortality in Karbala hospitals during Ashura mass gathering at Karbala, Iraq, 2010 1 . Two other relevant references are—a) Alqahtani AS, et al. Australian Hajj pilgrims' infection control beliefs and practices: Insight with implications for public health approaches 2 ; b) Rahman J, et al. Mass Gatherings and Public Health: Case Studies from the Hajj to Mecca 3 . In summary this is a indexable manuscript with minor revision.
