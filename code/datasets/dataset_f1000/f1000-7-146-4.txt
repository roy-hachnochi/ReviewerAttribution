The review could be of interest but some some major revisions are needed. In particular, it would be important to update the papers selected for the revision because many other scientific evidences were published after June 2016. Moreover, too many aspects and subsets are taken into account; they did not add information and they make the paper hard to read and the message not clear. As regards to the subsets chosen for the meta-analysis, it would be important to take into account the publication period before and after the smoking ban, because it determined a variation in the exposure of the people to passive smoke and the related effects. In the discussion, section "publication bias", it was reported that " One must note, though, that various large longitudinal studies, e.g. 66â€“69, reported results relating ETS to smokingrelated diseases such as lung cancer or heart disease, but did not do so for COPD. If any relationship had been seen, these studies might well have been reported.". The reviewer thinks that this sentence is too strict and not supported by evidences. Overall the discussion seems to set up versus a negative approach against the results of the other published reviews; on the other side, it did not discuss the results regarding the negative effect of exposure to ETS found using meta-analyses. The reviewer thinks that it is not to overlook the results about the dose-response evidence or the findings of the whole sample meta-analysis (OR 1.20) etc...
