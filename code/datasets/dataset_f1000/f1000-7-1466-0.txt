While the authors have improved aspects of the manuscript through a revision, it remains unclear why the presented analysis necessitated the development of new software. Compared to VariantAnnotation (another Bioconductor package much like seqCAT; not a 'command line-based software' as noted in the revision), seqCAT uses a number of default and optional filtering parameters which, while now described in the revision, remain unexplained and unjustified, thus limiting its transparency, particularly for novice users for which this package is intended. Furthermore, it is unclear whether the noted 'highly accessible, easy-to-use' and 'intuitive' features of seqCAT were benchmarked with user testing, particularly by those with 'little R expertise' and other 'novices'. A more thorough discussion of seqCAT's limitations, particular compared to existing software, is needed so users may better decide which software is best suitable for their particular needs.
