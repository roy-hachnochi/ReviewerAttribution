I found this paper quite interesting. It introduces a mathematical formulation for ion transport across cell membranes, based in thermodynamic principles. The author further shows that other, more common formulations, are special cases of the more general one introduced here. Finally, the author employs the introduced formulation to study the dynamics of SA pacemaker cells, and is able to explain the experimentally-observed double activation of calcium channels. Overall, I have a good opinion of this paper and recommend its indexing. There are only a few minor points that should be addressed: 1. Page 3, first column, beginning of last paragraph: Eq. (10) is referred to before being introduced. 2. In my opinion, Eq. (8) is not self-evident, and its origin should be explained. 3. Same thing for Eq. (33). 4. The procedure to estimate the parameter values in Table 2 must be explained. Moreover, a parameter sensitivity analysis should be performed to assess the robustness of the obtained results.
