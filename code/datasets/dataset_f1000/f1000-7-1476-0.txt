The study by El Moshy et al. is well designed and investigates an important topic with potential clinical applications. However, there are a few issues that need to be addressed to improve the quality of the manuscript: Introduction and discussion sections are extremely short and do not cite enough literature on the topic. Discussion section besides being short is basically a repetition of some results without discussing technical aspects of the study and comparing it to previous similar studies. The quality of some of the images could be improved. The statistical analysis is not a true representation of the results and could be inaccurate. The effect of time is neglected in this case. Ideally a two way ANOVA should be used to illustrate the interaction between time and treatment. If no interaction was observed then the single main effects of time and/or treatment could be reported then. Using the post hoc analysis is not the best practice as it neglects the effect of time and will most likely lead to false-positive results. Some images for illustration of the techniques used in the materials and methods section would be helpful.
