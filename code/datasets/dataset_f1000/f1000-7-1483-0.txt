This is generally an interesting clinical vignette by these authors, especially the first case. We are of the opinion actually that the authors have enough literature base as well as the clinical materials of the first case to do this write-up simply as a case-based literature review of head injury/traumatic brain injury from projectiles from house-hold pressure cookers. The second case does not warrant any scientific report in our opinion, not by the near normal clinical acute-event / immediate post-event period status of the patient, as well as the very minimal body harm to the patient. Having said that, we like to make some of the observations below concerning the authors’ otherwise well-written paper. The figure 2, the plain 3-D reconstruction of the cranial CT bone windows, contains more information that just ‘the foreign body and its relation to the orbit’. There is the impression of a right naso-orbital fracture extending from the inferomedial orbital rim across the maxilla (just medial to the zygomasticofaical foramen) to the right nasal wall. One would expect all this to reflect in the authors’ case description (and the figure legend) by way of emphasis on the apparent destructive impact of the house-hold utensil turned projectile. Case 1 “A 55-year-old woman, with no known comorbidities, was cooking dal using a pressure….” What’s ‘dal’ please, for us international readers? “There was fracture involving the right frontal sinus with pneumocephalus and 11 cm sized left frontal contusion (Figure 3).” The figure 3 referred to here is a brain, not a bone, window of the cranial CT. The frontal sinus fracture being described could therefore hardly be appreciated. We had actually wondered why the authors did not render some of the images at this frontobasal level in the bone windows. That’s what would have been more instructive for this part of the work
