In this article the authors report two interesting cases of head injuries. One is due to accidental explosion of a man-made device and another one is due to a natural calamity. In the second case, it is interesting to note that hailstorm is a natural phenomenon, and there are number of incidences reported in news ranging from minor injuries to fatal incidences both to humans as well as to livestock.

This single case can be taken as message that we need to further expand the scope of the incidence and impact of injuries due to natural calamities on human life.
