This is a well presented systematic review of the published literature on operative and non-operative interventions for wrist osteoarthritis. It could be strengthened with inclusion of grey literature (eg. searches of clinicaltrials.gov). I am not sure that it was appropriate to carry out a meta-analysis of adverse outcomes, as these seem to have been defined differently between the studies.
