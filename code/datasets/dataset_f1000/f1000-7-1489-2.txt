The authors' provide reasonable responses and revisions for many of my past concerns. A remaining concern is that for both graphs of Fig 3 (Polygon class distribution in the EVL layer from 24 to 72 hpf), "No significant differences were found between stages". Because significance cannot be shown, statements about increased frequency of hexagonal cells from 24 to 72 hpf do not seem to be supported by the current data. The statements should be revised or more data should be collected.
