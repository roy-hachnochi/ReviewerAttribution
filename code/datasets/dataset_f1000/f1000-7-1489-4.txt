The manuscript by Sampedro et al. provides an interesting and useful contribution to epidermis development in the zebrafish. Cadherin adhesion is among the mechanisms that control epidermis development, and the authors contribute an initial description of cadherin adhesion molecule expression changes during epidermis maturation. The image analysis and cell shape changes observed will provide a starting point for additional studies. However, I have some concerns about the manuscript. The monoclonal antibody that the authors used to examine E-cadherin was raised to human E-cadherin cytoplasmic domain sequences. This antibody cross reacts with cadherins in various species and with cadherin types other than E-cadherin. E-cadherin is probably the most prevalent cadherin in the epidermis but this was not shown. If other cadherins are expressed, then this antibody is likely to detect those cadherins too. Flurorescence microscopy can be a useful way to measure protein expression, but several controls would be necessary to ensure that expression is being detected within the linear range of flurorescence detection. These controls were not evident, and expression was not validated with other approaches. The authors state that the prospective epidermis is established at 24 hpf, but this prospective structure is established at neurulation, which occurs significantly earlier. Overall, this is a useful contribution to our understanding of cadherin adhesion activity during epidermis development.
