This paper represents a thorough microscopic analysis of E-Cadh expression, as detected by immunostaining, during zebrafish development in the two layers of epidermal cells. Fig. 1: what does the white arrow in Fig. 1c point to? Also, weak detection in EBL cells is not so obvious at 18hpf, maybe another arrow (head) would be helpful. Fig. 2: Comparison of E-cadh levels between stages: how far can it be excluded that immunodetection by the antibodies may be systematically different at different stages, considering the important changes in the epidermal cells, especially between 31 and 48hpf (hatching)? This comment also applies to Fig. 4, where in addition the differences between stages are either non-significant or dismissed by the authors. Overall, this comment sheds some doubt onto the comparisons of intensities between stages, while the changes in topology (polygon classes) is more secure. I was wondering whether counting of the puncta adherens , independent of intensity, could be performed to further support the conclusions. Also, the weaker labelling of the deeper EBL layer would be further supported by performing immunodetection on sections.
