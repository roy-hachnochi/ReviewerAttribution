Ajayi et al. present an important technically sound in silico data about the genes that code for sHsp, Hsp40, Hsp70 and Hsp90 from Bos Taurus . It can be accepted as it is after considering the following minor suggestions: Authors are requested to justify the reason for restricting their analysis to only sHsp, Hsp40, Hsp70 and Hsp90. It is unclear why the searches for Hsp90 were unable to identify genes for GRP94. Authors can keep all the identified genes in Tables 1 to 4 in the supplementary figure. Authors are requested to briefly provide comments on the physico-chemical values for the Hsps from bovine in comparison to humans and mouse.
