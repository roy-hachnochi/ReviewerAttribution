In this study the authors have shown the use of urine in diagnostic ELISA at different time points and concluded that collection of urine in the morning gives maximum antigen concentration in Leishmania infected samples. However, the authors have not shown the ultimate advantage of their findings. There are considerable concerns necessary to be addressed before publication. Below are my point wise comments for the paper. The statistical difference between three different time points is not very high. If all the three time points are distinguishing active VL from controls then what is the advantage of selecting morning samples. Authors should include the reference for this. The sample size in this study is very low. Authors should justify the selection of 16 samples. Throughout in the manuscript the authors have stated the use of the test with VL and PKDL. However they have not studied PKDL samples. Selection of only VL subjects is not sufficient to explain any parameters related to the diagnosis. Therefore study with cured samples, and healthy and other diseases controls are also important. The papers published in the last two years related to the development of urine based diagnostic assays in VL can be counted on the fingertips. Why the authors do not want to give credit to those papers? In the Introduction and Discussion section there is serious absence of rationale related to the study such as in other infectious diseases what are the papers available with sample time point study and the result they have. Overall the outcome of the study with very few and selective samples are over conclusive.
