The authors have evaluated the leishmanial antigens in urine (as a non-invasive means) in primary and relapse VL as well as in cases of treatment failure, at different time points. Though the pilot study is interesting, it is very preliminary. There are few concerns regarding the manuscript. The sample size is too low. What is the sensitivity and specificity of the assay? Is it better than others reported so far? The authors may assay the PKDL samples as well. The authors mention the advantage of antigen detection in the urine of patients as in Leishmania /HIV co-infection. They need to complement their pilot study with few such co-infected cases. The authors also state the importance of antigen detection in urine (that reflects parasite load in the patient) over serum antibody response, as the later are detectable up to several years after cure. The authors need to validate this by including urine from cured patients in their assay. Minor concerns: The English language needs to be improved. For instance’ Although molecular methods, such as PCR, have shown to be effective in VL diagnosis.’
