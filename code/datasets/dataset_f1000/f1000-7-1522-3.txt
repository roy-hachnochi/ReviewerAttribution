In this manuscript Innes and Bader present scClustViz, an R package for interactive assessment and visualization of unsupervised clustering methods for scRNA-se data. The topic is very timely as unsupervised clustering is one of the most important applications of scRNA-seq. Nevertheless, it is a challenging problem and despite several different software tools being available, it is still not possible to fully automate the process. Thus, having a method to facilitate this analysis that can be run on the output of other clustering methods is potentially very useful. Major Comments: 1. Installing scClustViz was straightforward and easy. However, I then had some issues running it. Using a Seurat object from another project where we are analyzing the data, I got the following error: DE_for_scClustViz - clusterWiseDEtest(data_for_scClustViz,exponent=exp(1)) [1] “” [1] “” [1] “Calculating all DE stats for res.0.8” [1] “” [1] “Calculating cluster gene summary statistics” [1] “-- Gene detection rate per cluster --” |++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++| 100% elapsed = 01m 39s [1] “-- Mean detected gene expression per cluster --” |++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++| 100% elapsed = 01m 36s [1] “-- Mean gene expression per cluster --” |++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++| 100% elapsed = 01m 24s [1] “” [1] “Calculating DE vs tissue with 16 clusters” [1] “-- logGER calculations --” |++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++| 100% elapsed = 25m 39s [1] “-- Wilcoxon rank sum calculations --” |++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++| 100% elapsed = 11m 20s [1] “” [1] “Calculating marker DE with 120 combinations of clusters” | | 0 % ~calculating Error in intI(i, n = x@Dim[1], dn[[1]], give.dn = FALSE) : invalid character indexing It may be that there are some issues with the Seurat object that I used as input, but the unspecific nature of the error message makes it very hard to troubleshoot. I then tried to run it using an SingleCellExperiment object. Here, the instructions were less clear and it required some fiddling around before I came up with the following lines of code for preparing the dataset, the FACS sorted lung data from the Tabula Muris: logcounts(mySCE) - log2(counts(mySCE) + 1) clusterAssignments - grepl("^cell_type1",colnames(colData(mySCE))) mySCE - plotPCA(mySCE, return_SCE=T, draw_plot=F) mySCE - plotTSNE(mySCE, return_SCE=T, draw_plot=F) data_for_scClustViz - readFromManual(nge=logcounts(mySCE), md=colData(mySCE)[,!clusterAssignments], cl=as.character(colData(mySCE)[,clusterAssignments]), dr_clust=reducedDim(mySCE,"PCA"), dr_viz=reducedDim(mySCE,"tSNE")) DE_for_scClustViz - clusterWiseDEtest(data_for_scClustViz, # Stop once DE is lost between nearest neighbouring clusters testAll=FALSE, # Normalized data is in log2 space exponent=2, # Pseudocount of 1 was added to log-normalized data pseudocount=1, # False discovery rate threshold of 1% FDRthresh=0.01, # Use difference in detection rate to filter genes for testing threshType="dDR", # Genes with at least 15% detection rate difference will be tested dDRthresh=0.15 ) save(data_for_scClustViz,DE_for_scClustViz,file="for_scClustViz.RData") This allowed me to get the shiny interface started, but there were several error messages appearing (most frequently "object 'dr_viz' not found") and I was not able to explore the different functionalities that had been highlighted in the manuscript. This may have been due to the fact that there was only one clustering present in the SingleCellExperiment object. However, if this is the case, then I think that the error messages should be more informative and scClustViz ought to do a better job of handling this special case. Thus, I was unable to explore the different functionalities that were highlighted in the manuscript. 2. The multiple filters used by scClustViz is in general a good idea since it is not clear what is the best way of defining DE genes. However, filtering by changes in detection rate invalidates the multiple testing correction, genes could be filtered by expression level or detection rate but not difference in detection rate. The authors should comment on this complication Minor comments: 1. Figure 3A plot would be better presented as a grouped scatterplot since the number of values per box is small. 2. Figure 4 D colours in legend do not match colours in figure.
