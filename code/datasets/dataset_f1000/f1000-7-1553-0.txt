The manuscript describes the histological findings of the dental pulp and periodontal ligaments after intermittent administration of PTH (1-34) to induced osteoporotic male rats. I think the manuscript requires additional data to be acceptable. The followings are my comments: The title should include the word microarchitecture or histology to reflect the manuscript’s content. Data for ALP level or bone density measurement or ash value is required to confirm that osteoporosis was induced in all male rats. The results should include images from both Forteo treated group and saline treated group. Although it is stated that the dataset included images captured from each mouse in each group, I did not find any image from control group. The names of the images included the word "Forteo" and thus I assumed that all images are captured from the treated group only. In addition, figure 1 and the supplemented images should include arrows that describe different parts e.g. dentin, pulp, periodontal, different calcifications (intrapulpal, intraperiodontoal …etc). The discussion should include a possible explanation of why only 3 out of 9 rats developed ectopic calcification following PTH (1-34) intermittent injection and how the authors excluded the possibility of a prior existence of ectopic calcification. Did the treatment improve the microarchitecture of the mandible of all osteoporotic treated rats? (please see the additional citation 1 ) Results of the submitted manuscript should not be included as a reference (# 33).
