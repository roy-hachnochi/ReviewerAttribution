The article presents a small retrospective review of anesthetic management for postpartum tubal ligations. The article is well-written and organized. The data are presented clearly and concisely. The author outlines limitations of the study such as a small number of patients and generalizability. However, it adds to the current literature on PPTL and higher than expected neuraxial anesthesia failure rates. There are no identified predictors for success/failure of epidural reactivation; however, given the low numbers the study is underpowered to access predictors. The article discusses the clinical considerations for anesthetic management and the importance of completing these urgent PPTL procedures.
