 Abstract: The methodology of bias risk analysis and meta-analysis was lacking. If you have word limitation, you can reduce the abstract background. Is risk ratio correct or relative risk? I was confused. How radiographically did the pulpectomy prove worse? Methodology: Differentiate the primary outcome and the secondary outcome. Correct me if I am wrong, but the factors considered in the secondary outcome are those that will determine the primary outcome. The search is updated... Search is confusing and seems to be wrong. I did not understand why at # 22 you crossed # 18 (which would be terms related to 'prior vital teeth' and 'pulpotomy') or terms related to 'pulpectomy' (# 19 or # 20). The # 21 was not used at any intersection. I did not understand the purpose of # 24. If you want studies evaluating pulpotomy X pulpectomy, you should cross terms related to 'anterior teeth' and 'pulpotomy' and 'pulpectomy'. If you did not do this kind of crossover, some terms may have been selected wrong. Please review. The authors considered homogeneous until the value of i2? Results: Include the unclear symbols in figure 2. Remove the Howley study, since this is not considered in analysis in figure 3. Include a descriptive result for pathological radiolucency. What the studies concluded about this outcome? Conclusion: Only for clinical parameters, no? Pulpectomy presented more failures than pulpotomy for radiographic parameter.
