This study mentions about burden of CMV reactivation in KT patients who underwent transplantation. All patients had serology as D+/R+ and received ATG as induction. Since ATG is a highly immunosuppressive agent, the results of this study reveals CMV reactivation is common and other infectious complications also high. Medical expenses demonstrates different among CMV reactivation and without CMV group. As we know, cost of oral valganciclovir is expensive and need long period for prophylaxis. Preemptive treatment and frequent follow up might provide benefits in this patient group in Thailand that will provide cost saving for this situation.
