In this manuscript Chitasombat and Watcharananan conducted a study of the burden and cost of treatment for CMV reactivation/disease among CMV serostatus D+/R+ kidney transplant (KT) recipients who received antithymocyte globulin (ATG) in a single-center in Thailand, which has limited healthcare resources. The study has showed that due to high cost of valganciclovir, patients were not able to afford the medication for using as universal CMV prophylaxis post KT. Consequently, since ATG could increase risk of developing CMV reactivation/disease in KT recipients, patients required longer hospitalization resulting in more financial burden. The manuscript is well-written and well-organized. As mentioned by authors, generalization of the study is limited by a small sample size from a single-center setting. The result of 180-day inpatient cost post KT was not significant higher in CMV reactivation/disease group which could be due to a small sample size but we still could see the trend of higher financial burden among CMV reactivation/disease group. A prospective study with a larger sample size or even in multi-center setting is warranted since this could impact treatment approaches for KT patients in Thailand. If CMV prophylaxis or pre-emptive treatment could be done, it would be interesting to see what would be an outcome and how much would it be for the cost of a serial CMV PCR monitoring and outpatient visits in the setting.
