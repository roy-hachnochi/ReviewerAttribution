The Idea of research article "Healing capacity of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells versus platelet-rich fibrin in tibial bone defects of albino rats: an in vivo study" by Rady et al., is interesting and valuable as it is comparing two different ways for enhancing bone defect healing in vivo which could be a base for clinical application . Overall, the paper is clear, substantially easy to read and well constructed but still, there are suggested minor comments the authors could deal with, or at least discuss for additional impact. Methods It is worthy mentioning the number of rats per cage Further details for clarifying the methodology and aseptic conditions of BM-MSCs isolation from the femurs of donor rats will be a valuable add. It is recommended to mention how the depth of bone defect was controlled to be standard in all experiment induced defects . It is an add to mention the place of the lab where the BM-MSCs isolation procedures were done. You need to give further details about the size and methodology of BM-MScs and PRF pellet loading in the bone defect Results Fig. 3 need show monitoring of the positively stained calcified nodules as mentioned in the methodology Recommendations would be worth mentioning depending on the paper results
