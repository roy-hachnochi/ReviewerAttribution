This manuscript is focused on the application of supported stable peroxyl radicals for the photo-degradation of organic materials. In this work the authors systematically investigated the photochemistry of peroxyl radicals in carbon-supported silica (PCS) and then they evaluated the effects of PCS on the methylene blue photodegradation as a model for a generic organic effluent. The manuscript is clearly written with few errors (e.g. “N. Chen et al. ” and “Y. Chen et al. ” refer to the same reference article). However, the authors have extracted some interesting data that well supports the discussion and the appropriate conclusions. Furthermore, problems such as overpopulation and the lack of drinking water are unfortunately a plague that afflicts our entire planet. I encourage the authors to continue with their research, thus contributing to increase the impact of their study.
