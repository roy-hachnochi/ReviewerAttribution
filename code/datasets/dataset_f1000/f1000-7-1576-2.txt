This article describes a new R package, which allows easy plotting of discrete and continuous measurements onto human and mouse anatomy. This is a really valuable R package contribution, as it fills a real void in the current infrastructure. I found the code examples in the manuscript intuitive and easy to run. It is great that the author adopts the popular ggplot2 grammar as well as a tidy data structures. Minor comments: It would be useful to know how many tissues (and which) can be plotted using this package. An example of changing the order of the data frame to change the layering should be added. I encountered the following error when trying to install the package through neuroconductor: Error in latest_neuroc_release(release = "stable") : unused argument (release = "stable") Thank you for making all code (even for processing) publicly available.
