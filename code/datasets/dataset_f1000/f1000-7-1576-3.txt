The author describes an R package that displays discrete and continuous data onto anatomical structures. The structures are based on mouse and human anatograms from the Expression Atlas project and the grammar from ggplot2 R library. The code example was easy to run and the necessary input data was intuitive and simple. The author can increase its usage by providing a webtool (even one based on shiny) that takes as input a csv or tsv table with predefined columns. This would allow physicians and scientists with no background in bioinformatics to easily display their data. Also, it would be useful to create an anatogram for the human brain and one for the different compartments of a cell (nucleus, mitochondria, etc).
