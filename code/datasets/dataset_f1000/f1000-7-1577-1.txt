This paper investigates the potential of heterogeneous ensembles for protein function prediction by quantitatively comparing several classical base classifiers and ensembles on them. This investigative study is interesting, innovative and informative for future study on protein function prediction. This manuscript is clearly presented, well designed and organized. This investigation can be further improved in the following aspects: The used data are only Amino Acid sequences, will the results and conclusions be changed when other types of data are used and integrated? The heterogeneous ensembles are intended for heterogeneous data types. The considered GO terms (annotated to 200-300 proteins) are quite small, compared with the large GO terms space, more specific GO terms (annotated to 200 and =10 proteins) should be tested. PFP is an imbalanced function prediction problem. Smin is another more stringent evaluation metric in CAFA, and it refers to GO hierarchy when measuring the performance. This metric should be additionally used to quantify the performance of PFP. There are some classifier ensemble based PFP solutions omitted. They should be cited and acknowledged.
