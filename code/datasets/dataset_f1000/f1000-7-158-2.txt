This report look at Vanishing White Matter disease (VMD), part of the genetically inherited leukoencephalopathies, a rare group of neurological disorders, of which X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy is the most common (1/17,000). VMD is an autosomal recessive disorder characterised by progressive neurological impairment and white matter cystic degeneration. It generally presents in childhood but adult cases are well reported. Here a 30 year old woman reports a short duration of weakness, ataxia and primary infertility. An older sister also has VMD (there are siblings in total). In females there can be ovarian failure, which is a useful diagnostic feature, as is shown here (so it can be described as an ovarioleukodystrophy). The periventricular white matter shows the same signal intensity as CSF on FLAIR/T2 weighted imaging. Mutations occur in any of the 5 genes that code for translation initiation factor EIF2B ( EIF2B1 â€“ EIF2B5 ), here is EIF2B. Sometimes deterioration is triggered by physical or emotional trauma. This is a useful addition to the literature of a very rare group of conditions.
