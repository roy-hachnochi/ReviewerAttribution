Thank you for the opportunity to review this article. I have the following questions/suggestions for the consideration of the authors: The following important reference is missing from the article, please include: Rasmussen et al. (2016) 1 Authors should mention that Zika migrated not only to Brazil but to the Americas. What are the characteristics of the chosen hospital? Why only one hospital was chosen? Does the hospital has a good reliable birth defect registry? There is no description of the birth defects taken into account for the paper; which CZS-type birth defects were chosen form the hospital registry? Were the birth defects confirmed? Was any description available in medical records? Were X-rays available for review? I agree with the authors on the importance to have birth defects surveillance systems in place. I hope that this article will contribute to the awareness of public health authorities regarding this important issue. Birth defects surveillance is needed to identify Zika related defects. As the authors mention, the majority of infected pregnant women are asymptomatic. I think it will be important to differentiate in the article between Zika virus surveillance and birth defects surveillance, and the difficulties of implementing them in Africa.
