The authors have produced a paper speculating that African lineage Zika virus has the same capacity to cause congenital Zika syndrome (CZS) as more recent Asian/American outbreak isolates. This was accomplished by analyzing birth outcome reports from one hospital in West Africa and temporally linking outcomes consistent with CZS to seasonal patterns when mosquito populations would be abundant. The paper is well written and certainly addresses an outstanding question in the field. In sum, this article's major purpose is to create a discussion and provide a rationale for broader Zika surveillance activities in Africa, which I I believe has been accomplished, however, there are a few minor details that could be changed to facilitate understanding by the reader. I understand the need for security and thus not naming the hospital but would naming the country truly jeopardize security? While I agree that it is possible that African ZIKV has always had the capability of causing CZS and that it is likely underreported or unrecognized, an alternative explanation is that in Africa where ZIKV is endemic girls and women are exposed early in life and subsequent immunity provides protection against CZS during child bearing years. Is there any age distribution that can be associated with the outcomes presented here? Throughout comparisons are made to Malaria which is transmitted by Anopheles mosquitoes, whereas, ZIKV is likely transmitted by an Aedes species mosquito. Therefore, the same environmental factors may not drive transmission of both equally. Do the authors have any data on, for example, dengue cases that were reported at the same hospital during the study period? The data are from a country that is at "medium risk for a Zika outbreak". I believe it is more important to know what the estimated seroprevalence of Zika exposure is in this country. This suggests that perhaps Zika is not endemic in the country.
