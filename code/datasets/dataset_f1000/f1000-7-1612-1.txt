Antibiotic-resistant infections are a global threat, and novel antibiotic, as well as non-antibiotic approaches to deal with the problem of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), are urgently needed. In this pursuit, taking insights from traditional wisdom seems to be a logical effort. This particular research note describes an investigation of the prophylactic efficacy of a traditional Indian formulation - Panchgavya , and using the nematode worm model has demonstrated such a prophylactic effect to be there against some of the pathogenic bacteria. I appreciate that they have selected important pathogens like P. aeruginosa , and S. marcescens (Enterobacteriaceae). Despite Panchgavya being an ancient formulation, it seems to be under-investigated by modern-day scientists. Studies like this one attempting to validate the traditional medicine claims are welcome. As mentioned in the conclusion part by authors, they should take up in near future further characterization of this formulation. If such a standardized formulation can be made available for public use, it may help in reducing the overall infection burden of human populations. - The formulation concentration [OD 625 = 0.100.01], is it right? The authors may use w/v units for clarity. - Will there be any effect of different doses of Panchgavya? - There are many interesting questions that are yet to be addressed, most possibly by taking up this research further and analyzing the mechanism, bioactive component etc. - An independent experiment similar to MIC using a CFU-based method for each of the selected pathogens would have shed more light. - Differential behavior on Gram +ve bacteria is quite interesting and must be studied further.
