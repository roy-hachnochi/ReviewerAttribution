The present study describes an methodology that classifies schizophrenia patients from healthy controls. The study claims to demonstrate high classification accuracy. The study has significant relevance to the neuroscience community however I have following concerns: The functional significance of the brain regions involved needs to be elaborated so that their activation could be validated. The description of the role of obtained brain regions in schizophrenia patients and healthy individuals will indicate that the obtained regions are actually involved in schizophrenic patients and not a result of Type II error. It will be good to provide some details about the demographics, level of education, duration of disease, medication history of the participants in order to evaluate the role of these confounding factors in the obtained results. These factors might cause some variation in the fMRI signals and just wondering if any of these parameters were taken as covariate in the analysis. The fMRI signals obtained are task state and not resting state. These signals were obtained while doing oddball paradigm. So, I was wondering whether such classification would apply to schizophrenia patients only when they are doing this particular task, or it would apply to all schizophrenic patients irrespective of their state.
