Here author describes an interesting algorithm to identify the activated brain voxels affected in schizophrenia from time-series fMRI data. I think this is an interesting paper and a nice example which can be implemented in more severe cases of mental distress. However, I have few minor concerns: How did the author remove the effect of gender, I noticed that there are way more males in the data than females. I can see some voxels outside the brain and which are at the skull. I am not sure why did the author get those voxels and if the author made any effort to exclude those voxels?
