This case report report described success of partial pulpotomy with MTA-Angelus in irreversible pulpitis teeth of 8 years old child. However, the background of the caseâ€™s history, diagnostic tests, treatment given and outcomes were not described in sufficient detail. What kind of stimulus produce the pain in this patient? (cold water, sweet?) Was the pain lingering? What kind of pain killer did the child take? Did it help with the pain? Any sensibility tests (Cold or EPT test) was performed before treatment? These information will lead to the diagnosis of the tooth. The diagnosis should be consistent throughout (acute pulpitis vs irreversible pulpitis). The tooth should be diagnosed before prior to the treatment. What type of pulp exposure? Carious, mechanical? How big was the exposure type? How long did you control the bleeding? At three months, pulpal sensitivity test was the EPT test? Please specify. At 24 months, please be more specific of clinical and radiographic success. Please address in discussion The histology of irreversible pulpitis that allows the success of partial pulpotomy. MTA should not be described as a "perfect" dressing material. It has both desired properties and drawbacks. Besides, biocompatibility and sealing ability, other good biological properties (antibacterial, induce reparative dentin formation, less inflammation compared to calcium hydroxide, etc.) should also be described. Drawbacks should also be described (long setting time, discoloration, poor strength in early phase, etc). Why did you choose to use glass ionomer on top of MTA? There are several misspellings. carious not curious. blunderbuss not blunder-bus. biocompatibility not bio computability. MTA-Angelus not Angelos.
