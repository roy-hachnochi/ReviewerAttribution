Authors described in-silico methods to delineate the data which are particularly important due to high mutation rates by RNA viruses which can generate mutations, that enable them to evade the host immune system. Authors emphasized the structural stability of E protein, which is a key factor for antibody binding. The bioinformatic analysis of B cell epitopes of Zika is very important study in terms of developing effective vaccine and may be also in cross-protection against other similar viruses. In the present study, the authors extracted all of the available E protein sequences for Zika isolates obtained from 1968 to 2017 and constructed three-dimensional (3D) structures of E proteins from various Zika strains using homology modelling. Further the authors investigated the patterns and conservation of E protein B-cell epitopes and assessed their structural stability upon mutation. The authors did meticulous data analysis and discussed very thoroughly.
