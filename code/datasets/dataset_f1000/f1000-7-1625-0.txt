This is an interesting, well-structured study analyzing the risk factors for contracting diphtheria in Indonesian children. The article is well written but some improvements are needed before indexing: What were the criteria for defining cases of diphtheria? Only clinically or after bacteriological confirmation? Specify the age group 5-10 years: is it 5-10, or 10, or both (5)? In "Methods - statistical analysis", it must be stipulated that only the parameters giving a p 0.05 are entered in the logistic regression. The results obtained (cases better vaccinated than the controls and better nutritional status in the controls than in the cases) should lead to discuss more deeply the possibility of a weaker immune response among the cases and suggest a complementary study with dosage of post- vaccine antibodies. A source of contamination was found among the controls, not among the cases; it is in contradiction with the fact that among diphtheria cases, mobility in a region experiencing a recrudescence of diphtheria proves to be the main risk factor. Such discrepancy should be analysed in the discussion.
