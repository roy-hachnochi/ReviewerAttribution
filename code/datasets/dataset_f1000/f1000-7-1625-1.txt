This research article is very good. However, please complete the conclusion in the Abstract: Child/parent mobility (OR=8.456) is the main risk factor for diphtheria outbreak and the nutritional status of children and the source of transmission as well. The keywords, introduction, methods, results (including statistical analysis), discussion, conclusion and references are okay. Additional comments: 1. The study design is appropriate and the work is technically sound. 2. The method is quite detailed and analysis provided is absolutely perfect to allow replication by other researchers. 3. The statistical analysis is correct and its interpretation is also appropriate. 4. The conclusions drawn should be: the main risk factors for diphtheria outbreak are children mobility, source of transmission, and nutritional status. It is recommended to the parents to limit mobility of their children to areas that are experiencing increased cases of diphtheria and improve their childrensâ€™ nutritional status as well. It is recommended for further study to analyze the effectiveness of diphtheria vaccines since both study and control group have already got diphtheria vaccination.
