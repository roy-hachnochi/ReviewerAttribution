The CRISPR gene editing technology followed by next generation sequencing technology has brought up new means for high throughput genetic screening. However, a streamlined and systematic method for downstream data analysis is required to examine these high throughput screenings. In this work, the authors provide a pipeline for combining the analysis of a screen with network illustrations that facilitate the assay of this type of screens. The work is timely and applicable for a lot of related research. I am not an expert in bioinformatics. Therefore, I will provide several comments from the biological side. In a CRISPR-mediated high throughput genetic screening, people frequently apply several sgRNAs to target a single gene, which exhibit different knocking out efficiencies. In addition, these sgRNAs may target distinct isoforms of a gene, which may lead to different knocking out phenotypes. How the pipeline deals with these sophisticated cases requires elaboration. The author used one example, the alpha toxin resistance screen, to validate their method. The analysis of another independent screen is needed to test its validility. During the analysis of alpha-toxin screen, the authors conclude that the result is consistent with previous findings. This argument requires more detailed comparison with previous work. In addition, if possible, at least some of the new hits coming out of the work could be validated by wet lab experiments.
