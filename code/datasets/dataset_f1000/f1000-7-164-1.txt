Authors propose a retrospective study about the incidence of post operative atrial fibrillation (POAF) in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery in Malaysia. To do so, 637 medical records have been considered, including several confounding factors that could be determinant of the outcome. Results show that the incidence of POAF in Malaysis is similar to the European one. The paper is well written and factors are correctly described. Methods and statistics are appropriate. I only have some concerns: The paper is quite long and it could be considered to try to revise some parts. I would like to suggest the authors try to revise some paragraphs, discarding the less necessary and focusing on the more important information, in order to improve readability To strengthen the association with predictive factors of POAF it would be interesting to see also ROC curve showing the value of the area under the curve. That could result from the multivariate logistic regression analysis determined by including all factors resulting predictive for POAF. Some possible predictive factors, as the state of autonomic nervous system, as considered in the suggested works 1 , 2 , have not been taken into account and that should be added at least as limitation.
