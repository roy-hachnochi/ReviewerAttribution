Here are my comments: Findings of two surveys and a workshop First paragraph, first sentence - Who is “we”? The three authors of this paper? Second paragraph - The authors talked about a review of academic literature. Is this part of the survey or workshop? Perhaps this should be in the Introduction. Third paragraph – Suggest briefly stating the three main areas found in the survey. Fourth and fifth paragraph - Please tell us a little bit more about the third report and the workshop. What does this tell us? Does this refer to the findings of the two surveys and workshop? Paragraphs 2 and 3 – It is not clear what the objective of these paragraphs are. Do they summarise the barriers to data sharing? The reason I mentioned barriers is that in the Introduction, the authors said that this paper does two things – (1) to highlight the barriers to sharing research data and (2) the role research funders might play to improve this situation. If indeed they are barriers, are these barriers based on the two surveys and workshop or do they include research conducted by other groups? If the latter, I believe there are more barriers such as costs and ownership issues. Paragraph 2, first sentence. “Interviews with researchers”. Please provide reference(s). Did the authors conduct these interviews? What are the next steps: the role for funders in support of data sharing Paragraph 1 – “…there is very low compliance with these policies”. How did the authors get this information? Please provide references if appropriate. Paragraph 2 - “It appears the main barrier to sharing is not technical but cultural,…” How did the authors get this information? Please provide references if appropriate. Paragraph 4 – “There needs to be direct benefit….” This is a general statement. What is the funders’ specific role? Suggest including a “Conclusions” section.
