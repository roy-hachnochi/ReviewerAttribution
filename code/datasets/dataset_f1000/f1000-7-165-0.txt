The study is focused on question of relation of primary genomic sequences and H3K27 acetylation preferences. Original method, based on the translocation of the different CG% and CpG -based sequences to the same genomic locus, followed by H3K27ac analysis was employed. The results suggest that that the context is more important than GC or CpG properties of the genomic sequence itself. The results of certain interest for the wide pool of researcher working with epigenetic aspects. At the same time, I believe that involvement of more techniques, such as Chip-Seq would be suggested to confirm the results. Also, it is not clear from the text how many replicates were taken and how general is the conclusion, if, for example, different genomic loci (or different genome, for example extremely GC or AT-rich one) will be used.
