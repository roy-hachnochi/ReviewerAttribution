The manuscript "Metagenomic evaluation of a Utah tar sand microbiota suggests the predominant hydrocarbonoclastic role of Actinobacteria" describes the Utah sand microbiota using NGS and CLPP. Although the experiments are well-designed, the authors should boost the "Results and Discussion" section to create a more informative manuscript, exploring better the obtained results. Furthermore, some minor corrections are needed: Figure 1: There are four Acidobacteria groups (Gp16, Gp7, Gp6, and Gp4). What is the difference between these groups? Figure 1: Figure and data explanation through the text does not match the figure data. For example, the authors described that "The gram-positive Actinobacteria (50%) were dominant in the tar sand followed by Betaproteobacteria (27%), Alphaproteobacteria (7%), Gammaproteobacteria (7%) and Acidobacteria (2%)", but in the figure, Actinobacteria correspond to 48% and Betaproteobacteria 26%, while Alphaproteobacteria 8%. "Actinobacteria are known for their role in the biodegradation of a variety of different pollutants including petroleum hydrocarbons 18,19 .": The authors can explore better this statement, maybe they can describe scientific and commercial applications of Arthrobacter, Dietzia, Janibacter, Nocardioides, Microbacterium, Agrococcus and Salinibacterium.
