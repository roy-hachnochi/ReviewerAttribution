This manuscript documented microbial communities in Utah tar sand. The methods are well described and results are clearly presented. The performance of these communities to consume 31 different carbon sources was compared. Conceptually, I like the idea to compare the degradation rate of 31 different carbon sources using Utah tar sand indigenous microbial communities at micro plate. However, I believe the microbial community characterization, especially the high-throughput data, are not vigorously examined. I have a few minor concerns as follows. Major concerns: 1. As you mentioned in the Introduction part, the BIOLOG system excludes strict anaerobes and bacteria that lack certain electron transport enzymes. That means the indigenous microbes of Utah sand were selected after inoculation and cultivation at 96-well plates. Some of the Utah sand anaerobes and other microbes were inhibited. It is possible that those inhibited Utah sand anaerobes are efficient for the degradation of other recalcitrant compounds. 2. It is necessary to mention the primer pairs and the regions of the 16S rRNA genes, because it is essential to ensure full reproducibility by others. 3. All raw pyrosequencing data that was obtained from this study should be deposited to the NCBI Sequence Read Archive, and the accession no. should be provide in the method.
