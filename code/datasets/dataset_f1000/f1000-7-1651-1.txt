In general the concept of the KnetMaps BioJS component is very welcome. I like the functionality that the authors have developed (at least as described in the paper), but I think they could take it up a notch to use additional “visualization techniques to prevent information overload”, especially taking advantage of Cytoscape.js’s ability to group nodes via the compound node feature – this way, different types of nodes could be grouped (which might be useful for larger networks where things might become quite overloaded). Nodes and edges might receive some additional treatment. The authors write: “Developers can customize the stylesheet to replace the supported static cytoscapeJS shapes (such as triangle, round-rectangle, ellipse, pentagon and star) with images.” It would be nice to actually include a set of image-based icons for the different nodes in the KnetMaps release. Given the multiple types of nodes possible, perhaps a node icon that looks like a page with a few lines on it could symbolize publications, a node icon with an stylized alpha helix could represent the protein etc. I’d also explore using different kinds of edges (straight, curved, dashed) instead of a just a colour scheme. Sample.json did not seem to be in NPM (as described in the code in the article)? I tried getting KnetMaps to work within Codepen.io and unkpg.com/knetmaps/ but wasn’t quite able to. It would be nice to have this set up so readers could try out the package simply within a browser (by making the “pen” public and sharing the link in the F1000 article). It was almost working, except the JSON file (e.g. Arabidopsis flower network) couldn’t be loaded because of a MIME type error and even when I included the JSON object in the script it wasn’t working (see code here ). Another reason for providing a Codepen link is that there is no preview on the BioJS site.
