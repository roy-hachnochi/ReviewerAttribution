The work presented here addresses key topics in the biomedical research community at large, including reproducibility, team coding, installation-independent and error-free code environments. The main goal of the authors was to deliver public resources through published materials through modifiable and raw materials and source codes that can readily be leveraged by participants during and after the Bioconductor training. With this in mind, authors present a generalizable model for producing an open-source workshop in an efficient manner that includes a published work of contributed sessions/education materials that can be used beyond the conference, a guide to best practices in education, an installation-free environment for workshop participants with error-free code. Overall, this approach to creating workshops and educational materials is exemplary for the biomedical research community as it provides public, transparent, reproducible, and free solutions. Some minor suggestions that could be included: One practical aspect that could be reported is the specific number of editors that was used, particularly given the heavy work load of editors throughout this process. Do participants still have access to an AMI to avoid having to install everything themselves on their own after the workshops? There is a small typo in the second sentence of the Discussion “social contracts such a deadlines” should read “social contracts such as deadlines”. Under Future directions and challenges, the concept of using a Docker rather than the proprietary AMI is mentioned twice. Have authors collected feedback from workshop users, particularly regarding whether they are easily able to use material outside of the conference workshops?
