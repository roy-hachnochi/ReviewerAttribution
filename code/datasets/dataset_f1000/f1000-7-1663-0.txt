 INTRODUCTION In general, the introduction is relatively good but needs to be added by the results of research from Hosono et al 1989 1 and Wirawati et al., 2019 2 about micflora in dadih In the introduction, the author needs to explain in more detail the role of GABA produced by LAB and other organisms METHODS An explanation should be added as to why only to choose the DS15 strain producing GABA in this study. It is necessary to add the reference methods used in the 16S rRNA gene amplification analysis and electrophoresis process RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The results are well presented and discussed systematically because the authors used only one strain. REFERENCES The author needs to add references as a follow-up to suggestions for improvement in the introduction and method of this paper The strength of this paper The strength of study is the first research to report on GABA-producing LAB from dadih and local fermented milk products from Indonesia The weakness of this paper One of the weaknesses of this study is that the authors only used one LAB dadih isolate (strain DS15) so that no comparative data were produced and the discussion was relatively limited.
