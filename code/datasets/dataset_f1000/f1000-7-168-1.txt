In this review, Miniaci and De Leonibus present a concise and balanced overview of the egocentric-based spatial navigation. In the first part, the authors focus on the brain areas mainly involved in egocentric information processing, such as the posterior parietal cortex and the striatum. Then, they review a series of studies showing that the egocentric spatial abilities are impaired in developmental disorders like autism, as well as under pathological aging conditions, such as those of Alzheimer's disease. The authors provide a critical view of the summarized literature leaving also some important questions open. For example, they realize how little attention has been paid to the study of spatial processing in autism and associated brain activation patterns. Indeed, understanding the nature and the neuronal correlates of spatial processing in autism can shed light on the nature of cognitive and social deficits that characterize the autism spectrum disorder. In addition, neuropsychological screening designed to assess navigational deficit may represent an important tool for detecting the prodromal symptoms of amnestic mild cognitive impairment and early stage of Alzheimerâ€™s disease. Overall, the paper is well written and the figures are clearly presented. My recommendation to the authors is to improve the conclusions about the relevance of the egocentric spatial processing and its relationship with cognitive disorders.
