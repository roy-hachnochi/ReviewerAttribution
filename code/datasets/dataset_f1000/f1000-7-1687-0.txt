In my opinion the work outlined in this paper represents an interesting software prototype, but at this stage my impression is that this work is still very much in the ‘prototype’ phase and not yet ready for full publication. Developing a VR framework for visualizing PCA in 3d is extremely quick work using a tool like Unity, and does not represent a significant technical achievement per se . This paper feels to us like an interesting starting point for future research. For example, it would be good to see some examples of dataset visualisations which demonstrate cases where the VR really helped the end-user, e.g., in the form of measurable HCI type user studies, or perhaps through case study examples. We have inspected the code linked to in the GIT repository, and it appears to rely on standard Unity sphere prefabs. It would be good to understand how this framework would actually scale for visualizing massive data sets. Technically, it would be quite useful if the application could outsource the computation of the PCA data to another program – e.g., via a library or through a communication protocol such as protobufs. That would maximize the application’s interactivity, and it would mean that users need not precompute their PCA.
