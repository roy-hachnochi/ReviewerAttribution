This is an interesting case that merits publication as a case report. I think the diagnosis is sound based on the description and single photograph. However, ideally, one would like to see a low-power picture of the lesion and a representative photograph of the epithelial elements exhibiting lactational and hyperplastic changes. Also, the case is of interest because this lesion has a history of rapid growth - most likely induced by the pregnancy - a fact that should be stressed in the discussion to make radiologists and pathologists aware of the apparently alarming clinical evolution that may be encountered in PASH during the altered hormonal environment of pregnancy.
