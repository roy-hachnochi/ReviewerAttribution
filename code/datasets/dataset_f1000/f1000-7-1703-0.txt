The authors demonstrate that chlorohexidine (CHX)- and essential oil (EO)-containing mouth rinses induce cell death in fibroblasts in culture. They attempt to prove that this is through apoptosis, using qPCR to quantify the expression of Annexin V (Annexin-A5) in these cells. Unfortunately, this assay is flawed. Annexin V is a normally-expressed protein that happens to bind to phosphatidylserine, a phospholipid normally on the cytoplasmic leaflet of the plasma membrane. During apoptosis, this inner leaflet is exposed to the extracellular environment. Thus, Annexin V can be used to identify apoptotic cells fluorometrically. An increase in Annexin V transcript expression has not been linked with apoptosis. Furthermore, apoptosis is a post-translational event involving cytochromes, caspases and other proteins (e.g. BCL2 and BAX), and thus cannot be detected using a transcriptional assay like qPCR. Thus, the only finding of this manuscript is that these mouth rinses lead to cell death, which is neither novel nor worthy of independent indexing. The manuscript also contains numerous other errors (e.g. the photomicrographs in Figure 1 are of too little contrast to demonstrate anything, and are not even properly identified), and this is not yet ready for indexing.
