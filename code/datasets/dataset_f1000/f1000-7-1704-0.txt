 The isolated B. subtilis strain only has the capacity to degrade cellulose at high saline concentrations (1.25-1.5 M) and its xylanase activity is only developed at medium salt concentration (1 M). However, protease and amylase activity cannot be considered as halotolerant because these enzymes only have good activity at 0.25-0.5 M. In this sense, I believe the conclusion must be reoriented to point out these results. All the figures contain the same legend, please correct this issue.
