This paper aims: to measure chemical and antioxidant properties of L. casei -fermented mandai at different drying temperatures with constant time of drying at 18 hours. The results are then compared with spontaneously fermented mandai and dried at 50C for 18 hours. The paper proposed also to find the best drying temperature on starter induced fermented mandai powder; and to find correlations between phenolic contents and antioxidant activity on starter induced fermented mandai powder. The article is well written. Data is interpreted statistically. They are compared to literature data.
