It is very interesting research which has tried to explore the use of Mandai as industrial ingredient while maintaining its antioxidant activity. However, there are some suggestions and queries, which needs to be corrected along with grammatical errors. Abstract: Better, if is structured like introduction, aims and objectives, material and methods, results and conclusion. Methods: On page 3, it has been mentioned that cempedak was boiled two times at 100c for 5 minutes to remove sap and to soften its texture, then there might be a possibility that at this temperature of 100c, flavonoid and retinoid content be lost or decreased. The mandai storage temp, and the drying period of 18 hours, are selected but without proper referencing. Please add reference if any Extraction process: Here the liquid extract was dried at 50c for 16 hours. Please add reference if any. Methods: There should be a mentioning of temperatures. Nowhere, temperature of 45, 50 and 55c is mentioned, though the same is provided in the table. Results: The values mentioned on page no. 4 and in table 1 are not matching. The yield mentioned in table at 50 and 55c are approximately same, but in the text it is mentioned that there was a significant difference. There should be proper mentioning in text under result section whatever is shown in table 1. With increase of drying temperature, there is decrease in TPC, HTC and TFC. There might be a chance to get more flavonoid and retinoid content in further lowering temperatures. Antioxidant activity results/values shown on page 4 and in table 1 are not matching. In the text it is mentioned that higher TPC, HTC, TFC value means higher the antioxidant activity, but in table, as the temperature is increasing the values for TPC, HTC and TFC are decreasing, and antioxidant activity increasing.
