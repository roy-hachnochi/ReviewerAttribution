Thank you for the opportunity to review this manuscript. All comments and suggestions are meant to enhance the quality of this manuscript and future research by your group. It is apparent that a significant amount of time has been spent by the authors in the conception, data collection and authoring of this manuscript. Introduction: The introduction should include background information and set up the purpose of the study. While prostate cancer is important to know about as adults, it is not something that college-aged people know much about. This is because the only physicians that this age group has seen are most likely pediatricians. I do not have a clear understanding of what this study is attempting to accomplish. Methods/Results: Survey projects are tricky and rife with pitfalls. The most glaring issue is the very poor response rate. The results are based on a response rate of 0.3%. It is very difficult to accept the results as valid unless the response rate is 30%. The other issue with survey projects has to do with the questions asked. If the right questions are not asked in the right way, the results will be invalid. Additionally, if the questionnaire is not formally validated, then the results tend to change even if applied to the same group. This manuscript unfortunately suffers from these issues. Discussion: In the first paragraph of the discussion, the author is supposed to summarize the results. In the next 2-3 paragraphs, the author is charged with picking 1-2 important findings from the study and providing further commentary with comparisons to existing literature.
