In this paper, the authors describe the development of two powerful tools to aid in the implementation of Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) in the medical domain. The first tool, named DomainBuilder, combines knowledge authoring, case authoring and validation tasks into a single environment, whereas the second tool, TutorBuilder, allows users to select and customize different aspects of the design on an ITS, such as the user interface, pedagogic and feedback modules, etc. While the tools, as proposed, are clearly powerful and should be well received by the research community, there are some aspects of the paper that are less clear. For example, in several parts the authors claim that these tools are useful for “general medical ITS”, whereas in other parts they restrict the use of the tools to the domain of Pathology and their SlideTutor ITS. This dichotomy permeates the paper, and it is at times difficult to tell whether the authors are talking about DomainBuilder, TutorBuilder, or SlideTutor. For example, in a subheading reading “Operation”, it seems like the authors are discussing SlideTutor, not the other two systems. In addition, I would have encouraged the authors to include more “Results” in the appropriate section, as the responses to the questionnaire and the usability study are presented as an aside dataset. Finally, several projects (which have apparently benefited from the development of DomainBuilder and TutorBuilder) are named, such as ODIE and NOBLE, but the reader does not benefit from this information as no description is given of these projects.
