I am fully supportive of this article on the effects of hormone pregnancy tests as it stands. I have no substantive criticism of the content or methods. I am of course interested in why the regulator (MHRA) did not find comparable results but this is not a matter that should be addressed in this article. There is one extra point that this article may speak to which is that from some time it was thought that teratogens caused signature defects - such as the phocomelia of thalidomide. This may now be a minority position (I'm not sure of this point). The findings here do not support that point of view. I can understand if the authors may think that commenting on this point is a matter for others or for another article; I mention it for consideration. I have one very minor point about the layout which is that in the column where the numbers of women recruited to various studies is mentioned, the right justification of paragraphs leads to an odd spacing between 28 thousand and 671 - this doesn't apply when the page is resized.
