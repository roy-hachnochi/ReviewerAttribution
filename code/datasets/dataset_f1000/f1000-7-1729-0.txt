The article reports on optimisation of deodorization methods for the olein fraction of red palm oil by using vacuum evaporation and vacuum evaporation nitrogen- assisted. It is a piece of interesting work, the authors though are focused on the application of the above methods without giving the state of the art in deodorization methods applied so far and what are the advantages of the ones they are reporting. They should add something in the introduction. The conclusions must be rewritten and commented based on their results and efficiency of the methods. It seems that Nitrogen-assisted vacuum evaporation at 85 0C is slitghtly better in terms of b-carotene, tokopherol and all the other analytical data compared to solely vacuum evaporation at higher temperature, which is expected. Antioxidant activity of the final emulsion and content in b-carotene etc are not very encouraging in case of application. They should discuss it. The paper can be accepted after minor revision.
