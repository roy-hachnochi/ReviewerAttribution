The authors have developed high content image-based screening and tested a commercial library of 1,280 compounds, including FDA-approved drugs for antiviral activity against Chikungunya virus. The authors found the drug sofosbuvir to be effective against chikungunya virus and proposed it to be a promising candidate for repurposing. High content screening (HCS) assay developed seems to be of medium throughput due to the cumbersome steps involved. Since this homogeneous cell-based assay involves multiple step additions, therefore number of steps in assay could be minimized either by using reporter virus, labelled virus or fluorophore conjugated antibodies. The assay robustness should be further validated by calculating signal-to-noise ratio, CV, inter-plate, intra-plate and day to day variability. The assay performance should be consistent from day to day; ideally the assay signal should not vary with passage and cell density. The authors should attempt to further validate the activity of Sofosbuvir, using different assays. Further, in this study, the experiments are performed with a low MOI of 0.05, would Sofosbuvir be effective when cells are infected with higher MOI of virus? MOI of 1 and 10 should be evaluated too, though the authors pointed out about highly cytotopathic nature of the virus. As such, the CHIV titre is very high in human patients. Furthermore, from the figure 3 data (sofosburvir), it might be possible the drug has had a slight proliferative effect on the Huh-7 cells and may have slightly increased the SI (cell viability curve, proliferation may affect infection rates). Please provide evidence indicating that proliferation has not occurred. The authors should provide information about the remaining compounds that didnâ€™t work against Chikungunya virus in their assay. At least tabulate the name of compounds; reporting of which will be extremely useful in dissemination of important information among researchers.
