The article describe the optimization of a high throughput screening assay for CHIKV compounds and its validation using a commercial library of 12800 compounds. The assay was developed in Huh7 cells and the endpoint was detected using indirect immunofluorescence staining with CHIKV specific antibodies. The author showed that the assay is working and they confirmed that using a couple of known CHIKV inhibitors. However, there are some concerns regarding the used assay: The readout of this assay depends on IFAs which: i) require several steps of washing, fixation and staining and ii) are expensive compared to the ordinary colorimetric methods (e.g. MTS/PMS) because of the use of AlexaFlour antibody. Therefore, the use of this assay for high throughput screening would be time and money consuming. It will be more beneficial and technically sound to optimize high throughput assays using reporter CHIKV. This will eliminate the need for IFAs, which is the main drawback of this assay. It is not addressed clearly in the manuscript what is the added value of the developed assay over the already established CHIKV assays. Furthermore, the authors did not mention whether they found any new hits in the screened library (12800 compounds) using their developed assay. Were all the tested compounds inactive or there are some new hits? This part needs clarification.â€‹
