The review article has covered the problem statement, the need for the development of new vaccines and the newer vaccines in phase 2 and 3 very well. This article covers the newer platform i.e. mRNA and new viral vector hCMV for vaccine delivery. The authors have also elaborated on immune mechanisms stimulated in response to Mtb including HLA E, CD1a, antibody response in addition to MHC I and II responses. These mechanisms are targeted by newer vaccine candidates to generate an immune response in adults and adolescents. The review also covers the use of advanced assessment techniques, including transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics for identifying newer biomarkers for identifying active disease and can further be used to assess vaccine efficacy and safety. The article also highlights alternative routes of immunization and discusses BCG revaccination status. However, it would be helpful if the following points are discussed in the review: Role of DNA vaccines (Tian et al. , 2018 1 and Bruffaerts et al. , 2014 2 ). 231 subcultures in place of 230 subcultures over 13 years to develop BCG on page 7 (Norouzi et al. , 2012 3 ).
