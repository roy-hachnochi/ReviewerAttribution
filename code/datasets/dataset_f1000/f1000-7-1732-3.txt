This review article provides a comprehensive and detailed summary of a WHO consultation on TB vaccine development. It is well structured, clearly written and based on the presentations during the consultation. The article describes the need for new TB vaccines and provides an overview of the current clinical pipeline as well as considerations and modeling for anticipated impact. Subsequently, the different indications and populations that would benefit from new TB vaccines are described, notably BCG replacement and vaccines for adolescent and adult populations. An overview of new vaccine platforms, for example CMV, mRNA and whole cell vaccines, is provided. Then, the importance and usefulness of models for TB vaccine development, from rodents to controlled human challenge studies, is laid out. The final section provides perspectives from the main funders and other stakeholders in the field. Importantly, new developments, including clinical data on BCG revaccination and the M72/AS01E TB vaccine candidate have been incorporated to reflect the major recent advances in the field. This review is a comprehensive and useful reference for the current state of TB vaccine development.
