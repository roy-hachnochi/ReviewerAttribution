The authors describe the validation of an LC-MS/MS method for quantification of several steroids in amniotic fluid. The validation is not thorough enough to permit publication and in my view would benefit from extra work: Preparation of calibrators is sketchy, it appears that these were not made in protein based buffers. In my experience protein is needed in the buffer to stabilise the steroids and stop losses to plastic and glass surfaces. The LLOQ should be decided on a combination of precision (20% CV) and bias (20% from target values), the CV was similar for both LOD and LLOQ. Analyte recovery should have been performed in amniotic fluid. Precision was evaluated in three solutions, how were these solutions made? They should be a similar matrix to amniotic fluid, possibly protein based but not methanol solutions. How stable were the samples in amniotic fluid over hours and days? There is no attempt to investigate matrix effects. Only one internal standard is used with a different retention time to most of the steroids measured.
