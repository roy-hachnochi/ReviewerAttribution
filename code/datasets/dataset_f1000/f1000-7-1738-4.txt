This case report describes a patient who developed CSU refractory to 1 st and 2 nd line therapies. His CSU resolved promptly after treatment of the concurrent dental infection. This case illustrates importance of searching for underlying causes of CSU as part of routine clinical assessment. The authors state that routine infection screen is not recommended by the current guidelines, however the guidelines state: ‘The diagnosis is based primarily on the clinical history. Investigations are determined by the clinical history and presentation, but may not be necessary”. Although infection screen is not specifically mentioned, taking a thorough clinical history as suggested by the guidelines should include enquiry about possible infections and subsequent investigations might include an infection screen. One of the reasons why infections might be overlooked when assessing CSU, is that the past recommendations for routine screening for H. Pylori and its eradication failed to produce desired outcomes 1 . There are other examples in the literature where chronic infection has been linked with CSU, and one such example is HepC and HepB. However, a comprehensive review of the literature failed to find an obvious associations, and routine screening is not recommended 2 . In summary, this is well written article with a useful message, but discussion regarding the role of infection triggers in CSU should be more comprehensive and include the points mentioned above.
