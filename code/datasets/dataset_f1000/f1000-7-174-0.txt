In my view, this well written report adds clarification to an old problem of explaining the pathogenesis of glaucoma secondary to particulate material in the aqueous. The authorsâ€™ conclusions should direct additional attention to studying the biomechanics of meshwork functioning especially phagocytosis by the lining endothelial cells. The experimental methods are complex but make sense considering the challenges of the physiology being investigated. I have no major criticisms and suggest the paper be indexed as is.
