In this article the authors carried out TP53 sequencing in 50 esophageal cancers, from the Sudan population. Sequencing identified 40% of samples had a TP53 mutation, with the majority of mutations occurring in the core domain in exon 5. This finding is consistent with the literature. A higher rate of TP53 mutations was found in Ac compared to SCC, however the sample numbers of each cancer type very greatly in this study. Overall this is a well written article, with novel data on the Sudanese population, with some consistency with previous reports in other geographical locations. I would suggest including data on the incidence, prevalence and mortality rate of SCC and AC in Sudan in the introduction (GLOBOCAN, 2018).
