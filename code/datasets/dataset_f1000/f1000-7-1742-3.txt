This a fairly balanced presentation of a case report of a case of exertion-related rhabdomyolysis and its potential association with sickle cell trait (SCT). There is suggestive evidence for association of exertion-related rhabdomyolysis with SCT, but only with assumed prevalence of SCT in military personnel of self-identified African descent. There has never been a well-controlled analysis of this sickle cell risk, but it is strongly suspicious based on extensive circumstantial evidence. There also is an extensive history in the 1960's of stigma and discrimination involving SCT that is not well-appreciated in the current generation of biomedical personnel. The authors do a good job of presenting the issues involved in this case report with the exception of three points: At least half of the cases of exertional rhabdomyolysis do not involve SCT, and so SCT is not a complete explanation of risk. Universal precautions help to address this population outside of SCT. SCT is highly prevalent and the vast majority of SCT subjects never develop rhabdomyolysis, including in spin classes, and additional risk factors must contribute to these rare cases. There are inadequate data to base evidence-based recommendations and more research is needed in this area.
