This is an interesting and well-conducted study on density artefacts observed in molecular dynamics simulations that use multiple time-step integration algorithms to study liquid-liquid interfacial systems. The authors nicely show how depending on choices made for pairlist updates and thermostatting algorithms twin-range schemes can lead to severe density artefacts at (water-chloroform and water-cyclohexane) liquid-liquid interfaces. It is shown that these density artefacts cannot be remedied when widely used thermostats (WC, NH, NH-chain) are used that control the velocities globally. Do the density artefacts observed in these systems disappear when a standard, stochastic thermostat is used instead?
