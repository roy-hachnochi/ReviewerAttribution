The authors have conducted a systematic review assessing reports of adverse reactions attributed to DMSO. The topic is interesting, and the authors have conducted their searches in a reasonable way. However, there are several flaws in this manuscript that need to be addressed: Introduction The term “possible adverse reactions” is incorrect. Suspected adverse reactions is more reasonable Methods If Russian articles were screened by only one author, how were discrepancies resolved in these cases? Specify which authors extracted the data, and whether this was done independently. Results The term “possibly due” is incorrect. There are 4 levels in describing associations between medicines and suspected adverse reactions. The authors should revise their terminology. You state “in some studies patients discontinued treatments due to halitosis”; however, you have provided references for 5 studies – the report can be more precise. Discussion How does “including Russian studies” strengthen the review? What about several other languages that have been omitted? You state that there seems to be a dose-response relationship, and have drawn similar conclusions. However, at no point in the results do you report data to support this claim. You state that studies reported associations between dose and the occurrence of adverse reactions, but fail to report the doses in question. Please enumerate the limitations of your review.
