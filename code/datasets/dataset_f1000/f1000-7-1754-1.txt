Vaitaitis and Wagner have written an interesting opinion article regarding the shortcomings of mouse models of autoimmunity and their assessment of immunotherapies to delay disease progression in human clinical trials. Mouse models are instrumental in increasing our understanding of genetics and immune responses involved in disease pathogenesis. However, the identification of numerous interventions that can delay autoimmunity in mice are ineffective in humans. One potential scenario of the lack of success in translational studies may be due to opposite circadian clocks and sleep/wake phases in mice and humans. The authors provide an interesting opinion that is overlooked by immunologists and warrants attention in future studies. The opinion article is well written, but could be strengthened by providing examples of how some immunotherapies including anakinra and rituximab have shown to be efficacious in mice, but not in human clinical trials with respect to opposite circadian clocks.
