Vaitaitis and Wagner published this timely opinion article regarding an obvious overlook of the circadian control of immune cells and the unsatisfactory outcome of clinical trials. The authors rightly pointed out that most, if not all, immune-therapies for human autoimmune diseases have been based on animal model, especially mouse model, studies. The mouse has a completely opposite circadian rhythm to humans. This could be one of the reasons that many clinical trials of immune therapy cannot be faithfully translated to humans. Pre-clinical studies, if not specific for circadian research, are all carried out in the daytime, when the mouse normally sleeps, whereas clinical studies in humans are conducted in the daytime, which is the human waking phase. In addition to the difference in circadian regulation of immune cell functions, importantly, the circadian regulation of metabolism of immune cells needs to be taken into consideration in the interpretation of the “failed” immunotherapies in humans, which have had positive outcomes in mouse model studies. The authors have made a very important point in highlighting this major overlooked possibility for some of the discrepancies in efficacy of treating autoimmune diseases, such as type 1 diabetes, between the mouse and human studies.
