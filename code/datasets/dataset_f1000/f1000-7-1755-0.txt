The authors have begun to put their findings into context with prior studies in the literature using MinION and rRNA genes or operons. However, I disagree with their conclusions that the primers used for rRNA operon amplification need improvement rather than the choice of software and database. Specifically, Cusc et al. report that mock databases containing only those targets in the mock community can correctly assign OTUs using WIMP and MiniMap2 (Fig 3 and 4). While larger databases such as a rRNA operon database or the NCBI Refseq database incorrectly assign taxa (from 12-55% of reads). This may be true for the software they employed. However, other studies have used QIIME, BLASTN, Centrifuge, and Discontinuous MegaBLAST to identify OTUs for the MinION platform for 16S rRNA genes or ribosomal operons. I think an acknowledgement that these various software packages have also been employed to analyze the MinION reads in the scientific literature would benefit the F1000 readership. Especially since the authors indicate that our study (Kerkhof et al ., 2017 1 ) supports their findings which is incorrect. We actually found the databases which provided the most number of OTU calls for our raw reads were the NCBI 16S rRNA database (18K entries) and the ARB/Silva NR99 database (645K entries). The intermediate size databases (Greengenes and RDP) did not work as well using Discontinuous Megablast. I suspect the issue with incorrect OTU calling stems more from the software used to screen the database than from the primers or the size of the database being used. A brief discussion of variability resulting from different PCR amplification reagents and what might be considered a best practice for data analysis for future studies would be helpful. Other Specific Comments: Figure 3 has the calculated target gene concentration “Reference” on the right side of the heat map while Figure 4 has the “Reference” on the left side. This makes it hard for the reader to figure out what should be for the WIMP or MiniMap2 results as a basis for comparison. References 1.
