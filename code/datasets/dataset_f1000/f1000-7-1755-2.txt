The study compared the results of microbiota profiling using two different markers (16S rRNA and the rrn operon) and different classification methods. Because other reviewers have already made comprehensive reviews and comments including several critical points, I would like to add only a few minor points to the manuscript: Figure 2: according to the text, Actinomyces odontolyticus was detected using the 16S rRNA gene, however, '0' in the figure can create confusion. It would be better to represent the number of copies of Actinomyces odontolyticus using more decimal places or adding a caption for this species. Figure 3a: - It would be better to change the figure (e.g. heatmap) to make it easier for readers to recognize under-represented and over-represented bacteria. Listeria monocytogenes also seems under-represented in the analyses using the mock database and rrn database, and the corresponding sentence in Page 7 may be changed. - Include the classification method (WIMP, minimap2) along with the name of the database, as in figure 4, to allow general readers to more easily match the methods and the database. In the last paragraph of page 7, it seems that the criteria of the percentage of wrongly assigned species for the rrn operon are different from that for the 16S rRNA gene. Table 3: I suggest making a caption for the difference between 'Staphylococcus' and 'Other Staphylococcus'. If the authors would like to insist on better resolution by using the rrn operon, they need to demonstrate the data of the analysis using multiple species including species that tend to be under-represented or over-represented.
