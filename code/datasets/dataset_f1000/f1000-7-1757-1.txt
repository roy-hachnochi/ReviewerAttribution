I thank the authors very much for their reply to my comments. Although I have no doubts about the validity of the approach and the techniques used, I still believe the small sample size together with a high variability within this small sample size provides good pilot data for a bigger study, but as it is now it is not enough to publish. Response to Comment #1 : “This aim of this study was not a full-scale analytical validation of biomarkers, but as stated in the Introduction, to introduce chromosome conformation signatures as a measurement modality with the potential to be developed into a clinical biomarker in the field of Huntington’s disease.” Reviewer Comment to response #1 : If this is the case than this should clearly be reflected in the title. The title is now misleading. I am not stating that the methods are invalid, or not properly done, but I remain of the opinion that the sample size is too small, and the results are too variable to draw any conclusion. See Figure 3 and my previous comment #9. Reviewer Comment to response #2 : I still think the text should be changed to something like: “HD is a monogenic disease but there are many other genetic, environmental and unknown factors that can influence onset and progression of the disease”. Reviewer Comment to response #4 : Carini et al used 59 patients, Salter et al used 74 unblinded patient samples, Yan et al used 58 patients. Proof of concept of this analysis was done in these papers. However, if this analysis is useful as a tool to assess disease progression cannot be deducted from the data presented in this paper.
