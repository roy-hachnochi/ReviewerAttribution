This article presents a case of a dentigerous cyst in a rare case of Hunter's syndrome. Overall it is good. Some corrections are suggested here. Paragraph 1 Line 4 Add "Hunter’s syndrome clinically resembles other mucopolysaccharide disorders such as Hurler’s, San Filippo’s, Morquio’s, and Schere’s syndromes,which are autosomal recessive. Hunter’s syndrome is the exception being transmitted as an X-linked recessive disorder, thus mainly seen in males. Thus this does have a preference for males." 　 This is mentioned in the reference the authors quoted (number 7) 1 . Paragraph 1 Line 6: sex - as above comment. Paragraph 3: English needs rewording. I suggest the following: "An eight year old girl, born as a second child to healthy consanguineous parents, was diagnosed with Hunter's syndrome. She was referred to the Paediatric Dentistry Department, Cairo University in June 2017 with a chief complaint of a hard swelling related to the lower left posterior area of her mandible, that was easily felt on palpation." Paragraph 4 Line 2 should read: "first" not "fist" Paragraph 4 Line 3 should read: "The adjacent..." not "Adjacent.." Paragraph 5 Line 1 should read: "revealed a well defined..." Paragraph 5 Line 8 should read: "..lower permanent incisors were also noted (Figure 1)." Paragraph 6 Line 2 should read: "Examination of the aspirated.." Paragraph 6 Line 6 should read: "A list.." Paragraph 6 Line 8 should read: "keratinizing odontogentic tumour" not "Odontogentic keratocyst" according to Welbury et al 2 . Paragraph 6 Line 11 should read: "presentations"
