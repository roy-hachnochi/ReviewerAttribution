I appreciate your submission. This study is of interest to dentistry and medicine, to those who diagnose and treat paediatric patients with Hunter's syndrome. But, the manuscript should be revised and the author should provide the more detail data, to give useful clinical information to readers. So, I suggest the following revisions and advice before accepting it for indexing: How was Hunter's syndrome diagnosed in this patients? You should give more detailed data about patient's medical history. If patient's physical appearance and intra-oral views could be presented, your paper would be perfect. More information is needed on how to apply marsupialization. Bone removed? Or buccal bone resorbed? If the view of placed drain could be presented, your paper would be perfect. In these patients, orthodontic treatment may be needed to erupt the tooth after marsupialization. This should be added to the discussion section. Hunter's syndrome is a very serious disease affecting children. Aggressive surgery is usually not advocated for Hunter's syndrome. This study was to present that marsupialization could be the first choice treatment for dentigerous cyst in preadolescents. It should be useful article to oral maxillofacial surgeons and general dental practitioners, if the authors perform more research and revision. Thank you again for your submission.
