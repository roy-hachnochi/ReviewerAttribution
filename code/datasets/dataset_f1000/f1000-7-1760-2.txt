This report presented a case of an eight year-old girl diagnosed with Hunter’s syndrome. She had hard bony swelling on the buccal vestibule related to the unerupted lower left first permanent molar. Radiographically: there was a well-defined radiolucency surrounding the unerupted lower left first molar with radio-opaque margin. Marsupialization was performed and a drain was placed. Follow up was done. The case report is interesting however, I have some comments: Signs and symptoms of Hunter syndrome on the patient face weren’t mentioned. As well, there are no intra-oral and extra-oral clinical pictures. The part of cystic lining that has been removed during marsupialization should be taken as incision biopsy. So the final diagnosis should depend on the histo-pathologic examination The panoramic radiograph shows only very minimal movement of lower left 1 st molar. The eruption of the tooth and other permanent 1 st molars could be achieved if orthodontic treatment has been carried out after 3 months of marsupialization. Discussion does not mention if there are similar previous case reports of hunter syndrome with dentigerous cyst that was treated by marsupialization. The conclusion should reveal the effectiveness of marsupialization as a conservative method for treatment of dentigerous cyst with Hunter syndrome with evidenced bone deposition. However the written conclusion put first the necessity of follow up and oral hygiene which was not evaluated the case report!
