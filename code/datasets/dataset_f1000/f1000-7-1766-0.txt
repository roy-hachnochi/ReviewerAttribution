This is a very interesting study and raises very important point: optimal antibiotic therapy for CF exacerbations. As this is a major source of morbidity in CF patients and the introduction of antibiotics clearly improved outcomes in CF patients. I have several comments/points to make regarding this paper: What is the advantage of choosing a random sample as opposed to analysing all CF exacerbations? This is a retrospective study and larger sample would've increased the power. The authors enrolled CF patients from 2010-2016 and they mentioned that continuous infusion was introduced in 2013. They did not mention what percentage of patients received continuous infusion versus intermittent. It is unclear how the authors came to conclude that "the longer the duration of antibiotics, but slightly better the pulmonary function at the end of the treatment". p value for FEV1 change was 0.0049, however, the authors reported that this was not statistically significant.The raw data do not report that actual change in FEV1. Overall, it is understandable that the authors were unable to draw strong conclusions likely due to small sample size, however, further evaluation of the analysis maybe needed.
