I appreciate the changes made in this revision. Specifically, I am glad to see that the authors used the results for the mock community to set the parameters for detecting the presence of species in the other samples. Improved is also the inference of the relative abundances of species using bracken and the presentation of the BUSCO results. I have only minor suggestions that I hope will help further improving the manuscript. My only issue is the detection of the false positive ( Shigella flexneri ) for the mock community data set. I agree with the authors that this might likely be the result of misclassification of a small portion of reads. This, however, may also be the result of incorrect taxonomic profiles that may be present in the chosen (full NCBI nt) database. The evaluation of the effects of database taxonomic correctness and composition on species assignment accuracy is clearly not the scope of the present work. However, since the correct profiling of the mock community is crucial for selecting the best detection threshold for all other data sets, I suggest to strengthen the analysis of the mock community by comparing kracken/bracken results using different databases (only for the mock community): full NCBI nt vs. full bacterial RefSeq vs. curated genome database (i.e. including only the 20 genomes of the species forming the mock community). Minor points: In the abstract, add a line to describe the use of the mock community in your study. Figure 1: I would modify the box 'Classify reads (kraken2)' into 'Classify reads and estimate species abundances (kraken2 + bracken)'. p. 8: "The effect of the number of reads on Pielou's index is moderate". Please define 'moderate'. p. 10: Please move the formulas of the two indices to the Materials and Methods section. Other corrections: p. 6: M1 was mostly composed OF. p. 11: "..the performance in the full set and IN". p. 12: ".., depends on several factors such as THE number of species ..".
