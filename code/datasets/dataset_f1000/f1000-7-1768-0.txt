The objective of this study was to assess the ability of double antibiotic paste versus calcium hydroxide used as intra-canal medication in reducing postoperative pain. Post-operative pain is currently a relevant subject in the dental practice. Overall, the study was well written and designed. Additionally, it fits in a Randomized Control Trial, which increases the significance of the research. The results are well described, and no differences were observed between the groups; however, clinically, the antibiotic pastes present some disadvantages compared to calcium hydroxide. The sample size is adequate for this kind of research. I recommend the manuscript for indexing.
