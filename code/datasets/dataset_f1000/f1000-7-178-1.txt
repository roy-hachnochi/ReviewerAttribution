This paper by Estandian et al. will be greatly appreciated by Trabectome and other glaucoma angle-surgeons. The logic of the discussion is outstanding and the references inclusive. I was an early enthusiast of Trabectome and well-remember that the rationale for utilizing pilocarpine post-operatively was based on non-proven concepts and the then fuzzier understanding of angle physiology. Not utilizing pilocarpine after these surgeries will greatly simplify the whole follow-up with great benefit to patients. I have no significant revisions to suggest.
