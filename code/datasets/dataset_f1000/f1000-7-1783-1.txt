The authors have conducted a retrospective review of a large sample of patients undergoing VATS with surgeon placed extrapleural catheters. The study is well done and well reported. They found that most patients had mild pain only, and only 15% had severe pain, which diminished to 6% by day 3 â€“ suggesting good analgesic efficacy of the technique. I have no major problems with the methods of the paper, and it is well written. They did find a difference between VATS lobectomy compared to other VATS, but the authors have not offered any potential reason for this. It is possible that the surgeons place more intercostal catheters in lobectomy patients, which could increase stimulation beyond the analgesic boundary of the extrapleural catheter? Further in the VATS group, how many patients were included who had a pleurodesis? It is possible that the inflammation produced by pleurodesis could cause stimulation outside of the extrapleural block, and therefore requires additional pain relief.
