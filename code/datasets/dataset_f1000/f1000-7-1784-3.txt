This is a manuscript describing the refining of the key concepts which will ideally be used as a basis for developing interventions to help people discern between what are true and false healthcare claims. This manuscript describes the methods and rationale for revising the classification system of key concepts, and for revising the key concepts themselves. It also provides the "results": the revised list of key concepts with explanations and presentation format. This is very important work: the IHC Key Concepts have been the foundation of education interventions that are being actively tested and implemented in several countries in the world, across rich and poor settings. It is an international initiative to promote critical thinking and evidence-based health care. The manuscript describes excellent work, and it is written clearly and articulately. I have the following minor recommendations for improving the manuscript: The authors write that “adaption of the IHC Key Concepts to claims and decisions about other types of interventions (such as educational, economic and environmental interventions), has contributed to the changes we have made." However, the authors have not clarified how the changes were informed by considering other types of interventions. I suggest they provide a brief explanation. On page 3, the authors have written: “We initially obtained feedback from 29 members of an international advisory group”. I suggest they name the group in the manuscript, rather than only in the relevant reference. The conclusion of the Abstract could be stronger, by referring to the overall purpose and potential impact of the revised key concepts.
