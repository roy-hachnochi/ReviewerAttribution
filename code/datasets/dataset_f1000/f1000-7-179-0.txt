LeBrun and Kang compared two metagenomic functional gene datasets of the same microbial community, functional gene microarray and PICRUSt 16S rRNA sequencing data. PICRUSt detected a much higher gene diversity and abundance than the microarray. Some of that difference could be accounted for by group probes on the GeoChip microarray that cover two or more similar sequences, although PICRUSt offers a much larger database. The authors make a good point about the relative ease of expanding coverage by including additional genes for the PICRUSt method. Microarray require additional steps and manufacturing a new array compared to simply updating a database for PICRUSt. The methods used and the conclusions are sound. This paper can be indexed. Minor edit - The second Kim et al. reference in the methods section has an incorrect citation - I believe it should be 10 (or 15)
