The authors reported a parallel comparison on two most popular high-throughput technologies on environmental microbiota studies, 16S sequencing and GeoChip. Other than taxa aspect, they focused on the comparison of functional gene involving in P. Overall, the methods and results are sound that 16S sequencing detected more taxa involving in P since 417 KO could be predicted by PtCRUST rather than 3 KO in GeoChip. It is unsurprising because functional gene microarray can only pick up limited number of genes in each bio-process as marked functional traits, while the high-throughput sequencing can be much more open to uncultured and novel taxa in environments. Zhou et al. already mentioned this opinion in their review paper 1 as well. Thus, according to the policy of F1000, I think this paper can be indexed.
