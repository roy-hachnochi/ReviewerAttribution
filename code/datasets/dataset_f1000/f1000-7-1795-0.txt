 Introduction: There is a lack of information about the previously performed studies. The authors should clearly and briefly describe the existing studies, which have been done so far. Why did the authors perform this study? Which gaps was/were exist in the field of postoperative pain evaluation when diode lasers are used? What was the Null hypothesis? All should be described in the Introduction. The power analysis is adequate. Methods: Allocation concealment and sequence generation were described adequately. Results: Demographic and baseline characteristics (mean age, sex, education, etc) of the patients can be showed in one Table so that Table 1 and Table 2 can be removed. Discussion: In the Discussion, the second paragraph is unnecessary. It can be completely removed and can be add to the Introduction.
