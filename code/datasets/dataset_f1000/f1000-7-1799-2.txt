This is an interesting paper. Cumin has been shown to have potential anti-inflammatory effects in other papers, and I think you should do a proper literature review around this - you will need to incorporate this in both your background and discussion which are both focussed on cumin but not asthma. I am not sure why you chose aminophylline rather than a better bronchodilator such as salbutamol, and you will need to explain the limitation of looking at the trachea in an animal model, rather than being able to evaluate the small airways. Nonetheless, this is an interesting paper.
