The Acr protein is a chaperone that prevents misfolding of proteins in latent M. tuberculosis . Characterizing the precise molecular mechanism of action of Acr, however, remains a challenge. The authors, Krishan and Roy, have used a novel means of estimating the degree of oligomerization using polynomial graphs. The authors make two key observations: the coverage of the insulin B molecules is influenced by (a)the degree of Acr oligomerization and (b)the ratio of oligomers. This work lays the groundwork for further experiments in understanding the chaperoning activity of Acr at a molecular level.
