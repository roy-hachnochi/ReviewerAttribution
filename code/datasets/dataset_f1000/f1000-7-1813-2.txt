This manuscript demonstrates performance of the latest photoacoustic system from Canon Inc. The images are very impressive and definitely showcase the potential of photoacoustic imaging for clinical applications. Compared to the previous generation, major improvements in the current system include the use of a 1024-element transducer array (vs. 512 elements), implementation of dual wavelength imaging, a flat bed for limb imaging, and dynamic imaging of motion. Overall the manuscript is well written and the study is comprehensive. The study could be further improved in the following aspects: Please quantify the imaging depth in human. Calculation in phantom is not sufficient as the phantom composition could not precisely represent the optical attenuation of human tissue. Application of the system is unclear and needs to be clarified. The palm images could be used for biometric application as mentioned in a previous publication 1 . Could the system be miniaturized for that application? Foot imaging could be used for chronic ulcer assessment. However, most of those patients are immobile and the imaging pose may not be ideal for these patients. The authors suggested ICG imaging. For that application, photoacoustic imaging will compete with fluorescence imaging, such as the SPY system from Novadaq. What would be the pros and cons of PAI in comparison to a clinical fluorescence imaging system? Please indicate the magnitude of amplification in the data acquisition system. The original system from Dr. Kruger's group used a 128-element hemispherical array 2 . The system has been improved over years to 1024 elements. Is there a cut-off number, beyond which further increase in element number will not improve the image quality? After reconstruction, did the authors use any image processing techniques to enhance vascular structures?
