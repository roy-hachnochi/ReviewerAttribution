The present manuscript is a relatively extensive comment on a short original manuscript (brief communication) published in Thorax. The key finding of the paper by Recoquillon et al. 1 was a lack of effect of effective OSA treatment by mandibular advancement therapy on NT-proBNP. This finding is in the centre of the comment by Denis Monneret. From my point of view the result was far away from being statistically significant, and the observed (non-significant) difference may have been the result of chance. Therefore, I cannot fully follow the argument listed under “biological standpoint”. The key problem however is the fact that it is currently unknown what BNP and NT-proBNP reflect in patients with OSA. The literature on this issue has been summarized in detail by Maeder MT et al. in Clin Chim Acta (2016) 2 , and the overall summary is that the data is conflicting. No study has in detail evaluated whether NT-proBNP in OSA reflects cardiac dysfunction or whether NT-proBNP is mainly under the influence of obesity in OSA. Variable effects of CPAP on BNP and NT-proBNP in uncontrolled studies have been observed. In the present manuscript I would really like the author to mention these aspects. With regards to the statistical standpoint I fully agree that BNP and NT-proBNP always display a skewed distribution, and that this should have been taken into account. When using non-parametric tests, the result is even more unlikely to be statistically significant. With regards to the analytical standpoint I also agree: the use of an established easy to use NT-proBNP assay would have made it easier to check the plausibility of the data and to compare it with the existing literature.
