In this manuscript Bakr et al. gave promising evidence about the protocol employed in immunohistochemical analysis of various immunomarkers. This research provides brief information about the role of Toll-like receptors and their applications in clinical practice for diagnosis. I was curious to know about the sample size selected in the study - when I went through the criteria for selecting the sample size was found to be satisfactory. The introduction part of the article provides lots of information about the Toll-like receptorsâ€™ role in the field of endodontics. The authors highlighted the immunohistochemical analysis well in the manuscript. Minor comments: The introduction is too elaborate. I would appreciate it if the key points are focused on. Even though the sample size utilised is 8 for qualitative analysis out of 772 samples, this needs further explanation. The statistical analysis is not incorporated in the study to show the significance. Overall the authors have done excellent work. The authors have provided a brief insight about the Toll-like receptors and refractory periapical lesions. If the points raised above will be addressed, indexing is appropriate for this manuscript.
