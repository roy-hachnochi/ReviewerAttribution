The authors' response about association of animal contact and toxoplasmosis is not convincing. The following descriptions may help to this discussion: 1) Cat is the only animal as the definitive host for Toxoplasma gondii which can shed Toxoplasma oocysts becoming infective after a few days in environment; so this is the only animal species with possible association of its contact with toxoplasmosis. 2) Other animals like caw, buffalo, goats, and dogs may harbor the latent parasite (tissue cysts) inside their body tissues and cannot transmit to human or other animal by outer contact. 3) Even if this idea, possible association between these animal spp and Toxoplasma infection, could be proposed, the method of the present study is not suitable for this evaluation, as the study population contained only seropositive women, whereas no seronegative control groups with animal contacts were included in the study. So, the authors' aim to measure the association of these animal contact with toxoplasmosis is not basically scientific and the relevant data and discussion are not acceptable.
