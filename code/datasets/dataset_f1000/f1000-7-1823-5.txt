This article has studied toxoplasmosis, which is considered as one of the most common causes of abortion, stillbirth, intrauterine death, and congenital abnormalities. In addition, it’s a globally distributed disease. The paper is well designed and clearly written; the results were presented accurately and the conclusion is supported by study findings. In my opinion, it’s perfect and scientifically acceptable. However for further improvement of the article, the authors should revise the English grammar.
