Strength of the paper First case reported on duality between breast and prostate cancer in male. This finding may suggest a specific prostate surveillance or genetic screening for men prostatism symptoms or asymptomatic rise in PSA. Weakness of the research work Lack of genetic testing outcomes correlation to the clinical cases presented still a limitation of this study. Some studies suggest an evidence correlation between Hormone and symptomatic or asymptomatic prostate cancer! Unfortunately, the authors could not follow up and present the Hormones profiles before and after the Tamoxifen treatment and Prostate cancer diagnosis because of funding issues! This could be very informative to be discussed and need to be consider in their future work. In sum, these rare cases reported is an initial presentation of the duality between prostate to breast cancer in men! I recommend the paper for indexing as a clinical case report and Im looking forward to reading the next paper based on future work discussed in this paper.
