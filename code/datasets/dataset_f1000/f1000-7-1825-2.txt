Both breast cancer and prostate cancer are hormonal dependent and have genetic alteration in recent studies, This article is not perfect due to lack of genetic testing that is difficult to explain the co-incident of both cancer. Conclusion is quite long, author should rewrite. Conclusion has this sentence 'suggest that men with prostate cancer be screened clinically, biochemically and genetically for breast cancer and vice versa.' Maybe write 'only suggests that men with prostate cancer can be screened for breast cancer.' If possible summary of the case report in Table maybe more understand the natural history and treatment of this rare condition.
