It's an interesting observation. I think authors should mention BRCA Gene mutation's role in breast and prostate cancer. Why is the second patient on ADT if bone scan was negative? Details are important when discussing cancer: What was the breast pathology? Ductal or lobular? What were the patients' Gleason scores and PSAs? Which men would you screen for breast cancer since it is so rare - less than 1/100? Which genetic tests? Be clear with screening goals because you are talking about screening parameters because prostate cancer affects a massive population. Those are my thoughts to the author(s). It is an idea which needs refinements and more details regarding how and why we should carry their message into practice.
