 The article has few grammatical errors and needs better proof reading. Authors fail to mention other aetiological factors like the practice of “Taqaandan” in Middle Eastern countries. Authors have stated that involvement of both cavernosa is uncommon in penile fractures but have failed to mention the incidence in absolute numbers. The authors did not perform any radiological imaging study because of lack of resources. It implies that they would have preferred to perform some imaging procedure had the required resources been available. It would be interesting to know what imaging modality they would have preferred to use in such a clinical scenario. The authors state that absence of urethral bleeding and voiding difficulties was an indicator of uncompromised urethra. However, it would be prudent to reiterate that both of these factors are not reliable in ruling out associated urethral injuries as an overlying clot can mask the urethral disruption. Even a retrograde urethrogram can be falsely normal in such settings. A high degree of suspicion, complete exposure of corpus spongiosum and use of intra-operative manoeuvres like urethral injection of methylene blue have been advocated to detect occult urethral injuries. In discussion, authors have mentioned that there is no statistical difference in long-term outcomes of early versus delayed repair in patients without urethral involvement (Ref 14, 15). However, the quoted study by Naraynsingh et al (ref 14) is a case report, without any statistical analysis. In conclusion, authors have stated that imaging should be used to delineate the location and extent of the injury. However, as per both AUA and EAU guidelines, role of imaging is largely limited to unclear cases with equivocal findings or unreliable history (Ref below in citations).
