This is a good article and research work. It addresses the question of whether congenital colour vision deficiency (CCVD) affects the behavioural and emotional status of school children at the early ages. This is an especially important question to explore given that the current teaching and learning methods in primary schools utilize significant animated and graphically based materials. The researchers have chosen a comprehensive screening method which involved only mainstream education systems (public schools) and adopted standard questionnaires with translation (CBCL/4-18) to be given to parents. The authors have employed appropriate statistical tools for normality and non-parametric analysis. Matching processes between affected children with CCVD with control groups were well performed which allowed the researchers to analyse their background and economic status. For example, education background and household income for each group were compared to show the possibility of these two factors in the childrenâ€™s behavioural and emotional status. However, since the recruitment was done in schools around metropolitan areas with standardized teaching facilities, it would be difficult to conclude whether this result is applicable to school children with CCVD in the rural area. The discussions and conclusions highlighted that children with CCVD were within the normal range but showed significantly higher scores than children without CCVD, Externalising and Total Behavioural Problems. It is more important to note that students in this study came from public school systems with household income that represents borderline urban poverty line. Low awareness rate among parents of both affected and non-affected children is alarming and reasons for this should be highlighted in the article. It would be interesting to find out whether children from affluent backgrounds would have the same results as revealed in this research work.
