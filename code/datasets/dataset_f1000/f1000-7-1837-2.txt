The authors describe the InterMine Android app, which makes data available from InterMine applications on Android devices. Significantly, it is able to combine data from multiple data warehouses, and users can add their own InterMine instances to this list. The source code is GPL licensed and available on GitHub, and the source code as it was at the time of publication has also been archived. For this review, unfortunately I did not have access to an Android device, so I assume that the application functions as described. The app seems to contain a carefully chosen set of core features to enable quick searches, for example by gene or template, and presents combined search results in a streamlined user interface. It is also possible to access gene lists. The WebView feature to display visualisations should also be useful, although most likely the user experience here is harder to control by nature (owing to the different widgets that may be available in InterMine instances being accessed). I am curious as to how the app would behave if one queries different InterMine instances that have very different response times and displays the combined results. Hopefully, the app would display results incrementally as they are available, instead of waiting for the slowest instance to reply and then combining the results. The authors have also taken reasonable care to handle authentication details and transmitted information securely. In summary, the InterMine Android App should be useful for querying InterMine instances on the go from handheld devices, but also for combining data from different instances in a way that, as far as I know, has not been possible until now. I recommend acceptance of this report.
