This is, in principle, an interesting article on the effect of alcoholic bitters on male rat sexual hormones and fertility. The authors found an increase in the hormonal concentrations of FSH, LH and testosterone and conclude, that sexual desire and fertility have increased and improved, respectively. In this context, the antioxidant effect may indeed contribute to a better testicular function. However, for interpretation of changes in fertility evaluation of seminal parameters or – in this case even better –testicular biology is necessary. From the clinical experience we know that FSH and LH as well as testosterone can rise after stimulating treatment with antiestrogens, but normally elevated levels of FSH and LH indicate a testicular damage. As alcohol is not only toxic to the liver but also to the testis it is well imaginable that fertility has not improved but deteriorated. Therefore, the conclusion that administration of alcoholic bitters may be helpful for fertility problems is than questionable. Without providing data on semen variables and testicular biopsy before and after treatment the manuscript should not be indexed.
