This is an interesting manuscript containing new information on the potential of Litsea angulata. The paper is well written and provides valuable data. However, there are some suggestions to improve. 1. Introduction: Not only include the reason for exploring the potential of Litsea angulate, but also why should it be seen from each part of the material (bark, branch and leaves), is there any previous research that each part of the plant has different active ingredients? It should also be written the reasons for using Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus mutans. 2. Results: An increase of IC50 value in antioxidant activity written in succession leaves, ethanol; bark, ethanol; ethanol branch; branch, ethyl acetate; bark, ethyl acetate; branch, n hexane; leaves and bark, n hexane; it should be bark, ethyl acetate; leaves, ethanol; bark, ethanol; ethanol branch; bark, ethyl acetate; branch, ethyl acetate; bark, n hexane; leaves ethyl acetate; branch and leaves n hexane. In the written method there are several controls used, namely positive control, negative control, vehicle control and control machines, but in the results only positive controls are written, what are the other controls? 3. Discussion: Need clarification as to why ethanol can extract more active components such as tannin, carotenoid and coumarin compared to n hexane and ethyl acetate. Is there a relationship between antioxidant properties and antibacterial with component ingredients (phytochemical assessment results). 4. Conclusion: In conclusion section, only conclude about antioxidant activity and antibacterial activity. It should be mentioned also the conclusion of phytochemical assessment.
