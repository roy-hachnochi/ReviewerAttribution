The authors already addressed almost all reviewer commands, and overall the manuscript quality is improved significantly. However, there is one parameter that should be clarified: It is still confusing between Phagocytic activity (PA) and Phagocytic Index (PI). The unit for PA is percent (%) and the unit of PI is cells or particles/Phagocyte. I think, the authors observed PA, instead of PI as the unit is %. Please replace the PI to PA.
