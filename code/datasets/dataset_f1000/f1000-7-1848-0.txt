In this simple study, Roca and colleagues compare CPAP requirements in patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and rapid eye movement (REM) related OSA. Their conclusion is that both groups require similar therapeutic CPAP levels. Although the authors acknowledge that their study is underpowered and thus potentially unable to detect any statistical difference between the two groups (also considering the retrospective design), the main message of the manuscript results are too strong given such preliminary results. Therefore, I would suggest some adjusting in wording to put less emphasis on the clinical outcome of this work (i.e. in the abstract: “Individuals with REM might require similar CPAP pressures”; in the discussion: “Our results suggest that, REM OSA could be not different than NREM OSA for what concern CPAP needs ”). Furthermore, I have a number of other concerns: Su and colleagues found lower CPAP requirements following titration in a bigger, non-AHI matched population of REM-OSA vs OSA, 1 which would deserve a comment in the discussion. The very high REM AHI in the REM OSA group (was this high number driven by people with the shortest amount of REM?) could lead to an out-of-proportion increase of CPAP at the titration (especially if this was done automatically, see also next point) and consequently to higher average CPAP requirements for the whole group. Consider discuss this further as a potential bias for the results. How were the recommended CPAP levels obtained? After titration (and, if so, automatic CPAP or manual titration) or after follow-up? For OSA prevalence, much more recent estimates exist. A quote is missing at the end of the second paragraph. Define acronyms before using them (i.e. cwp).
