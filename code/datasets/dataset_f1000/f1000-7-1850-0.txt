The article summarises a feasibility study to include mindfulness activities to support maternal mental health in pregnancy, incorporating this into a pregnancy care programme in Sri Lanka. Please ensure clearer signposting of the literature reviewed (e.g. paragraph 1, column 2, page 3). More details of how the tool used was 'culturally adapted' would aid in replicability or would provide more information for healthcare providers to transfer this intervention to other cultural settings. The positive results suggest that continuing to test this intervention would be appropriate, but given the small sample size, caution should be used in transferring these findings to other settings.
