The work presents a cross sectional study of attitudes of Cambodian women regarding corporal punishment. A few criticisms: The question asked, when translated into English, combines both "hitting" and "beating" which, at least in the American South, considers different degrees of severity. It is unclear to me what behaviors the women considered to be acceptable. The risk factors identified reflect well known risk factors for physical discipline, and the ORs are quite modest. Many of these small distinctions are statically significant due to the large sample size. The reporting of the logistic regression is unclear. The methods section describes "bivariate logistic regression" which in the results section is titled "multivariate analysis." Logistic regression can be used for both bivariate and multivariate analysis but the interpretation of the resulting numbers is very different. The article should clarify how the analysis was performed. The second paragraph of the introduction has little relevance to the paper presented and should be omitted. A somewhat surprising statement: "It has been narrated that mothers are twice more likely to psychologically or physically abuse their children than fathers" is cited to Al Dosari (2017). Upon reviewing the cited paper it is not immediately clear that the citation supports the claim. The authors suggest that increasing female autonomy will decrease child physical abuse. While this may be true, it is inappropriate to infer causation in a cross-sectional survey such as this one. In summary this paper reports a secondary analysis of a significant effort to survey a representative sample of Cambodian women. The article is of limited significance, only because the results are strongly concordant with prior research. The paper could be improved with a better description of the multivariate analysis and a more focused hypothesis and conclusion.
