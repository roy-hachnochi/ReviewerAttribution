It seems very important to choose the subject of child abuse and research in this area; in this way, a few items seemed vague that needed correction: It's not better to look at social status or relationships with friends in relation to confounding factors. It also seems to be effective in child abuse. In Table 2, the authors noted that "media exposure" had a significant relationship with the child abuse. Please explain this clearly. The authors stated that "families with daughters/sons who died" supported beating the child - this is due to many factors regardless of the cause of the child's loss. Please explain the reason for this in the paper.
