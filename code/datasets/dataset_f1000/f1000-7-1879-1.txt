Kenyon and his coauthors explore whether self reported sexual "risk" taking on an aggregate level is associated with HIV prevalence. They present cogent arguments, supported by an extensive theoretical literature on sexual networks and propagation of STIs along such networks, why this is a valuable approach. I agree, but before reading their paper would have been pessimistic about the outcome because of the well-known misreporting of sexual behavior. That they nonetheless find some moderate to strong associations between (aggregated) self-reported risk behavior and HIV prevalence is not just a (methodological) justification of their approach but also (finally perhaps) a rationale for asking such behavior questions (in DHS and other surveys). The paper is well written with appropriate figures and tables. All potential weaknesses were - as far as I could tell - recognized, acknowledged, and addressed by the authors. As regards to the statistical methods: although alternative approaches were possible, their approach was not flawed, and the choice of methods seemed appropriate.
