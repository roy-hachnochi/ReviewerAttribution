I agree with the earlier comments by Ann Jolly, and am adding only a few minor additional comments here, meant for clarification. Legend of Figure 2: Please clarify or rephrase 'if one conditions on this variable.' Page 5, section(b), left column: 'generally high-quality longitudinal data on HIV prevalence around the world': I think these prevalence surveys are not really longitudinal (which commonly denotes cohort data, where a cohort of identified individuals is followed for incidence at individual-level), but rather periodic (in a similar population, but with some turnover of individuals). Please rephrase here - and in a similar instance later on in the article.
