This paper describes a pilot study of a questionnaire to assess the practice of health care providers' (namely oncologists') understanding and attitudes to fertility preservation in a local setting to consider its utility nationally. The authors describe the process of translation and verification of sense of the questionnaire and then its use in the clinical setting with a small group of oncologists. The process proved effective. The initial findings are of interest and the authors have raised a number of relevant points which confirm that rolling out nationally may indeed be informative. The authors see the trial as successful. They comment on the discussion around cultural questions. They have not discussed the comments around the "difficulty" of the questionnaire which more than one respondent made. Since the paper was designed to explore the utility of the questionnaire rather than the specific answers given by the oncologists it would be useful to see more discussion around those points and in particular whether or not they felt that any modification was needed before wider use in Indonesia. If so what and if not, given those comments, why not?
