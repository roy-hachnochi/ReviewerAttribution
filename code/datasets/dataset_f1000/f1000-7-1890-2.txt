In this study, the authors aimed to develop a standardized Indonesian questionnaire from already published English questionnaire that was successfully used to survey oncologists’ current knowledge, practice and attitudes in a Western country. The authors translated the questionnaire, and the content was validated through the process of back translation. In addition, the authors used the translated questionnaire to interview ten sub-specialists in Indonesia. The questionnaire worked well for that purpose. In summary, the translated questionnaire will be useful for future studies in the field of oncofertility in Indonesia and may be used for comparing the quality of health care providers’ knowledge, attitude, and practice regarding fertility preservation in patients with cancer in different countries.
