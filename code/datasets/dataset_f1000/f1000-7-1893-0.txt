The manuscript presents a bibliometric analysis on wearable health, which is based on co-words networks. To do that, authors employed SciMAT. In what follows, some comments and suggestion are listed. The English is very poor. The authors should make a great effort to improve it, and describe in a clear manner their finding. I don’t understand why there are duplicate documents in the database. There are more than 300 duplicates items, that seems too much. If the authors download the data correctly from Scopus, it is impossible to get duplicates. On the other hand, the number of documents listed in the document manager is equal to the number of records returned by the search? The methodology seems like a SciMAT tutorial. Authors do not need to describe every single step with the software. There are two section with the same label. In the strategic diagram, there are some themes that don’t make sense. For instance, Algorithm, review, etc. This broad theme should be marked as stop group in SciMAT, then redo the analysis. The organization of the results section is strange. First, the authors should describe the periods (each strategic diagram), and then the evolution map. The references section must be improved. Authors should add citations to the methodology employed, to co-words analysis, bibliographic networks, etc.
