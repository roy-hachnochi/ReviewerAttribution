The article by CK Mah et al. describes a new GenePattern Notebook "MethylationCNVAnalysis" which allows users of GenePattern platform to run copy number analysis (CNV) of Illumina Infinium DNA methylation arrays. The tool provides graphical user interface to the CNV analysis based on Bioconductor packages `minfi` and `conumee`. Such analysis can be with this tool performed even without programming experience or without functional R installation. Compared to analysis on the R command line, the user is asked to set only few parameters required for the analysis: set of test and control samples, gene list for detailed view, a black-list of regions excluded from the analysis and a coice to in-/exclude sex chromosomes. In my opinion it would be helpful to create a section with "Advanced settings" and allow also specification of few other parameters: `bin_minprobes` and `bin_minsize` for function `CNV.create_anno` from `conumee` package and parameters for segmentation of log2ratio (functions from `DNAcopy` package). In both cases the authors of `conumee` package warn, that they optimized parameters for 450k arrays and another array type might require further optimization (see http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/conumee/inst/doc/conumee.html ). Also in respect to general need for higher reproducibility of analyses, the tool should export short summary of software, their versions and parameters used for analysis.
