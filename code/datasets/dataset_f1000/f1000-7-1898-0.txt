This is a focused manuscript attempting to evaluate the effects of thread design on implant stability with an OD drill protocol in trabecular bone. It is a surprise that the OD protocol did not improve initial implant stability. Therefore, this is clinically relevant as it may influence providers to use the OD protocol for ridge expansion or sinus lifting, but not for densification. Studies like this are giving us information that may influence our clinical decisions in this regard. It is a simple, but very useful study that I hope will lead to a larger clinical study. Two small comments to consider: Consider the use of the animal model terminology "bovine" vs. "Cow". Consider adding a comment on clinical relevance to the discussion - for example, what clinical scenarios would be appropriate or not for the OD protocol.
