In this paper, the authors have reported about the influence of storage condition (5C and 25C) on nitrite, nitrate and ascorbic acid in vegetables. The topic has already been investigated, so, the originality is lacking. The references section is incomplete. Many papers dealing about this topic were not included. The results obtained in this study cannot be considered as reliable. Indeed, the analytical techniques adopted were not validated or compared to reference parameters. Moreover, they seem obsolete. This weakness is confirmed by evaluating the results obtained for both nitrite (many authors do not report quantifiable concentrations of nitrite in spinach and lettuce) and (specially) nitrate, since the NO3- concentrations in spinach and lettuce reported in the bibliography are well higher. The authors have not specified the number of samples analyzed and their characteristics (origin, type, etc.). Consequently the statistical analysis is not possible and the significance of these results is not high. In view of these criticisms, I regret to not recommend this paper for indexing.
