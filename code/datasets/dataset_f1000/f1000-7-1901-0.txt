The authors present a novel tool, ProbeSpec, to test specificity of probes against sequence databases. The tool is presented with enough detail and deserves indexing if the authors successfully address the following questions: The authors assert that ProbeSepc’s performance is superior than other similar tools in the “Use case” section. Only one recent publication was mentioned. Are there any additional publications recently with similar settings? Can the author provided more specific instructions for the reviewer to find where Krausfeldt mentioned their testing “took several days”? What is the most important improvement ProbeSpec has done to outperform other tools? Can the authors provide a breakdown of the running time of a typical ProbeSpec run to prove it? In “Probe specificity matching”, the authors proposed a new scheme for positional weights. The formula is very similar to a formula on page 35 of the supplement material from "Spatial and temporal variability in the nitrogen cyclers of hypereutrophic Lake Taihu 1 " (can be found here ). Why use w =1 as default, which is different from w =3 in the above reference. Eq. (3). It is strange to use b !=0, in which case the weighting function will not be symmetric. What is the rationale to assign different weight to the starting and ending bp? If not necessary, what is the point to introduce parameter b ? It is a little confusing to use both p and P , while there are plenty of other letters available.
