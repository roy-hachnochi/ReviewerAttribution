The author applied Expert System (ES) for rice plant disease and diagnosis; the background information and introduction is sufficient and well organized. The entire manuscript is also presented well. However, the author used the word “accuracy” which is not quite a scientific term. If “accuracy” is defined as sensitivity of the method, how about the specificity of the method? If a method has low specificity, it may not be able to solve the problem from false positive. For other comments, please see below: Page 1: Change “is the lack of knowledge of farmers on early symptoms…” to “is that farmers lack of knowledge of early symptoms…”. Page 1: “accuracy of 87.5%” accuracy is not a scientific terminology, do you refer to sensitivity or specificity? Page 3: change “… education, and business, including agriculture, problems” to “…education, business, and agriculture problems.” Page 3: please change to “Waterfall Paradigm was applied in designing this ES.” Page 5: “In this case test, the ES gave the accuracy of disease type detection of 91%”. Do you refer to sensitivity? Please also try to apply this comment to the other “accuracy” you mentioned in the manuscript.
