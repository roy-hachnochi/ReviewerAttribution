 Table 1: Socio-demographic… “Address” - what does it mean and what is its impact on the findings? Table 1: Xpert results (RR+VE)…I think it is Inclusion criteria, I will suggest to omit this from the table. Table 2: PTLF and P-Value…For the “Age less than 15 years” group, PTLF is 00, so how is the P-value 0.24? Table 2: It is confusable, Urban and Rural P-values for both, while Address P-values only once? Uniformity must be brought to the article and its format. Do the researchers want to prove that such defaulter is due to distance? There are no further reasons? The discussion needs to be improved. The conclusion seems like a general statement, it should be based on the study findings.
