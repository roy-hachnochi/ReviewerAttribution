The authors have addressed most of the comments. I would still suggest to include some illustrative results in the abstract. Further, the fourth conclusion (”Finally, introducing e-cigarettes should lead to a reduced risk of SRD.”), as previously mentioned, is not based on primary data and has to be acknowledged to be speculative at this stage, without using more rigorous modelling (e.g. see papers by Levy et al. or the models included in the NASEM report) to quantify this statement.
