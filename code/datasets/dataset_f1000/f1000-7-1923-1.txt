This is a thorough, thoughtful, and valuable contribution to the scientific literature on pathogenesis of hidradenitis suppurativa. The principal advances of the systematic review are: cogently advances a reasonable hypothesis to explain decreased levels of inflammatory marker density in some studies as due to the lack of treatment interruption; links the presence of certain hyperproliferative keratin markers (K19) to the presence of concomitant inflammation collates evidence from multiple studies demonstrating the presence of keratinocyte-derived pro-inflammatory biomarkers, reinforcing the concept that keratinocytes are actively contributing to the inflammatory milieu The authors advance the hypothesis that follicular occlusion is secondary to inflammation, based on: absence of evidence of follicular occlusion without inflammation (though absence of evidence is not equivalent to the evidence of absence) presence of inflammation in clinically normal perilesional skin (though inflammation could be spill-over from adjacent inflamed skin) analogies with other inflammatory skin diseases presence of K19 staining only in inflamed sinus tracts (though the relevance of this observation for the pathogenesis of HS is uncertain) In short, this hypothesis is plausible but the conclusion that "primary follicular occlusion as a pathogenic paradigm and the principal driver of HS is not consistent with the findings of this review" seems too sweeping a statement based on the information provided. The authors should consider altering this conclusion in line with the limitations of available data. As a minor issue, there is an unnecessary repetition in the second sentence of the Immunohistochemistry results, epidermis section: "Increased K6, K16 and K17 staining were increased..."
