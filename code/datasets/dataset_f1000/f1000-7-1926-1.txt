This paper does what it says on the tin: it is a report on the perspectives and ideas generated and captured at an invitation-only workshop. As such, it presents the discussions and themes explored within the workshop, and points toward individual white papers published elsewhere. The use of references is appropriate to the form of the report. The inclusion of a survey element, which makes the perspectives of university leaders visible within the narrative, is helpful, and adds depth to the discussion. I would have found the document more comfortable to read if it has acknowledged the North American and Anglophone perspectives that it captures; and the limitations that this may imply. Nonetheless, the report captures the energy, and the passion of the workshop participants; and points the way to important work that still needs to be done to ensure that the open knowledge potential of universities is realised. While I do not agree with every point made within the document, as an opinion article and a record of a series of discussions, I don't believe that it is necessary for me to do so. By making this document public via an open platform the authors are allowing for annotation and the continuation of conversations and collaborative knowledge building. I look forward to annotating the document itself and watching as differences in perspective continue to be negotiated by both the authors and a wider community as conversations about open affordances and the future of universities unfold.
