This is a long time needed review trying to shed light in the pathogenesis of hidradenitis suppurativa (HS). My concerns are coming from the biggest hurdle the authors had to overcome from the very beginning of their attempt i.e. the great heterogeneity of the existing evidence. Due to this, I find over-exaggerated the conducted approach to set-up a mechanistic interpretation for the disease. I believe that the heterogeneity is so vast that it is almost impossible to suggest the pathways implicated in the pathogenesis of HS. To this end, I suggest that the mechanistic parts are omitted and Figure 2 as well.
