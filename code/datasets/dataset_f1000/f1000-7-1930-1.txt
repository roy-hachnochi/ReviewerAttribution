This very instructive study aims at analyzing previous cytokine studies in HS patients, in skin tissue, blood, serum and exudates, to assess relevancy and reliability of these studies. The authors have performed an extensive work, methods seem perfectly appropriate. The authors are very critical and rigorous in their approach, looking for confounding factors, which is highly desired. The authors could also mention that genetic heterogeneity may play a role in the diversity of results and encourage using similar phenotypes for future studies. This analysis brings up a very important and honest contribution to the current knowledge in cytokines involved in HS and therefore deserves indexing.
