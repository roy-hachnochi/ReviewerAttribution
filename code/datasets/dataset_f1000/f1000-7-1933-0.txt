Most of the comments were addressed. I still have reservations about point #2 from my previous report - the authors just repeated that their approach fits the definition of a distance metric (which is true), but I think that many biologists would find it counter-intuitive that two genes with very different gene expression *patterns* over different tissues, but with the same mean expression value would be considered 'closer' than two genes that have the same "pattern" of gene expression across tissues but very different raw gene expression values. However, I now suggest that the authors consider writing a follow-up paper about this, rather than address this point within this manuscript.
