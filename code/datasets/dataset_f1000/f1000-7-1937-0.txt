This article presents the preliminary phytochemical screening, total phenolic content and ORAC activity of different extracts obtained from the inner bark of Tabebuia rosea and T. chrysantha . The goal of the article is to study if the antioxidant activity of ethyl acetate extracts is mediated by Nrf2 nuclear translocation and its induction of antioxidant response gene (NQO1). The methodology as the results are clearly presented with enough detail to allow replication by others. Both ethyl acetate extracts present similar total phenolic content, however T. rosea ORAC activity is almost twice T. chrysantha activity. Also both extracts showed a similar preliminary phytochemical screening, with a little difference; T. rosea showed a positive FeCl 3 test but a negative AlCl 3, otherwise T. chrysantha presented a negative FeCl 3 test but a positive AlCl 3 . Is this difference important? In the tests: Nrf2 activation and expression of NQO1, I think you should explain the purpose of using H 2 O 2 . Please find an annotated copy of the article here for further suggestions and comments.
