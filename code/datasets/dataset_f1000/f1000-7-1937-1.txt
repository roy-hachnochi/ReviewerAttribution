 Tabebuia is the largest genus of the Bignoniaceae family and several bioactive compounds such as: naphthoquinones; quinones and phenols have been extracted so far, due to the traditional use of numerous species of this genus. Very few studies have evaluated the anti-oxidant activity of extracts obtained from both T. rosea and T. chrysantha and only one study has evaluated the effect of T. impetiginosa extracts on Nrf-2 activation and translocation. The study from Garzo et al. describes for the first time the effect of the inner bark extracts from T. rosea and T. chrysantha on the Nrf-2-mediated antioxidant activity. The best antioxidant activity (evaluated using the ORAC Technique) was displayed by the ethyl acetate extracts from both species. This activity was clearly associated with the activation and translocation of Nrf-2 to the nucleus and the induction in the expression of the NQO1 gene in HepG2 cells. This study contributes to the knowledge on the biological activity of plants from the genus Tabebuia that have not been studied extensively and highlight its importance on the search of new molecules with antioxidant activity. Finally, the research paper is very clear and presents results of great expectation.
