This research has major defects: The authors measure the pain during root canal therapy, not postoperative pain. Postoperative pain measured after root canal obturation, not after intracanal medication. So they need to modify the title to be as the following: Intra-canal medication containing silver nanoparticle versus calcium hydroxide in reducing pain during endodontic treatment . There is a need to expand introduction to contain more information regarding endodontic pain and there is need to clarify the following statement: "However, the ability of calcium hydroxide medication to completely eradicate bacterial species from the root canal has been questioned". The authors compared silver nanoparticle and calcium hydroxide so there is no need to mention the following statement: "chlorhexidine intra-canal medicament significantly reduced postoperative pain more than calcium hydroxide medication, where at 4 hours, 20 of 100 patients in chlorhexidine group had no pain compared to only 4 of 100 patients in calcium hydroxide group, and at 24 hours, 44 of 100 patients in chlorhexidine group had no pain compared to 24 in calcium hydroxide group". The authors wrote in sample size it represents the Egyptian population, do you think 34 patients represent the Egyptian population? Is silver nanoparticles intracanal medicament formula which is used in this study eligible to use with patients and approved by the medical authority in Egypt?
