We would like to thank the authors for addressing our comments and incorporating them nicely in the new manuscript version. Additionally, they also added a lot more details and figures to many of the sections, which further clarify the approach and relevance of BED. We also really appreciate the added results and use case! We only have some small remarks that might be nice to address: Methods / Data model → deprecated identifiers are one of the challenges addressed by BED, but it is not discussed how those are represented in the data model. Methods / Available database instance → it would be nice to provide a DOI for the specific docker instance release. Results / Figure 6 → legend should now say “The red edge” instead of “The red arrow”. Results / Figure 7 → we believe legend for figure f should be “Conversion of 20,000 ​ Affymetrix probe ID into Ensembl mouse peptide ID”
