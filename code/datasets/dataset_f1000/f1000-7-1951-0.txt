 Is the work clearly and accurately presented and does it cite the current literature? Very limited references and a few dated references. Is the study design appropriate and is the work technically sound? This is a straight forward descriptive study using Chi-squared tests to determine significant differences. It would have been more informative if the author had included the derivation of the costs of the equipment and the tillage operation from the userâ€™s actual expenditure. Are sufficient details of methods and analysis provided to allow replication by others? The process of collecting data was sufficiently discussed although the determination of the sample size was not clearly explained. If the data collection was carried out by the researcher herself without any assistant, it must have taken a long time to get data from 380 respondents. Samples of 1 and 2 for Bontang North and Bontang South respectively was not justified. If applicable, is the statistical analysis and its interpretation appropriate? For a descriptive study to determine differences in usage of the machinery, the analysis is adequate. But for practical and policy decision purposes, the analysis may not provide sufficient evidence to help the relevant agencies to take the appropriate actions. Are all the source data underlying the results available to ensure full reproducibility? The author has clearly discussed the sources of data used in the study. Are the conclusions drawn adequately supported by the results? This is a simple descriptive study with straight forward conclusions. The analysis will be useful for further causal relationship analysis.
