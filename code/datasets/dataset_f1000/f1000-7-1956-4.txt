Chabbert and colleagues did intricate work to measure how erroneous gene annotations without careful curation can lead to errors in gene expression analysis. This is a recurring problem in analysis of gene expression that has recently started to be addressed. In this work, they used a mouse gene (ketohexokinase) as a model to analyze publicly available data employing current alignment-free approaches to transcript quantification. The authors bring a real problem to the table and presents a good alternative as to how to proceed before analysis. Thanks for the deep study on how isoform annotations can affect gene expression quantification. Comments – In Figure 2, is it possible to show the same coverage tracks and assayed tissues (2B vs 2C)? What does the R1 isoform look like in the spleen? Do the authors have any theories about why the software is misusing the retained intron information during quantification? Why might correcting 3’ UTRs fix the problem? Would manually curating the 3’ UTR for each isoform make a difference? Same question for the 5’ UTR. A lot of times, the difference in isoforms is in transcription start sites, which have been observed to relate to downstream transcript processing events including splicing and poly-A site selection. Do the authors have any theories about how to generalize this approach for studies about many genes? How do the annotations for Khk change between databases? Would a unified annotation set using data from beyond Ensembl improve isoform quantification?
