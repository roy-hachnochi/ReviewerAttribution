While there are many, often complex, tools available to manipulate pdb files, pdb-tools stands out as a light-weight set of command line tools for common use cases. The requirement for each tool to perform one task makes these tools easy to use in shell scripts and to combine into a pipeline for batch processing a set of PDB structures. On the software side, this is a well-designed open source tool kit available in GitHub that follows best software development practices, including documentation, checking for consistent coding style, high test coverage, using continuous integration, semantic versioning, and deployment on PyPi. A liberal open source license encourages community contributions. The modular design makes this project easy to maintain and expand compared to many of the legacy tools still in use. Recommendation: List all, not just a subset, of the available tools with an example on the documentation page. That way, a Google search will find those tools and examples are helpful for new users.
