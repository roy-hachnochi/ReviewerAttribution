In this work, Rodrigues et al, present to the readers a collection of python based tools to edit, convert and validate PDB files, in a very simple and efficient way. The authors clearly describe in the methods section the procedure used to implement the pdb-tools toolkit, and they even provide some simple use cases where the toolkit can be applied. I have installed the toolkit in my workstation and I did not have any kind of problem. I have tested several of the available functionalities and I have found it to be very useful and easy-to-use on day-to-day work (as the authors clearly state in the article). This type of contribution software is very useful for any scientist (with beginner or advanced skills) dealing with structure data in PDB format.
