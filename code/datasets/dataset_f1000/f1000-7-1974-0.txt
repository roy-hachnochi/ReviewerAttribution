The authors describe their experience with tutorial development in a collaborative event. These events bring together volunteer community participants, either locally or remotely, for a defined period of time to accomplish specific tasks. In this case, the motivation is to help develop and improve user facing documentation for existing software packages. This is an important problem since documentation writing is an undervalued but important part of building useful scientific software. Some suggestions to help improve the manuscript: Could you provide specific examples of materials developed during your collaborative events? Seeing outcomes would help motivate readers of the paper. Do you have specific approaches for identifying existing tutorials and datasets, and connecting with other communities doing similar work? One downside of time-bounded events is that it can be hard to have enough time to become familiar with previous work and finish tutorials in the time frame of the event. How do you help make it easier to get started, and ensure that work is in a completed state at the end of the event? How do you maintain documentation following the event? Is it integrated back into the projects? Do subsequent events follow up and continue the work? Out of date and obsolete documentation can be as problematic as absent or terse documentation. Strategies to help mitigate this problem and ensure the produced documentation evolves over time would be helpful. What are your strategies for motivating attendees to attend a documentation based event? It's always challenging to get researchers to write docs, so it might also be hard to convince people to devote dedicated time over multiple days for this. It would be worth mentioning and coordinating with Bnice Batut, who organizes similar events for the Galaxy Training Materials .
