This paper describes a method for very quickly comparing lists of sequence parts (e.g. from a similarity search) to PFAM families. It is extremely well described. I have a few typos and queries but these are very minor. The method looks useful and, as the authors point out, can be used as the basis for a variety of production or interactive tools. I have no major changes to request. Minor points: page 3. The word "regions" is mentioned twice. What is a region? page 4 "But in the other 2 cases we may also wish to". Wish to what? Also "We can calculate theb" page 5. The minimum of the three is used. Minimum time? "chunking"? Is this a word? page 3 "This overlap criterION is an important ..." page 6 "...identifying families from A sequence similarity search."
