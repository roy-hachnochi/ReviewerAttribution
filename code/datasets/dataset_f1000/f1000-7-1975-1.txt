This concise paper nicely describes a problem - how to rapidly compare the results of a database search to a set of protein families - and provides a solution via an efficient hashing algorithm. I have just a few suggestions. To me a title like "Rapid identification of novel protein families in the results of similarity searches" would better convey the content. As is, it reads as if the paper is more about innovations in the similarity searches themselves. The authors should cite UniProtKB in the Intro. Typo 'theb Jaccard containment'. Maybe a brief explanation of what hashing is - the paper rather assumes the reader knows what it means. Are the funny partial square brackets round i/w on p.5 correct? Maybe 'In Figure 4, the time taken for calculation of the...' Maybe on pg. 5 spell out what the consequences of under- or over-prediction of the two Jaccard measurements would be for placing database search results into the three categories defined at the star of Methods. On p. 5 the authors say that 'Increasing the value of w also reduces accuracy' Visually, that seems clear for n=64 but the differences for n=1, 4 or 16 are much less obvious. Maybe calculate Rsquared or some other statistical measure to quantify this tendency.
