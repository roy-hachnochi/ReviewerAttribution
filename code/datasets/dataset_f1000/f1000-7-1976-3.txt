Unfortunately, the manuscript is still lacking details about the added value it provides as compared to oro.* packages. The clarification that it provides "convenient extraction and exploration of image metadata", which, according to authors, "is not provided by existing tools", is not helpful. I do not understand what that statement actually means. Please include specific details how the functionality provided by Radtools is different from oro.*, and justify why that new functionality is important. The authors refer to the "tests" directory in the package source, but the datasets referenced are from a local Dropbox folder. Considering TCIA provides API for retrieving images, it would make more sense to include code that retrieves all of the tests. Also, it is not clear why the specific datasets were selected, how they are different, and what aspects of the implementation they are testing. About the updated title: "smooth" is equivalent to "convenient". Both are subjective qualifiers. I understand it was the authors intent to make extraction and navigation "more smooth" than available alternatives in their judgement, but whether this was successful or not will be up to the users of the package. I would drop the subjective qualifier, unless the manuscript includes specific objective criteria that would demonstrate it is "more smooth" or "more convenient" than the alternatives. Not sure how that would be demonstrated though - perhaps blinded user surveys?
