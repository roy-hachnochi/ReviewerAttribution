This manuscript reported the information of phytochemical and antioxidant activity of barks of Baccaurea macrocarpa . The results of evaluation on phytochemicals of barks of B. macrocarpa showed that the methanol extract consisted of alkaloids, steroids, triterpenoids, flavonoids and phenolic compounds. But the profile of GC-MS showed only fatty acids, fatty acid esters and methyl paraben. The authors should use LC-MS to investigate chemical constituents of methanol extract instead of GC-MS. Check the scientific name through the whole manuscript. When the scientific name appears first time in manuscript, it is full written both Genus and species, and then use the abbreviated binomial form for the following times. In methods section, Phytochemical evaluation of alkaloids: “H 2 SO 4 1M” must correct to “1M H 2 SO 4 ” In methods section, Phytochemical evaluation of alkaloids: Please correct your statement “The formation of orange on filter paper….” In methods section, Steroids and triterpenoids: “green or purple precipitation/red precipitation” must correct to “green or purple precipitate/red precipitate" In methods section, the details of GC and MS conditions must clearly clarify. In results section, the results should express your statistical analysis. In results section, Table 2: It is essential to set the concentration of sample for calibration range to less than 50% mortality and greater than 50% mortality, and the calibration curve is linear. The results should express your statistical analysis. In results section, Table 3: Check the data and calculation in Table 3. The results should express your statistical analysis. In results section, Table 4: Data of peak no. 13 does not complete. In discussion section, the data of GC-MS analysis (page 7) does not match the data in Table 4. In discussion section, correct the equation of DPPH and ArOH on page 7. In discussion section, correct “benzoate acid” to “benzoic acid”. To improve the quality of English, the authors must correct grammatical errors and English improvement throughout the manuscript.
