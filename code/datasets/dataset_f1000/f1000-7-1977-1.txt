I respectfully reject this manuscript as following reasons: This manuscript contains insufficient data although the authors tried to explain that this is a screening study. In addition to my previous comments I have following notifications: Table 2, the LC 50 value which is 1577.89 ppm was not in the concentration range (7.8 - 500 ppm) used in the study. Table 3, Inhibition should be rewritten. Table 3 , an IC 50 value (11.15 ppm) of bark was suspicious as the lowest concentration used was 20 ppm. There is some typing error of DPPH reaction as AOH supposed to be ArOH.
