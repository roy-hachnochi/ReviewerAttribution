According to the GC chromatogram the peak that was claimed to be methyl paraben was detected at 9.479 min but when identified with the MS the peak at 9.467 min was identified instead. This might be wrong interpretation. Why the peak with high intensity detected at 19.329 min of methyl palmitate was not considered as the major compound or whether it was contributed to the antioxidant effect? Due to there are many antioxidant mechanisms, therefore, only DPPH scavenging activity is not sufficient. Cytotoxicity result was not shown and sufficiently discussed in correlation with the antioxidant activity. The statistical analysis should be mentioned in the method section. Based on the insufficient information and evidence, this manuscript needs more experimentation and well written regarding the method, results and discussion.
