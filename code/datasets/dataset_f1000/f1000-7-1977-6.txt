The study design and the methodology sounds good. Still more details on the plant B. macrocarpa need to be included in the introduction. Even though the authors try to substantiate Methyl paraben as a non-toxic compound, it is a universally known fact usage of Methyl paraben is strongly discouraged in all human usage food and cosmetics as preservative. The Environmental Working Group (EWG) lists methylparaben as being a low to moderate Health Hazard. Parabens are potential endocrine disruptors due to their ability to mimic estrogen. Studies demonstrate that at sufficient concentrations, parabens can increase cell proliferation in human breast cancer MCF-7 cells, which are often used as a sensitive measure of estrogenic activity. Applying personal care product containing parabens—especially methylparaben—can lead to UV-induced damage of skin cells and disruption of cell proliferation (cell growth rate). These are evidenced reports on the Methyl paraben. Nevertheless, it is available in the natural source from the plant in meagre quantity. The authors can check for other compounds in GC-MS and state its importance in the manuscript. The GC-MS can be repeated. or HPLC can be performed using an aqueous extract. A simple TLC becomes handy for compound prediction, Then a column chromatography will be useful to check if there are any useful compounds. The authors fail to include the ill effects of Methyl paraben in the literature. Is there any reason for avoiding such inclusions? The authors should weigh the importance of other compounds in the plant. Is there any traditional/ancient usage of the fruit mentioned in literature must be included in Introduction section.
