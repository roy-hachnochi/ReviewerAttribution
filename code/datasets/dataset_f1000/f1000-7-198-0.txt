There are no negative comments to make on this manuscript. An anatomical variable of very rare occurrence is approached in this article. Osteochondroma is the most common of the benign bone tumours, occurring in approximately one percent of the population. Although rare, periodic changes in blood flow can also occur. Vascular compression, arterial thrombosis, aneurysm, pseudoaneurysm formation and venous thrombosis are common complications and lead to claudication, pain, acute ischemia, and signs of phlebitis, while nerve compression occurs in about 20% of patients. This case is of interest for the management of a patient with a family history of osteochondroma and/or circulatory disease. It is of great relevance to health professionals as well as specialists.
