The authors present a case report of a young female patient who had gradual growth of benign osteochondroma compromising blood supply to the lower extremity. This eventually lead to loss of limb despite multiple interventions to re-vascularize the lower extremity. The authors should provide more diagnostic imaging such as Doppler imaging(distal flow/ABI), and complete angiography of left lower extremity(pelvis to foot). This will help readers understand the vascular anatomy that the patient presented with. What triggered the acute occlusion of the popliteal artery? It appears that the patient had a year history of claudication without evidence of collateral circulation on the presented angiogram. Did the authors discuss a possible combined case of tumor resection and revascularization? The patient had a largely patent AT which could have been sufficient for LE survival or atleast planning of lower amputation if needed.
