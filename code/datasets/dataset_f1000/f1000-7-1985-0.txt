This is an excellent manuscript. The work is very well done and the conclusions drawn are well thought out. This manuscript will be well-sited from a scientific standpoint and the results are very translatable. Comments: In the Abstract -- 'Background' perhaps add bovine as in " ...binds to the CD18 receptor on bovine leukocytes, ..." followed by "Binding of Lkt to bovine CD18 results from an intact 22-amino acid signal peptide which remains uncleaved in all ruminant species." Although these are minor changes, they reflect the knowledge that this binding phenomenon is described specifically in cattle and is now inferred in other susceptible ruminant species based on the Lkt/SD18 signal peptide binding studies in cattle. A similar argument could also be applied to the beginning of the second paragraph of the Introduction. However, this paragraph is better in its logical progression. It is completely unclear as to why the whole-genome sequencing of the BL3 cell line was performed. Suggest removing that section from the MM.
