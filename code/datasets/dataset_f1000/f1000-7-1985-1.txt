The authors have presented a well written article describing a nicely designed and thorough set of experiments to determine if variants in the CD18 signal peptide gene ( ITGB2 ) effect Lkt binding in leukocytes. Lkt is a protein secreted by M. haemolytica that activates an inflammatory response leading to fibrinous bronchopneumonia in cattle. M. haemolytica is an important bacterial pathogen associated with bovine respiratory disease that causes the death of over one million cattle annually in the U.S. alone. This article provides a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in M. haemolytica infection that may lead to more effective means to prevent and treat this common disease in cattle. Suggested minor edits were very few: Page 3, line 1 of paragraph 1; insert “one of” after “Manheimia haemolytica is" Page 6, line 10 of paragraph 2; replace “at run” with “and run at” after (Thermo Fisher Scientific) Page 6, line 17 of paragraph 3; remove “in” after “times” Page 9, line 9 of paragraph 2; I am not sure I would agree that a conserved sequence with less than 20% identity is remarkable
