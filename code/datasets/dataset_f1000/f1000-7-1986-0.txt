Record of malaria cases was reviewed for the period of 2013-2017 retrospectively. Therefore the statement "a cross sectional study conducted between July - September" is confusing and need to be deleted. Descriptive analysis to compare the coverage and reported suspected and confirmed malaria cases either by microscopy or by RDT was performed. No any inferential statistics was performed to analyze the relation between outcome and impact indicators. Therefore, this line should be corrected. Authors did not mentioned the methods of surveillance for malaria screening in DHIS and MIS reporting system. As per our understanding DHIS is a passive and MIS is an active surveillance system. Patients with any ailments visited to the health facilities were reported in DHIS if they have febrile illness (Passive) and under MIS, specific field staff particularly engaged for malaria survey visited to the villages/households (door to door visit) for screening of suspected malaria cases (Active) and if it is true then analysis, discussion and conclusion should be revised accordingly. The previously published literature (Singh et al. 2016) 1 mentioned that less cases reported in passive surveillance as compared to active surveillance system. Population coverage during the reported period is not mentioned whereas API and ABER indices are dependent with population coverage. Table 1: Zero showed that there was no cases reported instead of no survey was conducted. It should be replaced with DASH or NA (information not available). Table 2: A separate column for population covered in DHIS and MIS districts should be mentioned for more detail understanding.
