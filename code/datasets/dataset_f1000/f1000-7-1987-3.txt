In the manuscript entitled “Research on Babesia: A bibliometric assessment of a neglected tick-borne parasite” the authors try to evaluate the previous bibliometric research regarding babesiosis in the world. It has recognized the value of this type of study because it helps to identify the importance of a country, institution or researcher in solving problems based on scientific evidence. Most of them describe bibliometrics in their papers considering bibliometric variables such as number of citations, author participation in research production, author and co-authorship analysis with VOSviewer 1 , the H-index, geographical distribution of that disease by countries, the amount and intensity of their international collaboration, analysis of that research based on the frequency of the words used in the title of the articles 2 , number of publications with intra-country collaboration, number of publications with inter-country collaboration 3 , 4 etc, and usually, the literature was retrieved using only one database (Scopus, Medline, etc) which may give the advantage to let them analyze this in depth. However, when the number of publications is normalized by population 1 , by gross domestic product, and by gross national income per capita 5 , health expenditure 6 , scientific collaboration 7 or other important variable (epidemiology variables such as prevalence, incidence 8 , endemic versus non-endemic, etc) it makes more relevant the study. On the other hand, it is known the capacity of databases such Scopus, Medline, Web of Science and Scielo, and the authors may decide to use only one giving more details to the analysis. In this case, considering that Babesiosis is a neglected disease, of importance in several countries as it has been described in the manuscript, so this topic deserve still more research, so I consider that this bibliometric analysis would be important for the scientific community. However, it would also be important to normalize the number of publications (including some of those variables mentioned above), include other bibliometric variables such as H-index.
