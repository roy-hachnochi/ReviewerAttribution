Title and content of this work do not fit together. What about the taxonomical issues stated at the end of the abstract? It is not discussed in the paper. For a review, it is not very comprehensive and does not focus on Latin America. The structure of the manuscript is not logical, starting with Rickettsia , continue with Ehrlichia , coming back to Rickettsia . There is too much content about the USA for a short review referring to Latin America. In the table, there are a number of tick-borne diseases which do not occur in Latin America E.g. Colorado tick fever, Heartland virus diseases or Powassan encephalitis. It is not acceptable to simply transfer data from USA to Latin America.
