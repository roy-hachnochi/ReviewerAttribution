The author presents an interesting model of a robust biochemical logarithmic switch with a broad dynamical range as a sum of multiple Hill-equation based models. My main problem with this work is the lack of a biological context with a real example (the author argues the model applies to natural as well as artificial circuits). Is the author proposing that the successive Hill-type switches would be arranged in series? A more natural example would be a layered cascade like a MAP kinase cascade 1 . But in that case the output would not be a simple linear sum as in the author’s Eqn. (1), but rather something like a Hill function of a Hill function. The contention that “My design performs (more) robustly with respect to broad fluctuations in parameters” should be established more rigorously. How were the stochastic simulations performed? It’s hard to tell since no methodological details are provided. “Menten” in Michaelis-Menten mis-spelt throughout manuscript (after Maud Menten: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maud_Menten )
