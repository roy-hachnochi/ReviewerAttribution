The authors have expressed membrane-anchored constructs of influenza, human and bacterial sialidases in cells and measured the effect on cell surface sialylated glycans. The study is preliminary but well executed as far as it goes. General comments: The manuscript does not include evaluation of influenza virus infection so the title is exaggerated. Maybe “Evaluation of potential defense strategy…”. would be less misleading. The Figure legends are very terse and a reader needs to make some guesses at what is being shown. For example, what are the boxes on the panels in Figures 3 and 4? The manuscript needs to be checked for spelling. “sialilation” appears several times and there are other errors such as S. typhimyrium on p.7. Specific comments: Abstract: I have not seen data that shows the H5N1 virus is increasingly infective for humans. Either reference this statement or modify it. Abstract and text: the increased activity seen with influenza neuraminidase is likely due to the construct being more native and better folded. The S. typhimurium sialidase itself has much higher activity than influenza NA. P.5: the Maakia amurensis lectins have been variable between suppliers and one form binds additional glycans, as has been discussed in several recent publications. More information is needed to be sure the lectin used has alpha2-3 specificity. P.5, first paragraph of Results. “The optimal sialic acids level on the cells surface”. I think this should refer to sialidase, not sialic acid. P.5 The influenza NA does indeed cleave alpha2-6 linked sialic acid but at 1/3 to 1/5 the rate of alpha2-3. P.5: while the assay to show reduction of cell surface sialic acids fits the goal of the project, it might be useful to carry out classical enzyme assays using the expressed sialidases to determine if the constructs used have similar activity to their wild type counterparts and if not, if they can be improved.
