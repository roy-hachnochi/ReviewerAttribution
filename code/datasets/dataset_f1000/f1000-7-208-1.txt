1. The premise of this study uses PfCRT K76T as a molecular maker of chloroquine resistance. However, a recent study from French Guiana in South America has shown that despite the presence of PfCRT K76T parasites can be sensitive to chloroquine (Pelleau et al . 2015, PNAS ). So stating that parasite population in Sudan are clinically resistance to CQ based only upon the status of position 76 is incorrect. The authors need to sequence full length pfcrt in order to draw that conclusion. 2. Overall the sample size is small and not very diverse. 3. Authors fail to cite key publications, as an example Fidock et al . 2000, Mol Cell . 4. First sentence, second paragraph in discussion is missing a citation. 5. The authors need to also elaborate of the prevalence of P. vivax in the area and whether reintroduction of CQ is for targeting this species and how this can impact the population structure of the P. falciparum.
