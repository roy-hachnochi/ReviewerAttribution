 The concept is old and methodology is well established, however geography specific information still has the relevance and the results of such studies have policy implications in the programme. In this context, the investigators should give elaborate justification for revisiting resistance pattern at molecular level by including the clinical experience of physicians or in-vitro drug sensitivity using CHQ across the country. As the studies of such nature have geographical relevance, the coverage should have been wide rather than limiting in a small area. As stated in the text, drug policy has been changed since 2004 and chloroquine is no longer in use, therefore sampling should have been from different areas of the country and detail description of the patientâ€™s therapeutic history, residential status and travel detail prior to infection should have been included. Investigator should elaborate on site selection, patient selection and randomization detail during sampling.
