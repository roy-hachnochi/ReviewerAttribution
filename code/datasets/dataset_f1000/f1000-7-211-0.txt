This brief article provides an analysis of MORT epigenetic silencing across 16 TCGA tumour types not previously reported by the authors enabling assessment across all TCGA tumour types. MORT silencing seems to be a key early event in carcinogenesis. This indicates that further studies of MORT biology are required as well as investigation of MORT methylation as a potential biomarker.
