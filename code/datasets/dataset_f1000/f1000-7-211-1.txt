STRENGTHS: The authors utilize the TCGA database to extend their previous studies on MORT that has been primarily characterized in breast cancer, but also observed to undergo silencing in 15 out of the 17 most common cancers. The current work takes this analysis deeper into the 33 TCGA cancer types and perform a more thorough analysis of the DNA methylation associated with the 16 cancer types evaluated here. SUGGESTIONS FOR IMPROVEMENT: -The authors make a bold statement that “the MORT gene is one of the most common epigenetic aberrations seen in human cancer”. This statement is not supported by the data presented. In order to make a statement of this level, the authors would have to provide comparisons to other documented genes that undergo a high frequency of epigenetic alteration. -This statement becomes more difficult to make when considering that several of the tumors present do not have normal counterparts for comparison. We therefore do not know if those tissue types whether the DNA methylation is abnormal or typical for the tissue type. -Authors should consider revising some of the scales on the graphs in Figure 1 to highlight the lack of methylation (for example, in testicular germ cell tumors). Similarly, the cutoff for methylation could be shown by a dotted line or similar feature. -The location of methylation relative to the MORT gene would be informative. Of the tumor types that are methylated, are the same regions methylated across types? -The authors should be cautious not to overstate their conclusions throughout the text since the conclusions are speculative without experiments to support their statements. Nevertheless, these correlations present interesting speculation and avenues for further investigations.
