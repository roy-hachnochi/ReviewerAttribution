The revision has greatly improved the clarity of the text and the revised version is much more understandable. I agree with the other reviewers that a performance comparison is necessary to demonstrate the utility of StatePaintR over existing methods. I missed this claim in my first review: " In direct comparisons, we found that our own annotations exhibited greater similarity to the combined analysis than to either of the Segway or ChromHMM tracks separately (not shown)." If true, this is a key result; the results must be shown (as a primary figure, not a supplement).
