Since the last review, I could only find a minute change in the text and no change in the figures. I found no clear reason for using StateHub-StatePaint tool by simply reading this paper. I am sure the authors must have spent lots of time developing the Bioconductor package, but a large portion of details are simply missing in the paper. I honestly don't think there is no systematic performance comparison (doesn't have to be exhaustive). There is no mathematical definition of the metrics used in the paper: What is the gold standard for the tests? What is the test statistics? How do you compute enrichment score? How do you estimate the confidence interval? Since the authors' claim for the paper is really about transparency and reproduciblity, these are too important to embedded in the stack of R codes. Moreover, I would emphasize on why rule-based methods are more transparent and reproducible, compared to other ML-based methods. Readers may disagree on the definition of transparency and reproducibility, but it is important to give them a chance to judge by themselves. It would also nice to have examples that clearly contrast between this method and other methods.
