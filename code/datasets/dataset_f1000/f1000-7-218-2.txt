The authors should revise the major comments below: Abstract: the problem in first paragraph was not accurate. The methods section: this should mention how sample size was done or based on which statistical formula? Also what was the method used for sample? The section of introduction: this should state the opposing and agreeing research and the gaps between this from the current literature. This needs to be stated to show how the study here differentiates from existing and accomplished works. The section of discussion was poor and the main results need to be supported by other research that agrees and disagrees with your results. This section should also mention researchersâ€™ point of view.
