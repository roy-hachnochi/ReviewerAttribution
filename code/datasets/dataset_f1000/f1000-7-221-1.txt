The manuscript by Capobianco Cerniglia investigates the selective mutism phenomenon in twins. The study is interesting and well written and it improves the knowledge about mutacic difficulties in children. I accept the paper with minor revision: The Authors in the Conclusion section of the manuscript should better clarify the modalities of intervention on the two twins interaction. A table with neuropsychological scores should be added to the manuscript to better clarify the patientâ€™s cognitive profile.
