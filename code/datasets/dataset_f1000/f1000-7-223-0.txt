This Case Report is of scientific interest and well written. A more detailed explanation of therapy would be appreciated. About the thermal printed palate plaque for instance: what material is it made of? Is it a mold or 3D printed? Is it placed immediately after surgery and left in place 24 hours a day? Is thermal plaque therapy a novel approach or are there any references about this kind of therapy?
