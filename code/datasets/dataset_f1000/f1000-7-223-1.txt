I believe the article is well structured and describes an interesting presentation of a rare benign condition. I must congratulate the authors on the quality and quantity of the photographic material. The case is really well documented with clinical pictures, histologic images and radiologic findings. I have personally treated a couple of these cases but often experienced short to medium term recurrence. The alternative treatment described by the authors (the use of a guiding plaque after removal) is interesting and seems to warrant better long term outcome.
