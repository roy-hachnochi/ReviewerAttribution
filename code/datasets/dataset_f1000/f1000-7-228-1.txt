Proteus syndome is a complex multi-organ mosaic disorder, characterized by progressive overgrowth and disfiguring. The authors did a nice job in describing the occurrence of such a multi-faceted condition in its (rare) minimal symptomatic presentation. To suspect and correctly diagnose a Proteus in view of (apparently) so few clues is indeed challenging. Since the repercussions are relevant (increased incidence of malignancies) the educational message conveyed here is an important one: never underestimate the importance and significance of a given set of signs and symptoms, as subtle as they may be.
