 This paper is recommending frozen section as a primary evaluation of salivary gland tumors, and it is considered out of date and unethical. Many salivary gland tumors share histologic features and have dintinct expression or molecular characteristics. Ancillary tests are occasionally necessary. Accurate diagnosis before operation, if possible, is needed for proper patient management. Core needle biopsy of the salivary gland tumors is recently substituting aspiration cytology. Authors need to comment the usefulness of such preoperative diagnostic procedures. Three exclusion criteria from selection seem irrelevant with diagnosis of salivary gland tumors. The distribution of tumors appear very biased even after exclusion. Mucoepidermoid carcinoma is the most common malignancy worldwide, while squamous cell carcinoma of salivary gland is rare. It is difficult to be convinced that most of lymphomas, and all small cell carcinomas and carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenomas were accurately diagnosed by frozen section. Illustrations or other back-up data are needed.
