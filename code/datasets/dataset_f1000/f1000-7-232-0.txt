As the title implies the article describes the method of microsatellite loci isolation from the DNA of two sea anemone species, which are not the model objects. The goal of the study is to bring some information about 41 microsatellite loci and corresponding primers for PCR than can be used for different species of sea anemones, which genomes have not been sequenced yet. It is reported that 13 of 41 microsatellite loci were polymorphic for the two species but possibly will be suitable for population genetic studies of other sea anemones. Much attention is given to the otimization of PCR conditions and this procedure is described in detail. In my opinion, this article is interesting and can be useful for scientists who deal with sea anemones or other representatives of Anthozoa because it includes elaborate technique for microsatellite loci isolation as well as prepared loci for microsatellite analysis. The manuscript is certainly worthy for publication.
