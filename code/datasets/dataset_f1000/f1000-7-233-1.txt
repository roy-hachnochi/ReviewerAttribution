The authors are absolutely correct that in the event of a radiological accident blood is likely to be the most likely source for analytical materials that would reflect a radiation exposure. Given the analytical approach taken we tested this using two sets of data from normal human lung epithelial cells (HBECs) irradiated at multiple doses by γ-rays but also with Fe particles such as those found in the deep space environment. (Reference 8 in this manuscript) We were interested in two things: 1) Would the results from lymphoid cells translate to epithelial cells? There is sufficient evidence in the literature to suggest signatures created with lymphoid cells are poor at predicting radio response in cells from tissue. 2) Would the results from γ-ray exposures translate to something more exotic like Fe particles which have discriminating gene sets that are both common to γ-ray and Fe particles as well as unique to the radiation type. We chose the 10 gene signature derived from GSE6874 and validated against GSE10640. Given the limited size of our sample set, we were surprised to see Prediction Accuracies of 73% for γ-rays and 83% for Fe particle irradiation when examining the normal HBEC cells; and 85 and 76%, respectively, for a genetically manipulated HBEC (p53 knockdown, KRAS mutant over-expressing) cell line. We look forward to testing this approach in genetically diverse tumor cells.
