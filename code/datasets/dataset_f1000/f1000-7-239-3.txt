The Authors have discussed an interesting case of fulminant myocarditis in a child which have been managed with transcutaneous pacing for the third degree AV block along with other supportive care including intravenous methylprednisolone and immunoglobulin. In overall the article is at satisfactory level in its scientific contents and usefulness to other practitioners. But there is some space to improve its rating. The background information provided here is an overall information, it would have been better if the author has also focused on various arrhythmias associated with fulminant myocarditis as the myocarditis tends to have various refractory arrhythmias including ventricular tachycardia. 1 It would have been better if the authors were focused on particular theme, such as on various arrhythmias and their medical management or overall medical management. The case description is somehow lacking smoothness in the flow of information. That could be because lack of cohesion in sentences and writing in the form of clinical vignette can improve its content. Similarly there are a lot of English grammar related errors and rampant use of short form that should be corrected. In addition, it is advised to use scientific words rather than layman terms in academic writings. Taking help from an English language expert might also improve its contents. The case report section should be made little bit short. The discussion section should be more descriptive by discussing clinical features of myocarditis including various arrhythmias and medical management of myocarditis. The use of Vitamin C, Coenzyme Q10, Fructose diphosphate and Mannitol can not be understood from the discussion section which I was expecting there. I hope, the revision after considering above advice will improve the scientific content of the article.
