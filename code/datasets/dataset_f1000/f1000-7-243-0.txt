I am satisfied with the revision. Many errors and inconsistencies have been corrected. The narrative qualities have improved. The way forward is helpful. Including the non-specific effects of vaccines as potential AEFIs is important. In general the fact-boxes are easier to understand and helpful now. I did not understand in Box 6 how we came from the 13 fatal cases reported in Appendix 5A to the 42 deaths said to have occurred in the first 3 days.
