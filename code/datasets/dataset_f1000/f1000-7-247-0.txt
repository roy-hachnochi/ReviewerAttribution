Thank you for the opportunity to review the manuscript entitled “Features of the waterpipe tobacco industry: A qualitative study of the third International Hookah Fair ”. This is a well-written and interesting topic that can help policymakers to curb waterpipe epidemic. The manuscript conceptual framework is particularly new since not many research has been conducted on a constructive paradigm (qualitative methodology). This manuscript has been peer-reviewed by other two collogues who are expert in the waterpipe tobacco field. Hence, I think the manuscript has improved tremendously. I have a few minor comments as follows: 1. First Paragraph in the results section: " Most interviews lasted less than ten minutes, and the longest lasted over an hour". This part needs more clarification. I suggest having percentages/ or numbers representing the interview time. For example ?% (less than 10min) and ... 2. Usually in the fairs like "International Hookah Fair," some representatives had waterpipe with charcoal on and atmosphere may include the smoke. If the same happened in this study, I would suggest having a sentence in the limitation section to explain this issue that may affect the interview process.
