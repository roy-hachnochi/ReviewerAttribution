I'm happy to see a work like yours that realizes a "climate chamber" for silkworms. By climate chamber I mean a complex structured monitoring system for some entities useful for the life of the silkworms, and is able to suitably act to control the chamber and able to provide information of the entities on the internet. I have mixed feelings about the article: from one side the work is extremely clear and describes well all single steps made to realize the system, providing all the information to replicate the system, but from a scientific point of view, it does not seem innovative. The paper could be improved under many point of view as a study of reliability, consideration of the accuracy of the system and from a biological point of view explaining what could happen to animals if something is not fully managed, etc. Anyway, considering the effort made to do this system, considering that the application can be considered partially innovative and considering that you talk about preliminary test letting, you imagine that this is a first step of a longer research and I can consider it positive. The current structure of the paper prevents me giving punctual improvements because, as I said, the paper is well written and important changes are no compatible with the time of the revision. The only thing that I ask is to improve your bibliography, is insufficient for an International scientific journal. I'll suggest many papers that you could insert in your, I admit, some of them are mine because I have a good experience in this field, but you are completely free to decide to insert them or not; anyway I wish that you expand your bibliography.
