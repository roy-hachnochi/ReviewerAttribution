The original article by Kundu and Singh focuses on the study the effects of cardiovascular drugs on the heart rate of Daphnia. The authors have used an interesting heart model: Daphnia. This model has some advantages in comparison with classical animal models such as rats, mice, dogs, cats, and others. This model could be interesting for researchers from undeveloped countries. The study shows the effect of dopamine, caffeine, and alcohol on Daphnia heart rate (HR), which has been studied in other animal models. In this case, it is shown that dopamine and caffeine increase HR, and alcohol reduces HR. Interestingly, dopamine restores the low HR ethanol-induced. The authors claim that itâ€™s probably similar effects of this agents in humans, however, the Daphnia heart does not represent a direct analog of mammalian cardiac function, so the interpretation of the results of the present study in terms of mammals is problematic. I have two comments/questions: It is mentioned in the introduction, that atropine and atenolol decrease HR and this is not true in humans: Atenolol, a beta blocker reduces HR, but atropine, a cholinolytic agent, increase HR, so this statement must be revised. It could be useful if the authors add the how HR was performed. In general, after reading this submission, I consider that this is a short and interesting article about a simple model which will be useful for students, young researchers interested in alternatives to study cardiovascular function. After clarifying the comments the paper can be indexed.
