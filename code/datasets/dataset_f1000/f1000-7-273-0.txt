This case report illustrates the use of a bowel segment to restore the urine flow from the kidney to the bladder. The authors appropriately consider that as the "last resort" option for long ureteral strictures. From the description of the case it looks like that the renal pelvis and the proximal ureter were salvageable (in fact, the anastomosis was performed to the pelvis), making the reader wonder whether alternatives such as a auto-transplantation to the iliac fossae could be implemented, avoiding the need for interposing bowel. Using 22cm of bowel was probably excessive, given the anticipated lenghtening that always occurs (as illustrated in the post-operative reconstructed images from a CT). Also, the authors could include tappering of the ureter as an option to reduce the risks of urine reabsortion. Finally, it would be interesting to know the final diagnosis of the pathology behind the ureteral stricture, to further support the therapy chosen.
