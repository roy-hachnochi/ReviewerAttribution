The authors have improved the review sufficiently for indexing. While the review still suffers from a lack of depth in any particularly topic or target, it does provide a starting point for readers that are new to this field. The authors should be careful when discussing available inhibitors to relevant ECM or TME targets, as to whether they are research grade or clinical grade. Is their goal to inform future preclinical studies or clinical studies of these targets, or both? In future, the authors are encouraged to find particular subtopics or protein family that warrants a deeper dive into the literature.
