As I said previously this is a purely descriptive review which does not add much novelty to the existing literature. However, the authors have added additional details, as per referee comments, to improve the depth of the paper and it affords a useful succinct summary of the interaction between the cancer cell mass and its extracellular milieu which influences invasion and metastasis. On this basis I can recommend its indexing.
