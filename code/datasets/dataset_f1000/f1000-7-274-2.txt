ECM is the major component of tumor microenvironment. The review briefly summarized function of ECM in breast cancer progression. Authors discussed function of MMPs and LOXs in ECM remodelling and cancer progression. The review also touched the roles of EMT and CAF in ECM remodelling. However, none of these aspects has been covered thoroughly and discussed in detail. The review provides some information about ECM and cancer progression, but lacks big picture of ECM function and detail information about ECM deposition and remodelling. Major comments: ECM degradation is only part of ECM remodelling during cancer development. Increased ECM deposition is also associated with cancer progression. The authors need provide more and detail information about what and how ECM deposition contributes/represses cancer progression. Function of ECM in cancer progression is very complicated. Some ECM proteins promote cancer progression, some may suppress cancer progression. It is crucial to classify it in the review. EMT and CAF are both involved in ECM remodelling. Detail information about how EMT and CAF regulate ECM remodelling need to be provided. It is also important to discuss the function of other stromal cells in ECM remodelling in cancer tissue.
