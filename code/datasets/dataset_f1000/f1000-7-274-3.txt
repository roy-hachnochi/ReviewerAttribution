This is a very brief overview of the various complex processes that are thought to influence the migration of breast cancer cells from their primary site into and through the extracellular matrix, a pre-requisite for metastatic dissemination through the vascular system. The importance of the ECM in this process and its potential as a therapeutic target has only relatively recently been recognized, but the extent of interest has grown rapidly. Although this report does not add much novelty to the existing literature it is nevertheless a useful succinct summary of some of the major influencing factors/processes that are involved in breast cancer progression that inter-relates to the ECM. It is well written and easy to follow, particularly for those less familiar with this field. The title refers specifically to the role of the ECM. But EMT is a process occurring within the cancer cells prior to interaction with the ECM so it’s description is rather out of place here. Perhaps instead the authors may speculate as to how alterations or signals originating from the ECM might initiate EMT in some cells of the tumour mass (platelet derived-TGFβ is one factor mentioned but this is also secreted from cancer cells). This would add something new as little is known about the triggers (as opposed to the pleithora of mediators) of EMT. A short description of the differences in the tumour ECM from that around normal cells would be also be useful. Minor points: Statements that 98% of any cancer mortality and 90% of BC is due to metastasis should be removed or compelling evidence cited to support these figures. Whilst it may be true for BC, primary tumours in vital organs such as brain, lung, liver etc are likely to be as responsible for mortality, if not more, than their metastases. A few grammatical corrections: lys y l and build s and MEC abbreviation to be explained.
