The review by Jena and Janjanam provides some updates on progress in our understanding of the complex interactions between breast cancer cells and surrounding extracellular matrix (ECM) during tumor progression and metastasis. The review also mentions the growing appreciation of the interplay of stromal cells such as tumor-associated macrophages and fibroblasts on this process. While I applaud the efforts to synthesize some recent findings in this review, each subtopic within the review would warrant a deeper dive into the literature and what this means for developing new therapies. The recent discovery of the interstitium as a fluid compartment, as opposed to a rigid ECM barrier, that facilitates metastasis within lymph nodes and blood vessels 1 would warrant mention in a future review on this topic. There is also evidence emerging that ECM can form a barrier to cytotoxic immune cell recruitment. What might this mean for therapies targeting matrix metalloproteinases or cancer-associated fibroblasts that alter the ECM? How can the altered ECM improve responses to chemotherapy or immunotherapy in breast cancer? Overall, the topic is very interesting and timely, but the review needs to be more focused to achieve significant depth, and to truly guide thinking about new therapeutic strategies for metastatic breast cancer.
