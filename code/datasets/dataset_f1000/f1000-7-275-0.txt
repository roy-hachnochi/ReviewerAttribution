I have only following suggestions/questions Though the absolute difference in fraction of time for the two methods of data collection is very small (Table2) but the difference in AUC beyond specified thresholds is almost double. Is it due to difference in the valid time period of analysis by two different methods i.e. BBB and AIMS? In that case it would be better that the time period analyzed in each patient by two different methods be also depicted - the explanation given by authors is not satisfactory. Looking at the time period of analysis by two methods may clarify it. Is the Philips monitor sending the data for AIMS every 15 second or every 5 seconds? Is the data averaged after collection at server or before being sent from peripheral monitor to central server? How is area under curve calculated for AIMS data? If the peak of wave was SBP, what was time dimension – is it the total systolic time or total epoch time of 15 sec? As no waveform was available in this case. Or was it the SBP above the threshold multiplied by the time till next SBP value comes within the threshold? Why was MAP not chosen? Otherwise it’s a well written manuscript with great future implications.
