This well written manuscript compared blood pressure data collected using two sampling resolutions: beat-by-beat contours vs. numeric data captured q15 seconds. This study represents an important first step to validating and comparing hemodynamic data obtained using different sampling methods and proposes the concept of time fractions as a standardizing method to account for case duration. The authors provided a thoughtful discussion of main findings. As the authors suggested, future studies of the association between different sampling methods and outcomes would be very interesting and a welcomed addition to the literature We have only minor suggestions: Can the authors briefly explain what constituted artefacts and how artefacts were removed from BBB tracings and from the AIM data? Also did these algorithms produce consistent removal of artefacts in both BP recording modalities? The authors are to be commended for their use of time fraction. Can the authors clarify the method of calculation for time fraction (i.e., was case duration used as the denominator)? Looks like although the median AUC values were very different between the BBB and AIMS groups, their corresponding time fractions were not very different (despite statistical significance).
