Frampton et al describe seqfam, a set of tools to perform family-based analysis on sequence data. It does gene-dropping, burden-testing, relatedness evaluation, "pattern of occurrence", and contains a script for running cluster analysis. My main critique is that this seems like a set of unrelated modules, some of which have (potentially) better alternatives. For example, the SKAT family of burden tests have been widely used in place of CMC implemented in this package and several implementations of CMC exist. Therefore, it's not clear from reading why this package is needed. In addition, as the authors note, this is only useful if there are sufficient unrelated controls. Another example is the relatedness module which relies on KING output. The additional utility provided in seqfam is a subset of the utility provided in peddy which does not rely on plink or KING. Again, it's not clear when the use of seqfam in this context would be preferable. The parts that are more novel are the gene dropping and the "POF" scripts. Running the script currently requires setting the PYTHONPATH. The package should have a requirements.txt and a proper setup.py so it can be used in a more standard manner. I was able to run the example script for gene dropping and see sensible outputs. Other than this, there are no tests in the repository and nothing in the manuscript indicating any of the methods were evaluated for correctness or accuracy performance. There is also very little documentation. For example,the gene_burden_test has: cmc_result_df = cmc.do_multivariate_tests(sample_s, geno_df, group_col=gene_col, agg_col="pop_frq_cat", agg_val_l=["rare","mod_rare"], covar_df=covar_df, results_path=results_path) A user must read the code to see that agg_val_l is: `(list of strs): names of the aggregated categories.` but it's still not clear what that means or how to use it. For each module intended for use, there should be clear text and API documentation. Figure 1 and some of the manuscript would be useful as documentation as well. Figure 1B could be made clearer by adding a rule and using PASS/FAIL for how/if families meet that rule. This is certainly just a matter of preference, but I found the manuscript hard to digest due to the layout. To get all the information on a particular tool, I have to keep 3 sections of the paper in my head, the intro, the methods, and then the use-cases. This would have been more readable to me with a short intro describing the use-case and more per-tool description in the methods.
