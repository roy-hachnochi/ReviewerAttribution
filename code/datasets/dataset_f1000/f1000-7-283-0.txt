The results and conclusions are improved from previous revisions. However, as written, the paper is non-sensical. The title now states that the biomarkers are non-EV proteins, and the results and conclusions are appropriately skeptical about the EV origin of these proteins. However, the introduction only discusses the promise of EVs as biomarkers (and seems substantially unchanged from previous versions). I think any reader would find the introduction to be quite disconnected from the revised title, results and conclusions. For clarity, and to appropriately contextualize the study, the introduction should be revised to focus on the utility of circulating biomarkers, irregardless of their association with EVs.
