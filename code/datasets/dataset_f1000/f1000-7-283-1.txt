The authors have not made a true attempt to satisfy my reservations. They have only parroted my reservations in their response and discussion, and removed the word "vesicle" from their title. They have not attempted to revise the content of their article at all. Indeed, the first two words of the text remain "extracellular vesicles". I do not consider this work satisfactory for indexing.
