In this research note by Tucker et al., authors have identified 2 novel biomarkers potentially involved in early breast cancer development as well as as lymph node metastasis using extracellular vesicles from patient samples along with adequate controls of metastatic and non-metastatic cell lines. Several reports in the literature have already suggested the importance of EVs in cancer initiation and progression in various types of cancers. Although the novelty of this publication is limited, identification of 2 new molecules differentially expressed in primary versus metastatic breast cancer patients opens up the possibility of them being used in a simple prognostic blood test for detecting early BC development as opposed to mammography and other invasive techniques. A probable limitation of the study would be lack of identification of molecular mechanisms through which this upregulation of CRA-a and histone H1.2 phosphorylation plays a role in metastasis, specifically in which step of metastatic cascade e.g. intravasation, EMT, extravasation etc? But overall, the authors have done a great job and the article is a good addition to the field.
