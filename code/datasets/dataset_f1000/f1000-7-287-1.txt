In general, the paper would still benefit from a review by a native English speaker to correct the language. Additional recommended actions to consider are the following: Abstract in Methods (2nd line): instead of “Both materials were analyzed for their adaptation, …” please use “The microbe was analyzed for its adaptation, …” Methods in Culture of E. faecalis bacteria: please rephrase the last sentence “The Accurate of the density ...” to make it more understandable. in Adaptation to pH assay: first sentence: how do the concentration values, given here in %, compare with units of Figures 1 to 3 where concentration is given in micrograms per milliliter? Results, Discussion Figure 1: why is the initial pH value (at 0 hours) about the same at all lime extract concentrations? Are there any known inhibitor (buffering) substances in the lime extract (or in the bacterial culture) that could explain relatively constant initial pH at a range of concentrations? Figure 2: why is the indicated acid tolerance apparently higher towards increasing lime extract concentration also at 0 hours of exposure? Figure 3: why is the indicated adhesion level apparently higher towards increasing lime extract concentration also at 0 hours of exposure? Where are the error bars mentioned in the text? The paper is referring in many places to “interaction activity” between lime extract and E. faecialis . However, could the results also involve a concentration-dependent interaction between e.g. citric acid and other antibacterial compounds of the extract?
