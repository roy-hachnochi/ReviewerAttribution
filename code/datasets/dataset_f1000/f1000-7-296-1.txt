The work from Zelmer and collaborators is very interesting, timely, well executed and clearly written. I anticipate a great interest in the tuberculosis vaccine field. I have only minor comments and suggestions: Regarding introduction and/or discussion, it would be important the authors discuss what are the main genetic differences between the 4 mouse strains selected for this study. In Figure 4, it is right to state that colonies vary in tissues but only 2 tissues were analysed here so it would be more appropriate to state "between lung and spleen". Moreover, would it be possible to get the data in lymph nodes as well? Lymph nodes are critical for the responses to vaccination. The variation in CFU/organ seem to be higher in animals that have high levels of protection in this study (e.g. A/J mice). Could the authors comment on this? Is it possible to know the ML ratio in the 2 mice showing high CFU/lung from Fig 4A? Not sure if the authors have the samples available, but it would have been interesting to see the profiles of Type I/II IFN in tissue at least by qPCR. This information could be of great interest for the tuberculosis field. The authors should discuss the limitations of a relatively low number of biological experiments in this work.
