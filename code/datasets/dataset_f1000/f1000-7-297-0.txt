The authors assembled a draft genome of ISE6 using long-read sequencing. In addition, they used short-read sequencing to validate and distinguish the ISE6 assembly through differences in genome size and mapping coverage from the already sequenced, albeit incomplete, Ixodes scapularis genome. The primary aim is to generate the genome of ISE6 for host genomic for potential application such as the subtraction from genomic analysis of pathogens and/or symbionts cultured in ISE6. The authors demonstrated very well that the draft genome of ISE6 showed more coverage than the tick genome. It was also a great approach to use three different methods to estimate the genome size. There were a few areas that could have been improved upon. This article would have benefited from demonstrating if there is any difference in using the ISE6 genome assembly vs. the tick genome for subtracting host genomic background, or in some other application in which using the assembled ISE6 genome would be more beneficial than the tick genome. In addition, the authors could discuss further the origin of the contig that was similar to Rickettsia . For instance, the authors could hypothesize whether this contig came from a lateral gene transfer event, rickettsial contamination of the starting material, or technical error in the assembly process. Nevertheless, having a draft genome of ISE6 will be useful for in vitro research involving tick-associated bacteria, protozoans, and viruses.
