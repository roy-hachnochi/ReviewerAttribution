The methods involve only variability, yet the conclusions are about precision medicine. It is not entirely clear what the one has to do with the other. Yes, I get that heterogeneity can mess up the analysis of precision medicine, but it can also mess up standard analyses of standard treatments too. Moreover, is this really the strongest argument against precision medicine? Because it does not seem to be insurmountable, so if anything, it seems to argue against the research methods used to evaluate precision medicine, rather than against precision medicine itself. Also, the writing is fairly poor, which is surprising, since Dr. Senn is one of the best writers I have ever had the pleasure of reading.
