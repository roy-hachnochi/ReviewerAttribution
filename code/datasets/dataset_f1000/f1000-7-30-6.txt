I appreciate the authors’ careful response to my review. They have made a number of changes which have improved the manuscript. However, a number of errors remain which leave me unable to approve the manuscript. The key errors are: I still do not accept the authors’ argument (stated in the abstract) that “conventional clinical trials are designed to find differences with the implicit assumption that the effect is the same in all patients within the eligibility criteria”. Their response document does not make a convincing case. I think the authors see that standard procedures - the Neyman-Pearson lemma, a sample size calculation - use a single parameter, and infer that these procedures assume a common treatment effect. But this single parameter is the between-group difference of means, which equates to the average treatment effect. There is no assumption that the treatment effect is the same for all individuals. The observed reduction in variance does not imply that “treated patients … would not require further precision medicine” (abstract). If for example there is a subgroup of less ill patients who derive no benefit, then this would explain the observed data, but excluding this subgroup would leave us in the setting of equal variances, which as already argued does not imply no role for precision medicine. The reporting, though much improved, is still unclear in some ways. For example, what is the “baseline heterogeneity (τ2)” that is estimated as 0.31 (p6)? what does this mean: “both sources of variability cannot be empirically differentiated: (i) within study or random or that one related to sample size; and (ii) heterogeneity”? Table 1 remains unclear to me. I am also disappointed that the authors have not replied to Erica Moodie’s critical comments.
