The authors have performed a review of a sample of clinical trials conducted every three years from 2004-2013 to examine whether there exists post-treatment heterogeneity in participants responses with premise that lack of heterogeneity suggests that precision medicine is not warranted. While the question is one that should be asked. However, the study carried out is not suited to answering the question as it has been conducted in randomized trials where there is typically little heterogeneity. That is, the authors have performed a perfectly reasonable analysis that cannot answer the pertinent question. It is well known that randomized trials tend to be populated by homogenous population (more white, more male, etc.) – see, for example Oh et al. (2015) Diversity in Clinical and Biomedical Research: A Promise Yet to Be Fulfilled. PLoS Med 12(12): e1001918, Caplan Friesen P (2017) Health disparities and clinical trial recruitment: Is there a duty to tweet? PLoS Biol 15(3): e2002040 and the references therein – or indeed many other papers on this topic. This may be in part a function of recruitment strategies and also by design, as trialists (particularly those testing new therapies) often determine inclusion criteria to target the (potentially homogeneous) segment of the population who might show the greatest response to the treatment. Thus, the authors have chosen to study a population that is likely to be homogeneous and not reflective of real-world clinical care. There are numerous examples covariate-tailored treatment algorithms, from the choice of hormonal therapies for women diagnosed with estrogen-receptor-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer to the choice of ACE inhibitors vs. calcium channel blockers for hypertension, that the authors choose to overlook as cases where we have learned about previous patients with particular characteristics to learn about future similar patients.
