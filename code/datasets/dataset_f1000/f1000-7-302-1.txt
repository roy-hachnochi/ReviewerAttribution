Comments/minor revisions Ref. 16 refers to Treatment of children with human cadaver-derived growth hormone (hGH) contaminated with prions resulted in iatrogenic transmission of CreutzfeldtJakob disease (iCJD). I was unable to find any reference to ‘immature dopamine neurons grafted to PD patients” and Lewy bodies in Ref. 16. Need correct reference or further explanation. Fig. 4 - would be helpful to use arrows to indicate several VLPs which were used in measurements. Fig. 7 - need arrow - VLP In a PD neuron, close to the internal face of the nuclear membrane. Re: Immunohistochemistry Methods: Was antiserum raised against polio types 1, 2, and 3 or…only poliovirus type 1? Fig. 11 - How were these VLP particles identified as intranuclear? Are smaller particles also seen - i.e. the cluster of particles in the quadrant directly above the putative VLP? Fig. 12 - what are the particles seen inside the Lewy body? Fig. 16 - Shows only IHC for rabbit anti-polio. Would be useful to show an example of IHC for anti-coxsackie. Table 3 - IHC for anti-coxsackie and anti-polio - nearly all dual positives, only one is specific for coxsackie only.Is this result expected?
