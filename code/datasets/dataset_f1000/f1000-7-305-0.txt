I understand that this is a pilot study and that the task of recruiting patients with the appropriate inclusion criteria may be very difficult. Regarding the study design, it would have been valuable to have an age-matched control group similar as it was done on the referenced study by Fournier et. al . 1 They studied the postural control of 13 children with Autism Spectrum Disorders and had 12 age-matched controls. Even though the sample was also small, having a control group in this study added more value to the findings and final conclusions. In the reviewed study by Rosario et. al. the absence of a control group in the study design should be mentioned as a limitation that may hinder the conclusions drawn from the results. This being said, there is significant scientific value to this study and more data is needed to evaluate potential postural control issues in patients with autism spectrum disorders.
