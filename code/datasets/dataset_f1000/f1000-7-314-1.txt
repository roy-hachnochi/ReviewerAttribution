The manuscript has been improved. Some terms must still be corrected: “infected” and “uninfected” must not be used in the manuscript and must be replaced everywhere by T. vivax PCR-negative and T vivax PCR-positive Results and discussion section: there is not any significant differences between positive and negative animals, concerning blood formula, thus the figures must not be over-interpreted and they should not be discussed so widely.
