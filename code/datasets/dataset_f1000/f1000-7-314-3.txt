Animal trypanosomosis is an important disease in both animals and humans and understanding the host’s response to such infection is important scientific endeavor. The manuscript describes some basic hematological parameters in these two breeds of animals, which may have some biological significance and lead to some understanding of parameters affecting disease resistance. However, the number of infected animals is quite low in both groups, with only 4/55 WASH and 7/55 N’Dama infected. The data supports the conclusions presented. Suggestions: The use of real numbers for each WB cell subgroup parameter rather than reporting only a %. For instance the Eosinophils in Table 2 could be represented as a number rather than a % and this would give a greater feel for the level of absolute differences. If for instance the Eosinophils were represented as a number then the differences between the breeds would be much clearer. Both absolute numbers and % could be used. 5mg/ul is a considerable concentration of ethidium bromide (needs to be checked). Green and Sambrook recommends use of 0.5ug/ml suggest checking the value. Concentration of the template is not given and should be. Suggest checking concentrations of the reagents used in the PCR. For instance, 10mM dNTPs is quite a considerable quantity of dNTPs or is it x ul of a 10mM dNTP solution. Typical final concentrations in PCR are between 200-250uM.
