This is an interesting "negative results" report. The authors had previously reported data in support of the hypothesis that systemic loss of the expression of the gene Zbtb32 would increase T-cell activation and increase diabetic pathogenesis. The expected hypersensitivity of leukocytes was not observed. A minor but non-significant increase in diabetes incidence was observed in males, but only at later than 30 weeks of age. The lack of hyper-responsiveness of immune cells in these NOD mice (investigating an impressive panel of different leukocyte types and assays) is surprising since hyper-responsiveness had been found in 3 other strains with a knock out of Zbtb32. This raise an important question of whether immune responses and their regulation in NOD mice are different compared to other commonly used mice strains with respect to regulation by Zbtb32. However, as noted and discussed by the authors, the mutation on the NOD background was created using CRISPR/CAS9 whereas the 3 strains where the KO was successful in enhancing immune reactivity were more traditional KO mice. Furthermore the immune reactivity assays in this report are only comparing activation of cells from NOD mice without direct comparison to cells from the other strain backgrounds. As such this question may warrant a more detailed investigation before it can be answered conclusively. The manuscript is clearly written and experimental designs are technically sound.
