This manuscript discusses a new tool developed by the authors that improves the ‘liftover’ between genomic builds. “Segment_liftover” is built on the already available liftover tool from UCSC with the novelty that it the tool implements a better conversion between genomic builds for stretches of the genome (segments) like in for example DNA copy number analyses. In addition, the tool provides options to perform the analysis in batches and provides log files of execution and results. The tool, as available on github, provides ample documentation and examples to run without experiencing too many difficulties. The authors provide an interesting new tool that shows an improvement over existing tools. In general, the manuscript is clear and concise. However, a few minor points need to be addressed to improve the interpretation of the results described in the manuscript. The second use case is basically a direct comparison between UCSC liftover and the newly developed segment_liftover tool. However, this is not explicitly mentioned in the text. In the current version it is not evident that you did the nice/required comparison with a currently available tool. Furthermore, a little more explanation on the 4 different strategies would benefit the reader. Figure 3 does not convincingly convey its message. For example, it is not clear from the figure that the percentage of unconvertible segments is higher that probes although properly mentioned in the text. But also, the difference between the first bars is over a factor 1000. I understand the choice of a log10 scale but the authors might consider a different way of showing this data (table? Add percentages or number?).
