This report by Keeley et al., examines the effects of adolescent THC exposure on conditioned place preference for d-amphetamine. While no effects of adolescent THC exposure were found on the CPP or the neural correlates (c-fos expression), the authors' inclusion of important factors such as strain and sex make this an important study to consider for those interested in studying the effects of developmental cannabinoid exposure on future risk for substance use. Suggested changes would help to improve the impact of this paper. Abstract: Last Sentence: include "sub-threshold dose of" before d-amphetamine Introduction: The introduction begins with mentions of psychosis, anxiety and depression, whereas the central questions being asked in this study are not related to those topics. The authors should think about setting the research question in the opening paragraph. Methods: Subjects: This section is unclear. Are the subjects being referred to here the parents of the rats used in the study? D-Amphetamine Doses: 1 mg/kg not listed here Statistical Analyses: Unclear whether dwell times were also compared within-animal pre- and post-training? Results: Tables missing, but mentioned in the text. Discussion: Since the authors chose to discuss psychosis in the introduction, maybe they can discuss it in the context of the null results of d-amphetamine on c-fos expression, since an accentuated response to amphetamine is something that is seen in patients with schizophrenia. An excellent review by Chadwick and Hurd 1 might help to formulate some of these thoughts. Rearing environment was not one of the research objectives/hypotheses and the relevance to this discussion needs to be strengthened.
