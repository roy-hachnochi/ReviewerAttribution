Thank you very much for the opportunity to review this potentially important manuscript. Unfortunately, it suffers from a fatal flaw. First, recommendations. This reviewer strongly recommends English language editing to improve clarity, readability, and flow of the text. The authors are to be congratulated for authoring a coherent manuscript and have done much better than this reviewer could do in (what is presumed to be a language other than their primary language). The fatal flaw has to do with study design. A complex survey design was used in at least to survey the Kenyan (and I suspect other) population(s). This two-stage sampling design oversampled urban populations and undersampled those in the North East province. Not taking the sampling design into account when doing the analysis has critical implications and renders and conclusions wrong. This reviewer is unaware of SPSS survey sampling software; however, SAS has several survey procedures (PROC SURVEYMEANS, PROC SURVEYFREQ, PROC SURVEYPHREG), R (which is free) has a package for complex survey analysis (survey), and RTI (SUDAAN) all have software for handling complex surveys designs.
