This well-written account from a renal unit gives a clear detailed account of the range of presentations of Fabry Disease in 8 local patients with mainly renal manifestations of this rare lysosomal storage disorder. An excellent summary of the condition is followed by details of index patients and relatives. The condition is increasingly recognised, but only some nephrologists are not fully aware of the range of presentations and manifestations. It is important as its very expensive treatments need careful consideration, though heavy proteinuria or other evidence of significant renal consequences would usually considered to be a treatment indication. The unexplained association with parapelvic cysts is nicely illustrated. There is no doubt that there are unrecognised patients still; whether they meet treatment criteria is important, and not addressed. But that's OK.
