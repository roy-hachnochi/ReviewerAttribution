The authors have addressed the major issues concerning the clarity and logic of the argument. The new section, Summary, weaknesses of the hypothesis, and conclusions, is an excellent addition. Most of the grammatical and stylistic corrections have been made, however, since new text has been added there are still a lot of English language problems throughout the paper. A copy editor for English language would be very helpful for the revision?
