The methods in this paper are adequate, however, in probability theory, according to Bayes’ theorem that describes the probability of an event, based on prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to the event. So, in case of this paper I think it is necessary to show data about pollution water made in different areas of Ecuador, for two reason: the first one is to make known the difference between rural and urban area, and the second one, if “ this study focused on estimating the probability of a person in Ecuador contracting an infection due to ampicillin-resistant Escherichia coli through the consumption of contaminated water” , it’s necessary to know if the source of water in Ecuador are contaminated with ampicillin-resistant E. coli . So, if the water in Ecuador is contaminated with ampicillin-resistant E. coli , is highly probably that the people of Ecuador contracting an infection, then using Bayes’ theorem, a water quality of water (contaminated with E. coli) can be used to more accurately assess the probability that the contracting an infection, compared to the assessment of the probability of people contracting infection made without knowledge of data of quality of water. In conclusion the paper is correct because the aim is shows that both urban and rural populations are exposed to an antibiotic-resistant infection, and in Ecuador there aren't researched in this area. For this reason I think the worked can be published.
