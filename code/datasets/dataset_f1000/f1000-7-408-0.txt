 The sample size of the study must be clarified. The number analyzed as indicated in Figure 1 and Table 1 is unclear. Figure 1 indicates 15 people in each of the DM and Control groups participated in the study and were analyzed, but also that 4 participants in the DM group and 5 in the Control group were excluded. Table 1 then presents data for 15 in each group. Although no statistically significant differences were noted, the knee and ankle kinematic data were numerically higher in the DM group, and the SDs indicate sizable variability in both groups. One wonders if these could be meaningful differences, and if they would be statistically significant if a larger sample size had been examined. The authors note prior work that has demonstrated gait abnormalities in diabetic patients without peripheral neuropathy. The manuscript would be improved by greater discussion placing the current results in context and consideration of why the current results differ from prior work. The authors note that even in the absence of neuropathy diabetes has been associated with reduced gait speed, partly as “an adaptive mechanism to feel safer.” The authors should comment on whether the lack of difference in spatiotemporal characteristics could be due to the imposed speed in their study design overcoming this adaptive mechanism. The small sample size should be acknowledged as a limitation.
