The authors of the manuscript conducted a cross-sectional study to assess the state of early childhood development and early storybook reading in Iran. They reported a correlation between Early Storybook Reading (ESR) and early childhood development in communication development domain. I support the conclusion and consider ESR as an environmental stimulation that can promotes early childhood development; it also has a key role in building up the interest in book reading in the future. After a detailed review of the report, it could be stated that the study is sufficiently done and reported appropriately. I generally support the main conclusions and find it suitable and acceptable for indexing. Recommendations for authors: It is better to clarify the limitations of the study. It seems necessary to specify which version of ASQ was used to assess the state of Early Childhood Development. Regarding table1, in data file, columns AD and AE titled as “New mother educate (1=diploma and below, 2=academic)” and “New father educate (1=diploma and below, 2=academic)” were analyzed and reported but in the first column, rows seven and eight, only “Diploma” is mentioned pleas correct it to “Diploma and below” In the first column on row explain the table's footnote that Rials is the Iranian currency
