Thank you for sharing the manuscript entitled “Early storybook reading and childhood development: A cross-sectional study in Iran” with me. I read the paper carefully and find it is credible and appropriate for publication and it doesn’t have any major problem. This is a new topic in Iran and the results of this research can be the base for further research on book reading for children. I think the methods and the results sections are written completely and in clear format. Only as minor comments please follow below points: The limitations are more based on suggestions, and the main limitation of the research is not clearly stated. It is suggested that, in the Ethical statement, the cut-off point for the developmental delay should also be mentioned. Some sentences of the article should be edited by a native editor. Add the full form of acronym in the first time appeared in the article. for example: Ages Stages Questionnaires (ASQ) Did you use a localized standard ASQ questionnaire? In the data set, there are 273 subjects, but data analysis has done for 272 subjects? Is there any reason? Are there any relation between ESD, ECD, and infant sex or type of delivery? My mean is that the gender of infants or even the type of delivery (natural delivery or cesarean section) may have effect on the ESD.
