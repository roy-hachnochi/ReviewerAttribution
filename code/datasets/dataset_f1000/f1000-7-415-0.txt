In the field of fisheries, the attack of pathogenic microbes and the use of formaldehyde are some of the main issues. The use of formalin as a food preservative has reached dangerous stage, but its more effective substitute compounds have not been successfully developed. Bacteriocin is a compound that has great potential to be developed as a prevent attacks of pathogenic bacteria and preservative inhibitor to replace formaldehyde. Bacteriocin is a secondary metabolite product from lactic acid bacteria (BAL). These bacteria are often found in various places, including the digestive tract of fish and shrimp. There have been many efforts made to get bacteriocin-producing microbes. Increased mass production of bacteriocin is very helpful for fish cultivation activities in preventing pathogenic microbial attack and processing of fishery products as preservatives replacing formalin. This research is the initial stage of the effort to develop bacteriocin as a deterrent to the activity of pathogenic microbes and decay. Bacterial isolates that have been found need to go through several stages in order to produce bacteriocins, including isolation processes to produce pure cultures and optimal bacteriocin separation technology from microbial culture media. In the abstract several words are repeated, reducing the use efficiency of the word. The reasons put forward to carry out this research are quite relevant. It is hoped that bacteriocin can be found that can overcome the problem of pathogens that attack fish and shrimp. The method used has been presented in sufficient detail so as to facilitate future replication. Some parts still need to be detailed further, for example need further explanation on how to get bacteriocins using centrifugation, how many bacteriocin samples are used in the HPLC method, what and how many solvents are used?
