 Lot of words are repeating in the same sentence in the abstract. How do you produce bacteriocin by centrifugation? The species name of shrimp and prawn is missing in the whole test. How was the isolates obtained? What was the sample used? How was the health status of the shrimp and prawn confirmed? Characterization of probiotic features are completely missing. Have the authors confirmed whether the isolates by itself had antibacterial potentials? If so, have they determined the mode of action before moving on to bacteriocin isolation and purification? How do the authors justify selection of only Amoxicillin as the test antobiotics? There are no citations provided for Gel filtration chomatography. There is no mention of standard probiotic strain which are known to produce bacteriocins. How did the authors compare the bacteriocin production and its efficacy? The chemical formula of Ammonium Sulphate is (NH 4 ) 2 SO 4 not (NH4)2SO4. It has to be rectified throughout the text. Bacteriocin inhibitory activity is indicated as AU. AU does not stand for Activity Unit by Arbitrary Unit. Discussion is very poorly written. It has to be re-written and there is no mention of any papers on bacteriocins isolated from prawn/shrimps/fish sources.
