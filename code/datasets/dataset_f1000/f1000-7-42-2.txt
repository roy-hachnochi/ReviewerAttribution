The manuscript by Vargas-Bermudez et al. evaluated humoral response (IgG) and viremia in pigs from farms with two different vaccination programs. The authors concluded that viral loads were low regardless the vaccination schemes. The manuscript is well written, clear and provides interesting information. Major concerns: Conclusions There are statements that are not supported by the results and have to be modified. “Another explanation for vaccinated and non-vaccinated pigs with low viral loads is that there was no PCV2 circulating in the farm and that continuous vaccination of the populations has indeed minimized PCV2 infection between pigs”. Positive PCR indicate that PCV2 is circulating in the farm. “Our findings illustrated that different vaccination schemes against PCV2 can maintain low viral load in endemically infected populations regardless of the different humoral immune profiles observed over time”. This statement is not correct, because non-vaccinated group maintained low viral loads. Minor concerns: Results Can you include the IgG values of week 5? It is not clear the weaning age. It is week 3? The inclusion of vaccination time in the table 1 could help in the interpretation.
