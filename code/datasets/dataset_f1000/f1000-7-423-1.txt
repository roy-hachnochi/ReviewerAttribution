Bronchial asthma is a complex and heterogeneous pathology due to multiple mechanisms that are not present in all patients at any given time-point, or in the same patient at different time-points. Furthermore this disorder is not characterized by a single biomarker, but by a panel of biomarkers which describe its molecular aspects. In the last years, “omics” sciences have improved disease phenotyping by linking the molecular mechanisms to the clinical field. In their opinion article Scelfo and colleagues discussed about the application of omics sciences in the asthma characterization. The topic is very interesting although I have some concerns regarding some aspects of the article: Firstly, the main concept of omics sciences, such as epigenomics and metabolomics, should be explained in a more extensive manner. Furthermore, several other proteins other than galectin- 3 are associated to severe asthma. I suggest to include other examples. Other matrixes (please prefer matrix to sample) have been used to metabolomics analysis in asthma such as exhaled breath condensate. This part should be extended, considered recent findings on the possibility to phenotype asthmatic patients using this method.
