The study by Mansour AA et al. is an important contribution to the limited pituitary research in the middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. The following points need further modifications/clarifications; Sellar and parasellar region lesions usually refers to structural abnormalities and do not necessarily include other pituitary pathologies like hyperprolactinemia and hypopituitarism. Therefore, I suggest using the term ''pituitary disorders'' instead; more comprehensive. The inclusion of patients needs further clarifications in the ''Method'' section. what diagnoses where looked for? Pituitary adenoma includes all functioning and non-functioning pituitary tumors. In some part of the text, it was used separately from its subtype (see paragraph; Definition of variables). Maybe just typo. Table (2) needs to be simplified. The total number of patients should equal clearly equal 232. I suggest using 3-4 categories only; Sellar masses/abnormalities, Hyperprolactinemia, hypopituitarism and others. The "miscellaneous" cases need to be mentioned; what diagnoses are here? Table 3 the sum of patient with pituitary adenoma subtypes are not equal to the total number of cases. In the conclusion, ''A change in the practice of adenoma treatment is needed'' is very general. Based on the presented data, change in the management of GH secreting adenomas is more specific and relevant. Additional language editing will further enhance the manuscript.
