This is the first case described as far as I am aware of Elizabethkingia mircola in a patient with cystic fibrosis.The authors describe isolation of Elizabethkingia mircola in association with clinical deterioration of a patient, and subsequent clinical improvement and eradication of the organism following quinolone therapy. The report could be further improved by addressing the points below: The authors state in the first paragraph that the patient had a cough that was unproductive, but in contrast also state that a sputum sample was obtained. The report states that the patient was receiving treatment for ABPA; it is important to know what exactly the treatment was and in particular if this could have caused immunosuppression and lead to increased susceptibility to unusual infections. The authors state the patient was heterozygous for F508del; did they identify the other CF gene? The authors state Elizabethkingia mircola was isolated after extended incubation: what culture media was used and how long was the extended incubation before Elizabethkingia mircola was isolated?
