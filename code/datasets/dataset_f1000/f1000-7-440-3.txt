I agree that this appears to be the first report of this organism in CF and as such this is a relevant and important article and so should be published. The Case Report para 2 states the patient was heterozygous for CFTR mutation F508del but does not give the other mutation. Readers (including me) would be interested to know the second mutation so this should be stated. Para 4 states treatment of P aeruginosa and E miricola took place with oral chloramphenicol. This is an unusual choice as P. aeruginosa would usually be treated with ciprofloxacin or IV therapies and/or nebuliser amino glycoside. It would be helpful to know why chloramphenicol was chosen and whether any neb antibiotics were used as well (which is likely the case). These details should be included to give a more complete picture of the case.
