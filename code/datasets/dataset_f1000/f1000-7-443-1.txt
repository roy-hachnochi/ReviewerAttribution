This is an interesting study, but it is rather poorly analyzed. Also, some of the definitions need to be readdressed. First of all, even in cancer patients, growth of Candida from sputum or urine does not mean dissemination; rather colonization. Even if the patients have symptoms, Candida UTIs and even less pneumonia are extremely rare. The authors need to provide solid data such as histopathology, define that there were no other potential pathogens, and symptoms resolved only after antifungal. I am not sure how appropriate it is to use chi-square to document that one condition (colonization) is more frequent than another (infection) within the same group. Besides, so what? If infection is properly defined, the authors should investigate if there was a statistically significant difference in % between their "case" and "control" groups. Speaking of infection, any cases of candidemia? This is the main clinical syndrome that can result from heavy Candida colonization, mucosal breech, foreign bodies, especially lines, immunosuppression, elimination of other flora with antibacterials etc. More clinical information is required and needs to be properly analyzed (e.g. risk factors for non- albicans species, different clinical syndromes etc.). It might be good to analyze the data on different species presented in the article tables for statistically significant differences in the frequencies of different Candida species.
