This is the proposal of a prospective study aimed to assess the ability of a novel portable ultrasound (US) system to estimate the amount of renal fibrosis. The study would first consist in an ex-vivo experiment in which the US system is tested on bovine solid organs (kidney and liver), ultimately leading to the clinical study on human subjects. In the first instance, the novel US system would be employed as a screening tool for the early diagnosis and staging of chronic kidney disease in the rural population of Sri Lanka. The idea and purposes are interesting. Few comments: It is not clear whether the data obtained ex-vivo would be compared against histopathology data, as this would be imperative before proceeding with the clinical study. In this case the investigators should make sure that bovine kidneys with different degrees of fibrosis are analysed in order to properly assess the sensitivity and specificity of the US system. It would be interesting to have an estimate of the saved costs of this technique employed for the rural population of Sri Lanka, as the application could be extended to the many other populations across the world with limited access to the healthcare system. In my view, it is important to point out that, if successful, this US system is aimed to flag patients with suspected CKD - who will eventually need a biochemical estimation of the degree of CKD, as I doubt this system would have sufficient sensitivity to warrant a fairly accurate monitoring of the progression of the CKD (changes in the degree of fibrosis detected by the US system would probably correspond to dramatic decreases of the eGFR). In the clinical study, the obtained B-mode parameters should be corrected for anthropometric features, such as the body height. This would strengthen the degree of correlation between CKD stage and US parameters (Lucisano et al., 2015 1 ).
