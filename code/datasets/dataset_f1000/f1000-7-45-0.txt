I had difficulty reading the tables in the article. I thought maybe it was the way they were displaying on my computer, but nothing seemed to change when I clicked on them. Please make these charts simple to read and clear. I need to see the tables to make sure your findings are adequately described. The article is really well written. I was very pleased with the quality of the writing and the honesty of the authors about their challenges. This is important work in the area of PPE use. While I know that this was quick work in a difficulty setting, I still feel like the article needs to do justice to personal protective equipment research of the past 20 years (at least since SARS). The major section that needs more referencing is the discussion section. How do your findings compare to what we have found in epidemiological studies, simulation studies, and others on PPE. Even if these studies were not done in the context of an outbreak of EVD in Africa, they should still be discussed. There is literature on some of these areas that would bring worthwhile context to your findings.
