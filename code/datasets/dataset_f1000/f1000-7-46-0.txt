The authors describe a 79-year old woman presented with palmoplantar rash. This was characterized by painful erythema, edema and desquamation. In this case the history led to the right diagnosis: the woman suffered from metastatic colon cancer and underwent chemotherapy with capecitabine. There are other diagnoses to be considered in patients with these clinical findings. Only some of them are mentioned by the authors. For the readers a table with differential diagnoses and typical clinical and anamnestic criteria would have been helpful to differentiate between these diagnoses.
