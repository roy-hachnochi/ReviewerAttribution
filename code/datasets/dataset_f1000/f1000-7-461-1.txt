Thank you for asking me to review this manuscript which reviews the factors influencing the higher incidence of TB in migrants and ethnic minorities. Introduction The authors should clarify that the symptoms of active disease both site-specific and systemic and list site-specific symptoms. Epidemiology Although a mainly UK based paper, is there evidence from other high-income countries relating to transmission in migrant communities? Differential exposure Whilst I agree travel is potentially important as a risk factor for acquiring TB infection, the evidence at present is weak. I think the authors need to nuance this section and clarify that the data is weak and further work is required. In particular type of travel is important. Migrants working in healthcare overseas as volunteers etc will be at higher risk. Vitamin D The impact of vitamin D is difficult to tease out and I think the authors should cite the work of Pareek and colleagues which suggests that vitamin D levels (i.e. deficiency) are associated with EPTB. Impact of strain I would like more discussion on the host-pathogen interaction and impact of strain type on TB phenotype. See Pareek et al's work in this area. Diabetes The relative risk of TB in DM patients seems lower in the UK. Have they seen the work from David Moore's group on the CPRD cohort? HIV Whilst I agree that the absolute proportion of TB-HIV cases is low it should be borne in mind that incidence in this group is relatively high and they are important group to prevent TB infection and progression in. First generation vs. second generation I would have liked some discussion in the manuscript relating to why second generation individuals (i.e. UK born but with parents born overseas) are at increased risk of TB. This is often neglected but needs to be evaluated.
