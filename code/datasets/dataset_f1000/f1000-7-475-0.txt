This is a succinct and well written case report highlighting a rare but important complication of a first line anti-pseudomonal intra-venous antibiotic used commonly in Cystic Fibrosis care. It is possible this complication is under reported and without the appropriate investigations highlighted in this case may also be under-diagnosed. The potential additions to this case are minor. In the introduction it would be useful to clarify the details of the previous four reported cases; as it is slightly unclear whether all four cases were in individuals with CF or across other diseases without tracking down each reference. Within the discussion it would also add to the clinical relevance of the case to highlight whether drug dependent antibodies show any evidence of cross-reactivity with other similar antibiotics as is seen with hypersensitivity reactions. If there is no evidence in this regard it would be useful to state this. Otherwise I am in agreement with the previous reviewer that clinical teams are alerted to this potentially significant adverse reaction.
