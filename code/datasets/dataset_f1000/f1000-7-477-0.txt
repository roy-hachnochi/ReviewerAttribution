I recommend the indexing of this paper in your journal based on the following considerations: 1. This is one of the few papers discussing the effectiveness and safety between biosimilar insulin and originator insulin in real world clinical practice in a Chinese diabetes population. It releases the message that biosimilar is potentially different in effectiveness from originator as reported by previous papers. It helps provide a clinical implication to physicians and raise the necessity of long term observation or well designed trials to identify the differences in real world at the same time. 2. Despite the limitation of small sample size, short term treatment duration and potential bias mentioned in this paper, the authors smartly designed two subgroup analysis. It also showed that the mean FBG was lower after switching from Basalin to Lantus , 8.25mM vs. 7.49mM(p=0.0217,for purely basal-bolus regimen with no OAD population) and 8.51mM vs.7.37mM(p=0.0337,for recorded suboptimal glycemic control population). The conclusion is consistent as that in the whole group. 3. The graphs should be displayed in a simple way to be well understood.
