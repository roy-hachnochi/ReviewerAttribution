As a peakless long-action insulin analogue, Insulin glargine has been widely used in China, as basal insulin initiating paradigm become more and more accepted. Biosimilar insulin glargine has been on market for many years. As debate if biosimilar is as effective as originator continued, we also once noticed three patients switching from biosimilar glargine to originator resulted in improved glycemic control without increase in dosage. In the report the authors retrieved data of inpatient electronic record, studied retrospectively if the switching from biosimilar insulin glargine to its originator would improve patients glycemic control. They found it did improve patient glucose control after the switching. The authors discussed the possible reasons. But as reported, this is a retrospectively study, there was no control. From the authors schematic description of data retrieval, we noticed there still had around 20 patients who switched their insulin from originator to biosimilar, although the number was small, this might still be used as a control. We discussed our case report one possible reason of improvement in glucose control might be due to inpatient diabetes education, strict dietary restriction. The adding of these “control” patients would provide more strong evidence supporting the use of originator.
