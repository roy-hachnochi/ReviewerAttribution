 This study is well structured with a clear objective to explore a very common scientific question in daily clinical practice. In this study, authors reported a significant FBG reduction(additional -0.67mmol/L) and better overall hyperglycemia control after switching from Basalin to Lantus at similar insulin dosage in hospitalized diabetes patients, mostly are type 2 diabetes patients. This outcome helps provide an initial answer on the efficacy and safety difference between biosimilar insulin and originator insulin in real clinical practice for physicians. This study also implies the importance of FBG control on overall glycemic control for physicians. As a retrospective chart study, the outcomes inevitably limited by some confounding factors as discussed in the paper. To better verify the outcome, authors explored subgroup analysis in basal bolus regimen and recorded suboptimal glycemic control population, from which with similar outcomes as in total population. Sufficient and valid data in Lantus switching to Basalin as control group or crossover design study may provide further useful and robust information on efficacy, safety evaluation. After a careful review of this manuscript, I do think it appropriate for publication in F1000 Research.
