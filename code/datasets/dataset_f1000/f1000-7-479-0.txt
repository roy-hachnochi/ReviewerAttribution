The advent of microbial ecologic studies using 16S rRNA gene analysis has opened the field of microbial diversity to a wide range of new investigators. Most investigations include ecologic analyses of microbial diversity using a range of different diversity indices. The authors of the ShinyDiversity have developed a new software package that can aid the investigator in these analyses. Appropriate to its use is the interactive nature of the package. ShinyDiversity should be of value to many investigators in the field. Users, however, should be aware that interpretation of results needs to be in the context of the broad assumptions built in to the diversity indices. In particular, those using this tool probably are comparing ecologic environments and that identifying differences in diversity can be used to imply differences in microbial community makeup based on some differences in the environment. However, minor differences can occur as the result of defined microbial differences that may or may not grossly affect the diversity indices. Thus, interpretation of the result must go beyond the integration of large data sets into indices but need to take in to account the true compositionally differences. I believe that the authors do understand this.
