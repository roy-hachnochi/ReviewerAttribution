Leung et al described a software tool for visual analysis of microbiome alpha and beta diversity. The motivations are to be user-friendly and to allow users to explore how different alpha and beta diversity indices impact their results. The tool is developed using Shiny and Phyloseq R package Their solution is to put the graphical outputs side-by-side to facilitate comparisons. The benefits of such arrangement is very clear. However, it is important to realize that real sample size are often very large, making such arrangement not practical (esp. for alpha diversity). I also appreciate the table showing singletons and doubletons. Main limitations: I cannot find a way to upload data! Without this, it is not a tool yet, not even mention user friendliness, as it cannot be used at the moment. I would strongly urge authors to implement this very basic feature. Minor: 1) It appears that the tool should be installed from within the RStudio. If I do it from R terminal, there will be errors; 2) Fig 3 should be normalized for more informative view.
