Mechanisms of immunity to intracellular pathogens, such as those causing tuberculosis, leishmaniasis, and leprosy have much in common, and as such knowledge in each of these areas should be leveraged and applied as much as possible to these and other intracellular pathogens. The functional definition of CD4 T cell subsets was pioneered in experimental leishmaniasis models and the knowledge has been applied to other infectious diseases, allergy and cancer. Of particular relevance is the selection of vaccine delivery systems and adjuvants that may selectively drive desired immune responses.
