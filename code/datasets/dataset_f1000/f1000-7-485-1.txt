This article comprehensively describes the scope and purpose of VALIDATE, a Global Challenges Research Fund Network. VALIDATE aims to exploit the similarities among complex intracellular bacterial pathogens, including those responsible for tuberculosis, leishmaniasis, melioidosis, and leprosy. Of the target diseases, only tuberculosis receives considerable attention from major funding agencies. Establishment of VALIDATE will help unite researchers from across the globe to accelerate vaccine development against these largely neglected diseases. It will also provide a resource for data sharing, pilot funding, and mentorship for young investigators.
