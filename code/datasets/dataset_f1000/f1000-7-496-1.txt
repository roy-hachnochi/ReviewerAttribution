This is a cross-study on association between social capital and quality of life in Thailand. The justification of study has been provided in "Introduction". However, there are many studies on such associations that authors can cite some of them in Introduction. While the details of multistage random sampling have been provided, justification for calculated number of participants (second paragraph under the subheading of "study participants") has been written in a wrong way and need to be re-written. We did not know "Conbach alpha". It might be Cronbach's alpha. Justification for classification of SC as a dichotomized variable is not correct and sufficient. This is true for accessibility to health service. The manuscript need severe English language editing service. The presentation of Tables is understandable and appropriate.
