This is an informative and well written report on a very rare cancer, undifferentiated sarcoma of the tongue. The authors could consider discussing the challenges of the pathological classification of sarcomas. For instance, they reference a review by Dr Nguyen and colleagues â€“ this review cites studies dating from the 1980s. There have been clear improvements in the classification of sarcomas over this time. Consequently, this strengthens the importance of the current study which provides detailed exome sequencing data. I agree with other referees that it is not surprising that the profile of an undifferentiated sarcoma is different to that of a head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.
