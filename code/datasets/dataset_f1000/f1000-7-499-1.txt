Undifferentiated sarcoma of the tongue is a rare malignancy of the head and neck, and its underlying genetic alterations have not previously been investigated. In this case report, the authors performed whole-exome sequencing (WES) of a tongue sarcoma and paired blood sample of a 31-year-old male. They identified a fairly low mutation rate, with mutations in POLDIP2 , a gene important in DNA replication and repair, and RETSAT , a gene involved in adipogenesis. WES analysis of the patient’s blood DNA revealed mutations in TP53 , CDKN2A , CASP8 , and NOTCH1. Overall, this is a well-written case report of a rare tumor arising in a patient with an interesting germline mutational profile. The authors should consider the following: Is “undifferentiated sarcoma of the tongue” a distinct clinicopathologic entity? The introduction discusses the rarity of undifferentiated sarcomas of the tongue but then references a review of malignant fibrous histiocytoma. Several times throughout the manuscript, the authors compare the mutational profile of the tongue sarcoma to that of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. They remark that the mutational profiles of the two tumor types are distinct. I would not necessarily expect that the mutational events underlying a mesenchymal-derived tumor would be similar to an epithelial-derived tumor. Can the authors comment on why they expected that the mutational profiles might be similar?
