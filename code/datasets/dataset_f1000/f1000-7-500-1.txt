This is an outstanding paper that objectively evaluates the potential benefit of the vitamin C protocol for sepsis.This evaluation was impeccably conducted and reported. The impact of this paper is significant. A few comments that will improve the paper: 1.The authors state " The delay between publication of the pilot study and results of the large RCT due in mid-2018 could create substantial opportunity costs" . This study which the authors cite is the NIH funded study due for completion in mid-2018 which is investigating vitamin c (ALONE) and not the combination AND in patients with ARDS (not specifically sepsis). Secondly, this study is not powered for a mortality difference. Currently according to Clintrials.gov there are 8 RCTS testing the combination and 3 testing Vitamin C alone. This suggests that it may take at least until the end of 2019 before the results of any of these studies are available and we can make firm conclusions. 2. The authors refer to the "sepsis bundle"; I would avoid using this term as it will create confusion with the Surviving Sepsis Bundle.. widely known as the Sepsis Bundle. I would call it the Vitamin C protocol, the Marik Protocol, or something similar. 3. Approximately 50% of sepsis survivors develop the post-sepsis syndrome, defined as severe physical and cognitive dysfunction not unlike PTSD. This syndrome is associated with enormous suffering and high costs. It is likely that the Marik Protocol will reduce the incidence and severity of this syndrome. While the cost savings are difficult to quantitate, I think that this proposition should be mentioned in the discussion section.
