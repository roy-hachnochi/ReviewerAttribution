The authors have revised the article to address most of my prior comments/concerns and that of Dr. Pearce, the other official reviewer. In particular, the addition of references, addition of text (e.g., a new “value and credit” subsection), and wording revisions have strengthened the work. The article is an important contribution to the literature on open science. The article should promote additional dialogue on this important topic.
