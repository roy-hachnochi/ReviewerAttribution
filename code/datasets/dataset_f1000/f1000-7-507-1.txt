This is a very simple paper based on common microbiological techniques. Authors have taken a few common antibiotics and made a cocktail which is cost-effective and gave results comparable to the existing commercially available antibiotics (PANTA). Experiments are planned well, appropriately described, and conclusions are justified. The comparable findings obtained using this highly cost-effective formulation relative to commercially available formulations can be of great help to researchers in TB field. To check the reliability of the new formulation, authors have conducted animal experiments and enumerated bacillary load in the infected organs such as lungs and spleen. Authors detected no significant difference between commercial and the new mixture of antibiotics on the growth potential of the BCG strains isolated from the infected lungs. The statistical analysis was done using two-tailed ANOVA, which is most appropriate. While experiments are reliable and results are presented well, I would have liked a control wherein authors plate organ homogenates on the culture media plates without any antibiotic mix. This would have confirmed that the normal microflora present in these organs are interfering with the outgrowth of BCG cells under the experimental conditions used by the authors. This way authors can bolster the efficacy of the antibiotic combination in reducing contamination in the mycobacterial cultures.
