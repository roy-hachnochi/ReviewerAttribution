I agree with the previous reviewer about methodological remarks. While wearable devices may help in collecting data and significantly contribute to generate hypotheses or confirm results, their reliability has not been rigorously tested. An advantage of wearable devices is the possibility to collect large amount of data, which is not the case with this paper (n=212). Nevertheless, this work points to the possibility of increasingly available "big data", especially after appropriate validation studies.
