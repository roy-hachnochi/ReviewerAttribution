The paper confirms a weak inverse association between sleep time and BMI using a mainstream consumer activity tracker (fitbit). The aim is to demonstrate the potential for wearables in scientific research. Because of this aim, it would be helpful to get additional information about feasibility aspects: what are the prerequisitions for usability in terms of data collection, how many of the participants had useful data based on which criteria, what strategies are needed for quality control to obtain meaningful associations? Definitions for 'useable data' should therefore be clarified. Sensitivity analyses can provide answers to what elements are important and what factors are secondary for a meaningful data use of consumer trackers.
