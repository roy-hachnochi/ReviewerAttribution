The authors have addressed the concerns raised by the reviewers in the revised version. In the new version there is one misleading statement in the paragraph about TLOs becoming operation centers (pg 5): "In ..EAE they found the following: 1) Expression of CXCL13 by Th17 cells in the CNS;". This statement is not correct - in this reference CXCL13 expression was detected in the CNS of Th17 recipient mice, but the source of CXCL13 are (most likely) not Th17 cells themselves but other cell types like stromal cells. This should be corrected.
