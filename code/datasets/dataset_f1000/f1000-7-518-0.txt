Ahmed et al. report a concise case of an 82 year old female who developed Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TTC) after an acute infectious bacterial Pneumonia. While TTC is usually described in relation to an emotional or physical stressor, this case is unique and contributes to the small existing literature of an infectious precipitant to the syndrome. The clear objective data of an existing echo 10 days prior to admission showing a normal LVEF adds to the clear development of this patient's syndrome as being induced by her multi-lobar pneumonia. This case report is written well with a clear focus on the objective of describing a unique case of TTC precipitated by multi-lobar Pneumonia. As sepsis and Pneumonia are fairly common diagnosis, this case report adds to the growing body of literature that describes infections as being another possible etiology of TTC in addition to emotinal and physical stressors.
