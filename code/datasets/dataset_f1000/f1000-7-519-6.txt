This paper presents new features to an existing cytoscape app namely eXamine. eXamine was initially developed to visualize small graphs and node sets. This new version of the app has automation features for reproducible research. Given the importance of reproducible research, this new version of the app is highly relevant. Figure 2 should really be Figure 1. For someone new to eXamine, it aptly summarizes the app. Also the summary at the end is very clear. It would have been great to have a small dataset and step by step guide through the cytoscape app. Then small R script that I can run to generate the same results. Could you extend it for R users? Do you plan it in future work? If the paper is about automation of eXamine via python, then it should reflect in title. The current name of the paper is misleading.
