In this article, the authors have described their extensions to the popular ReactomeFIViz Cytoscape App to support automation via CyREST. They do an excellent job providing the motivation for their extension. The manuscript was clear and well-written, and I believe that the new REST API's will be quite useful. I do have a problem with the manuscript, however, in that in the Workflow section, they state: "The MAF was then loaded into Cytoscape via the CyREST API to construct a FI sub-network after choosing a sample cutoff to select genes forming a network composed of about 500 genes. The FI-network was then subject to network clustering analysis. Two sets of network modules from network clustering were compared to find modules shared and not shared between these two cancers. Pathway enrichment analysis was performed to collect pathways not shared between them." My problem with this is that they don't provide us with enough detail on the actual CyREST calls and parameters they used to allow us to understand how to reproduce it. Which part of their analysis was done in Python vs. which was done in Cytoscape through the GUI. It is true that all of my answers exist in the Jupyter notebook they provided, but that's a lot of work to figure out that they used the "buildFISubNetwork" method with the "MAF" format the fiVersion "2016". My suggestion is to add at least enough information either in the figure or the text to help others understand the REST flow for their App without referring to the notebook.
