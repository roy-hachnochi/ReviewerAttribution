The authors have used same methodology as we did in our study. This is the usual standard. Please share details of two and three procedures whether they were CABG AVR or CABG MVR or DVR! It would be a better idea to analyse mortality in performance of Euroscore II for isolated CABG and combined procedure separately. Table 3 there is concordance between expected and observed mortalities in subgroups 0-10% and 11-20%. However for 20% there is gross mismatch of expected and observed mortalities. Please share details of 8 patients who died in this group. Did they belong to isolated CABG category or the combined procedure? As suggested above, please separate analysis of performance of Euroscore II for isolated CABG and combined procedures. This will give a true picture of performance in these two distinct groups. It may also explain the reason for underestimation in 20% group and may even improve concordance within results.
