The authors found that LINC00987 is a new long non-coding RNA which is poorly known in lung adenocarcinoma. Using genomic and transcriptomic databases, the authors discovered that LINC00987 is a tumor suppressive non-coding RNA and its expression levels correlate with patientsâ€™ survival. This finding is a good clue to discovering potential roles of LINC00987 in clinical diagnosis and prognosis in lung cancer patients. However, additional data are needed to claim that LINC00987 is a tumor suppressor. My comments are as below. Could any known lung relevant lncRNAs (such as MALAT1) be applied and validated using the database (GEPIA)? Could the author reproduce the data shown in Fig 1b and 1c using a different database to demonstrate differential expressions of LINC00987 in lung adenocarcinoma and normal tissues and survival curve? Could the author validate the differential expression levels for LINC00987 in several lung adenocarcinoma and normal lung epithelial cell lines? Furthermore, could plasmids for LINC00987 be applied to validate the tumor suppressive roles in lung adenocarcinoma cell lines?
