This is an interesting case report describing in a full details a rare recently described mixed odontogenic tumor. I would prefer the authors to suggest further diagnostic test to differentiate peimordial odontogenic tumor from the aggressive odontogenic myxomas especially when cases unexpectedly appear radiographically multilocular radiolucent as in the present case.
