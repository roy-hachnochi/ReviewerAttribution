The case report presented here is a well constructed case, the rarity and novelty of the lesion makes it useful for the clinicians and indeed, as stated, it may lead to a more conservative treatment and save the patient an aggressive treatment. The young age of the patient is interesting and gives a probable reassurance for the parents as only a conservative treatment is needed. A clinical picture for the patient would have been useful if present and also a clinical picture after full recovery. A need to switch the magnification on the histopathologic pictures is to be done.
