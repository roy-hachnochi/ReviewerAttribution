Comparing protein structure with RINspector is an intersting application that allows an easy determination of crucial residues in protein structures. It can be useful for pinpointing specific positions in the protein backbone for further experimental investigations. The paper clearly explains the procedure, and clarifies with test cases the relevance of the application. Software is detailed and reproducible. Figures are clear and appropriate.
