The RINspector app allows network and flexibility analysis of protein structures, which plausibly has the capacity to disclose functionally critical residues. The paper by Brysbaert et al. explains the updated (automated) version of the RINspector app. The new version is stated to work more efficiently than previous one, especially while treating multi-conformers. The paper could further be improved, if the following points are addressed. - The differences between the previous and current version of the program are not clearly stated. It is confusing what is new and what is updated, especially for someone who is not familiar with the RINspector app. Maybe the authors could mention the version numbers explicitly when they make a comparison. - There is a tutorial provided for the initial version of RINspector. A similar tutorial should also be prepared for the use cases presented in this paper. In this way, the users can exactly reproduce what is stated in the manuscript. - Relevant links to the software, the use case folders and scripts should be cited within the text. In the current version, it is hard to link the source code files with the options/conditions stated in the paper. Overall, RINspector app stands a useful resource that would corroborate structural and functional studies in the community.
