The authors investigated cross-sectional associations between smoking and metabolic syndrome (MS) and its components in 2,212 adults from Maracaibo city, Venezuela. They reported that, in the multivariate analysis, the presence of MS, abdominal obesity, hypertriglyceridemia and hypo-HDL cholesterolemia were positively associated with current smoking while high blood pressure was inversely associated with current smoking. There was no significant association between smoking and hyperglycemia. Their data and study methods are fair. However, these results are not novel but well known findings. The authors stated that cigarette smoking represents an independent risk factor for the development of MS in Conclusions. However, this conclusion is incorrect because the authors stated that, regarding the limitations of this study, its cross-sectional design makes it incapable of determining causality. After all, the authors had no data regarding the association between baseline smoking status and incidence (development) of MS which can only be obtained from longitudinal studies.
