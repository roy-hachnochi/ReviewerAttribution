The authors present an R package that helps in the visualisation and analysis of epidemiological contacts. It is a well-presented summary of the capabilities of the software and brings network theory tools to academics from the areas of public health and epidemiology. For version 2 of the manuscript, the authors follow the Introduction with Use cases, which benefits the understanding of how data has to be prepared for input. I followed the examples, and the output that they present about the ebola data set is outdated. I suggest to include the version of the outbreaks package used in the examples. For those not familiar with R, presenting the data with the str command is not clear; to use the command head instead, could be a better option. This is something minor and not needed but would improve the understanding of the software on the most critical point, which is data input. As in version 2, the Use cases section is presented before the Methods section, the last paragraph from the Use cases section needs to be changed from: "methods described above" to "methods described below". The visualisations produced from epicontacts are impressive. For the manuscript to become more accessible to main stream readers, it would need to include the output from the analysis and interpretation.
