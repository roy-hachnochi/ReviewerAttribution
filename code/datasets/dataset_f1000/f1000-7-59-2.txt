I read the paper carefully and find it good and suitable for publication. Only one point in my opinion needs to be clarified before publication as following: The two group of study have named "case and control" although the type of study has mentioned:" comparative descriptive study". There is a conflict that must be clarified. Recommendations for authors: The type of study would be changed to: cross sectional study The name of groups would be change to: with dysmenorrhea / and without dysmenorrhea I hope my recommendation can improve the quality of the paper.
