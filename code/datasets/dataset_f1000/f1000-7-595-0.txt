This paper by Thackray et al. provides an interesting and useful overview of the development and advantages of utilising alternate methods of investigating prion infectivity, such as the Drosophila protocols outlined in this paper. The ethical implications of the paper are well discussed as are the scientific advantages of the method over the ‘gold standard’ murine studies. Overall this paper is well written, concise and a good review of the previous literature of prion-infected Drosophila research. Specific comments: Page 3, paragraph 4 – The authors should consider the fact that cell culture methods have been used to replicate and define human prions in human cell which have also shown capability of sub-passage between cultures 1 . Also recommend reference to this paper later alongside animal ‘gold standard’ comments as the sensitivity of the Drosophila model is unrivalled by human cell culture also and thus supports the Drosophila method. Page 4, preparation of drosophila head homogenate – be more explicit about how fly heads were isolated after vortex. Assume this is done manually? Are there technical issues with other parts of the fly torso impeding recognition of the fly head? If so, how do you overcome this (or does it matter)? Page 5, acclimatisation of flies in the climbing assay pipettes – this section is repetitive to the sentence above. Recommend deleting and moving information about the 30 minute incubation at 25C to sentence above. Recommend addition of simple figures that visualise the sheep fly and fly fly experiments with the results (or a cartoon depiction of the results). Are a suitable application and appropriate end-users identified? Yes If applicable, is the statistical analysis and its interpretation appropriate? Not applicable Are the 3Rs implications of the work described accurately? Yes
