Muschelli, Sweeney, and Crainiceanu have provided researchers (and particularly statisticians) with a useful new tool for analyzing structural neuroimaging data. They cite a number of packages for analyzing and manipulating imaging data, but lack the functionality of Freesurfer. They well document the processes for reading and converting file formats to obtain usable R objects. The examples for plotting, bias-field correction, surface mapping, and brain extraction are clear, concise, and provide readers with enough information to recreate these with their own data. A very minor addition I would like to see would be an example of how to extract the volumetric and segmented volumetric data from a sample of subjects (or from multiple studies on the same subject). These could then be stored in other R objects (vectors, data frames, etc.) to be further analyzed using statistical methodologies. Overall, this is a very nice tool, and I personally am excited to use freesurfer very soon.
