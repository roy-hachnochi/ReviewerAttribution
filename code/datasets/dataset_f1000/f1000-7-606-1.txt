I had already mentioned in my original review that it is useless to look for association of a monophonic allele with a disease and study has zero statistical power. The only conclusion from the present study is that TLR9 C296T/ Pro99Leu polymorphism appears to be monomorphic in Gujrati Indians. However, it again suffers from low sample size. The person designing such study has to understand the basic tenets of genetic epidemiology. Therefore, I do not feel that the manuscript deserves indexing.
