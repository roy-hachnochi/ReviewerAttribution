This paper described an updated approach to deriving the percentage contributions of the direct comparison used in treatment estimates. In the interests of full disclosure, I am not a statistician and was reviewing from the view point of an applied user of NMA. There are several papers on this topic in recent years, and it is an active body of work in this area. The article is straightforward to read, although made considerably more readable if one is aware of the content in references, 3,4 and 5. I have to admit that this is an example of why I appreciate the open review system. I enjoyed the paper and found it easy to read and follow, but the others reviewer's comments were a significant contribution also. I don't have any additional critique of the proposed approach, but I look forward to seeing how the investigators address those or provided some discussion, as this would help the less statistically inclined reader like me. Again, the reason I wanted this, is that I am an applied user and such discussions are very helpful. In particular, I would like to have seen some discussion of the 1st comment. I would also like to see if the comment about Figure 3 could be incorporated - perhaps not feasible. Concerning the approach to calculating the % contribution and how to weight the flows, I came away with the impression that the decision of equal split of the stream flow as arbitrary (perhaps not precisely the correct term) or perhaps pragmatic is better. Therefore, it is not surprising this is a debatable approach. Again, this was another reason why I am looking forward to see the investigators responses to the 1st reviewer's comments. I agree that the comparison of the methods of deriving the percentage contribution would be of interest but was not expecting that to be included. I look forward to this comparison being published.
