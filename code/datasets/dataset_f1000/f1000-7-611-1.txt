In patients with traumatic acute head injury, impaired pulmonary function is a common but poorly understood complication. NPE is a potential early contributor to the pulmonary dysfunction that occurs in patients with head injuries. Although NPE is a frequent complication of traumatic head injury, its occurrence in this specific condition is rarely described. In addition, despite clinical and experimental studies, the mechanisms leading to NPE are not fully understood. As consequence, studying the incidence of NPE after acute head injury is very interesting subject. In this study, in this observational study carried out in Mulago National Referral and Teaching Hospital, Uganda, involving patients who died from head injury. Okello et al had consecutively enrolled subjects into the study upon death over two months (1 st June to 31 st August 2013) Medical records were reviewed and data on patient demographics and progressive medical/surgical management collected. Particularly, data about diagnosis and diagnostic procedures, medication, fluid administration, ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, and surgical procedures carried out. During the study period, twenty-six patients were enrolled in this study. Autopsy showed features consistent with pulmonary edema in 76.9% of patients, being bilateral in 85% of these. All the 15% in whom edema was unilateral had involvement of the right lung. This study suffers from several limitations: 1. There is no hemodynamic exploration for all patients. 2. No electrocardiographic has been reported 3. How pulmonary contusion were excluded? 4. For patients with long bone fractures, how pulmonary fat embolism were excluded? 5. How other causes of pulmonary edema have been excluded: due to severe septic shock! cardiac arrythmia?... 6. Brain CT scan were not performed in all patients All these points represent a several limitations to understand the positive diagnosis and the mechanism of NPE.
