The authors reviewed large number of multiple injuries patients with lower extremity fracture and, in the abstract, concluded that the optimal time for definitive fixation to reduce complications was within 24-48 hours. However, the authors did not clarify the reason for the delay surgery which could be unstable patient condition or operation room availability or other reasons. Complications in these groups could be different and affected the patient outcome. Do we really need to speed up the improvement process of the patient condition to get fracture fixed in 24-48 hours? Can we conclude from this paper that definite fracture treatment before 24 hours is not recommended? For patients whose conditions are stable before 24 hours, should we wait until we get into 24-48 hours period to reduce the inflammatory process? For the conclusion “optimal time for definitive fixation to reduce complications was within 24-48 hours”, are the severity of the injuries, type of injuries, pre-operative conditions of patients, fracture configuration and operative time in this group similar when compare to those of 24 hours and 48 hours groups? Should the authors do subgroup analysis on this point? The percentage of multiple injuries patients with lower extremity fracture who had major complications in the abstract is not equal those on the main manuscript, please correct.
