This is an extremely interesting research paper, well conducted from the methodological point of view and the statistical processing of data, well written and with well documented results. The idea of administering recombinant MBL to newborns with a MBL deficit is not new and could open many unconventional ways in treating neonatal infections. Therefore, studies that increase biological knowledge in this area are very relevant. The observation to be made is that the side effects of MBL are not yet known exactly. MBL, on the one hand, promotes the defense against infections, but on the other if in excess, could by itself generate tissue damage, thanks to induction activity of complement system. This problem is more evident in newborns, who have little biological ability to contain inflammatory up regulation. So until today we do not know if we can safely administer recombinant MBL to human neonates without side effects. That said, which could be cited in discussion, the study is experimental, of great interest because it adds important knowledge (type of bacteria, relationships with prematurity and baseline MBL levels) and in my opinion can be published.
