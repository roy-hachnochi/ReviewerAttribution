This manuscript 'Peculiarities of the formation and subsequent removal of the circulating immune complexes from the bloodstream during the process of digestion' by Sergej B. Landa et al describes the molecularâ€“cellular mechanisms of the formation and utilization of food CICs in humans and rodents. Circulating immune complexes (CICs) are macromolecular structures formed as a result of the specific interaction of antigens with bivalent or multivalent antibodies in biological body fluid. Authors have developed a relatively simple method of determining the CICs, differentiated by the size and class of Igs, which makes it possible to study the structural and functional features of the organization of native ICs. They found the fact numerous macromolecular structures that efficiently scatter light are formed in the plasma after eating and the mechanisms of formation and removal of food ICs in humans and rodents are different. This manuscript provides a new information about special metabolic process in a person, which accompanied by the entry into the blood of relatively large molecular structures, which are not completely digested in the oral cavity and the gastrointestinal path by digestive enzymes into monomers. I think, this is a very interesting work, and this manuscript is worthy of publication in your journal.
