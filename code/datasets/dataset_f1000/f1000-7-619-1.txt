This paper by authors Kareem H and Adams H presents an interesting prospective case series of patients who received an operation for the diagnosis of chronic subdural haematoma which utilised a novel yet seemingly simple, close system irrigation and drainage technique. Their results show a recurrence rate not notably different from that reported in the wider literature. Their result of no pneumocephalus reported in their case series is perhaps the most interesting result. Additionally, they report a short operating time and hospital stay which might represent a potential economic benefit to the health service. It would have been of value to note the clinical course of other patients in the unit who underwent a more standard operative intervention during the same time period, and for this to have been compared. Their paper provides a relevant and helpful review of the existing literature. Their conclusions drawn are measured and balanced, with dutiful awareness of the study's limitations. Their results could pave the way for a meaningful larger study to follow, where rates of recurrence, pneumocephalus and the cost benefit ratio of operating time and hospital stay can be further explored.
