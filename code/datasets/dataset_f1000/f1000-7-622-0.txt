In the revised version, the authors did not respond to all issues raised by the reviewer. Please respond to or rebut each item separately. According to Dominici et al. (2006) 1 , mesenchymal stem cells can be characterized by 1) plastic adherence properties, 2) surface marker expression, and 3) multipotential differentiation ability. This article lacks of mutipotential differentiation test. Hence, the claim of these cells as stem cells isolated from human exfoliated deciduous teeth was not accurate. Indeed, these cells may be dental pulp fibroblast cells. If authors cannot provide the evidences of MSCs in this article or citation from authors previous publication, these cells can be call dental pulp cells. Authors did not mention which time points that they evaluated for cell viability and proliferation. To determine cell proliferation, at least 2 time points are required and the second time points should be longer than the normal doubling time of these cells. Please provide more detail on those reagent used in the study. The catalog number as well as company is crucial information for others to replicate these finding. The main reagents (for example FGF6) were lacking this information. In TEM results, it seems that there were a lot of contaminated substance in MV collection. Would this effect the evaluation of gene expression since the RNA from the cells might also contaminated with MVs RNA? In PCR results, it seems that there was no statistically significant difference. This might be due to the different baseline expression among donors. Plots demonstrated the individual data could help to visualize the trend between control and treatment in each donors. Please indicate n in each experiment. By this "n" meaning the biological replication of the experiments. Please indicate in each experiment. Authors can place it at the figure legend. Overall, the results seems preliminary and required further improvement to strongly support the conclusion claimed by authors. References 1.
