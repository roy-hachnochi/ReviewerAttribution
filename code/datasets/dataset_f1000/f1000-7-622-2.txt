This study is about evaluation of the effect of FGF-6 on SHEDs and assessment of CDK2 and MATK gene expression, in which the authors reported that CDK2 and MATK genes in SHED-derived can be used as molecular biomarkers for proliferation. Add mean and SD of patients and add female to male ratio or male to female ratio. Please provide approval code or public link. For characterization only flow cytometry is not enough, RT-PCR on genes that show mesenchymal stem cells have been isolated would be interested, e.g. STRO1, NANOG, SOX family, OCT4. Or differentiation to osteoblast, chondroblast and adipocytes. Please add a paragraph that show how your results would be helpful to clinical research. Increase the quality of figures. In Figure 3 for CDK2 there are two outliers data. Figure 4 can be removed. Authors can report the correlation as follows in the results section: Expression of CDK2 is positively correlated with cell proliferation in the test group (r=?, P_value:?)
