The authors have made significant improvements to the tool in this revision, addressing a number of points raised in my initial review. However, sadly I was still unable to get the tutorial code to work myself. A number of the steps generated syntax and execution errors making progress impossible. The notebook has some statuses from the authors' previous execution steps with similar error messages, so I don't think that this is just my system (downloading the genome building the index onwards). There seems to be some active development work ongoing in the repository - both a `devel` workbook (better to use git branches instead of separate files), but also some duplicate code blocks in the main notebook. There also seems to be a discrepancy between the introduction text on the main website and on the repository. In summary - I still think that the intention and design of the tool is excellent, and the manuscript text good. However, whilst the tutorial itself seems to be broken and not usable by others, I cannot approve this article. If these issues can be fixed so that it's possible for others to easily run through the tutorial, then I will be happy to approve.
