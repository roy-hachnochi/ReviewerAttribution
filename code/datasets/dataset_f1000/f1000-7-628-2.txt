This article presents a streamlined tool aimed toward novice bioinformaticians who wish to analyze RNA-Seq or ChIP-Seq data in one simple tool. The premise for this tool is excellent. Investigators who are new to these approaches often find the analysis of data daunting and are unsure of the tools to use for each step. SeqAcademy provides a single tool for all the steps in an easy to download package. Given that the target for this tool is investigators who do not have extensive expertise in the tools and analyses available, the article would benefit from more detailed descriptions of some individual components. Specifically, the following: 1. Alignment: The rationale for use of HISAT2 is clearly described. The time needed for this step should be discussed and, if possible, it would be helpful to provide an alternate local tool that could be used if users are unable to maintain consistent internet connectivity over the time needed for alignment completion. 2. RNA-Seq: A critical piece of RNA-Seq analyses are the statistical tools used to define differential expression. Some brief discussion of important cut-offs would be helpful. 3. Most tools incorporated into the package are described in 1-2 sentences. This should be consistent throughout, including for HTSeq, DESeq2. The tool is really quite useful and I believe will be very valuable to novice investigators and students learning the pipeline of RNA-Seq or ChIP-Seq. Given that, it would be very helpful to provide more, not less, explanation of some of the basic tools such that the educational goal of this package will be served.
