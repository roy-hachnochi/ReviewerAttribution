This is a short data report on the molecular identification of Necator americanus in food handlers in Sudan which also serves as a 'proof of concept' for the molecular identification of hookworm species in feces. Although the report is not ‘novel’, it is new information for this region, and important information for public health officials and diagnostic laboratory scientists overall, and the data may be useful for those who study enteric parasites in humans in other regions. I recommend someone that is an expert in the molecular diagnostics of hookworm infections to carefully evaluate the methods- to the best of my knowledge the methods are sound. Major comments: Please include values for the proportion infected and the 95% confidence intervals for all proportions infected/detected reported in your data. I think that the discussion section could be expanded a bit more to include other studies of molecular diagnostics of hookworm and compare the prevalence and detection rates of those studies. Since in Dataset 1 you have complete positive/negative results of each technique, you may also be able to do statistical tests of agreement. In your conclusion, you state that ‘We confirmed that the major hookworm species infecting humans in Sudan is N. americanus .’ I think that a sample size of 350 stool samples is insufficient to make that conclusion. You can say that in your sample population, you confirmed that the major hookworm species infecting humans in Sudan is N. Americans. Minor comments: First sentence Introduction- change ‘were’ to ‘are’ Change’ age of participant’ to ‘age of participants’ Fig 1- is the low molecular weight band a primer dimer?
