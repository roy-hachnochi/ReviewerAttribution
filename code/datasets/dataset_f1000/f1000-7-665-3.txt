The manuscript, "Phenotype profiling of white-nose syndrome pathogen Pseudogymnoascus destructans and closely-related Pseudogymnoascus pannorum reveals metabolic differences underlying fungal lifestyles", describes the comparative analysis of metabolic profiling of 2 closely related fungal pathogens with vastly different hosts and virulence. The manuscript utilizes the well known BioLog system to accomplish the comparison. In general the the study is well designed and executed and the manuscript well written. The conclusions are not surprising considering previous publications regarding the genomics of Pd and its loss of carbon utilization related gene content. Accordingly the impact of the findings on the field are modest and the sophistication of the analysis is simplistic. Regardless the manuscript does support previous findings and although the methods are limited in scope they are sound and well vetted. Accordingly it is my recommendation that the manuscript is acceptable as it is.
