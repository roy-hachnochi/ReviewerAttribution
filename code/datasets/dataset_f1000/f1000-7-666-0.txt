 Title and introduction The title of the manuscript does not provide a precise summary of the paper's content, which is, it does not condense the paper's content, since this refers to environmental impacts of two types of land use, while the content is totally related to water footprint. I suggest to change the title for a better descriptive name, although simple and brief, but including both: Carbon and water footprint. Methods. The authors failed to present a comprehensive methodology to calculate the components of total footprints: Green, blue and grey. A full description of the methods used to calculate these specific footprints is required in order to understand results, and whenever necessary, compare results. Moreover, they should explain why is not necessary to calculate Grey water footprint, for this specific case. Authors should complete the methodology. Figures. Figures 1, 2, and 3 should be more clear, and do not requires number on the bars. Thats why the Y axis exists. Discussion In the first paragraph of the discussion the authors again present the results, which in fact belong more to the results than to properly to the discussion component. As for the other paragraphs, the presented discussion is far too poor, and do not interpret and describe the significance of the findings in light of what was already known in this field of the science. It needs to be completed. The authors should present a new discussion based on: Authors should demonstrate their ability to think critically about the reported and formulate through the discussion session a more profound understanding of the research problem under investigation, To denote possible implications of the results and explore possible improvements that can be made in order to further develop the research topic To state how the findings from this study revealed new gaps in the literature that had not been previously exposed or adequately described.
