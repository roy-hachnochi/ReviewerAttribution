In the abstract, the presented results refer only to the water footprint calculated for the conventional system. Without the missing information, is not possible to follow your conclusions, presented in the abstract but not in the document. The introduction of the manuscript does not provide the reader a context to understand the importance of this study. This is, for example, the relevance of agroecology, the current politics about it, or the significance of tomatoes in particular or agriculture in general for the region where the study was carried out. I believe the earlier would enhance the study. The study sites and their location would be clearer presented in a table or in a figure. In a table would be interesting add, besides the coordinates, some information about the field characteristics, since I suspect it has a relationship with the results obtained. Particularly, it would be interesting if helps to explain the huge differences you found among plots. Also, and related to the earlier, it would be necessary to justify why you decided to work with 3 plots in each assessed system. This is a big concern to me due to the differences presented in fig. 1... there is no explanation in the document and is it must be statistically supported. Fig 2. and Fig. 3 are not relevant since they are not showing new information. Finally, it is important to review the references. I.e, #9 says IPCCc, but it actually refers to Eggleston et al. Also, the letter c does not have sense if there is no a or b. In general, English needs to be reviewed.
