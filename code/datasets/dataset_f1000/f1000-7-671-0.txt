The paper should provide a clear problem statement and literature review to provide a rationale for the study. There is no overview of the literature of previous similar studies, and the added value of the current study is thus not clear. The method to perform a 24 food recall and just 3 days food record is likely way too short to get an impression of food intake of patients, which can vary over weeks. The use of this methodology is not sustained. And since this methodology does not seem appropriate, I judge that the conclusions cannot be drawn. The discussion mixes concepts: data obtained in longitudinal risk and epidemiological studies in pre-dementia patients address a different subject than the current study trying to study the cross sectional food intake in established dementia patients. Alzheimer disease should be diagnosed using state of the art criteria (e.g. including biomarkers, see Jack et al Neurlology 2018)
