The aim of this study is to know the most frequently reported drugs associated to adverse drug reactions (and DDIs) in order to prioritize the efforts for clinical pharmacology consultation services. I find this manuscript interesting. Comments: Just to clarify, please confirm that adolescent age is considered from 12 to 17 yo. I agree about the utility of knowing the most frequently reported drugs associated to adverse drug reactions; the author should mention some other similar studies previously published 1 - 4 . I also like the concept that a better knowledge of the most frequent drugs producing AEs can drive prioritization of efforts for clinical pharmacology consultation services. However: - Authors should give a more detailed description of the design (case/non-case ?) and statistical methods allowing calculation of OR. - We should not disregard the potential of this analysis to rise hypothesis about the link between the AE, DDIs and drug PK and pharmacogenetics. A comment by the authors would be useful. - I also think that it would be useful for readers to provide a more specific comment about the relationship between pharmagenomics and AEs whose knowledge could improve drug safety. For example, CYP2D6 polymorphisms have been related to weight gain and hyperprolactinemia in patients with risperidone (including adolescents). On the other side, the association of ondansetron with pneumothorax could be a confounding by indication and not a true causal association. Although not new, it is interesting also the finding that frequently reported indications for risperidone were non-approved indications by FDA and that top fifteen reported drugs associated with DDIs are prescribed in patients treated for mental health disorders.
