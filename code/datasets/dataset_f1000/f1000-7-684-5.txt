Overall fair manuscript with sound finding and relevant area of study. Can much be improved with grammar check and essential scientific writing reorganisation especially in Introduction and Discussion section. Inclusion of results for negative control (untreated biofilm) would critically improve Results presentation and appreciation of findings. Lacks relevant information on findings between smoker and non-smoker in the study that may not strongly support the conclusion on the anti-fungal effect of agent on smoker.
