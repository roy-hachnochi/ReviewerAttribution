This was an interesting report of a common clinical occurrence relating to membrane exposure following oral guided bone regeneration procedures. Some existing evidence suggests that exposure is more common with non-resorbable membranes as seen in this report. This is a very well documented progression showing and discussing the progression of exposure, infection, surgical intervention, and resolution. The report mentions several times the observation of the “red jelly like” substance. This is clearly osteoid that has been formed and not lost due to the infection. Some research is available discussing the speed of formation (1-3 weeks post grafting, but not much is available discussing the formation and stability in the setting of membrane exposure or infection. Therefore, I would recommend this manuscript be considered for indexing with the addition of a brief review or mention of osteoid formation timeline in the discussion.
