FEV1 as a percent of predicted is widely used as an outcome measure in patients with cystic fibrosis and is one of the metrics used to compare centres or countries in benchmarking exercises. This manuscript presents data showing that differences in data processing and the use of different reference equations used to estimate FEV1 as a percent predicted can result varying estimates of lung disease changes and potentially impact comparisons of centres/countries. The paper supports the standardization of FEV1 collection and reference equations which is currently in development by CF International Registries. It also highlights that different approaches to data collection can impact the interpretation of statistical analyses. Comments: Differences in FEV1 percent predicted using different equations is well known (Rosenfeld et al 1 and more recently in the cited UK/US comparison study). For this reason, the GLI have been recently accepted as the standard for most CF registries. Although year to year subtraction is a method of looking at longitudinal changes, regression methodology is preferable to analyse these changes, especially, as in this case, where you have 3 time points. This also allows to adjust for baseline factors such as lung disease severity. The method of adjustment for baseline Iung function is a bit crude. The medians subtracted are from a US population over 10 years ago and are likely to overestimate lung function decline in this population. In the Morgan et al, J Pediatr 2016 paper cited, the benefits of using this type of adjustment was shown using regression. Did their statistical approach factor in that these were repeated measures in the same patients? Bland Altman plots comparing different reference equations could be considered. The results suggest that height inaccuracy is impacting the results. As this is a single centre study, it is difficult to determine is this is a more universal problem.
