The authors report an increase in heart rate and SBP in HIV+ individuals for sitting compared to standing while performing the SCT. This fluctuation in cardioautonomic functioning is interpreted as orthostatic hypertension. The analyses seems appropriate however, the study has some limitations that appear to mitigate the impact of the paper. Besides the small sample size this study may be have been prone to selection bias. The authors report "The Physical Therapist from the Center identified possible participants for this study". The lack of randomization provided by a general recruiting strategy may have resulted in a bias to select HIV patients for the study based upon symptomology, thus oversampling for OH. This is a serious limitation and should be mentioned to the reader. Were the patients virally-suppressed? Were they on standard anti-retroviral therapy and for how long? With regards to the cardio-metabolic function what percentage of the sample were hypertensive as this may perpetuate the blood pressure responses to postural adjustments. It is perplexing why a control group was not recruited, particularly due to the small sample size of HIV+ individuals.
