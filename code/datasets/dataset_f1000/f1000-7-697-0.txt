Temporomandibular disorders (TMD) in many patients constitute one of the most frequent causes of non-dental pain in the orofacial region. It is universally accepted that the etiology of TMD is multifactorial, including the structural factors such as mandibular asymmetry. However, a mild degree of asymmetry in the craniofacial region is common in humans, including in individuals with a normal facial appearance. These patients often present with complain of impaired facial appearance and occlusal malfunction, which underlines the importance of this subject. The literature shows that the Temporomandibular joint internal derangement is also associated with mandibular asymmetry. Nevertheless, how skeletal discrepancies in mandibular asymmetry relate to TMJ disorders is still debatable. This article by Ervina Sofyanti et al is a great step towards evaluating the association between TMD symptoms and vertical mandibular asymmetry in 106 young adult orthodontic patients in North Sumatra, Indonesia. The results of this study show that there is no significant correlation between vertical mandibular asymmetry and TMD symptoms. For better clarity and understanding, especially for the readers who are new to this subject, it would be appropriate if the authors could provide more details on Kjellberg's technique in the 'Methods' section. To enhance it further, it should include the exclusion criteria as well. Modern dental practice is focused on individualized diagnosis and treatment planning. Considering extreme variations in morphological and functional characteristics of an individual patient, it would be interesting to design a study involving these factors to fine-tune the results. This is because presence or absence of functional disturbances determines the discrepancy at the joint level in sagittal, vertical and transverse planes. The authors have done well in this interesting research work.
