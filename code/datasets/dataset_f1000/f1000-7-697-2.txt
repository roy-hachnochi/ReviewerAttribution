Overall your paper is very good and well done, but here are some minor suggestions: Could you please state more about the Kjellberg’s technique, it is not well described in the methods section of your paper? Could you please inform about the study design (descriptive or analytic study)? Could you please inform about the sampling method and how to determine the sample size? You only mention the inclusion criteria, what about the exclusion criteria? Please mention it. Please mention and inform who examined the patient? How to examine the patient? Please explain. How about the competency of the examiner? How many people? How to calibrate each examiner’s perception. Please mention also who is in charge for radiographic image interpretation?
