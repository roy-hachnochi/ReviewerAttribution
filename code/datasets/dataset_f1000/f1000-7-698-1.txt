This is a well constructed piece of research which examines the diagnostic value (sensitivity and selectivity) of anti-Jo-1 positivity when detected by standard ENA testing in a large teaching hospital. The results clearly show that Jo-1 positivity is not particularly predictive of myositis or ILD, as many other non-CTD conditions can also be associated with a positive result. This is rather surprising, but the authors explain why this outcome. The reviewer has no negative comments to make about this article, but is not a statistical expert, so the view of a statistician may be warranted.
