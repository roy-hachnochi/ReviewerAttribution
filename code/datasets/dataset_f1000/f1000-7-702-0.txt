I think the comments raised in the previous review have not been sufficiently addressed. Perhaps a point by point discussion and reply by the authors will be helpful. Specifically: It is still not clear as to what is meant by 1000-fold CV on a data set with 70 samples of ~ 1400 features each. If I understand correctly based on the added text and discussion by Reviewer 2, since each sample had longitudinal data and ~ 1400 features, perhaps the longitudinal data was split up into multiple samples? If this is so, please specify clearly how this was done and what the new dimensions of the data set were, instead of 70 X 1486. Supplementary Figures 1 and 2 still link to ROC curves rather than pathway data, as written in the text. The link to HMP2 metadata in the article, under Methods-Subject Selection gives a 404 error. Again, a point by point rebuttal of the comments from the first and second round of reviews, along with any appropriate modification to the article, will be helpful for readers and for reviewing the article.
