Non-invasive brain stimulation techniques are based on generating, either magnetically or electrically, electric fields that can alter brain neuronal activity. However, the generated electric fields can vary greatly depending on the individual anatomy of the scalp, skull and brain. This data note presents a collection of 38 individual head models (both healthy and patients) that can be used for characterisation of variability in the electric fields. Head models were constructed from T1-weighted MRI using freely available software: FreeSurfer, SPM12 and SimNIBS. Manual verification and corrections were applied when necessary. The approach is state of art. The datasets are provided in the Gmsh format, which can be used directly in modelling software or converted to multiple other formats using open-source software. Furthermore, raw data, including FreeSurfer subject data, are included, allowing further processing and adaptation of the data. Minor comments: 1. In the text and Figures 1 and 2, it is written that the head models are segmented to six tissue types. Actually, it seems that there are more than six tissue compartments, as cerebellar GM and cerebellar WM are separate from the cerebral GM and WM. Also, at least some air cavities are segmented (missing from the caption of figure 2). 2. Brainstem is segmented as cerebellar white/grey matter. It may be helpful to list this as a limitation, for instance, in "Creation of head models". 3. In the abstract, sentence "... effects of non-invasive brain stimulation ...", and in "Dataset validation", sentence "The scripts used for automated simulation of tDCS effects for all head models ...". Electric fields are not "effects".
