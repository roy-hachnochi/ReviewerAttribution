The current study examines male Fmr1 knockout mice in the Morris Water maze. This group focuses on the FVB strain as previous work has shown background strain differences can impact the phenotype of Fmr1 knockouts. The authors show that the male Fmr1 knockout mice have no impairment in acquisition of spatial memory but do show differences in the reversal learning paradigm that are not attributed to vision or motor differences. In the reversal learning paradigm, the authors show that during the 4 blocks of reversal learning the Fmr1 KOs show a rather stable latency to find the platform in contrast to the WT mice that show the expected decrease to reach the platform with increasing trials. The authors highlight the finding that male Fmr1 knockout mice have deficits in reversal learning as assessed in the Morris water maze but not in acquisition, demonstrating a link to a specific form of learning in this paradigm. The study is straightforward and the data clearly presented. A couple of comments the authors should further clarify: The authors should elaborate on the breeding scheme as they are not directly comparing littermate controls. Based on the authors discussion point regarding potential sex differences between male and female Fmr1 KO mice, is there data to suggest differences in cognitive flexibility between the males and female KOs?
