 Methods: Kindly include the research question being answered. Study design needs to be made clearer in this section. Measurement of study factors: Kindly specify important co-infections and co-morbidities. Sample size consideration/selection: how were the centres selected? It is not clear how the size of 100 patients was arrived at. If the sample size and record selection was arbitrary this should be stated as a limitation of the study. What is standardised data collection? If this study is looking for variations, what of the similarities? The method section should give more background information on the centres chosen. This will include the health care worker/patient ratio, patient load and type of care provided to the patients. What are the effects of missing values on the study findings? Efforts should be made by the authors to highlight reasons for missing values. A statement on the best way to address the missing values should be stated. What is the new information that this study added to the literature?
