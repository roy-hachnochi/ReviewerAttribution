The paper is well written, however in some instances the authors have used outdated references. In the case of Nigeria where there are 2 health facilities with different caseloads per month, the authors could also enlighten us on the impact of having a high and low case load as presented. The authors should also enlighten us on whether the records indicate the dates when the CD4 count and viral load tests were taken and when they were reported back. I suppose this of great importance since, there are reports of patients who have their blood samples taken and never receive results. 1) Is The study design appropriate and is the work technically sound? The study design wand the work is technically, as the authors endeavoured to analyse multi-country settings 2. Are sufficient details of methods and analysis provided to allow replication by others? The methods and analysis were sufficient, however in the case of Nigeria where there are 2 health facilities with different case loads per month; the authors could also enlighten us on the impact of having a high and low case load as presented. 3. If applicable, is the statistical analysis and its interpretation appropriate? The statistical analysis was appropriate, although the authors should also enlighten us on whether the records indicate the dates when the CD4 count and viral load tests were taken and when they were reported back. I suppose this of great importance since, there are reports of patients who have their blood samples taken and never receive results. 4. Are the conclusions drawn adequately supported by the results? The authors however need to address the issues that have been raised above.
