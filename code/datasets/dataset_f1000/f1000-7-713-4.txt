This article by Musa and colleagues uses a snapshot of patient records from four HIV clinics in Nigeria, Zambia and Uganda to describe the variability in a number of patient measures. Data are not reported longitudinally and all analysis is descriptive. The most useful part of this report is to show that ordinary clinics in countries with some of the highest HIV burdens globally do not confirm with WHO guidelines. For instance, only commencing ART when CD4 cells 350/ul. Further, the high amount of missing data in viral loads suggest there are logistical or cost challenges to routine testing. It is perhaps unsurprising that clinics in different countries vary in their patient characteristics and levels of reporting. The variability in CD4 counts is not particularly informative as it is not linked to length of time under ART. No research questions are addressed. Table 2 should be amended as some percentage values are missing and figures are presented to different numbers of significant figures. Despite the descriptive nature of the study, the authors are to be commended on presenting hard to access data from routine health care settings in sub-Saharan Africa. I hope that they will be able to take longitudinal data in the future and better understand how clinical practice in these settings is linked to patient outcomes.
