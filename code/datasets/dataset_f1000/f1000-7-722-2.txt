Thank you for the response to my comments. I have two minor suggestions: I'm still a little confused by the percentages of IDP use. In the abstract 53% are reported to be required to complete the IDP, and the same number is reported as a usage rate in the first sentence of the results section. Does that mean that 100% of respondents required to complete an IDP did so? And 0% of non-required respondents? Also, 37.4% completed an IDP with their advisor and 26.1% didn't -- that adds up to 63.5%, not 53%. Can you explain this discrepancy? At the start of the IDP effectiveness section, can you state what fraction of those that complete an IDP find it effective? It may be useful to put this in the abstract as well, as a point of comparison to the 33% of all respondents that find it useful.
