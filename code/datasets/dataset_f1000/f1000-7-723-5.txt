The manuscript is well written and interesting to read. While the findings are not entirely new, they warrant continued attention because of the current interest in the apoptosis effects of areca nut for oral cancer treatment. However, I see the following issues that should be clarified/resolved before indexing this paper: 1. Ethic statements. It is unclear whether the cell line has been authenticated, and the methods make no statement that an ethics committee or institutional review board approved the study, which involves the use of human cell lines. If the authors received ethical approval, please include the name of the ethics committee and the approval number. 2. In the results section, the figures should be made clearer using the appropriate graphing software. 3. The discussion section needs to be elaborated. While the discussion includes references to the previous studies, it has not been discussed whether the findings of the study corroborate or contradict those of similar previous studies. In addition, it would be better if the authors discuss the important signaling elements MAPK's and NFÎºB signaling pathways related to areca nut extract in cancer cells. The discussion appears to be redundant with the results and conclusion section. The discussion also lacks information regarding the limitations and implications of the study. 4. There is no acknowledgment section in the manuscript. The author should acknowledge anyone who contributed to the study but did not meet the authorship criteria. 5. There are grammatical errors in the manuscript. The language needs to be improved.
