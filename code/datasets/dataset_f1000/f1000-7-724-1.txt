This is an interesting and well-written case report of a disease which poses a significant difficulty in relation to its diagnosis and management. The main comments which I think may improve and enrich this study are the following: The discussion should include a more profound comment on the therapeutic options available for the cases when the bleeding does not stop after interrupting Warfarin, mainly radiological and surgical interventions. The discussion should also include some comments on hematomas which arise on other segments of the gastrointestinal tract, such as stomach and duodenum, since they are close to the topic reported.
