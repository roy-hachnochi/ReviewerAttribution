This Cytoscape app provides functionality that is widely useful for Cytoscape users for converting network identifiers to different databases. Some points not completely clear: The list of regular expressions used for inference, do they come from identifiers.org? What happens if the inference fails? Does the app try to pick the closest matching regular expression? For use of RCy3, is RCy3 a generic package to interact with any REST function in any Cytoscape package? Or did the developers of RCy3 specially include the mapTableColumn function to access the idmapper app?
