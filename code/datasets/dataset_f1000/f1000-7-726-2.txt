The article studied the effect of addition of pluronic F127 on the PVC membrane morphology and performance. The article needs Minor Revision. Introduction The authors should do a comparison between this work and other previous work in terms of different surfactant additions, rejection % and permeability. In section membrane preparation I think this is wrong - thickness in micrometer (0.450 m too thin) the wet thickness using most knifes or applicators can reach to 0.45 mm or 450 micrometer Explain where PF127 is added - is it added in polymeric solution or in coagulation bath? SEM section SEM section need more discussion, explain why the addition of 3% PF127 in fig 2b indicates the biggest finger like formation compared to 5 and 7%? Membrane hydrophilicity Explain how the PEO effects the membrane, with a reference? Membrane Shrinkage The method of measuring shrinkage is not correct, it depends on the length of wet membrane, which means the blend membrane will absorb more water due to hydrophilicity, so I think that can affect the wet length of the membrane. See this reference and repeat your shrinkage experiment: Bilad M et al , 2015 1 Conclusion Re-write the conclusion in points to indicate your results clearly.
