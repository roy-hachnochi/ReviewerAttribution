Identifying paths through complex networks is a common use case. The PathLinker app provides a nice approach via GUI or scripting. The methods and use cases are detailed and clear. The provided Python Notebook is especially handy. My only suggestions for future versions of this work would be to support table column-based specification of sources and targets (already mentioned in your summary) as well as an R Markdown version of your script. The RCy3 package should make it easy to translate as it is analogous to py2cytoscape.
