The article seems to provide enough evidence for the proposed goal, which basically was to induce skin repair in a critical size wound equivalent to 2nd to 3rd degree burns in depth, using an engineered biomembrane based on collagen type I. The biggest challenge was to gather enough subjects eligible to the study, presenting only 2 cases isn't ideal, but expected since real cases for clinical trials are difficult to respond to all criteria to be included. For further studies these criteria should be flexed to maximize the number of subjects included, specially if the exclusion of those were related to unsuccessful results, cut to not compromise the product. A larger number of subjects is desirable and for clinical trials mandatory. Nevertheless for this level of initial trial and concept it is acceptable and the results were remarkable. Another point to be kept for the following research is to give a molecular approach to the biopsies. Basic histology just present the morphological aspects of the tissue and it would be interesting to gather from these same samples an immunohistochemistry analysis to characterize the molecular content of the formed tissue looking for proteins related to repair and healing, but also for inflammatory and regulatory markers that play an important role in those process. This would give a enormous depth to the consolidation of the material and present more reliable and straightforward data for comparison.
