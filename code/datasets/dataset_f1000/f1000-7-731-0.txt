This paper focuses on a specific clinical sign of disconnection following corpus callosum damage, unilateral apraxia. The authors point out that focal damage to the corpus callosum is rare and may present a diagnostic challenge. I only partly agree, as damage to the corpus callosum is at least occasionally observed following ischemic stroke to one of the pericallosal arteries, though in this case the damage is often not confined to the corpus callosum, but also involves medial frontal cortex and cingulate cortex. I also think that such injury presents only a diagnostic challenge when the examiner does not specifically focus on symptoms of callosal disconnection. The body and genu of the corpus callosum carry fibers connecting pre-motor and parietal cortices of the two cerebral hemispheres which are necessary for the coordination of bilateral actions. When reading this case report I was surprised to notice that the authors observed apraxia of the left hand, but did not examine callosal transfer by asking the patient to execute bilateral actions. Besides alien hand syndrome, corpus callosum damage is known to result in diagonistic dyspraxia. This is a movement disorder of the left arm/hand characterized by movements that are antagonistic or symmetrical to the right hand, as well as the occasional inability to move the left arm (though force is typically preserved). Similarly to alien hand syndrome, this disorder suggests an impairment of voluntary control, and some patients report that their hand feels disobedient or has 'its own personality'. Such impairments appear sufficiently mysterious to be mistaken as psychiatric symptoms. The current case is interesting because of the isolated corpus callosum damage, but one would have wished a thorough examination of disconnection signs other than unilateral apraxia.
