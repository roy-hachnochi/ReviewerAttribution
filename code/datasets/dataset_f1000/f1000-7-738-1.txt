The author describe a case of acute PE initially masquerading as acute MI. The authors do a good job presenting a manuscript that is easy to read. However, there are a few points to be noted: Introduction: The authors on citing the cost of care for PE rely on an old article whereas there are more recent articles providing more current cost estimates. See citation added below 1 . The authors use of punctuation marks while describing the characteristics of chest pain needs to be reviewed. Is "in this visit" the right phrase to use or "on this visit" the proper one? A review of this sentence "Oxygen saturation dropped to 91% in room air while the patient laid on catheterization table but improved with supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula" is needed. The authors would do well to provide an image of the coronary angiogram and CTA PE protocol. Post coronary angiogram, while in the cath lab, did the patient still complain of chest pain, was he tachypneic, or in distress that led to desaturation to 91%? A lot health care providers will not get a CTA chest for O2 saturation of 91% without other symptoms. On seeing normal coronary arteries, prior symptoms could have been ascribed to MINOCA.
