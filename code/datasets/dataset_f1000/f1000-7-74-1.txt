On the topic of high drug pricing in the US, the authors present an interesting case and thoughtfully discuss it's potential implications. I appreciate their attempt to quantify the prevalence of future potential cases, but felt this effort could have been more systematic and involved other OECD countries. On motivation, I think it would have been preferable article construction to start with the problem of the pricing of new drugs in the US, particularly orphans, and then located this as a "special" case. Generally, the authors could have better described the tradeoffs presented in this case regarding access - entry facilitates wider access to a drug that may help American patients suffering from disease, but also creates access and affordability concerns due to the aggressive pricing practices of it's manufacturer. Within this context, the authors insight that this case highlights the special role the FDA may play in altering pricing incentives drug manufacturers face in the US is good and particularly helpful. Some of the terminology used in the article to discuss the current political debate regarding high prices - notably the public pursuit of "punishing" manufacturers for high prices - is a bit too dismissive and could be revised. Besides from naming and shaming through the press and Congressional hearings, there has been little "punishment" doled out to manufacturers that pursue such aggressive pricing behavior. What punishment exists is related to pricing practices that are specifically illegal as defined by laws and statutes. The main point here should be that the manufacturer's aggressive pricing practices may hurt American patients' access to care and presents real tradeoffs to payers; what to do about this, if anything, is a real concern for patients, their families and policymakers.
