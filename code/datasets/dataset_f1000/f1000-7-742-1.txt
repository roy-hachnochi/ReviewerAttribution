In particular, the authors addressed the wording issues that we pointed out in the previous review. E.g. 1) Instead of claiming that "BioConda is the most popular package manager", the author has rephrased it into "Bioconda is a popular package manager". 2) They removed the recommendation to use alpine altogether to consistent with the sample docker. We also tested the provided sample docker file. We were able to build the container and to run it successfully. A small issue is that it takes almost 20 Gb traffic to build the container, resulting in 1.3 Gb docker image --contradicting their recommendation to reduce container as small as possible.
