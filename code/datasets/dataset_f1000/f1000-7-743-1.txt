The authors present an update to their successful CyTargetLinker app for Cytoscape. This update extends the basic capabilities of CyTargetLinker by generalizing some concepts and adding automation functionality. The article is clear and well-written and succinctly outlines the major point of the article and the features the article is going to focus on. They present three use cases, which outline the automation capabilities nicely. I did have several issues that I believe should be addressed to support users trying to follow the instructions and to elucidate more clearly the functionality of the new automation features. First, the instructions point to a GitHub repository for the three use cases, however, I could only find two use cases in the repository. This should absolutely be fixed before approval. Second, the authors state that both the ChEMBL and OMIM linksets are available on the CyTargetLinker website. Unfortunately, only the ChEMBL linkset is provided. The OMIM linkset is provided in the github repository, however, once the file is unzipped. It wasn't clear to me why the authors chose to provide the data as a zip file in UseCase1, but just provide the unzipped directories in UseCase2. I would suggest just to leave the files unzipped in UseCase1 in the same way you do for UseCase2. Third, to support general understanding of the automation, I would add the CyTargetLinker commands you actually execute to achieve the results. For UseCase1, this would be: "cytargetlinker extend idAttribute=\"display name\" linkSetFiles=\"/tmp/cytargetlinker-tutorials/R/UseCase1/LinkSets/chembl_23_hsa_20180126.xgmml,/tmp/cytargetlinker-tutorials/R/UseCase1/LinkSets/rare-disease-gene-associations-hsa-20180411.xgmml\" network=current". Obviously, the paths could be truncated, so something like: "cytargetlinker extend idAttribute=\"display name\" linkSetFiles=\" path /chembl_23_hsa_20180126.xgmml, path /rare-disease-gene-associations-hsa-20180411.xgmml\" network=current" This would make it much easier for app writers to utilize your command features without having to look through the R source code. And, as mentioned before, I couldn't find UseCase3. Finally, as a suggestion, it would be nice to have the functionality to create a linkset from a csv file as part of the app so the user wouldn't need to download and execute it separately. Overall, I'm enthusiastic about the app and the new capabilities, and would be happy to approve it after the above major changes are made.
