The authors add new features to the Open PHACTS APIs which facilitate querying reactions in WikiPathways. Some comments: In the first example, the query for AKT2 in the figure 1 uses http://identifiers.org/ensembl/ENSG00000105221 but the result in the figure 2 shows http://identifiers.org/ncbigene/208 . I guess the API should be able to accept different commonly used identifiers, however, either the article or the web interface mention about the acceptable identifiers. In addition, It would be nice if the input of the query accepts simple identifiers, instead of constructing the full URI. The result in figure 2 is difficult to interpret. It would be nice to expand the query to get the basic information for those interacting entities. For example, the gene symbol or the compound name. The examples in figure 3 and figure 4 didn't show the query results. Simple queries in the examples may be difficult to show the usefulness of the new implemented APIs. A more sophisticated application which contains either bulk query or pipeline query should be helpful for the readers to understand the demand of using the APIs.
