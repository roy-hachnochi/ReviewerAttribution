The authors have responded to most of my concerns. They increased the number of RNA sequences and included published data in their analysis. Though some concerns are left, the overall conclusion of this study – that is, purine-rich sequences interact with various different RNAs – supports the notion that regulatory RNAs may target transcriptional co-activators to distinct genomic loci via Hoogsteen interactions with purine-rich gene sequences.
