The manuscript describes an application of the Triplexator software for search possible binding sites of the imprinting related MEG3 linc RNA on the human genome. The authors give a good example of the statistical analysis of the results. The main paper about this software has 62 references (google scholar data). Most of them have only reference to the software and only a few of them used the Triplexator. Only a few reports show a success story about the application of the Triplexator software and comparison the results with an experiment. In some papers, a significant enrichment of triplex targets on regions of interest was found. But they did not analyze the specificity of the predicted triplex formation. The current paper focused on a specificity of the Triplexator predictions. The authors got unexpected results that the Triplexator gives many non-specific hits for the case. Comments: Description of similar transcripts and the parameters of the Triplexator software should be rearranged because the appearance of some RNA names before definition sounds strange. The parameters of the Triplexator software contains a reference to the BE2L6 RNA while the description of the control RNA set has a reference on UBE2L6. The di-nucleotide shuffling seems more adequate for RNA analysis. In one paper 1 the Triplexator software also was used for analysis of MEG3 RNA-DNA contacts. The comparison of the obtained results with the results of given manuscript should be provided. Seems in current manuscript a more accurate analysis with good controls was provided. It would be good to look at the practice of using the program on literature and make sure that the program has a sufficiently low specificity.
