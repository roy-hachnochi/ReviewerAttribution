The authors provide a review manuscript highlighting the role of a specific surgical modality in the realm of prostate cancer survivorship. They initially start by providing a concise review of ED after RP. Under "Surgical Considerations," they begin to discuss specific steps of the penile implantation surgical process. I felt they provided a good review on the separate domains of penile implant surgery. However, I would avoid specific surgeon bias specific steps such as the first sentence under "Technique of corporal measurement," where the author's state, "After corporotomy, PDS 2-0 stay sutures..." This is NOT a surgical techniques manuscript, it is a review of the topic at hand.
