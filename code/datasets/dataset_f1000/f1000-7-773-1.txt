Galmn et al have written an important paper comparing liver movement during computer-assisted liver thermal ablation using high frequency jet-ventilation (HFJV) compared to conventional ventilation. The study includes 5 patients treated with open liver tumor ablations and both methods are used in each patient showing a significant and clinically relevant reduced liver movement with HFJV. As pointed out by the authors, liver displacement must be as small as possible when performing liver ablations, to reduce the risk of missing the lesion. A few minor comments In the method section it is stated that only patients with less then 20 tumors were included, but according to table 1. patient number 5 had 30 lesions, maybe this should be corrected. The reason for treating these patients with open surgery is unclear to me and this could possibly be explained in the method section. In the discussion the abbreviation ENT is not explained but may possibly be of value for some readers. It would be most interesting to see the same kind of study performed in the percutaneous setting.
