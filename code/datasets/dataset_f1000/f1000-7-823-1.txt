this is a clearly-written summary of the updated aMatReader API. This tool will be useful for reading in certain types of networks (e.g. correlation networks) into Cytoscape. A few additional thoughts: A description of how the tool works from within Cytoscape would be a nice addition to the paper for the less-computationally-savvy users of Cytoscape. It would be useful for the authors to clarify that for directed networks, rows in the input file represent "source" nodes and columns "target" nodes. I found the discussion section too short. Additional discussion on how aMatReader overcomes the limitation described, and/or when there is an advantage to the matrix format over an adjacency list representation would be useful.
