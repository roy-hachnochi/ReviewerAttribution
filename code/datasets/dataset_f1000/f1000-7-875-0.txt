This observational pilot study was designed to evaluate the feasibility of monitoring the autonomic nervous system response to intraoperative stress (intubation and skin incision), by a novel and unique multi-parameter device, the nociception level index (NOL) compared to the heart rate response (HR) under sevoflurane general anesthesia for VATS. For the skin incision, the authors separated the patients in 2 groups of 8 each: 100 mg lidocaine bolus through an epidural catheter versus 1 mcg/kg intravenous fentanyl. The authors showed that NOL variations were more sensitive than HR variations in detecting the skin incision stress. This pilot study confirmed the reliability of monitoring by the NOL the autonomic response after the two most common intraoperative stresses (intubation and skin incision). Despite several limitations that have been well-discussed by the authors (not randomized, high basal NOL values in the epidural group), these encouraging results have to be confirmed by future larger studies and compared to other available nociception monitoring devices (SPI, Analgesia Nociception Index) in various clinical settings. Future studies should also focus on the clinical impact of monitoring nociception by the NOL in terms of postoperative pain and analgesic consumption.
