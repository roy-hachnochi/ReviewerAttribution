This is an interesting study where authors retrospectively compared the safety and efficacy of primary trabeculectomy with Mitomycin C and Ahmed glaucoma valve (AGV) implantation in patients with Fuchs heterochromic iridocyclitis (FHIC)-related glaucoma. Esfandiari et al hypothesized that Ahmed glaucoma drainage devices, would have a lower failure rate compared to trabeculectomy and based on their results, authors successfully conclude that Primary AGV implantation had a higher success rate than trabeculectomy, with patients also needing fewer medications for the management of FHIC-associated glaucoma. Though there is a general trend towards utilizing minimally invasive angle based surgeries, authors have done a timely job in evaluating trabeculectomy and AGV since there is greater risk of failure of glaucoma surgery consequent of trabecular meshwork fibrosis and steroid response in FHIC associated glaucoma. This study gives insight into designing a randomized control trials comparing device-assisted trabeculectomy with conventional trabeculectomy and glaucoma drainage device in the future.
