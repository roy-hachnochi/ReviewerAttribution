This study was conducted to determine factors contributing towards mothers’ adherence to optimal infant and young child feeding practices for children under 2 years. The study investigators adopted cross sectional design and purposive sampling methods. The data was collected at randomly-selected health centres. The authors reported baseline SES characteristics of study participants and mothers’ characteristics. They also reported mothers’ practices on few IYCF indicators. They presented simple descriptive analysis. The authors did not provide analysis and discussion regarding the main objective of the study: factors influencing mothers’ adherence to optimal IYCF practices for babies below two years. This study has limited scope and interest of audience at a larger scale. Further, the data collection tools used are not appropriate especially the question asked to determine EBF rates. The language needs some revision. The analysis section needs more elaboration. This paper wouldn’t be accepted for indexing as there are major issues in the paper and the authors need to do further analysis and then draw conclusions.
