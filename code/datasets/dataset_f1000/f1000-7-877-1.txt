The study was designed to identify the factors that influence mother’s adherence to optimal infant and young feeding (IYCF) practices in Uganda. The authors used four characteristics: initiation of breastfeeding within the first hour following birth; exclusive breastfeeding up to 6 months; continued breastfeeding with appropriate complementary foods up to 2 years and beyond to assess IYCF. The study however has some deficiencies. The question, "Were you able to breastfeed up to 6 months?” did not take into consideration adherence to breastfeeding for 6 months. Adherence was a key factor in this study and this deficiency weakened the design and results. The other question that would have also helped is “when did you introduce complementary feeding?”. This would have helped clarify results. The statistics were not extensive. The method section needs further explanation. The discussion is weak and not well written. The results were not well discussed. There is need to properly link and discuss the findings from demographic information to other findings. Findings from other studies are not discussed. There are grammatical errors in the article. Run-off statements and unclear sentences need editing. Engaging editors’ service will be helpful to the manuscript. Data from 264 respondents cannot be generalized for a country with over 44 million population. There is the need to review this in the discussion. The meaning and importance of P-value in each of the tables presented needs explanation.
