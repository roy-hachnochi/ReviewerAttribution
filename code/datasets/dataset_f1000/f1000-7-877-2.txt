The article brings out the IYCF practices in a town of Uganda. It reports the profile of the mothers, their access to healthcare as well the adherence to suitable IYCF practices. While the authors have defined optimal IYCF as initiation of breastfeeding within the first hour following birth, exclusive breastfeeding up to 6 months followed by continued breastfeeding for up to 2 years and beyond with appropriate complementary foods after completion of 6 months, their scale to assess IYCF based on 4 questions does not cover these issues. For example, exclusive breastfeeding up to 6 months is not asked; instead the question is "Were you able to breastfeed up to 6 months?‚Äù - the concept of exclusive breastfeeding is lost. Since this is the basis of defining adherence, the whole data categorization becomes faulty, and hence subsequent analysis to study correlates of IYCF also are biased. What do the P values displayed in Table 3 onwards imply? This was not given in the discussion. Also in Table 4, many of the questions are multiple responses and therefore cannot add up to 100% nor can any statistical test be applied to them. No details of multivariate analysis given. Language errors need to be corrected.
