Authors have done a great job in writing this manuscript trying to find published materials and research endeavors on the topic of refugees. However, I have a few suggestions to add: No data to compare with previously done studies on refugee population in the discussion section? It would be highly appreciated if comparable studies on the current subject could be added in a separate paragraph in the discussion section. Any particular reasons why “only 9 articles out of this list were published between the years 1973 and 1989, the two decades 1990–1999; and 2000–2010 produced 45 articles and 46 articles, respectively.” Please explain the reasons you think of this disparity? Inclusion variable should be well explained in the methods section. Minor grammatical errors should be corrected
