The manuscript is well written and the methodology is clear. However I have only minor comments: Pi3-akt signaling should be briefly introduced in the Introduction section. The toxicity data of the used inhibitors should be included in the supplementary material. Is there any explanation why the virus controls in supplementary Figure 1B and supplementary Figure 2 are almost 1 log less than the virus controls in the rest of figures although MOI=0.1 was used in all these experiments?.
