In the manuscript by Sharma et al., entitled “ Miltefosine inhibits Chikungunya virus replication in human primary dermal fibroblasts ”, the authors have shown that MF, an FDA-approved Akt-inhibitor, inhibited CHIKV replication in pre- and post-infection treatment regimens And proposed that Akt-phosphorylation can be an amenable target of therapy against CHIKV infection. The work is interesting and written properly. However, few things have to be corrected before consideration. Major comments : What is the % of inhibition / reduction, that has been never been mentioned in case of all the inhibitors. How all the statistical values are with one *? Fig 3 A- How 10 μM is statistically significant? Fig 3 B- How all the bar diagrams are with same p-value, actual p value should be provided here. How the reduction of viral titer is shown at 24 hpi in Fig 3, where as in Fig 4 the significant reduction is shown only at 6 hpi and then the infection rate has been decreased. How the current manuscript has been used as reference in this manuscript. The data is the part of this manuscript only. This cannot be referred. What is the need for showing saline treated cells as control has not been explained in the text. What are the specifications of all the inhibitors has not been explained. Why LY294002 and Rapamycin did not work, can the author give some explanation? Little more introductions on different drugs inhibiting CHIKV replication may be mentioned in one para in the introduction.
