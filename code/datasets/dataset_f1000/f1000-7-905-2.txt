In "Abstract", session "Methods", the study was conducted among 468 healthy adults but some participants in study are not healthy, please write only 468 adults. In Table 1, focus at dietary intake, the result show the statistical significant difference of total energy intake between men and women. Do you test the difference of the other nutrients intake such as carbohydrate, protein, fat, fiber, cholesterol, and sugar between men and women? According to the distribution of these nutrients are skewed (not normal distribution), using Studentâ€™s t-test may not be appropriate test. For sure, testing normality of these nutrients, if the nutrient is not normal distribution the appropriate statistical testing is Mann-Whitney U Test (nonparametric statistic). Please show the prevalence of MetS separate by sex. The mixed pattern was characterized by the consumption of a variety of foods (factor loading 0.3) consisting of Fruits (F=0.575 ) noodles and bread (F=0.553) milk and yogurt (F=0.542) soybean and soybean products (F=0.524) vegetables (F=0.48) eggs (F=0.455) sweet beverages (F=0.434) bakery and snacks (F=0.378) processed meat (F=0.376) legumes and nuts (F=0.37) seafood (F=0.372) white rice (F=0.362) The traditional pattern included a high intake of rice (sticky white rice) and animal source foods (factor loading 0.3) consisting of sticky rice (F=0.603) internal organs of animals (F=0.566) poultry (F=0.499) freshwater animals (frogs, pond snails, small shrimps) (F=0.477) white rice (F= -0.467) processed meat (Thai sausage, fermented pork sausage, hot dog sausage, and pork cracking) (F=0.453) insects (F=0.427) energy drinks (F=0.411) red meat (F=0.366) fish (F=0.311) seafood (F=0.304) The 2 pattern that authors suggested, in each pattern some variable are shown in both pattern (processed meat) and the variables in each pattern are not clear cut. I checked from your data and found that the participants in your study who consumed both sticky rice and white rice are 85% (398 from 468) so the dietary pattern in this study is not follow the traditional way of food intake that eating more sticky rice but they consumed both rice. From theory of factor analysis, the greater the loading, the more the variable is a pure measure of the factor. Comrey and Lee (1992) suggest that loadings in excess of .71 (50% overlapping variance) are considered excellent, .63 (40% overlapping variance) are considered very good, .55 (30% overlapping variance) are considered good, .45 (20% overlapping variance) are considered fair, and .32 (10% overlapping variance) are considered poor. [Cited in Tabachnick BG and Fidell LS. Using multivariate statistics. 6 th ed. New Jersey: Pearson Education, Inc.: 2013.] If we decided to use a loading of .45 (20% variance overlap between variable and factor). With the use of the .45 cut, we will get the variables in each factor are as follow: Factor 1: Healthier pattern Fruits (F=0.575 ) noodles and bread (F=0.553) milk and yogurt (F=0.542) 4. soybean and soybean products (F=0.524) vegetables (F=0.48) eggs (F=0.455) Factor 2: Rice and meat pattern sticky rice (F=0.603) internal organs of animals (F=0.566) poultry (F=0.499) freshwater animals (frogs, pond snails, small shrimps) (F=0.477) white rice (F= -0.467) processed meat (Thai sausage, fermented pork sausage, hot dog sausage, and pork cracking) (F=0.453) Please consider to assign the name of the new factors I just try to assign the name but the name may be not appropriate. From the new factors that we got, please re-run the analysis and discuss the results accordingly.
