Overall This is an excellent meta-research study of the open science platform, F1000 Research, using observational data and survey results. The results of this study contribute to the shaping of journals’ conceptual framework, which influence their publishing practices, such as the adoption of post-publication peer-review, reducing publication costs, implementing open access policies, and reducing time between submission and publication. I approve this study for publication, upon addressing the following points: Title The title was a bit confusing grammatically as the “who and why” would require differing conjugation and the “survey of F1000 Research” phrase might need to include “researchers”. Here is a suggestion for the title: A meta-research study of the post-publication platform, F1000 Research – who publishes there and why – findings from a review and survey. Introduction This was good and covered the issue of “waste” in research because of the traditional journal publication system. I wonder whether there is a dollar figure that demonstrates this waste? I think two other articles might be worthwhile citing in this introduction: Aleksic et al 1 Tracz et al 2 Methods and results The methods used are scientifically sound and clear. I think the ~one-month response period for the survey could be identified as a limitation of the study, especially given that there was only a 25-30% response rate, and after a few reminders too. The emails could have ended up in researchers’ spam/clutter folders too. I have had a look at the data shared. The excel spread sheet contains the observational data of the articles published with F1000 Research from 13 July 2012 to 30 November 2017. It might be worthwhile to export an anonymised copy of the survey data from REDCap to share as well. I am wondering why peer review was discontinued for those 36 articles. Discussion This was clear. I have no further comments.
