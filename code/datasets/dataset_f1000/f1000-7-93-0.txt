In this study, the authors have addressed an important question often neglected regarding the regulation of gene expression by cis-Natural Antisense Transcripts. Cis-NATs usually identified by sequencing of tissues containing many different cell types are assumed to potentially regulate their cognate coding genes co-expressed in the same tissue. However, direct evidence that both transcripts of the pairs are actually expressed in the same cells is often missing. By taking advantage of RNAseq, micro-array as well as sRNA data from pollen, a tissue containing only 2 cell types, the authors identified 72 cis-NAT pairs for which both transcripts were expressed in Sperm cells and 56 in vegetative cells. In addition, they identified sRNA falling in the overlapping region of 35 cis-NAT pairs out of 739 in pollen, providing insight about the functional role of these cis-NATs. Qin et al. provide useful data about cis-NAT expression in sperm and vegetative cells in pollen. They also provide insight about their potential function in sRNA production, contributing to a better understanding of the mechanisms of gene regulation by cis-NATs.
