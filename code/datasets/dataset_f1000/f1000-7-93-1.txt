The have authors addressed an interesting question regarding gene regulation in vegetative and sperm cells in pollen by cis-natural antisense transcripts (cis-NATs). Qin et al. explain how cis-NATs are generated and their importance for plant development, pathogen resistance, stress response, homeostasis and fertilization. The main question for this work regards the discrepancy that may be occurring in previously published data, as most analysis were performed on bulked samples containing different types of cells leading to possible misassignment of cis-NAT pairing. cis-NATs should be co-expressed in the same cell, as the authors described, so the analysis should be done at the least on the same cell type. To address this issue, the authors used RNA-seq and microarray publicly available data from vegetative and sperm cells from Arabidopsis thaliana pollen in order to investigate cell-specific cis-NATs pairs, using specific parameters avoiding possible mispairing. The authors identified possibly functional cis-NATs in pollen, 56 pairs in the vegetative cell and 72 in sperm cells, also, the authors screened for small RNAs generated from the pairing regions, finding that 35 out of 739 pollen cis-NATs from the overlapping region, suggesting a regulatory function. It would be interesting to summarize in the text if any of these were in sperm vs VN. Function analysis is yet to be addressed, as the authors pointed out, to confirm the biological role of cis-NATs in plant development, stress response, pathogen resistance, homeostasis and fertilization. But the authors choice to survey pollen grains where cell specificity is known could be key to understanding molecular mechanisms regarding fertilization and heredity.
