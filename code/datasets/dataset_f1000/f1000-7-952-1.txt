The authors have made a great improvements to the article along the lines suggested by the referees. I still think there is a considerable amount of work that could be added to expand the study, as I suggested in my original report. I understand, however, that the authors feel that a more expansive exploration of the tool parameter space and the addition of assessment on real data is beyond the scope of the article. I am of the opinion that, with these suggestions in hand, they are best positioned to define the scope of their own work. In my opinion the improvements they have made round out the article nicely and certainly make it acceptable for publication and indexing. Minor comment: 1) Introduction, line 1: This sentence is awkward. I think total gene expression is self explanatory, but if the authors feel it requires more explanation perhaps they could make the sentense clearer - something like: "RNA-seq experiments across groups of samples can be analyzed to detect differences in the total expression of all isoforms of a gene and, additionally, differences in transcript isoform usage within a gene." P.S. I particularly like the use of the hex 'stickers' for the tools in the workflow diagram - nice.
