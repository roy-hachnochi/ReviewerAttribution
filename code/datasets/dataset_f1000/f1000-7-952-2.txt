We feel the authors have done an excellent job in improving the structure and clarity of the paper. We believe the improved introduction and workflow diagram will be particularly helpful to readers and we accept the paper for indexing. A few very minor points remain: p18, could the authors please rewrite this sentence for clarity: "To repeat, the set of genes passing screening should not have more than 5% of either genes which have in fact no DTU or genes which contain a transcript with an adjusted p-value less than 5% which do not participate in DTU." p32, second paragraph: could the authors hypothesise why there was a slight increase of false positives for DTU genes in the DGE analysis? p34, fourth paragraph: mentions of SUPPA2, DEXseq and leafcutter are repeated across two sentences in the same context.
