The critique of Malstrm et al. presented here makes some very valid points that are well supported by the literature. It has long been true in fish MHC research that the fact that a gene has not been reported to be present in a particular species does not mean that is not present. Modern genomics techniques has presented better proof for this assertion, with the lack of an MHCII/CD4 pathway in gadids being the most prominent example, but even modern genomics techniques are not iron clad 100% proof and should be checked very carefully before definitive statements are made. Thus the comments about verifying the presence or absence of specific genes in the numerous species by other means is valid. Additionally, the treatment of all U and Z genes as identical units while ignoring the allelic diversity of each gene within those classes is indeed a serious flaw in the reasoning of Malstrm et al. There is significant variability in diversity U gene families which will have differing effects on T cell selection that simply counting gene numbers will not address. Dijkstra and Grimholt's critique should be carefully read and addressed.
