I am a member of ELIXIR, and as member of the FAIRDOM project, I am heavily involved with the SEEK system whose link to NeLS is hinted inside the paper. However, I have been only losely involved with that, so I was deemed to be an appropriate reviewer. In order to make things crystal clear, I hereby make my status visible. In my view, this paper has diverse functions: It provides an architectural view on how a comparatively lightweight combination of a variety of pre-existing tools can yield a powerful national research infrastructure. It provides a short justification of many architectural decisions. It describes main steps in an ordinary NeLS project. It provides a description of typical use cases and a reference of workflows that can be run by users. I find the paper clear and readable. I second the major remark by Olivier Collin. I was also surprised to find a whole paper about an infra structure that does not reference the FAIR principles explicitly. I think they could provide some point of reference regarding the handling of metadata, identifiers, licenses. However, it is only a matter of making existing links to FAIR more explicit. One suggestion: Please adjust the numbering in the drawings with the numbering of subsections in the paper. This would make things much easier. Bullet point 2.3 (c) references subsection 2.4, shouldn't this be 2.8, the public API? Please clarify.
