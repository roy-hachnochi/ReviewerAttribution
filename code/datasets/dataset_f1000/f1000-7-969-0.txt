This is an nice introductory article to a reader who wishes to learn about open peer review. Authors introduce the main concepts and lay down ten items to be considered when dealing with open peer review. It will be useful to early stage researchers and general readership new to the issue. This is not a research article, but a non-systematic review of existing literature with recommendations from experienced researchers and professionals in the field. In my opinion, the article can be indexed without revisions. Minor point: pp 4 bottom right says "Thing 8" - should be "Item 8" (?)
