In this work, Hamoudi et al. present the use of Drosophila larvae as a potential biological in-vivo model to study chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy. The work is solid and well presented. The data are convincing and the methods well explained. I found only two aspects of the work that are perhaps overlooked and could use a couple of notes in the discussion: The work focuses on the effects of only one drug. The title appropriately refers to paclitaxel indeed, but it would be interesting to speculate on whether we could expect the same response using other drugs too. Larvae are developing organisms. Their neuronal network changes as they grow from instar to instar. CIPN, on the other hand, is normally observed in post-developmental conditions. Can we assume that the changes in synaptic structures reported in figure 2 would be observed in a fully developed nervous system too? I think adding a couple of lines of speculation regarding point 1 and 2 would strengthen the paper.
