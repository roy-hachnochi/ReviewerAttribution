The paper on chemical diversity of FooDB compared to several other databases, including GRAS and DrugBank and drug-like natural products fromZINC12, by Naveja, Rico-Hidalgo, and Medina-Franco was an interesting, informative and nicely presented analysis. The figures and graphical presentation of ChemMaps results in particular is very clear. One thing which I think would be interesting for a further study and analysis, (since epigenetics and some other diseases and health implications are mentioned in regards to polyphenols) is an analysis regarding vitamins and other compounds and dietary supplements which have had specific health claims made. ChemMaps analysis of these compounds according to properties in these databases and correlation with biological pathways would be interesting for future work.
