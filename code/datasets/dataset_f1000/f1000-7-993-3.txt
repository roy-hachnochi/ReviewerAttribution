I have no critical remarks concerning methods, correctness of work. Discussion is also appropriate from the point of view of scientists working in the areas of cheminformatics and/or pharmacology. I would like to ask some questions concerning relevance of the article for food science. The analysis performed reveals similarity in structural and physico-chemical features between compounds from FooDB and DrugBank. Does it mean that more detailed studies may reveal similar biological activity (i.e. interactions with the same target) of drugs and bioactive food components. Are Authors’ results consistent with these published in the following articles concerning similarity of effects of drugs and food components? Jensen K. et al. PLoS Comput Biol, 10, (2014) 1 Jensen K. et al. PLoS Comput Biol, 11, (2015) 2 Proteins interacting with polyphenols and described in the following article: Lacroix S. et al. Sci Rep, 8, (2018) 3 are also annotated in DrugBank as drug targets. Is the above finding consistent with the Authors’ conclusions? I would like to ask Authors to add few sentences concerning limitations of the proposed methodology (for instance limitations occurring due to presence of activity cliffs).
