In general, the article is sufficient in both presentation and content, and provides new findings in the field. However, several of the following concerns, as parts of my review to the article, may need to be clarified by the authors: Does it cite the current literature? Partly, as only about 25% of the references are within the last 10 years. Is the statistical analysis and its interpretation appropriate? Partly, as there is inconsistency between the method and the results (analysis). In the method, the highest PEG concentration is 20% but in the results (Table 3) the highest PEG concentration is 40%, which is not consistent. Are all the source data underlying the results available to ensure full reproducibility? Partly, in Table 3, there are four calli survived in the regeneration stage using K3 medium. If the 4 calli from petiole were all survived, then there must be 16 calli that have been regenerated in this stage, assuming that the same number of calli (four calli) was assigned into each growth medium. This does not match with the method and the results in Table 2, where only 57% calli (about 7 calli) survived the 20% PEG. 16 calli are needed for the four growth medium treatments in the regeneration stage. This needs to be clarified. Are the conclusions drawn adequately supported by the results? Partly, for the following reasons: 1) Inconsistency in the highest PEG concentration employed: 20% in the method and 40% in the results and conclusions. 2) More than 50% calli survived at the highest PEG concentration may indicate mild to moderate stress intensity, thus, its effectiveness as in vitro selection of drought tolerance needs to be improved. 3) There were only five calli survived in the regeneration stage (Table 3), which is very low in number as a starting genetic material for in vivo selection of drought-tolerant purple sweet potato clones.
