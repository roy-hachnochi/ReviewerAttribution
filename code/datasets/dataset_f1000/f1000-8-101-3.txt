 The manuscript is a small-size retrospective study about the prevalence of anaemia in patients with solitary acyanotic VSD in comorbid with PNA or PH; they find that patients with acyanotic VSD in comorbid with PNA or PH were 8 and 4 times more susceptible to develop anaemia compared to asymptomatic counterparts. For the VSD patients with PNA or PH, does the increased incidence of anaemia have any influence on the therapy or clinical management? As the aetiology of anaemia is multifactorial, any intrinsic and extrinsic factors should be analysed in this article. This is crucial. As mentioned above, it suggests that this article needs to be revised before accepting for indexing.
