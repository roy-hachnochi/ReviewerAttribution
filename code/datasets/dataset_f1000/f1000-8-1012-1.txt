The article addresses important natural volatile organic compounds (NVOC) sources of emissions to atmosphere from a three biogenic forest species, the Eucalyptus globulus , Pinus radiata and Alnus acuminata in Riobamba, Ecuador as a case study. The research methodology is well defined using different research tools linked with each other’s to provide the results. The study conclusions are practical and inline with the results finding. However, the following minor comments and changes need to be taken into consideration by the authors: It is better in the titles of the article the word “Biogenetic study” change to “ Biogenic study” as the word Biogenic signified for the emission of substance (i.e., VOC, BVOC and NO2) from a living material such the plants and/or species in this study. In introduction, 2 nd line, “as nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulphur (SOx), …” to be change to “as nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulphur oxides (SOx), …”. Figures 1, 2, 3, and 4 need to be reproduced with high resolution ones. In Figures 12 and 13, the x-axis name should be change from “COV (ppm)” to “VOC (ppm)”. Most of the references are documented research and/or study carried out in Ecuador in Spanish language, authors recommended to update the references section with the original source of references which are mostly published in English such as the Guenther model these references are as follows: Guenther, A., Monson, R.
