This is a very interesting research and of high clinical interest and I really appreciate the work of the authors. It is definitely publishable material after some revisions. Materials and Methods: Why didnâ€™t you consider doing mechanical cyclic loading before the fracture resistance testing? I think it would have been more clinically significant. More details are needed concerning teeth dimensions. Access cavity design and dimensions should be also described as all these details are important in behavior of the teeth during fracture resistance testing. And also, please mention the master apical file size. To which level were the teeth mounted in the epoxy resin? There should be more elaboration on specifics of teeth preparation designs, especially occlusal designs. A diagram would be highly beneficial. The photograph is not that descriptive. What were the details of crowns dimensions and standardization during designing? Testing: Indicate the points of load application during fracture resistance testing? Statistical analysis: There are no details. What type of tests or analysis did you perform? FEA: The model designing step needs more description especially the role of CBCT and the correlation with the 3D scanning. Fig 3: Just mention Bar chart or column chart. Fig 4: Indicate which mode of failure that figure is. Discussion: Paragraphs 2 to 6 are not necessary. Go straight for the interpretation after paragraph 1. Reference 33 has no journal.
