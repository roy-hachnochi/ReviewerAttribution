Sports-related mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) is one of social issues to solve in modern society, because the sports-related TBI increases subsequent mortality from neurodegenerative disorders, such as dementia. Given that if molecular hydrogen might easily reach injured brain area and induce some cytoprotective effects as the authors mentioned in this report, we evaluate the first-aid intervention by hydrogen administration as novel and innovative approach on the sports-related TBI. In order to potentiate the view that molecular hydrogen is beneficial for acute phase of sports-related TBI, we would like to propose the authors to consider some additional concerns as written below. Because of a case report, we understand that this study did not set placebo control trial (i.e., physical and mental rest without hydrogen treatment). However, we believe that the representation of the typical time course change in SCAT2 score without any specific medication will strongly enhance the therapeutic value of this intervention. Another point is that SCAT2 consists several clusters of assessment items (e.g., somatic, cognitive, emotional, and sleep-fatigue symptoms), nevertheless the authors displayed just only total SCAT2 score in this study. The information about which individual factor was improved by hydrogen treatment is so important to assess its efficacy and examine the target of the treatment. Thus, we would like to propose the authors to display the time course changes not only total score but also each score of SCAT2 symptoms.
