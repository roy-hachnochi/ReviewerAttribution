The manuscript is a good explanation of the need of molecular epidemiology in the public health area. This article reported the role of alpha 2 macroglobulin in the difference of metabolic state and it might be associated to homeostasis and health status. Therefore it could be a public health concern in the future. However, the abstract should re-arranged to be more representative of the manuscript summary. For the review body, to interpret and follow the role of alpha 2 macroglobulin, the reader might need more information about this protein in terms of molecular detail.
