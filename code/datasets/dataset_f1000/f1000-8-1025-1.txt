The submitted manuscript is a very well written review on the possible use of a2-macroglobulin as a marker of metabolism. The manuscript describes the general need of valid and meaningful biomarkers in the context of NCDs in public health research, especially with regard to overnutrition and obesity. The manuscript covers the implication of overnutrition and obesity for public health and the need of biomarkers and suggests a2-macroglobulin as such. The main part of the manuscript describes in very much detail the current knowledge of a2M in metabolic function as an omnipotent inhibitor of endopeptidases. With regard to the topic of the manuscript the authors concentrate on the knowledge regarding a2M in energy homeostasis especially with regard to energy-protein malnutrition. Comments: In general the manuscript itself is well written and balanced. However, the abstract is by no means reflecting the manuscript. It lacks condensed information on a2M and only addresses the general aspect of public health and the need of a biomarker. It is challenging for the reader to cite a citation with refers to another citation. It cannot be retrieved without greater efforts.
