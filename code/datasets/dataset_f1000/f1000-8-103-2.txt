The authors are correct in stating that a concurrent presentation of meningioma and primary CNS lymphoma (PCNSL) is very rare and worth publishing. The authors imply that the use of translators for the hispanic population in California is not routine. They should clarify this for an international audience. PCNSL can be rapidly progressive and urgent investigation is essential. Most cases of PCNSL are diagnosed by stereotactic biopsy +/- CSF cytology and a surgical approach is uncommon. In this case the radiological appearance was of a meningioma as well as a lesion adjacent to the right postero-lateral ventricle. The frozen section of the latter lesion suggested a high-grade glioma and for this reason surgical removal of both tumours was indicated. No detailed information is given on the staging investigations carried out which should include CT or PET/CT scanning, CSF cytology, bone marrow aspirate and trephine, slit-lamp examination of the eye and blood tests including LDH. Also baseline neuro-cognitive tests are indicated at the age of 64 years. No detailed information is given on the chemotherapy given, the regimen with methotrexate, cytarabine and rituximab is not referenced and no doses are given and the number of cycles not stated. In addition the radiotherapy dose is in Gy with the number of fractions stated not in cycles. This information is essential in a patient of this age. The authors state that at 2 years there is no recurrence but again give no indication of whether there has been any cognitive deterioration. In the discussion the authors discuss the other brain tumours that occur concurrently with meningioma but don't discuss the outcome achieved in the other 9 cases reported and how they compare with the case they are reporting. In summary this is an interesting case report which would be greatly enhanced if the additional information I have alluded to was included.
