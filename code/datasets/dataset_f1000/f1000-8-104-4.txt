This short report by Hurst and Gasser exposes an important experimental detail that is often, but not always, overlooked: Hoechst-sensitized cells irradiated with UV light produce a signal in the same region of the spectrum as GFP. Consequently, without the proper controls, it may lead to false positives. That is, that it may be falsely concluded that GFP-tagged proteins are recruited to laser-induced damage. In the discussion, they point out potential controls to that would prevent an experimenter to make this mistake. Specifically, they propose leaving out Hoechst or DAPI altogether, using the appropriate control cells that do not express the GFP-tagged protein of interest, using another nuclear marker, such as a protein localizing to the nuclear periphery, or using a different fluorescent protein. Those are all good ways of getting around the reported problem. I would also add the use of a UVC source (Dabin et al., 2018 1 ).
