I generally agree the author's response to my review and suggest the paper should be accepted after minor revision. I suggest the authors should cited recent and typical references to support their study, for example, from my group. We have tested the cross-reactivity of antibody for FB3 and we have extensively study immunoassay for FB1 detection.
