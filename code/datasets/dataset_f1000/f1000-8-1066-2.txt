Thank you to have addressed most of my comments in the current version 2. Regarding clinical trial duration, there may still be a misunderstanding. I was not referring to Phase IV but to Phase II (prior to Phase III). Your manuscript refers to the duration from first enrolled to last visit. It does not include the time of analysis of basic safety data and of immunogenicity data, the latter being sometimes long for complex vaccines (e.g., HIV vaccines). At best, the immuno analysis may take 6-12 mo, cleaning of the data and statistical analysis may well take another 6-12mo. This is not taken into account in your duration. Regarding my last comment on CEPI and cost estimates, please refer to the article of Gouglas D, et al. Lancet Glob Health 2018; 6: e1386â€“96 1 . References 1.
