LSF is a major antioxidant from cruciferous vegetables. Kwa et al. aim to validate if LSF protects human retinal epithelial cells from H2O2-induced oxidative damage and to identify the underlying molecular basis by employing lipidomic analyses. It may result in a better understanding of the pathogenesis of AMD. However, the following concerns should be better addressed. Major concerns: In general, I don’t reckon that authors should split data interpretation into -/+ H2O2. It results in the loss of comparisons between – H2O2 and + H2O2 (in the absence of LSF) that is fundamental to demonstrate proper modelling of oxidative damage. Fig. 1B. I cannot judge that effects of LSF result from protection against H2O2-induced cell death or an increased proliferation. 24 h treatment with H2O2 has been shown to cause toxicity in ARPE-19 cells 1 2 . The underlying raw data also demonstrate that the absorbance was reduced from 2.0+ to 1.0+ between CA-H2O2 (fig.1A) and CA+H2O2 (Fig.1b), if comparable. Did 2 h treatment with H2O2 cause any toxicity? Following LSF pre-treatment, why the addition of H2O2 for only 2 h induced such dramatic proliferation? What is the doubling time of ARPE-19 cells? Please note, MTS assay measures the mitochondrial activity. To draw your conclusion of “increase in proliferation”, other assays should be carried out, e.g. BrdU incorporation and Ki67 staining. LSF may also result in the phenotype in Fig. 1b, via the regulation of the cell cycle 3 . Fig 2 and 3 show that in the absence of H2O2, LSF increased FAs C18:1 and C20:3. In the related discussion, authors believe that these increases contribute to LSF-mediated protection. However, as shown in the underlying data, the levels of C18:1 and C20:3 was higher or, at least, similar in H2O2-treated cells, as compared to LSF-treated samples. How to explain both LSF and H2O2 caused changes in the same way, whereas they were claimed to have opposite biological effects? Fig. 4 and 5. In Fig. 5, authors need to double-check the fold change of PE 34:0, PE 38:5 and oPDA 34:3, which do not match the underlying data. In addition, if you normalised the data over the untreated control, it is better to set the untreated control as 1, and show 20uM LSF in fold change. In the related discussions, 1) PE. Indeed, PE is the precursor for A2E production (ref 44). However, based on your lipidomics results, PE 34:0 is a less abundant PE species. Will the reduction of PE 34:0 “reduce the PE level” and thus determine the A2E production? Did you measure the A2E level? 2) PC. Similarly, the authors discussed the biofunction of overall PC in Bruch’s membrane. But the most abundant PC species in the retina are C 16:0/18:1, 18:0/18:1, 18:0/22:6, 18:2/20:4, etc 4 . What is the physiological role of PC 33:3? Other concerns: In the figure legends, authors should clarify the treatment conditions, although the information has been mentioned somewhere else. In fig. 4, authors should list lipid species following the order of lipid classification, but not in the current mixed pattern. I suggest plotting the selected subspecies from all 6 experimental groups in Fig. 3 and 5. Then the ANOVA should be applied for multi-comparisons. T-tests on two groups are less critical.
