The Case report is interesting and very useful. There are few suggestions. There needs to be more details about the use of opioids in the past surgeries, whether the patient was dependent to Opioids in the past? Did the patient have status epilepticus? More information about what blood investigations were done and details about the same. Discussion is very superficial and the pathophysiology of seizures in a opioid withdrawal needs to be discussed. Kindly answer the above questions.
