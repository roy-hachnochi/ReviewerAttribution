This is a descriptive analysis of references in UK NICE guidelines using bibliometrics together with stakeholder interviews for context. Although clinical guideline citations have been investigated before, I think this is the first to match citations with the web of science and to analyse them in conjunction with interviews. The paper contains a lot of results, is well written and clearly explained. The interviews do not seem to have been systematically analysed with a recognised qualitative method but I think this is fine given that they are used to support and follow up from the bibliometric analysis, as well as to address pre-defined questions. It also does not have a literature review component summarising what is known about NICE guidelines from previous research but it does not really need it. For the sentence, “This is below the general average for international collaboration in research across the UK”, could you find from the Web of Science what the average is for public health? If not, the science-wide comparison is not very meaningful.
