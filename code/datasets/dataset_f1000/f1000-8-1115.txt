            <meta name="dc.description" content=" Background: Surfaces of ceramic crowns are modified several times before being exposed to wear in the oral cavity.&amp;nbsp; Grinding and different finishing procedures may be associated with teeth wear due to increased surface roughness. Limited data is available with regard to the effect of polishing procedures on the surface roughness and wear behavior of ceramic crowns.&amp;nbsp; This study was conducted to assess the influence of polished and polished-ground-repolished surface finish on the roughness and wear performance of three ceramic crowns. 
 Methods: 36 natural 1st molar teeth were prepared using a CNC milling machine and classified into three groups (n=12/group): zirconia, E-max and hybrid ceramic (VITA ENAMIC) crowns. Each group was classified into two subgroups (n=6/subgroup): polished and polished-ground-repolished crowns. Natural molar teeth served as an unrestored control group (n=6). All samples were loaded into a chewing simulator for 100,000 cycles and subjected to 600 thermo-cycles in temperature changes to simulate changes in intraoral temperature. Natural maxillary 1st premolar teeth were collected and only buccal half (cusp) of sectioned tooth was used as antagonists. A profilometer was used to detect the roughness before and after masticatory cycles. The occlusal surface was analysed using a scanning electron microscope (SEM). 
 Results: The E-max crown group had the highest mean surface roughness value (0.267&amp;micro;m) followed by VITA ENAMIC crown group (0.266 &amp;micro;m), while the lowest mean surface roughness value recorded for zirconia crown (0.257&amp;micro;m). The difference between these means was not significant. The polished-ground&ndash;repolished group had a higher mean surface roughness (0.266 &amp;micro;m) compared with the polished group (0.260 &amp;micro;m), which was not significantly different. 
 Conclusions: All tested ceramic crowns showed surface roughness with values within acceptable clinical parameters (~0.2 &amp;micro;m). Additionally, intraoral polishing procedures could be considered a reliable technique for smoothing of zircona, E.max and VITA ENAMIC crowns after occlusal adjustment.">

  "description": "Background: Surfaces of ceramic crowns are modified several times before being exposed to wear in the oral cavity.  Grinding and different finishing procedures may be associated with teeth wear due to increased surface roughness. Limited data is available with regard to the effect of polishing procedures on the surface roughness and wear behavior of ceramic crowns.  This study was conducted to assess the influence of polished and polished-ground-repolished surface finish on the roughness and wear performance of three ceramic crowns.
Methods: 36 natural 1st molar teeth were prepared using a CNC milling machine and classified into three groups (n=12/group): zirconia, E-max and hybrid ceramic (VITA ENAMIC) crowns. Each group was classified into two subgroups (n=6/subgroup): polished and polished-ground-repolished crowns. Natural molar teeth served as an unrestored control group (n=6). All samples were loaded into a chewing simulator for 100,000 cycles and subjected to 600 thermo-cycles in temperature changes to simulate changes in intraoral temperature. Natural maxillary 1st premolar teeth were collected and only buccal half (cusp) of sectioned tooth was used as antagonists. A profilometer was used to detect the roughness before and after masticatory cycles. The occlusal surface was analysed using a scanning electron microscope (SEM).
Results: The E-max crown group had the highest mean surface roughness value (0.267&amp;micro;m) followed by VITA ENAMIC crown group (0.266 &amp;micro;m), while the lowest mean surface roughness value recorded for zirconia crown (0.257&amp;micro;m). The difference between these means was not significant. The polished-ground&ndash;repolished group had a higher mean surface roughness (0.266 &amp;micro;m) compared with the polished group (0.260 &amp;micro;m), which was not significantly different.
Conclusions: All tested ceramic crowns showed surface roughness with values within acceptable clinical parameters (~0.2 &amp;micro;m). Additionally, intraoral polishing procedures could be considered a reliable technique for smoothing of zircona, E.max and VITA ENAMIC crowns after occlusal adjustment."

Limited data is available with regard to the effect of polishing procedures on the surface roughness and wear behavior of ceramic crowns.&nbsp; This study was conducted to assess the influence of polished and polished-ground-repolished surface finish on the roughness and wear performance of three ceramic crowns.<br/> <b>Methods: </b>36 natural 1st molar teeth were prepared using a CNC milling machine and classified into three groups (n=12/group): zirconia, E-max and hybrid ceramic (VITA ENAMIC) crowns. Each group was classified into two subgroups (n=6/subgroup): polished and polished-ground-repolished crowns. Natural molar teeth served as an unrestored control group (n=6). All samples were loaded into a chewing simulator for 100,000 cycles and subjected to 600 thermo-cycles in temperature changes to simulate changes in intraoral temperature. Natural maxillary 1st premolar teeth were collected and only buccal half (cusp) of sectioned tooth was used as antagonists. A profilometer was used to detect the roughness before and after masticatory cycles. The occlusal surface was analysed using a scanning electron microscope (SEM).<br/> <b>Results:</b> The E-max crown group had the highest mean surface roughness value (0.267&micro;m) followed by VITA ENAMIC crown group (0.266 &micro;m), while the lowest mean surface roughness value recorded for zirconia crown (0.257&micro;m). The difference between these means was not significant. The polished-ground–repolished group had a higher mean surface roughness (0.266 &micro;m) compared with the polished group (0.260 &micro;m), which was not significantly different.<br/> <b>Conclusions: </b>All tested ceramic crowns showed surface roughness with values within acceptable clinical parameters (~0.2 &micro;m). Additionally, intraoral polishing procedures could be considered a reliable technique for smoothing of zircona, E.max and VITA ENAMIC crowns after occlusal adjustment. </div> <div class=abstract-for-mobile> <div class="margin-top-30 padding-bottom-30 research-layout is-centered"> <button class="primary orange-text white-bg bigger-text abstract-expand-button-mobile with-border show" style="display: none;"> READ ALL <span class="f1r-icon icon-14_more_small orange vmiddle big"></span> </button> <button class="primary orange-text white-bg bigger-text abstract-expand-button-mobile with-border hide"> READ LESS <span class="f1r-icon icon-10_less_small orange vmiddle big"></span> </button> </div> </div> </div> <div class=clearfix></div> <div class="article-context no-divider"> <div class="article-abstract article-page-general-text-mobile research-layout generated-article-body"> <h2 class=main-title>Keywords</h2> <p class="u-mb--0 u-pb--2"> Teeth wear, Full ceramic crowns, CAD/CAM, surface roughness, Enamel </p> </div> </div> <div class=article-information> <span class="info-separation padding-bottom"> <div id=corresponding-author-icon class="email-icon float-left"> <span class="f1r-icon icon-6_email orange"></span> <div id=corresponding-author-window class="margin-top-20 popup-window-wrapper is-hidden"> <div class="popup-window corresponding-authors-popup"> <div class=corresponding-author-container> <div class="popup-window-title small">Corresponding Author(s)</div> <div class=authors> Ahmed M.

Intraoral adjustments of ceramic crowns may result in surface roughness; therefore, technical and intraoral polishing is a necessary procedure<sup><a href="#ref-20">20</a></sup>. Numerous studies have compared different finishing procedures;<sup><a href="#ref-21">21</a></sup> however, there is little research comparing different finishing procedures and the resulting wear behavior. </p><p class="" id=d289e1484>In the present study, natural teeth were used as they have characteristics closer to the clinical condition<sup><a href="#ref-22">22</a></sup>. The teeth were embedded in epoxy blocks simulating alveolar bone<sup><a href="#ref-23">23</a></sup>, and a specially designed centralizing device was used, which was an important step for accurate centralization of the tooth in the epoxy blocks<sup><a href="#ref-24">24</a></sup>. A constant seating force by the fingertip of a single operator was applied before curing to simulate the clinical cementation steps carried out by operators in clinical practice<sup><a href="#ref-25">25</a>,<a href="#ref-26">26</a></sup>.</p><p class="" id=d289e1506>The polishing procedures with dental laboratory polishing kits were chosen to simulate the surface conditions after milling. In the current study, samples were roughened with a fine diamond instrument, which ensures more uniform grind on the surface<sup><a href="#ref-27">27</a></sup>. The same operator with a light pressure was used throughout the study to polish all samples in order to standardize the procedures<sup><a href="#ref-11">11</a>–<a href="#ref-13">13</a></sup>.</p><p class="" id=d289e1520>The samples were subjected to 600 thermo-cycles between 5<sup>º</sup>C and 55<sup>º</sup>C to simulate changes in the intraoral temperature. This thermal-cycling caused additional ageing of the samples<sup><a href="#ref-28">28</a></sup>. The chewing force of the wear test device was 49 Newton with a frequency of ~1–1.6 Hz which simulated average chewing load in the oral cavity and equals the normal occlusal force reported in previous studies<sup><a href="#ref-12">12</a>,<a href="#ref-29">29</a></sup>.</p><p class="" id=d289e1541>Roughness values obtained after repolishing procedures were within the clinically acceptable value as reported by previous studies<sup><a href="#ref-12">12</a>,<a href="#ref-30">30</a></sup>. It could be assumed that the tested ceramic repolished surfaces produced only minimal wear to the opposing enamel (neglected wear). This also may indicate the efficiency of the polishing procedures carried out after grinding in smoothing the resulting roughness, which may explain the non-significant difference between the effect of the two surface finishings tested regardless of the characteristic differences of the three ceramic materials tested under chewing simulation. The results of the SEM were in agreement with previous studies<sup><a href="#ref-11">11</a>,<a href="#ref-31">31</a></sup> as they concluded that finishing procedures might remove some of the defects on the ceramic surface.</p><p class="" id=d289e1558>When the effect of crown material is considered, the results revealed that the highest surface roughness value was in E.max ceramic crowns (0.267), then VITA ENAMIC ceramic crowns (0.266), while the lowest roughness was recorded for zirconia crown (0.257), but these differences were not significant. <i>Rashid</i><sup><a href="#ref-32">32</a></sup> previously said that despite the variation in base line crystalline structures between these ceramics, smooth surface can be produced for different ceramics with the same polishing steps. Therefore, the present results were not a surprising result, as the same kits were used in the current study.</p></div><div id=article1-body class=generated-article-body><h2 class=main-title id=d289e1570>Conclusion</h2><div class=list><a name=d289e1573 class=n-a></a><ul><li><p id=d289e1577>All tested crowns showed surface roughness within acceptable clinical parameters when subjected to a different surface finish and six-month chewing simulation.</p></li><li><p id=d289e1583>No change in the wear behavior was encountered with the three tested ceramic materials with the applied surface finishing procedures.</p></li><li><p id=d289e1589>Intraoral polishing procedures could be considered a reliable technique for smoothing of the zircona, E.max and VITA ENAMIC crowns after occlusal adjustment.</p></li></ul></div></div><div id=article1-body class=generated-article-body><h2 class=main-title id=d289e1598>Data availability</h2><div class=section><a name=d289e1601 class=n-a></a><h3 class=section-title>Underlying data</h3><p class="" id=d289e1606>Open Science Framework: Wear Assessment of Current Esthetic Crowns Against Human Enamel After Two Finishing Procedures: In vitro study, <a target=xrefwindow href="https://dx.doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/MYGWD" id=d289e1608>https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/MYGWD</a><sup><a href="#ref-33">33</a></sup>.</p><p class="" id=d289e1615>This project contains the following underlying data:</p><div class=list><a name=d289e1618 class=n-a></a><ul><li><p id=d289e1622>Zip file containing images of digital microscope for each crown, before and after six month chewing simulation.</p></li><li><p id=d289e1628>Results.xls: raw surface roughness values for each crown and treatment, before and after six month chewing simulation.</p></li><li><p id=d289e1634>SEM raw, unedited images for those shown in <a href="#f11">Figure 11</a>–<a href="#f13">Figure 13</a>.</p></li><li><p id=d289e1646>3D topography files for the images shown <a href="#f8">Figure 8</a>–<a href="#f10">Figure 10</a>.</p></li><li><p id=d289e1658>CEREC software images.</p></li></ul></div><p class="" id=d289e1663>Data are available under the terms of the <a target=xrefwindow href="http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/" id=d289e1665>Creative Commons Zero "No rights reserved" data waiver</a> (CC0 1.0 Public domain dedication).</p></div></div><div id=article1-back class=generated-article-footer><div class=back-section><a name=d289e1 class=n-a></a><h2 class=main-title id=d459>Grant information</h2><p>The authors declare that no grants were involved in supporting this work.</p></div><div class=back-section><a name=d289e1674 class=n-a></a><span class="research-layout prime-recommended-wrapper reference-heading is-hidden"><span class="f1r-icon icon-79_faculty_recommended_badge red vmiddle default-cursor"></span><span class="prime-red big">F1000 recommended</span></span><h2 class=main-title id=d557>References</h2><div class="section ref-list"><a name=d289e1674 class=n-a></a><ul><li><a name=ref-1 class=n-a></a><span class=label>1. </span>&nbsp;<span class=citation><a name=d289e1681 class=n-a></a>Ahmadzadeh A, Hashemi Ashtiani AR, Epakchi S: Comparison of the Effect of Feldspathic Porcelain and Zirconia on Natural Tooth Wear. <i>J Islam Dent Ass Iran.</i> 2014; <b>26</b>(2): 89–95. <a target=xrefwindow id=d289e1689 href="http://jidai.ir/article-1-1645-en.pdf">Reference Source</a></span></li><li><a name=ref-2 class=n-a></a><span class=label>2. </span>&nbsp;<span class=citation><a name=d289e1698 class=n-a></a>Maglad AS, Wassell RW, Barclay SC, <i> et al.</i>: Risk management in clinical practice. part 3.
