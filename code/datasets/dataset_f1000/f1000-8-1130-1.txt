The paper titled “Prognosis associated with geometric patterns of left ventricular remodeling: systematic review and network meta-analysis” by Zheng et al aims to identify different prognostic profile of different left ventricular remodeling patterns. Although the aim is of interest, the method to select data from the international literature is quite messy. In fact, populations are not homogenous (from population-based studies like the FHS, to patients with stable CAD, to patients with hypertension, aortic stenosis, HFpEF, etc). In addition, methods reported in studies to categorize left ventricular remodeling are still not homogeneous. Consequently, conclusions of the paper are erroneous. Authors stated that the new classification of left ventricular remodeling proposed by Khouri is “complex” and “more guidance is needed before this complex classification can be integrated into routine clinical practice”, so that they propose a more simple index (the remodeling index) which at moment is tested by the authors in a trial of hypertensive patients. We thank the Author for the suggestion, i.e. to use their index; of course, to demonstrate in the future that their index is superior to that used in the past, they will have to perform a correct statistical analysis, confronting their index with clear-cut values suggested by guidelines and more recently by Khouri, (which, I guess, is very easy to use into clinical practice) for the identification of left ventricular remodeling patterns.
