 General Comments: This is an interesting and insightful manuscript that describes several novel computer-based algorithms that can investigate and/or uncover new insights into the porphyrias and Fredrich Afaxia. It proves the usefulness of bringing together experts in various fields as a team to stove certain scientific problems. The Iron Hack was very successful and in a short time accomplished an amazing amount of work. Specific Comments: Maturation and implementation of the various projects may prove the significance of their newly construction programs. Relevant to the porphyrias, it is important that UPWARD does not mislead symptomatic individuals to use consumer/commercial chips (e.g., 23andMe; Ancestry) to establish a diagnosis. This approach has already misguided people to believe they have a porphyria; However, they do not have the “gold standard” biochemical evidence of a specific porphyria. In fact the chip SNP data can lead to individuals having more than one porphyria based on being heterozygous in SNPs for two or more heme biosynthetic genes that are common and benign.
