“Iron Hack” is a rare disease-focused hackathon. As a collaborative, problem-solving effort it has successfully attracted participants of diverse backgrounds at the U of South Florida and focusses on rare iron-related genetic diseases, specifically porphyrias and Friedreich’s ataxia. It is pitched at a general audience, but some of the material is probably too technical for a general audience. So any revisions should aim to further simplify and explain areas of discussion that are complex and technical. Introduction: Friedreich’s ataxia – It would be useful to add a paragraph on diagnosis, and the underlying genetic cause. The proposed projects are interesting and timely. These are (1) exploration of consumer-genomics data, (2) largescale RNAseq data mining, (3) genomic data visualization, (4) rare-disease variants discovery, and (5) genotype-to-phenotype mapping. These all seem innovative. The scope of work is very large, and it might be asked whether engaging a larger working group from many institutions would lead to more rapid progress.
