This is an interesting and well designed trial and the outcomes will be of interest to many involved in running clinical trials. There are a few suggestions/areas for consideration by the authors: The manuscript would benefit from the addition of a description of the role of a TPI should be included (as stated in section 1.3.2 of the extended protocol) Have the authors considered additional timepoints for follow up? Recruitment fatigue can often affect long-running studies and it would be interesting to determine whether the intervention has longer-lasting effects. Feasibility and resource use are an important aspect of the study and should be included in the secondary outcomes. Have the authors considered performing a formal cost analysis? It would be interesting to understand the cost/benefit of the intervention. There are a number of acronyms referring to the studies hosting or associated with EnTraP – WHiTE, WHiTE 8, WHiTE 8 Copal, WHiTE 5 - that we found confusing and detracted from the description of the study. Section 1.3.1 of the extended protocol explains the relationship between these studies well, and it would be useful to include this for the reader to understand the context of the host trial. In the extended protocol the study is referred to as EnTraP and it would be beneficial to include this in the article to refer to e.g. ‘the EnTraP Research Fellow’. Will education and experience of the sites staff be mentioned or evaluated when analysing the results as this can impact on recruitment. The extended protocol submitted as extended data still has some comments and tracked changes the authors may want to remove before indexing.
