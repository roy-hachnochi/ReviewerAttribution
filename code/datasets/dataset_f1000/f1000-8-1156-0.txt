The case study titled Don't chew the fufu: a case report of suspected bodystuffing, brings to light that taking a proper history is still paramount in the management of a patient. In this case a patient who had ingested food that was meant for slow digestion, was mistaken for drug packets. CT scan which is the go to study of choice was false positive for drug packets. Even though this is just a case report, the authors reviewed the literature on concealment of drug packets and the management of these patients. Urine toxicology screening is an important tool to use in these patients, in case the drug packets have ruptured. CT scan is still the modality of choice in diagnosing various causes for an acute abdomen, including patients with swallowed drug packets. Drug packets are wrapped and have a distinct appearance of layers with sometimes air in between the layers. The strength of the paper is that, it reviewed the current literature of bodystuffing and points out the fallibility of CT scans. The weakness of the paper is that it does not go into further detail of managing these patients. However, It is still worth indexing.
