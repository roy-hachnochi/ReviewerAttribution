This trial is a pragmatic trial modeled after the ENGAGES trial published in JAMA in 2019. The findings are of importance because it may validate the findings of the ENGAGES trial, which were opposite of what was expected based on several meta-analysis of previous data. This trial also gives the authors an opportunity to address some of the criticisms of the ENGAGES trial. These include: By concentrating on cardiac surgery, this removes the heterogeneity of surgeries of the original trial. Achieve a better separation of the time spent in burst suppression of the groups. This is likely to happen simply due to the passage of time, as anesthesiologists are more aware of the problem of delirium today, and are more comfortable using lower MACs of volatile agents. Excluding the outliers in each group. However, there are several concerns, as below. The use of different "black box" indices to guide MAC is based on the assumption that they are equal. However, being a pragmatic trial, it is perhaps a reflection of true practice. The management of anesthesia during bypass is not clear, including the type of anesthesia (volatile vs. propofol), the involvement of the perfusionists, and the perfusion targets. Assessment of delirium is still once a day. Because of the fluctuating course of delirium, the protocol is heavily reliant on chart reviews, which may underestimate the incidence.
