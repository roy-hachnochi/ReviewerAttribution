This is a good article which emphasizes further investigation and work-up of irreducible hernia before hernioplasty, especially in the elderly population for occult malignancy. It is noted that there is a biopsy specimen, which confirms metastatic adenocarcinoma. Later, it reports cecal biopsies showed no evidence of malignancy. If there are supporting immunohistochemistry (CK7, CK20, CDX2, Villin, SATB2, etc.) along with the primary biopsy, then it would be more convincing to justify the relationship between the hernia and an intestinal neoplasm. There are many grammatical errors which need to be addressed before indexing. If there are any histology pictures then it will be more interesting.
