 This is an excellent report that investigated whether a specific genetic factor is involved in the development of an increasingly important disease of feedlot animals managed at moderate altitudes. It is scientifically sound and well written. The disease condition is Bovine congestive heart failure, which is clinically similar to altitude-induced pulmonary hypertension with cor pulmonale and right heart failure, commonly known as High Altitude disease or Brisket disease. A previous investigation suggested that a variant of EPAS1 was strongly associated with the development of Brisket disease. This investigation explored whether that gene was associated with BCHF. This was a case control study that was well designed and described. The explanation of experimental and statistical methods and results was very clear. This is an important area of inquiry because BCHF is an important disease problem with significant impact on feedlot producers, for which there are currently no good preventive, management or treatment practices. Previous work has shown that there are significant differences in the pathologic findings of animals affected by BCHF versus Brisket disease, and this project shows that the genetic basis of the two problems is also likely to be different. The authors describe that tissues were collected from some unaffected animals at slaughter, but there was no description of what analyses were performed on these tissues. I am assuming these were used to assess gross morphologic changes in comparison to the tissues of affected animals at necropsy, but this was not described. There is a typographical error in the last sentence of the second paragraph of the Methods section, written as 'congesting' rather than 'congestive'.
