Thank you for clarifying the status of the error bars on the charts in the response to the reviewers comments. However, please state in the figure legends what the data points are showing in each figure so that the reader of the manuscript will be informed. i.e. mean +/- SD if that is the case. It is unclear what statistical tests have produced the data shown in Table 3 and in the text shown on page 7. According to the methods section, the authors state that they applied Student’s t-tests, Mann whitney tests, and Kruskall-wallis followed by Dunn’s post hoc tests. Please clarify in the manuscript results section and table/figure legends what tests have been applied specifically rather than simply providing p values. It would be appropriate to apply the Kruskall-wallis followed by Dunn’s post hoc tests in the places where the comparison involve greater than 3 groups per test; and where simple pairwise comparisons are made, it would be appropriate that tests should be multiple means corrected. Note that the data could be cube-root or square-root transformed in an effort to correct for non-normal distributions, thereby facilitating parametric analysis such as by ANOVA. The authors stated they had corrected the italicization of 'Anopheles' throughout. This is not the case. Paragraph 1 of Introduction: It was surprising to see a paraphrasing of the reviewers text "(i.e. repellents, barriers, clothing, head-nets, etc)." This was just a guess as to what the authors were referring to in terms of "personal protection". Last sentence of methods section of abstract has grammatical errors in it. Please refer back to original suggested text change in earlier Reviewers comments.
