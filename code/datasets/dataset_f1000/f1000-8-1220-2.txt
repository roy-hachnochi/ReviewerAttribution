The authors validated an EIA for testosterone and cortisol detection in serum of Aceh cattle. They also performed the biological validation of both hormones in serum. And finally, they evaluated the effect of freeze-thaw cycles on the stability of these hormones in serum. Although the technique they present is not new, the validation the authors perform are imperative for the proper hormone interpretation in every matrix, and thus this should be done for each species, matrix and assay of interest. The study has a robust experimental design despite using a low number of samples in some experiments. Results they present are very useful and may provide guidance for future studies to perform appropriate validations of their methods. My major concern is why the authors discuss that T is affected by the freeze-thaw cycles if results do not indicate the same. Additionally, I would suggest dividing the aims in three: analytical validation, biological validation and freeze-thaw cycles, as they may provide three different results and conclusions. I have also added some minor comments which can be found in the pdf document that I hope they will be useful for the authors.
