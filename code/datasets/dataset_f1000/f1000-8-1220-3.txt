 The details comment of the paper are attached (Please see attachment ). Overall the content are complete including the validation test and the Biological validation are conducted. The theory of similarity base chemical formula namely cyclopentano perhydro phenanthrene both of human and animal should be added. The information standard of parallelism should be added. Although the number of samples is less than specified (based on the Frederer formula), the results can still be accounted for because the amount of 12 samples is still very sufficient considering the large number of replications.
