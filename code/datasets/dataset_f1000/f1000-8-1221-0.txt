There is a huge need for teaching resources in computational areas for life scientist. While there are a growing number of resources, it is far from saturated. The authors focus on an important sub-area, high performance computing with an eye towards genomic sequence analysis. This is a smart choice as sequencing data has become an increasingly common tool in the life science and students recognize the need to be able to hand such data. The authors deliver a course consisting of seven workshops, four core and three optional. All the resources are shared online. The results of the course and feedback is shared making the strength and areas of potential improvements clear. As someone who delivers similar content to graduate student, and who has been design a similar course, I found the online resources valuable and something that I could use to build on for my own class. As such, I believe the article is ready for indexing.
