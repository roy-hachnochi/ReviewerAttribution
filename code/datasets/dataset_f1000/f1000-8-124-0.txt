The paper presents techniques to identify regions in working memory affected by schizophrenia from fMRI data. The procedure followed is methodical but the claims to identify previously unidentified brain regions need clinical verification. The classification is yielding impressive results but the dataset is too small to be conclusive, however I understand how difficult it is to obtain fMRI data for schizophrenic patients. Overall, I am satisfied with the technical contribution in this article.
