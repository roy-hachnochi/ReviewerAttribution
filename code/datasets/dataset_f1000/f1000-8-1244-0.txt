The manuscript is much longer than needed. The section on health effects could be much shorter by just citing work by other authors. It is not really relevant for this paper. Also the chapter on "Analytical procedures" could be shortened by citing. Only when methods are different from what is cited, there is a need to go into full detail. Several of the tables could be made more reader-friendly by changing these into graphs. In the Discussion, the authors present quite definite conclusions based on the results. It should be realized that the results are based on a very limited number of fish per site (5). In the Introduction, the authors state that they have investigated farmed and wild-caught Nile tilapias. In the results the wild-caught tilapias seem to be missing. In the Results, a significant difference is three times indicated as p = 0.00. This is a very unusual way to indicate significance. Better p 0.001. The relationship between fish culture and mercury levels is not treated well enough. In the Discussion the authors suggest that multi-species fish culture causes stress, thereby increasing mercury levels in the fish. The different types of fish culture were never mentioned. Maybe this information is in the Extended data. Since it is in the results and discussion, the relevant information on fish culture should be included in the main paper. "Risk-based consumption limits": Table 3 should be changed in Table 4. In the discussion the authors state: "The observation of low levels of total mercury in water sampled from fishponds may.....". In the results they call mercury levels in water "significantly greater than the critical value of 0.0001.g/ml". A contradiction! The suggestion that pH impacts "distribution of mercury to the brain tissue as a receiver organ......" is a bit far-fetched. pH has an enormous impact on the water quality, for instance on the carbonate balance. I would look for an explanation in that direction.
