This manuscript is a review paper on sclerostin and dickkopf-1 impacts on dentistry. The authors made good publication search work, and reviewed the expressions and biological functions of sclerostin and DKK-1 in each parts of tooth and surrounding tissues. Furthermore, the authors explored the correlation between SOST and DKK-1 and various pathologies. More importantly, the treatment pathways to target SOST and DKK-1 were discussed profoundly. The only flaw is the lack of SOST and DKK-1 in enamel formation, which does not affect the merits of this paper.
