The manuscript fits into the aim of the journal. The manuscript is well written and the results presented interesting. I would like to know the search strategy. Inclusion/exclusion criteria. Minor aspects: Endodontic perspective: "Given the importance of hypoxia-induced signaling in the early phase of pulp healing we investigated the production of SOST and DKK-1 in dental pulp cells upon treatment with hypoxia or the hypoxia mimetic agent L-mimosine in monolayer, spheroid, and tooth slice cultures". Citation? Periodontic Perspective: " Dental cementum is a mineralized hard tissue on the surface of root dentin and present either in acellular or cellular form. Defective cementum results in periodontal breakdown, tooth dysfunction, and finally leads to tooth loss." I recommend adding a reference. Finally, I recommend re-writing the conclusion without citations
