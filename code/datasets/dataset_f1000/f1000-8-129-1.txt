The authors present an efficient and very useful method for gene set analysis. Their approach is network based and facilitates retrieval of sets of genes that are highly connected. Grouping is due to common context (molecular pathways, biological function, tissue localisation). Furthermore, this procedure facilitates gene enrichment and the identification of singletons or poorly connected islands. The RICHNET workflow stands as a user friendly workflow that can be easily incorporated in automated analysis pipelines.
