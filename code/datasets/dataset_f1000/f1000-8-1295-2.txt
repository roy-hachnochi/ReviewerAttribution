Although the author explained the rationale of building the tool ChIPdig, I am not convinced why the author selected the exact tools to be included-- QuasR for alignment, BayesPeak for peak calling, differential calling with csaw+edgeR, ChIPseeker for genomic region annotation. To make a pipeline with pure R packages is an interesting idea. However, the end-users will miss the flexibility to choose tools they want -- usually the most popular tools in the field, compared with using the Galaxy or Snakemake framework. The use case presented is only based on modENCODE C.elegans ChIP-seq datasets published in 2011, so I wonder how the pipeline can be scaled up to deal with bigger datasets or data from a larger genome such as human data (author can use recent ENCODE data as an example). Without more use cases on recent data, the tool seems yet another ChIP-seq pipeline tailored for reanalyzing specific datasets. Lastly, ChIPdig uses QuasR qAlign function to align reads to reference genome, and qAlign is, in fact, a wrapper on Bowtie, which is included in Galaxy pipeline that the author compared. Therefore the difference of mapping results in figure 9a maybe just due to parameter settings. However, such information -- how the author generated Galaxy results -- is missing in the manuscript.
