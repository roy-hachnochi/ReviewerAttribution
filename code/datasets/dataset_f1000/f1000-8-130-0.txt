 It is an interesting manuscript. However, there are several grammatical issues and some typos that you should check very carefully. My main concern about your manuscript is that you have not mentioned any strengths or limitations in your study. The small number of rats per group is indeed a limitation and should be mentioned and taken into consideration before making conclusions. This is a prospective study on the effect of red-fleshed pitaya ( Hylocereus polyrhizus ) on heat shock protein 70 and cortisol expression in strenuous exercise-induced rats. The conclusion is weak in my opinion. The study could be considered more as a pilot study than a proper study; however the results are interesting and should be indexed.
