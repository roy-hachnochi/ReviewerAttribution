The rationale for this study is the potential for transfer of medicines into the fetal and infant brain, a subject that is little understood through lack of research. It is a relevant question as there is considerable exposure of the undeveloped brain to medicines via administration to pregnant women, breast feeding women and directly to infants. The focus is upon the ABC transporter family, efficient at protecting the adult brain from lipid soluble medicines, but about which little is known in the developing brain. This question is addressed by using labelled digoxin, cimetidine and paracetamol, substrates for 3 different ABC transporters. Transport into brain and CSF is measured using radioactively labelled drug, dosed acutely or chronically and at different stages of brain development. Expression patterns of the transporters are examined at different stages of animal development and correlations sought with the transport of drugs into brain/CSF. There were large contrasts between E19 animals and P4/Adults for brain/plasma and CSF/plasma ratios for all three drugs, (but perhaps less so for paracetamol, especially acute administration) with E19 having greater transport/permeability. Useful information regarding ratios of marker compounds with a range of octanol-water coefficients, drug ratios and transporter expression for acute and chronic treatment was obtained. The ‘system’ showed potential for investigation of new medicines, prioritising studies of drug action on brain development on the basis of uptake into brain, e.g. paracetamol’s greater propensity for transport into brain at E19, unravelling protective effects of transporters and adaptions to componentry of the ‘system’ with dosage, duration of therapy and drug combinations. The work is well done, clearly described, well illustrated and fairly presented.
