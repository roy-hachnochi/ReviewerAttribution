The authors introduce a package that aids in processing linelist data ( i.e., in which each row represents a case) for building, handling, and plotting epidemic curves. This tool fills a gap within the larger epidemics toolbox of the R Epidemics Consortium in ‘getting the basics right’, or otherwise put, getting data common to outbreak situations in the right format for further analysis. I agree with the authors that this is a helpful tool. This is particularly true during outbreaks, when linelist data need to be processed quickly and disseminated to relevant actors. The procedures are straightforward and well presented. The examples given in this work are well chosen and provide a good starting point for working with this package. I only have a few comments pertaining to i) the loglinear model implementation and presentation and ii) the integration with other packages. While the package is meant to focus on processing and visualization of data, the authors have added a modeling-capability that estimates epidemic growth rates. The respective function contains an option for estimating the peak of the outbreak and fit the exponential increase or decrease during the epidemic. Basing the time window for exponential growth on the timing of the peak will underestimate the growth rate as growth will no longer be exponential just before the peak of the epidemic. A more careful description in the MS is needed to highlight this and other shortcomings of this approach. Other methods to estimate the best time window, such as those used in the R0-package 1 , could prove helpful and be implemented in the package. Further, the choice of fitting the growth rates to the aggregated data rather than the two distinct regions (Girardot and San Andres) is a bit uncomfortable. Particularly so because, as the authors acknowledge, there seem to be two quite distinct outbreaks. The authors highlight the gap within the epidemics toolbox is filled. It would be nice to see a little bit more context on what packages can easily work with their data structures and what analyses can hence readily be done.
