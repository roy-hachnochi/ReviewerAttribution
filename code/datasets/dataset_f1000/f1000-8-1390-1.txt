I thank the authors for applying a few of my suggestions: Running an update search and adding one of my suggested studies; Changing the Fixed-Effect Model to Random-Effects Model (Effects not Effect); Balancing their conclusion. The manuscript can benefit from a native language editor. Unfortunately, the majority of the comments and concerns are still standing: revising search strategy involving a search expert, restructuring inclusion and exclusion criteria, reporting/listing/analysing side effects as outcomes, adding new text headings in Methods for screening, data extraction, assessment of risk of bias, and explaining the processes that require involving at least two reviewer, following PRISMA checklist items, discussing the results of heterogeneity test, removing first four paragraphs from discussion or moving them to introduction, and assessing, including or citing Azzawi's study or mentioning the reason for its exclusion. The authors have removed EBSCOhost and Ovid rather than mentioning the names of the listed of searched databases via these search interfaces.
