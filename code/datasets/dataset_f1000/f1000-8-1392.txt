At this stage in the publication process, our plagiarism detection software did not identify any significant duplication of text. Following publication of the article, the F1000Research editorial team were notified of a high degree of similarity between this manuscript and one already published in the Institute of Physics (IOP) Conference Series: Earth and Environmental Science (B Wiweko et al 2019 IOP Conf.

On investigation, the extent of overlap between these two publications was substantial, and this was deemed a case of duplicate publication. Duplicate publication is a major ethical issue and, as a member of the Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE) and a follower of the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) recommendations, F1000Research takes such matters seriously. 
 
In response to our concerns, corresponding author Budi Wiweko acknowledged that publication misconduct has taken place and has been informed that, due to the extent and nature of duplication between the articles published in F1000Research and IOP, F1000Research will retract the article and publish a linked retraction notice. 
&amp;nbsp; 
In line with COPE guidelines, F1000Research has informed the Publisher of IOP Conference Series about this issue, and our final decision has been communicated to all authors and their respective institutions.">

  "description": "The article titled &ldquo;Consumer perspectives on reproductive health after using the Jakpros smart mobile health application: A cross-sectional, qualitative study&rdquo; ([version 1; peer review: 1 not approved] F1000Research 2019, 8: 396 https://doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.17894.1) has been retracted by F1000Research on the grounds of scientific misconduct.
 
On submission to F1000Research, all manuscripts undergo plagiarism checks as standard&mdash;this is detailed in our Originality policies. Upon submission, authors are also required to declare that the article is not under consideration or review by another publisher. At this stage in the publication process, our plagiarism detection software did not identify any significant duplication of text. Following publication of the article, the F1000Research editorial team were notified of a high degree of similarity between this manuscript and one already published in the Institute of Physics (IOP) Conference Series: Earth and Environmental Science (B Wiweko et al 2019 IOP Conf. Ser.: Earth Environ. Sci. 248 012038 https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1755-1315/248/1/012038/pdf). On investigation, the extent of overlap between these two publications was substantial, and this was deemed a case of duplicate publication. Duplicate publication is a major ethical issue and, as a member of the Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE) and a follower of the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) recommendations, F1000Research takes such matters seriously.

In response to our concerns, corresponding author Budi Wiweko acknowledged that publication misconduct has taken place and has been informed that, due to the extent and nature of duplication between the articles published in F1000Research and IOP, F1000Research will retract the article and publish a linked retraction notice.
 
In line with COPE guidelines, F1000Research has informed the Publisher of IOP Conference Series about this issue, and our final decision has been communicated to all authors and their respective institutions."

Upon submission, authors are also required to declare that the article is not under consideration or review by another publisher. At this stage in the publication process, our plagiarism detection software did not identify any significant duplication of text. Following publication of the article, the F1000Research editorial team were notified of a high degree of similarity between this manuscript and one already published in the Institute of Physics (IOP) Conference Series: Earth and Environmental Science (B Wiweko <i>et al</i> 2019 <i>IOP Conf. Ser.: Earth Environ. Sci. </i><b>248 </b>012038 <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1755-1315/248/1/012038/pdf">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1755-1315/248/1/012038/pdf</a>). On investigation, the extent of overlap between these two publications was substantial, and this was deemed a case of duplicate publication. Duplicate publication is a major ethical issue and, as a member of the Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE) and a follower of the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) recommendations, F1000Research takes such matters seriously.<br/> <br/> In response to our concerns, corresponding author Budi Wiweko acknowledged that publication misconduct has taken place and has been informed that, due to the extent and nature of duplication between the articles published in F1000Research and IOP, F1000Research will retract the article and publish a linked retraction notice.<br/> &nbsp;<br/> In line with COPE guidelines, F1000Research has informed the Publisher of IOP Conference Series about this issue, and our final decision has been communicated to all authors and their respective institutions. </div> <div class=abstract-for-mobile> <div class="margin-top-30 padding-bottom-30 research-layout is-centered"> <button class="primary orange-text white-bg bigger-text abstract-expand-button-mobile with-border show" style="display: none;"> READ ALL <span class="f1r-icon icon-14_more_small orange vmiddle big"></span> </button> <button class="primary orange-text white-bg bigger-text abstract-expand-button-mobile with-border hide"> READ LESS <span class="f1r-icon icon-10_less_small orange vmiddle big"></span> </button> </div> </div> </div> <div class=clearfix></div> <div class="article-context no-divider"> <div class="article-abstract article-page-general-text-mobile research-layout generated-article-body"> <h2 class=main-title>Keywords</h2> <p class="u-mb--0 u-pb--2"> Jakarta Reproduksi Sehat, Jakpros, Mobile Application, Reproductive Health, Social Media </p> </div> </div> <div class=article-information> <div class="associated-data-articles margin-bottom"> <div class="associated-article padding-bottom"> <span class="associated-article-type bold">Associated Research Article</span> <span class=associated-article-info> <b>Budi Wiweko</b>, <b>Aida Riyanti</b>, <b>Shanty Olivia</b>, <b>Muhammad Priangga</b>, <b>Vita Silvana</b>, <b>Aruan Lewis Putro</b>, <b>Yohanes Satrya Wibawa</b>, <b>Ilonna Putri Pertiwi</b>, <b>Sarah Chairani Zakirah</b>, <b>Achmad Kemal Harzif</b>, <b>Gita Pratama</b>, <b>R.
