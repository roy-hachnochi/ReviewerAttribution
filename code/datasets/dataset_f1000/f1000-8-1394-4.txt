The manuscript focuses on the quality of CBD oils, which is a meaningful and contemporary issue. Table 2 is the core of the study, because it compares the claimed composition of CBD oil, with lab results obtained by the authors. The conclusion is that the currently available products in Germany are often not what they claim to be. Unfortunately, the authors did not analyze the actual CBD content of many of the products, and they assume that their own lab analyses are fully accurate, without proving or showing why. The authors use two different methods of analysis without explaining why one method is not sufficient. Also, in many parts of the text, they explain the current situation concerning CBD product without realizing that many readers may not have enough background information to follow their line of reasoning. The manuscript should be rewritten to explain basic concepts better. Also, more data should be added to table 2, particularly about CBD content of the products analyzed. Right now, CBD analysis data is missing for more than half of the samples. It is not clear why so many of the products have not been studied for CBD content, and this undermines the strength of the paper. In general, the idea behind the study is very good, but the execution is relatively poor because it only focuses on the THC content of the product analyzed.
