The authors report a patient presenting an uncommon complication of BCG immunotherapy to treat bladder cancer. It is a very interesting case, with the peculiarity that the patient presented important radiological and histopathological liver involvement without jaundice or very elevated transaminases. Some authors suggest to reserve the term of BCGitis to local, regional BCG induced disease, and BCGosis to a distant or disseminated BCG induced disease, like in this case. I believe that the manuscript would be more valuable if the authors review all the cases of intravesical BCG treatment complicated with BCGosis involving the liver (Desmet et al. , 2012 1 , Bodurtha et al. , 1974 2 , Kaklamanos et al. , 2011 3 etc.) and compare them to the present case. A table would be useful. Could you explain why corticosteroids were not used in this case since it presented in a severe fashion? Okano et al. (2019 4 ), reported a patient who was considered to have a hypersensitivity reaction to the liver after intravesical BCG who responded only to corticosteroids, and this study can be added and discussed.
