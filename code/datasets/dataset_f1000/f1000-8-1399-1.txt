The authors report on a case of iatrogenic sepsis induced by BCG immunotherapy to treat bladder cancer. The final diagnosis was made with clinical history, ultrasound imagery and histology of the liver revealing a granulomatous hepatitis. No confirmation was possible testing for M. Bovis but the patient improved under specific treatment. The overall structure and language of the document is elegantly built. I would suggest a more thorough review of cases of BCG induced sepsis or hematogenous spread to other organs, and its treatment. Please review some of the language namely: 1) there are (virgula) spread all over the text; 2) there are units of concentration lacking or improperly written; 3) the phrase " In a matter of days, the clinical outcome with resolution of the fever and normalized the inflammation markers at day seven from admission ." has no verb; 4) (singular) is written somewhere in the text and makes little sense to me. I am kindly cited in the references but my name is not correct.
