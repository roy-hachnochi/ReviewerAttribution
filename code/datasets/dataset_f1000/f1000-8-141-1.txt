The authors described the analysis of HA sequences from H1N1pdm09 viruses reported since 2009 to the last influenza season 2018-2019 in the USA. The analysis was performed using the electronic biology platform " wEB " and the ISM method. The aim of the study was to determine pandemic markers that could favor the (re)emergency of the H1N1pdm09 virus. They emphasize the role of three hotspots as predictors of pandemic potential according to the analysis performed. The authors refer to residues 94, 196 and 274. They mention in figure 1 and table 1 the proportion of viruses that have mutated in these positions. It would be good to complement table 1 with the amino acid changes that have occurred in these hotspots. When the authors say “that the pandemic potential of A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses in the USA has increased” what do they mean? They mention three viruses with pandemic markers, the same as 94, 196 and 274? Or different? On what evidence they base the assumption that these viruses could represent precursors of new pandemic viruses? Minor comments: The authors should mention what HA numbering are using, the H1 or H3 I recommend being cautious about the terms used as “(re)emergence” or “precursor of a new pandemic”. It is desirable always to include any biological data available to reinforce any conclusion that could have an impact.
