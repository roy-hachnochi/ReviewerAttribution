I do believe that the review should be useful for readers, it considers the state of the art on the role of microsatellitesfor the genetic analysis of Bombyx mori silkworm. The most recent citation dates from 2018; therefore, I suggest authors to search for more recent articles on other Lepidoptera of agronomic importance. The population of these pests tend to have the same genetic structure as the ones of Bombyx mori silkworm? Please make the comparison.
