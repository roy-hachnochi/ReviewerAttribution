The authors have scripted the manuscript properly and covered the appropriate and relevant literature necessary for understanding the characteristics of microsatellite and the evolutionary events associated with it in Bombyx mori genome. Further this review has focused on the literature pertaining to the applications of the microsatellite as markers, in genetic analysis studies and in construction of the linkage maps in B. mori . Interestingly, the authors have also discussed about the lacuna of using microsatellite in marker-trait association studies and construction of high density linkage maps in B. mori . The authors have brought out an important point that linkage map construction in silkworm cannot be adjusted to the other models due to their gender based effects and absence of chromosomal cross-linking in the germinal line of the female silkworms. In this line, recently proposed statistical models to analyze QTLs were also reported and explained in this manuscript. Comments In the last paragraph of Introduction, it was mentioned that this review will focus on the roles or strategies involving microsatellite markers for conservation of silkworm germplasm. But, in future scope, this part has to be included with effective strategies to conserve the silkworm germplasm using microsatellite markers. In addition, the authors can also report in the future scope about how these microsatellite markers has been employed in breeding programs to improve the genetic materials of different silkworms. In some parts of the manuscript, the sentences are very lengthy which can be simplified.
