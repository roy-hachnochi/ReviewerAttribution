This is a useful methods paper to help clarify any misconceptions researchers might have about what is strictly necessary in order to preserve genomic specimens. I feel like this information could be highly useful for field researchers but also as information to help students just starting research projects. Overall, I don't have many comments to make. The sample size is somewhat small but appears statistically valid. The one thing that would have been really nice to see is a comparison of the study findings to RNA degradation under ideal conditions (-80) as well as with no preservation methods - just dry on the table.
