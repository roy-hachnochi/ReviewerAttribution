The article is a well-written systematic review of studies that show that Zika virus infection is associated with congenital abnormalities, and with Guillain-Barr syndrome. Because it is a living systematic review, the study gives interesting and important updates. There are a few grammar errors that must be corrected: In Methods, correct is "This review and subsequent updates will focus on four..." In the sentence "Araujo et al. found a 73.1 (95% CI 130–Inf) times higher odds was reported for microcephaly...", I would delete "was reported", so it would be better if written "Araujo et al. found a 73.1 (95% CI 130–Inf) times higher odds for microcephaly when ZIKV infection was assessed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in the neonate." (page 6) PRNT (plaque reduction neutralisation test) should be defined when first mentioned. Correct non traveller to non-traveller (pages 9 and 10). The text mentions Figure 4 as showing the combined adverse congenital outcomes, and Figure 5 as showing microcephaly as outcome. However, this is not clear in the figures. In addition, why are the diagnostic tests considered outcomes in Figure 5? Figures should be self-explanatory, so I suggest mentioning GBS in the legend of Figure 6 so that the reader doesn't need to refer to the text. Also, VNT should be specified as virus neutralisation test in the figure legend.
