The manuscript presented the results in a straightforward manner. The Introduction should contain studies that had been conducted in the area and the research gap that the authors need to address. Perhaps the authors could have done statistical analyses to compare the diversity in the sites where the data have been obtained. In the Discussion section, the authors must clearly explain the implications of their study and the impacts of the results that they had in terms of managing the resources. I confirm that I have read this submission and believe that I have an appropriate level of expertise to confirm that it is of an acceptable scientific standard, however I have significant reservations, as outlined above.
