 General The paper tackles an important topic on preparedness for dust and sand storm, a common phenomenon in the EMR that has not been much studied. The authors have done a systematic review on the topic and reviewed 30 articles in a comprehensive manner. I have some specific comments: Abstract Expand results section and reduce methods. Line 2: “Numerous health problems caused by DSS will be severely affected regions”: Something missing in the statement. Line 2, results: The preparedness components were divided into three and ten main categories and subcategories: Revise to “The preparedness components were divided into three main categories and ten subcategories”. Introduction The introduction is concise and organized, however I feel that that the last lines “The findings of the study, with proposed recommendations, can directly help health policymakers in preparedness promotion for this phenomenon, pave the way for further studies, and add to the richness of the current knowledge” better be moved to discussion. . Results “Using of keffiyeh” in end of results, better to write what it means in brackets (Arab Headdress). Discussion Move some parts of the discussion to the introduction where they are more relevant particularly from the first paragraph. The authors can also mention in the limitations that some articles might have been published in local scientific journals that are not indexed and thus were missed from the review.
