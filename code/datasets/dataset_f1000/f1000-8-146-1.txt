In this article, the authors survey preparedness components of health systems in the Eastern Mediterranean Region for effective responses to dust and sand storms using a systematic review approach. It addresses an important topic, especially the preparedness of health system in Eastern Mediterranean Region. Regarding climate change, increasing temperatures and dust storms, awareness of the readiness and response of health providers is important. In this systematic review, the authors attempted to study the studies carried out in this regard. Below are more specific comments: In the abstract, the authors have paid too much attention to the methods, and the results are very limited and incomplete. The keyword “reediness” is wrong, it would be better to write "readiness”. A large part of the material written at the beginning of the discussion section is related to the introduction, and it would be better to move that section. It is recommended that the authors, after a brief description of the subject framework, focused on the findings of their study and then compare them with the findings of others. In the conclusion, the authors must clearly and explicitly state the message of their study.
