The manuscript "EEG anticipation of random high and low arousal faces and sounds" reports results from a study involving anticipatory activity, wherein sensory characteristic and arousal level are experimentally manipulated. By using a machine learning algorithm (Support Vector Machine), they found a significantly larger amplitude in occipital cluster of electrodes before the presentation of faces with respect to sounds, along with a larger amplitude in the right auditory cortex before the presentation of sounds with respect to faces. The study is well designed and well written; the results are interesting and add insight to the ongoing effort to understand the sources of anticipatory brain activity. In addition, the authors adopt open science practices, which increase the level and quality of reporting. There are a few minor issues to address: The authors should report exact number of participants in last paragraph of their introduction, instead of "a group of healthy volunteers". The sample size is somehow small, and is not consistent with what they declared in the OSF, the reviewer believe 6 more subject will increase the power, and it's not that difficult to have 6 more.
