The article presents a case of apicogenesis performed by gold standard methodologies. The novelty is the use of a photoactivated disinfectant instead of a triple antibiotic paste. Since NaOCl and EDTA used are sufficient to remove all the tissues that could avoid a proper regeneration of the apex, the effectiveness of the light activated disinfectant is doubtful. The title of the article is on regenerative endodontics, that is a procedure that aims to regenerate dental pulp, but no evidences of regeneration are presented in the article instead of the production of new dentine, which is obtainable with a simple apicogenesis procedure and also without the use of triple antibiotic paste. The overall novelty of the article is doubtful and the evidences of the regeneration of pulp are not explained at all. Dentine formation and the closure of the apex are evidences that could be obtained with gold standard techniques that do not involve the use of other expensive appliances like diode lasers.
