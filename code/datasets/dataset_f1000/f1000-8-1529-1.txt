As per my knowledge, there have been several studies in roles of cytokine profiles in human and animal malaria. This study aimed to determine important cytokines in malaria. These included IFN-γ, IL-12. TNF- α. They used rather appropriate sample size. However, as follows, it was found some points are unclear and should be clarified. The conclusion in the abstract is not clear. The authors did not indicate any cytokines. The rationale and the benefit of study is not clear. The author did not show the difference in any cytokine levels between P. falciparum and P. vivax infected patients. It seems that there are too many tables. Is it possible to merge Table 1 and 2; 3 and 6? Correlation between parasitemia and cytokines in Table 8 is not reliable. Sample size (n=4) is too small for determining correlation. The authors did not mentioned about detail of patients in ELISA results. Why sample size was 10 control and 29 patients?
