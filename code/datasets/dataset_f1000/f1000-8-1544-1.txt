This is a brief but fascinating study of the original descriptions of craniopharyngiomas as the tumours were able to be re-imaged using contemporaneous techniques. I have no major criticisms, but feel that the figures, which are the dominant feature of this manuscript, could be more sharp, possibly at a higher resolution. In addition, in many cases there are arrows in the figures which are not alluded to in the Legends. Finally, a minor point, in the text there is an absence of appropriate apostrophes: Page 3 second column, "This patients's tumour"; Page 4, first column, "shop keeper's widow". I also note that the references are given at the end numerically but not in the text.
