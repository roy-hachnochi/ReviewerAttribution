I am pleased with how the author has responded to my comments on the first version of this manuscript. The changes and the explanation of those changes in the author response satisfy me. One very minor thing, which I regret I did not spot or discuss on the first version of the manuscript: In April 2018, the official name of 'Swaziland' was changed from Kingdom of Swaziland to Kingdom of Eswatini sz. So the keywords for this manuscript should perhaps include 'Eswatini' rather than 'Swaziland'. Although I guess one could argue if the work was done pre-2018 when the country was called Swaziland perhaps calling it that better reflects the time-period?
