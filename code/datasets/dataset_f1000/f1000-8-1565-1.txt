This is a concise piece of work and perhaps the third paper addressing ovarian cancer in Sudan. The title is concise and reflects very well the content of the research, but a minor change below may be adopted by the authors: “The frequency of epithelial ovarian cancer subtypes in Sudanese women at Omdurman Maternity Hospital in the period 2013-2018, Sudan” Comments Methods: The authors may agree to add the word retrospective to the type of the study. Have the authors designed a data collection form for the purpose. Have they revised some of the archived histology slides or produced some from the archived wax blocks. What is the total number of EOC diagnosed during the period 2013- 2018 and what is thus the number excluded according to the exclusion criteria set by the authors. What is meant by “newly diagnosed EOC subtypes “diagnosed or described as this is a retrospective study and there are no new cases. (line 2 under study design) Results: Only one figure is presented. What about other data regarding residence, parity etc. It may be a good idea if the authors would agree to add a table/figure to display the tumour grades. Discussion: Is very short compared to the number of cited references. References: Are adequate and covered the research subject quite well but: About a third of the references covered the pathogenesis, behaviour, response to therapy and molecular biology of EOC. Reference 27 (please see below) looks a bit odd as it is about breast cancer. I know why it is cited (young African population) but still it looks odd. 27.
