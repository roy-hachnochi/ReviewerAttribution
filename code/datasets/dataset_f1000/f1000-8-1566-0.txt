Lipin 1 plays important roles in regulating intermediary metabolism by acting as a lipid phosphatase to synthesize diacylglycerol from phosphatidic acid. This is an important step in glycerolipid synthesis and a metabolic branch point. Mutations in lipin 1 in people lead to severe, recurrent rhabdomyolysis that can be debilitating or fatal. While these mutations are rare in the general population, they account for a significant proportion of acute paediatric rhabdomyolysis cases. In this case report, Yim and colleagues detail the identification of novel mutations in LPIN1 that are associated with rhabdomyolysis in a boy in Hong Kong. The report is well done and complete. The authors have done a good job of detailing the important literature on the topic. No changes are requested.
