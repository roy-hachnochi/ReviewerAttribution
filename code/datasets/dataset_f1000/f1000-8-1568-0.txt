After re-reviewing and checking my previous corresponding comments, I am sorry that the authors did not improve their paper well, because they did not carefully read the references. In this version, the authors said "A genetic variant of the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase gene (homozygous MTHFR) has also been found to increase the risk of BCS 9,10". However, reference 9 did not mention "methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase gene" at all. Indeed, I had provided a relevant reference for this point. The authors were not willing to read or use this reference. In this version, the authors said "Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) mutation leads to impaired fibrinolysis or hypofibrinolysis increasing the risk of prothrombotic disorders in the splanchnic venous circulation 9,11". However, reference 9 did not mention "Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) mutation" at all. It seems that they did not find any appropriate reference for explaining such a phenomenon. The authors said "Unfortunately we do not have more MRI imaging to illustrate our case report" as a reply. This reply cannot be approved, because the present images could not provide a definite diagnosis of BCS.
