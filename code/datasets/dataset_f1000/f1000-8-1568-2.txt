 In Introduction section, the authors said "Myeloproliferative disorders are responsible for 40-50% of primary BCS cases in the presence of JAK2 V617F mutation." These words are not accurate. Please see the reference regarding meta-analysis of prevalence of JAK2 V617F mutation in BCS cases (PMID: 21395632) 1 . Maybe the authors wanted to express the words "JAK2 positive MPD is about 40-50% in BCS cases". In Introduction section, the results of a meta-analysis found "the prothrombin G20210A mutation is associated with PVT, but not Budd-Chiari syndrome." (PMID: 24793031) 2 When the authors said "There is also an established association with prothrombotic disorders, acquired or inherited, such as factor V Leiden mutation, G20210A prothrombin gene, ...", please consider the accuracy of your words. In Introduction section, please conside the results of a meta-analysis "Homozygous MTHFR mutation and hyperhomocysteinemia may be associated with the occurrence of BCS" (PMID: 24773704) 3 , when you said "A genetic variant of the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase gene (MTHFR) has also been found to increase the risk of BCS". Please emphasize "homozygous". When you said "Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) mutation leads to impaired fibrinolysis or hypofibrinolysis increasing the risk of prothrombotic disorders.", please cite a reference. Is there any evidence regarding the association of PAI-1 mutation with splanchnic vein thrombosis? Please review the accuracy of your words "... female Caucasian, farmer, farmer, presented to ...". Give more images of contrast-enhanced MRI scans to demonstrate the hepatic veins. Please give the information regarding oral contraceptives. As for chronic BCS, please observe the risk of varices. Please consider endoscopy.
