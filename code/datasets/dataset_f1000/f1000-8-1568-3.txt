Authors reported a case who developed BCS due to heterozygous mutation for PAI-1 gene.The case is interesting and instructive. But I have some concerns: In the past medical history, authors reported that the pt had ITP. What was the last situation on ITH in terms of therapy. Was she under the any treatment such as glucocorticoids? Authors must state laboratory parameters correctly according to international rules; anti-b2-glicoprotein? anticardiolipin-b? In discussion section, authors should give us a little bit more literature data about the role of PAI-1 gene mutation on deep venous thrombosis.
