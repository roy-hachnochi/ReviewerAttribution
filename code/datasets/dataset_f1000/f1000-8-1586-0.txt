In the section on cardiovascular outcomes, I think it is important to address the fact that most of the studies looking at the effects of nicotine have been done in adults. The effects of nicotine on these same outcomes in adolescents and youth is not well known and may in fact be different. It is somewhat surprising that there is no section describing birth outcomes in animal studies as there have been a number of rodent studies done with nicotine alone and more recently studies looking at the effects of ENDS use during pregnancy in rodent models. Many of these studies have described pregnancy outcomes including birthweight and live birth index (a surrogate for stillbirth).
