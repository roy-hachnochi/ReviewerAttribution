I have read the above manuscript with interest and found it to be a good survey followed by their conclusions. The manuscript is well written with the data available and help understand the lacunae in snake bite management in Kenya. The study included authentic data collected for 5 years from JOOTRH between 2011-2016. They have screened 127 medical records having full desired data and made the analysis.They followed international classification from medical archives to arrive at their conclusions. The snake bite still remains a neglected tropical disease in Kenya as is similar in other tropical countries. The fact that snake bite victims have to travel a long distance to avail antivenom is certainly a big draw back. Even in some cases, the antivenom is still not available in place like JOOTRH. The results of the present study should be made available to Health officials to take adequate measures for future snake bit management. Ideally local county hospitals should be empowered to reduce travel time and cost of treatment. Antivenom may be made available in referral hospitals to reduce, mortality and cost of treatment especially when the average monthly income of citizen is $44. The quality of antivenom also to be improved, probably with support from UN. It is welcome to take initial traditional and dependable herbal medicines and avail anitvenom from nearest county hospitals.The authors deserve credit for their commitment and concern for snake bite cases in Kenya. The manuscript is well written and the language is good. I recommend the manuscript for indexing in your journal and also with a request to implement the important findings of this study to reduce the snake bite deaths and sufferings of the survivors.
