This is a very interesting and important subject to interrogate especially in the Sub Saharan region where snake bite is a significant public health concern even though it is a neglected one. The financial burden of snake bite injuries on the health sector is even more neglected despite the fact that it is significant. So this study is indeed a welcoming breath of fresh air so to speak. This work is acceptable for indexing with some minor corrections/revisions. While most of the current citations were referred to the paper can be enriched by citing work which has been carried out in the region, e.g. South Africa and Zimbabwe, to emphasise the commonality of the problem in the region. The authors could also add references from the WHO “Guidelines for the Prevention and Clinical Management of Snakebites in Africa”. Although the guidelines are not very recent, they are still the prevailing ones. What is the age group of “child” according to the authors? What is the relevance of marital status to snakebite injuries? Circumstances of injury, “walking”, can this be explained further…walking where? What is “homemaking”? Perhaps the length of hospitalisation, the site of injury and the kind of snake can be associated to give a more vivid picture. Also the association of cause of death, snake type and injury can be elaborated. Snake identification can be confusing and difficult. A black snake is not necessarily a black mamba. A black mamba is in fact not black! It's black inside the mouth. What was the cause of death of the two who died after receiving antivenom? Was it due to reaction to the antivenom or late medical attention and what was the kind of injury?
