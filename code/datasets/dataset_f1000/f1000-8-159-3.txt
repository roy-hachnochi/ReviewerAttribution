This is a well-written manuscript about Anti-Mullerian hormone levels in female cancer patients of reproductive age in Indonesia. The aim of the study is to predict the reproductive function of cancer patients. The major limitation of the study is a low number of participants in two groups. I have a few other comments for the authors. Page 3 left panel L 21: I think the AMH levels are known to be one of the best parameters for predicting ovarian reserves. I do not think this is the best parameter. I need the author's opinions. Page 3 left panel L 43: Please add the information about the past history of pregnancy and birth, and infertility treatment in the non-cancer group. Whether there is racial difference? Please add the author's opinions in the discussion. Please add more precise opinions regarding the reasons why ovarian aging occurs earlier in cancer patients.
