The authors report a case of juvenile angiofibroma (JA) occurring in a patient with haemophilia, where severe epistaxes were ascribed to the bleeding disorder and no underlying cause was sought for a period of two years. Following transfer to the author's institution, the JA was managed successfully by surgery with pre-operative embolisation and optimisation of haemophila therapy. There were no surgical complications and the patient has remained symptom free after long term follow-up. This represents only the second reported case of JA occurring in a patient with haemophilia. The report underscores the importance of considering a separate explanation for epistaxis in a patient with an underlying coagulopathy, and particularly where there are other symptoms suggestive of intra-nasal pathology. The article is well written and carries a clear message. Minor points for the authors to consider providing further information are: It is implied, but not actually stated, that during the two year period where the JA was overlooked, the patient's haemophilia was poorly controlled (which presumably contributed to overlooking the diagnosis of JA). Is this the case? If treatment proceeded uneventfully, why did the patient require hospitalisation for a period of 2 months?
