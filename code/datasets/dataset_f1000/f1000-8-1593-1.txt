This is an excellent and well written case report about a young adult with a hematologic disorder and a coexisting angiofibroma. It delves into the difficulties this case presents to the treating surgeon, reviews the relevant literature (of which there is only one previous report), and reminds us that just because someone has a bleeding disorder does not mean they cannot also have a rare vascular tumour.
