The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of LH and granulosa cell LH-R in poor responder patients who underwent COS. Then the authors analyzed the expression of LH-R in the granular cells from poor responder and non-poor responders and found the expression of LH-R mRNA had a positive correlation with oocyte quality in poor responder patients and a negative correlation in non-poor responders. The aim of this study was vague. The conclusion was not consistent with the purpose of this study and made with insufficient supporting data. The correlations between the LH-R expression and oocyte quality was established based on Spearmanâ€™s test analysis. However, the oocyte quality might be correlated with age, BMI, basal FSH level, basal LH level and other factors. To analyse the correlation between the expression of LH-R and oocyte quality, multivariate logistic regression should be performed to quantify the effect of all related factors on the oocyte quality.
