The authors suggest a new statistical procedure to analyze in more depth a common performance measurement in the Morris Water Maze experimental procedure. The manuscript is well-written and all the methods explained in detail. The new proposed method is well-justified and shows much potential in the field of data analytics for behavioural procedures similar to the Morris Water Maze. Code of all the methods that the author describe is open source and publicly available. Instructions on how to run the code are clear. I would like to point out some aspects that could have been addressed/discussed more: For the post-hoc analysis the authors suggest the usage of t-tests on the four quadrants. Have the authors consider, if applicable, alternative tests of hypothesis in case the assumptions of the t-test (e.g. the data are not normally distributed) are not fulfilled? The authors focus on the probe trials but couldn't analysis on other types of trials (e.g. reversal learning) also been benefit from their method? Can the authors comment if their method is also applicable to other scenarios where there are mutually exclusive possibilities?
