The authors submitted a protocol studying two different prophylactic regimens in patients undergoing Holmium Laser enucleation of the prostate. The study is randomized. The topic of the study is worth while studying, as there are relatively little data especially in laser enucleation of the prostate. The study design is well described and set up, including the important in- and exclusion criteria. There is one exclusion criterium leucocyturia, which should be reconsidered, as especially patients with large prostates, might have elevated leucocytes in their urine, and those patients would not be included in the study, although holmium laser enucleation is especially done in patients with large prostates.
