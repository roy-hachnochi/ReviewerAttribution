This study protocol aims to establish optimal duration of cefazolin antibiotic prophylaxis prior to HoLEP procedure. The rationale and objective of the study protocol is clearly defined and the overall study design looks appropriate. Regarding details of the method, I have a couple of queries. First, one-day dosing and single-dose dosing should be distinguished. If you look at your protocol, it's single-dose (CEZ 1g, once per i.v. just before HoLEP/TUEB). However, the study title is 1-day vs. 2-day. Cefazolin is a cephalosporin antibiotic and is time-dependent. Therefore, 1-day (two or three doses per a day) and single-dose are different dosages. Second, most studies select a 3-day regimen as a comparator. Why did you choose 2-day? The reason for comparing the 2-day regimen in this study should be more clear.
