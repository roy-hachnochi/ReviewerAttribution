Wong et al describe a Chinese kindred with FHH in which they have identified a previously described mutation in AP2S1 . This is a comprehensive case report with detailed descriptions of the proband and several family members. Whilst not novel, this report describes FHH3 in a new ethnic population and further demonstrates that mutations in the Arg15 residue are the most commonly identified in FHH3. I have recommended some minor edits to improve the clarity of the report that are outlined below. At present there are very few references in the introduction. Perhaps a few more could be inserted. Please add an asterisk (or other appropriate symbol) next to statistically significant values in Table 1. This will make it immediately clear to the reader which values are significant. The statement about FECa being 1% in FHH is made on page 3. This should be brought forward to page 2 following the first statement about the proband’s FeCa. The second paragraph of page 2 begins with a statement about other members of the proband’s family, then goes on to discuss the proband again. I think this statement should be moved down to just before the mutational analysis. It will make the case report easier for a reader to understand if the proband is discussed first, then other family members later.
