 General comments The authors sampled children and their parents who had attended a hospital learning center to identify practice patterns, satisfaction and impact. A very good study highlighting the importance of educating hospitalized children and the impact on children and families. The paper needs to be edited again for grammar and spelling. Specific Comments Table 1 - How often do you explain the lesson to your child? Almost never repeated twice. I believe it should read -Almost always. The discussion part has to be rearranged. After results, the authors can discuss their finding, then either use implications, limitations and conclusions. The first part of the discussion can be moved to the methodology section so that the readers know what common diseases and chronic diseases are being discussed.

The key messages can be given in a separate text box as bullet points: Education of hospitalized children should be supported and promoted to encourage students to continue their studies in the regular education system. Teachers at hospital learning centers should coordinate their curriculum with regular school teachers and modify the curriculum to suit the childâ€™s educational need. Mobile learning centers can be used for some children to teach at the bed side. Electronic devices can be used to enhance the education of hospitalized children
