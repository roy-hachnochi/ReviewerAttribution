This report by Van Dijck et al. seeks to evaluate the anti-gonococcal activity of several commercially available mouth washes, as well as of one commercial and several in-house produced 'placebo' mouth washes. The authors find that all tested commercially available mouth washes have some anti-gonococcal activity, and that some of the 'placebo' mouth washes did as well. This study is important as mouth washes have been suggested as a potential tool for prevention of gonorrhoea on an individual and a population level. Trials examining the efficacy of oral mouth wash need a 'placebo' without anti-gonococcal activity. This report provides important data towards that. This brief report is clearly written. The conclusions are based on the data. The limitations of the small study are clearly described in the Discussion. I am a physician and epidemiologist and recommend that also a microbiologist should review the manuscript. I have a few minor comments: In the abstract it is not clear how the 5-point scale of N. gonorrhoeae growth is to be interpreted; make it explicit that 0 means no growth and 4 extensive growth. The abstract mentions an IQR of 2-3 for placebo 6 at 60 minutes; Table 4 mentions an IQR of 1-3. Please check and correct. Not all readers may be familiar with the term "pharmaecological" (perhaps better spelled as "pharma-ecological"?) so a fuller explanation may be helpful.
