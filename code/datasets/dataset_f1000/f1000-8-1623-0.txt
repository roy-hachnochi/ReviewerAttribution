The manuscript deals with a very interesting and intriguing topic, as a special instance of the broader topic of active learning. Therefore, even if it is a small-scale trial, it deserves interest. The main problem is the lack of theoretical foundation, that in my opinion causes an inconsistent interpretation of the results. Actually the authors saw a very good track of interpretation when they wrote “The method used in the present study involves different forms of active participation and at the same time a study about the students’ own bodies at everyday situations and provides an active visceral learning .” (page 7, first column). I suggest that they should dig into this topic, using the concepts and theoretical background of the “embodiment” to drive the Discussion. I suggest some reading at this proposal, just as examples (I’m not the author of any of these articles…) to focus the idea of “learning with/about own body”: Body pedagogics: embodied learning for the health professions.

Med Educ. 2019 Oct;53(10):960-962. doi: 10.1111/medu.13943. 4 The lack of theoretical foundation is also reflected by some of the statement of the manuscript: Page 3 , 1 st column - “Problem-based learning (PBL), which frequently involves simulations of real situations”: that’s Case-based Learning (CBL), another active method. Page 5, first paragraph of the Discussion: the authors quote single studies to support they claim about the inconclusiveness of research about the superiority of active learning methodologies, but we have plenty of high-grade evidence about this topic. When meta-analyses are available, they should be quoted in the Discussion, instead of a “cherry-picking” approach to low grade evidence. I list just some, as an example: Effectiveness of various innovative learning methods in health science classrooms: a meta-analysis.

Further, the references supporting this paragraph are of studies on high school students. Some more comments: Abstract (and also in the text, at the end of the Introduction): the goal of the study is described as “to assess whether this intervention could help assess the influence of self-experiments on student learning.”. I suggest that the goal of the study should be better expressed with reference to a research hypothesis “we hypothesize that the intervention will produce a better … than …”. So, the goal is to confirm or refuse the hypothesis Page 3, first column “The few reports on self-experiments frequently involve activities that are not part of the students’ routine”. There is only one reference, so either you add “as for example in…” or you add some more references. The same problem is at page 5, end of 1 st column “Nevertheless, most studies whose authors affirm that active-learning methods are better than others are based on theory, as they do not show experimental results or do not use proper control groups (26).” I also highlighted “most studies”, because it is a statement that should be supported by data. Only a systematic review could support this statement. See also my comment about the use of high-grade evidence in Discussion. Experimental design, page 3, 2 nd column: second line: “dived” for divided “According to a sample calculation performed using G*Power 3.1 software, the group should contain a total of 71 students of the second term the Bachelor of Pharmaceutical Sciences (33 active and 38 observers 38) to achieve a statistical power of 60% to achieve the objectives.” I cannot understand because the groups are different in number of students. Figure 1: I guess that the labels of the columns are inverted, because the score is higher before than after. The vertical axis is not clear, it seems that the students gave only 8% of right answers. Table 1, second cell: “self-experimentation”, please correct. Table 2: I find no use in intertwining the data of glycemia with the descriptive data. They are not experimental data. On the contrary, the descriptive data of the control group are missing, so the reader can only guess that the two groups were comparable for sex and age. Discussion, page 7, 1 st column, “The significant increase in the grades only in the subgroups that ingested glucose and fructose and not in the grades of the subgroup that remained fasting”. This statement seems to be contradictory with what stated few lines before “The lack of difference in grades in the test after the experiment among the subgroups that participated actively in the experiment (fasting, glucose, and fructose)”. Discussion, page 7, beginning – “This finding corroborates positive results of methods that involve self-assessment of learning by the students (15).” In the international literature of medical education (and in reference 15) self-assessment is intended as evaluation of outcomes of learning by the students themselves and not as measuring something upon themselves, like the glycemia. Few lines below “But s no study has used control groups”, please cancel the “s”.
