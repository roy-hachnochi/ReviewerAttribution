This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to analyse the efficacy and safety of different treatment approaches for acute basilar artery occlusion. The paper reads reasonably well and the authors acknowledged the main limitations of the study. However, the paper could be improved by the following revisions: Abstract: Please add a description of the main outcomes in the methods. Please include relevant definitions for “good clinical outcome” (mRS 0-2), “recanalization” (TICI 2b-3, mTICI 2b-3, TIMI 2-3) and “sICH” (ECASS II). Please cite the results of the BEST trial in the introduction. Please briefly describe the main results in the “Primary outcomes for the IVT, IAT and EVT groups” and “Secondary outcomes for the IVT, IAT and EVT groups”, in addition to the relevant tables and figures. Can the authors provide a descriptive figure for clinical outcome, recanalization and safety profile for ADAPT vs stent retriever thrombectomy? Figures 2b-c and 3b-c are not legible. Please improve the quality of these figures. Please add a comment and cite the following article in the discussion: “ Firstline a direct aspiration first pass technique versus firstline stent retriever for acute basilar artery occlusion: a systematic review and meta-analysis ” by Ye et al. (2019 1 ). Please rephrase the sentence "There was a statistically significant correlation towards increased recanalization across time with IAT and EVT therapy, but not IVT therapy" for greater clarity. Consider deleting the paragraph on the use of Solitaire vs Merci device in anterior LVO strokes as not pertinent. There are several typos in the abstract, main body of the manuscript and figures: i.e. modified Ranking Score, incleded, etc. Please review the text for accuracy. Please use scientific terminology rather than common language throughout the paper (i.e. peoplepatients, in different waysdifferent clinical presentation, etc.).
