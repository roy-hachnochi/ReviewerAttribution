To rule out neoplastic disorder, you need to get an excisional biopsy - not perform blood tests (case presentation p1). Add any serological tests like toxo, hiv, csd, cmv-ebv etc. that you might have done to rule out infectious causes of lymphadenopathy apart from IGRA which the authors have mentioned already.

How does the involvement of supraclav lad make the case unique? Final Comments: Authors have done a great job in summarizing KFD and have beautifully presented the case. With only a little alteration in the case presentation by adding serological markers will make the case look more complete - although it's not necessary.
