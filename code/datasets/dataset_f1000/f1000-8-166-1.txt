The comparative study between direct measurement of the skull and the stitching CBCT data obtained from different view had been well designed and performed. The statistical analysis are appropriate and sufficient to make the conclusion. The study showed the accuracy of stitching method using a commercial software. Some of the issues should be raised in the discussion part for more information of the study. The use of dry skull compared to the real clinical situation in term of soft tissue, does the soft tissue impair the clinical accuracy? If comparing the measurements between the stitching technique to the large field of view in CBCT (full skull sensor), how is the accuracy? The limitation of the study should be mentioned. The clinical implication? It should be discussed about the software used, would the results be different if the clinician used the different software?
