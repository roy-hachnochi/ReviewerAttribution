This improvement has been more scientific sounds. The authors discuss based on the experimental results. The manuscript; however, has major concerns on the unclear conclusion, miscommunication, and writing problems. Methods: Rice variety should be firstly introduced in scientific names. Results: Unbalance parenthesis when introducing the methane emissions from 1st, 2nd, and 3rd cropping periods. The sentence on “The total emission should be higher than that of the 3rd crop: because the absence of rice plants doubles the methane emission from the field (Oda and Chiem, 2019)” is not understandable. What is the total emission? Why does the absence of rice plants cause double emission? The sentence on ”In the present study, the pattern was the same as the previous study (Oda and Chiem, 2019)” is also hard to understand. What is the present study? Oda and Chiem (2019) or this study? If the author means this study, it was also not the same as the previous study since no emission peaked at the heading stage. Figure 2 should provide additional information on the heading stage, irrigation period, and period of the full canopy development ​​​​​​ Discussion: the sentence on “the rice straw is decomposed without methanogenesis in the water because the water includes dissolved oxygen” is doubtful. The author should discuss more how CH 4 forms without methanogenesis and how to be confident that the DO in the water did not deplete for the entire 2-month flooding.
