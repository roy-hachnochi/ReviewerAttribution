The idea of estimating methane emissions from rice paddy fields is not novel. Many publications, including those conducted in SE Asia, have been widely accepted, such that collected and reported in the 1996 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories: Reference Manual . The study on triple rice cropping in the Mekong River Delta is quite interesting since few studies carried on such the cropping system, but usually estimating the total flux based upon one single cropping experiment. My first significant concern in this work is involved with the methodology of methane sampling and analysis. The closed chamber method used in this study (Oda and Chiem, 2019) had not yet been validated with other traditional closed chamber studies. Furthermore, methane emission using this method seems to return significantly higher methane emissions compared to those emissions reported worldwide in the IPCC report. Since very much high emission rates can result in significantly overestimating methane emissions from the SE Asia region, I suggest the authors carefully discuss the reliability of the proposed method in comparison to the traditional method. My last concern is on the suggestions given by the authors. They claim that decomposing rice straw in paddy surface-water (nonrice period) is an effective method to reduce methane emissions. This suggestion is not conforming to the fact that the wetland system is a significant source of methane emission. I think the author could mean lower methane emission during the nonrice flooding period, but the conclusion written in the manuscript is not clear that way. Although, I think the conclusion given by the authors is not feasible since promoting long-term nonrice flooding instead of rice cropping could mean lower rice yield.
