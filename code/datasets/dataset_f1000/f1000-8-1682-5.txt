This is an interesting and original study that deepens the knowledge about interventions aimed at improving adherence to reporting guidelines by medical journals, an important issue. The study focuses on the perspective of the biomedical editors and provides valuable information on their perceptions of various interventions that have been proposed, identifies barriers and facilitators and provides possible solutions. However, the study includes a limited sample of participants (24 editors belonging to 20 medical journals), which limits the scope of the conclusions. Although the study, according to its stated objectives, does not intend to offer a representative view of the editors of all medical journals, the limited number of participants as well as their representativeness (the sources from which they were identified and selected allows us to think that it is a highly selected sample of publishers with previous experience and a potential motivation in the subject), is not mentioned in the discussion. It is noteworthy that, despite this potentially "favourable" sample, the response rate is very low (24%). What would have been the participation rate and the responses if a larger and more representative sample had been selected? Although this was not an objective of the study, it would deserve some reflection in the discussion. It would also be useful to provide details on the origin of the participants in the survey according to the sources of selection, which would improve the description of the sample. The results presented both in the section on current practices as well as in perceptions and in barriers and facilitators are consistent, clear and practical. The analysis is descriptive and does not pose difficulties.
