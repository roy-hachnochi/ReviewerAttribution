This paper reports on the views of a sample of biomedical editors on editorial interventions to improve adherence to reporting guidelines. The paper is clear, transparent, and well documented. A limitation of the study is that the results are based upon a survey return rate of just 24%. The returns are likely biased favouring editors with stronger views on reporting guidelines. In addition, it is not clear whether all ten of the top-ten journals were represented, or whether one or more journals dominate the response rate. In addition it is not completely clear how many participants came from the MiRoR Network, or journals previously publishing studies on Reporting Guidelines. Figure 1 is hard work to interpret and might be presented more usefully as two separate graphs. In addition, the colour scheme could be changed to highlight those interventions considered "Very easy" or "Moderately easy" to implement, and those ranked as "Very effective" or "Moderately effective". (Note that the proportions of each score could still be retained.) However, this is a useful addition to the literature offering valuable insight into some views on guidelines and candidate interventions promoting closer adherence to guidelines. The paper would be improved by a paragraph on Limitations of the Study.
