The authors have designed an elegant study to maximize their ability to use existing supportive interventions in the prevention of delirium. This study is very much needed and wish the very best for the authors to complete all the elements proposed in this study. The authors note this as a factorial design. In Fig. 1 this is categorized as usual HELP vs. Enhanced HELP system. The study is powered for interventions vs. controls. Enhanced HELP, Family support and HELP plus family support are all intervention groups. Is this powered to 15 vs. 45 (unbalanced)? While they note that n=30 in their power calculations. This is confusing. Given 1, is factorial design the best suited for this study? In the HELP group, all efforts are taken to make sure the investigators get two assessment right before they become eligible to score CAM. Why aren't the same efforts taken for FAMCAM as well? I suppose there will be logical issues, perhaps scoring with case videos might be one option. Inclusion criteria mentions high-risk group and yet age is the only one chosen to define high risk. Or have I missed other risk factors in the inclusion criteria? Family support can do certain things and HELP can do certain things. I presume this will be complimentary. It will be interesting to find out the results of this study.
