I think that this is a sound idea but I have several questions about the quality of the study and paper. In the introduction the definition of SUI is not correct, they have provided the definition of UI. They comment about prevalence in pregnancy but not about how many it resolves in post partum. Methods There is no standardization of the cough test - how was a full bladder defined. Why was PFMT taught by Dr's - is this normal practice, were physios involved. Mode of delivery - what about forceps - do you not do this? Discussion There is no mention about what is normal PFM strength on perineometry in women without SUI who are not pregnant. How will this going to change practice? You report that you found modifiable factors but how is EFW modifiable. There is no comment about what is normal antenatal care regarding PFMT and advice.
