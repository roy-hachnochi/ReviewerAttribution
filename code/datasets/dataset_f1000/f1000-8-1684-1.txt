The present article is an interesting study. From the background of the study, showed that stress urinary incontinence (SUI) is a common in pregnancy caused by several things including uterine growth, hormonal influences, and biomechanical disorders in the pelvis. These factors make the muscle tone and muscle strengh in the pelvic region decrease during pregnancy. The authors describe that the background of the research concisely and is easy to understand the reasons for doing this research. Previously, a lot of studies have been done to investigate the effect of pregnancy on SUI. but little evidence has shown about PFM cut off value for SUI. The authors investigate the relationships between SUI and obstetric factors during pregnancy and patient characteristics in Indonesian women, to identify the clinical predictors of SUI, particularly PFM strength, in the third trimester of pregnancy using a digital examination perineometer, and to develop a predictive model of SUI with cutoff points for use in practice for the early detection, and possible prevention, of modifiable risk factors that contribute to the development of SUI during pregnancy. From the present study, we can see the the cut off PFM strengh and fetal weight to correlated with SUI in pregnancy. I think that the present study does not have big problem and is well-organized.
