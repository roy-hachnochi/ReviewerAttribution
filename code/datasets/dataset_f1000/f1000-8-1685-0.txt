This study takes a number of infections for which vaccine interventions exist or may exist, considers their relevance to AMR and takes into account the vaccines that have been prioritised for investment by GAVI. A number of experts have been asked to prioritise these vaccines against criteria that were predetermined and scored against AMR importance elements. This prioritisation exercise is very similar to those previously undertaken by and on behalf of the WHO Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on immunisation (SAGE). The results of these previous exercises, as this one, were driven essentially by mortality, and to a lesser degree, by morbidity: the results are not surprising irrespective of the complexity of the scoring system. Meanwhile, some confidence can be derived from this subjective process that the GAVI vaccine priorities remain relevant from an AMR perspective.
