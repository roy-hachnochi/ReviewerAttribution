This article is an acceptable scientific standard with some corrections: The introduction part is not structured well and the flow of the written matter is missing. The objectives and hypotheses of the study were not discussed. In the discussion, it was reported that CH group has shown significant correlation between post-operative pain with gender and age of the patients but the statistical analysis was not provided. Preferable to place definitive conclusions from the outcome of the study.
