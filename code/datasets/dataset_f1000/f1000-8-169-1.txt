This is a sub-study of an already published major study (CARINEMO ANRS 12146) that initially evaluated the efficacy of Niverapine- and Efavirenz-based Antiretroviral therapy (ART) in patients on concomitant anti-tuberculous therapy. This sub-study utilized viral load, resistance and drug level data to answer an important question about the relationship between low drug levels in the early phase of ART and week 48 virological escape/possible emergence of resistance. This is a relatively understudied area and the authors provide very useful data that has otherwise been unavailable in published literature. The manuscript is well written and easy to understand with sound statistics, straight forward results and justifiable conclusions.
