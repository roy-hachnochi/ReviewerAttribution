Work presented by Azizi A et al described a spectrophotometric assay to detect the presence of phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors. This could used as a basis in the early stages in a pipeline to develop a method to detect PDE5i in suspect counterfeit drugs. Though preliminary and brief in nature, these findings shed light on the potential use of this assay from an application standpoint. However, the authors are asked to address some comments below before this manuscript is fully acceptable: Grammatical and language mistakes found throughout. Recommend English proofreading Authors are asked to define CX1A in the abstract The term "Sil" was used in the abstract and introduction. Please define at first use or change to Sildenafil. Table 1 is unnecessary as Fig 2 clearly depicts this more clearly. This also applies to Table 3. If need be put the raw data as supplementary data The results section was poorly written. It is too short and reads like a technical document. It lacks thought and short conclusive statements. Either re-write this section or consider merging the results section with the discussion section (if allowed by journal guidelines) Table 4 and 5 should be merged into one The beginning of the discussion section reads poorly, making it hard for readers to grasp the essence of the paper. Authors should firstly highlight the main findings from their study then critically analyse their data.
