This is an interesting study carried out by Chen et al ., focusing on human serum biomarkers values to improve the diagnosis and predict prognosis of severe traumatic brain injury (sTBI). They have described human kallikrein 6 (hK6) and prostaglandin D2 synthase (PGDS) as potential new markers of injury, coupled with NSE and S100B. The methods are clear and the results are very well described. A larger sample is necessary to confirm the proposed ratios, as pointed out by the authors, so multiple variables can be combined, increasing the statistic power. In consequence, the conclusions are still limited, but these findings are promising and worthy of future research. The pathological/biochemical mechanism to explain the increase of S100B and NSE in sTBI has been described and makes perfect sense. The protein S100B is produced and released primarily by astrocytes in the central nervous system and is a peripheral biochemical marker of neural injury, including reactive gliosis, astrocytic death, and/or blood-brain barrier dysfunction. Neuron-specific enolase (NSE) is a glycolytic pathway enzyme, predominantly neuronal, so increased CSF/serum levels of NSE and GFAP indicate neuronal and astrocyte damage. We are still puzzled by the role of hK6 and PGDS and further research should focus also on describing the underlying cellular mechanisms related to the presented findings. It is also noticeable that S100B and NSE proteins are also expressed in other non-neural cell types under physiological and pathological conditions, so future studies should control for that, especially in trauma.
