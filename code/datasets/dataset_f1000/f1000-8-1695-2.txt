Time for blood sampling after the brain injury is critical, especially for S100B. Biomarker S100B is increased within minutes after blood-brain-barrier (BBB) disruption. The passage to the systemic circulation is critical, especially the fact that only the BBB is damaged and not the brain. Another point is that most of these markers are expressed to varying degrees outside the central nervous system. If possible a more precise time between injury and sampling would be an additional help in the interpretation. In the next study, send a sample within the specified time to calculate the difference in S100B concentrations. In severe traumatic brain injury, we have cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) as well and it would be helpful to determine albumin (in CSF and plasma) to see if there is a brain or vessel damage.
