The manuscript deals with an interesting topic in the field of pneumococcal resistance epidemiology. The link between antibiotic use and the emergence of bacterial resistance has been clearly established and many studies have shown the increase in antibiotic resistance of S. pneumoniae . Due to geographical diversity of S. pneumoniae resistance, which depends on the local antimicrobial policy, epidemiological studies in each geographical region should be determined and analyzed separately. The topic is interesting and worthy of note, yet the manuscript have to be improved. Abstract: Methods paragraph is too detailed. Method: In my opinion, the methods - especially related to diagnostic tests - are described too extensively. Results: The authors should avoid duplicating the results in tables and in the text. The first paragraph of the Results is unnecessary. All data are shown in Table. The last sentence of the Result " The odds of being resistant to the tested antimicrobial agents significantly increased when the subjects had been attending daycare centers" is an over interpretation of the statistical analysis. All but one tests showed insignificant differences between the analyzed groups. The term odds in description of the statistical analysis results sounds awkward. The authors should rewrite the text using other terms, for example risk. Discussion: The first paragraph of the Discussion is a repetition of information given in the Introduction.
