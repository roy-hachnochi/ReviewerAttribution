 General comments: This study describes the occurrence of pathogenic spirochetes for swine in Poland herds using routine diagnostic cases submitted to their reference laboratory. As a result, sampling was bias for a prevalence study, so the decision of just describe as occurrence was adequate. The data represents important information for Poland swine production, but not so relevant for the rest of the World. Figure 1 is illustrative but it is a repetition of the data that it is already stated in the text. It seems that qPCR for B. pilosicoli was not performed at the arrival of the sample, in contrast to qPCR for B. hyodysenteriae and L. intracellularis . So, when was the qPCR for B. pilosicoli performed? Specific comments: It was very difficult to list the modification required in the text as it does not have the lines numbered. Abstract: Results: “…simultaneously with L. intracellularis. B. hyodysenteriae and B. pilosicoli were …” Suggestion of Key-words: pathogenic spirochetes, Lawsonia intracellularis, swine, intestinal pathogens, enterocolitis, diarrhea. Results: The 4 th and 5 th sentences of the second paragraph are confusing. Rewrite. The 3 rd paragraph is too long and confusing. Rewrite.
