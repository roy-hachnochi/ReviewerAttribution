I read with great interest this article, that sought to investigate the presence of Bhyo and Bpilo in polish herds. As the authors observed, this is a somewhat challenging goal: both bacterium can survive in the healthy host, thus it's hard to evaluate the meaning of their presence. Methods - Fecal samples - Please include a numeric description of each group. You mention the total number of fecal samples, but not how many came from X many herds, and how many are part of each "submission group". Results - How many samples were tested out of the 18 that were found positive for Bpilo? Please include the actual numbers in all your descriptions. Figure 1 - Please include actual n to the data shown. Also italicize scientific names. Lawsonia comparison - Please include actual numbers in all the descriptions (n=?). A statistical test to show that samples positive for LI are more likely to be positive with Bpilo would be interesting here, besides the simple description. Discussion - Was is thought that Poland was free of Bpilo? The first sentence is odd. Please acknowledge that this data set is inherently biased (at least partially, except for the ones that are routine surveillance but we don't know how many samples were part of the group...). Please include a conclusion statement, and clearly lay out your main findings.
