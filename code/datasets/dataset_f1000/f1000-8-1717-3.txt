This report presents a case of a young woman with adenocarcinoma presented in the bladder. With endoscopic procedures, secondary involvement of the bladder was excluded. Based on imaging findings the presence of urachal carcinoma was supposed, therefore partial cystectomy with extended lymphaedenctomy and the removal of the umbilical remnant and the umbilicus was performed. The pathological examination of the tumor found primer bladder adenocarcinoma. The case report is well written, the train of thought is traceable, but there are some diagnostic tools which could suggest the presence of urachal cancer before open surgical treatment. Therefore I have some minor point to discuss: Serum tumor markers as CEA, CA-19-9, CA125 and CA-724 can be elevated in urachal cancer. 1 , 2 What was the level of these serum tumor markers before and after partial cystectomy? However, there is no reliable immunohistochemical marker which can distinguish between urachal and primary bladder adenocarcinoma, some of them can suspect the origin of the examined adenocarcinoma. Were immunohistochemical examinations performed of the TURB tumor sample (e.g. AMACR, CK34bE12, GATA3)? This should be mentioned in the manuscript. Histological examination of partial cystectomy resulted primary bladder adenocarcinoma. What was the TNM-stage of this? In the case of primary bladder adenocarcinoma, radical cystectomy is suggested. In this case, urachal cancer was supposed before surgical treatment, therefore partial cystectomy was performed, however the final diagnosis was primary adenocarcinoma. In the future, is radical cystectomy proposed and if so, when?
