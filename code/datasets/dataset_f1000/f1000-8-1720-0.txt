The authors submit a case report on a rather young man with cardiac arrest likely due to coronary dissection, which was successfully treated with ECPR. In general the report is well written but left me with some major concerns. General Is this really a case of traumatic dissection, or a car accident due to spontaneous dissection? Please discuss the rationale of ECMO vs. ECPELLA, in a patient with acute myocardial injury. Was there some underlying condition, as CMV and candida infection are unusual causes of death in previously healthy people. The manuscript might benefit from language revision. Introduction There seems to be a word missing (‘life-threatening …’). ECMO during resuscitation is the same as ECPR, but in this sentence (‘and’) it looks like it is two different measures. Results Please provide more details regarding LV function over time. Figures Legends of Figures are mixed up. From Figure 2 I am not really sure whether LAD was recanalized, maybe the authors want to submit another angulation after PCI. Maybe the authors can submit an ECG from the ED.
