Tanaka and colleagues report a case of a 44-year-old man with traumatic coronary artery dissection in the distal left main coronary artery after a traffic accident, which was successfully managed with drug-eluting stent implantation. The background, case presentation, and discussion are well-rounded. Several comments to be considered: Case presentation, Page 2: Imaging from intravascular ultrasound may be supplemented to confirm the absence of underlying atherosclerosis or other coronary artery diseases. Discussion, Page 2: “In a previous report including 76 cases of traumatic acute myocardial infarction, which included 12 cases with coronary artery dissection, LAD was most frequently affected (LMA, 6.4%; LAD, 71.4%; RCA, 19%; LCX 3.2%).” Regarding the distribution of coronary arteries affected by traumatic dissection, it is advisable to reference the more recent and comprehensive literature review by Lobay and colleagues (J Emerg Med. 2012 Oct;43(4):e239-43 1 ). Treatment options for traumatic coronary artery dissection include coronary artery bypass grafting, percutaneous coronary intervention with stent placement, and conservative management. The decision rationale for this case may be further discussed. The caption for Figure 1 and Figure 2 appears to be in reverse. Case presentation, Page 2: “…normal right coronary artery was normal.” The sentence should read: “…right coronary artery was normal.” Typographical errors to be corrected: amiodarone (page 2); micafungin (page 2).
