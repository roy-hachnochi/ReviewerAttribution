Plants are constantly exposed to different abiotic stresses. They have developed a wide variety of adaptation mechanisms through molecular, physiological, and biochemical alterations to cope with different stress conditions. Heat stress is still considered as one of the major limiting factors for crop yields. Simultaneously, heat stress significantly contributes to climate change. This review well describes the wide potential of various functional genomics strategies from gene selection and identification of heat tolerance genes to genetic manipulation by genetic engineering and genome editing. However, I have a few comments that need to be addressed: The authors should have discussed the functional role of heat shock protein (HSPs) and molecular chaperones under extreme temperatures. I believe a potential discussion about the possible role of HSP/chaperones towards heat stress adaptation to plants will strengthen this review. I do not find a specific reason for selecting tolerant genes from a few selected crops/plants (Table I). I encourage to refer a number of heat-tolerant gene lists from other major crops.
