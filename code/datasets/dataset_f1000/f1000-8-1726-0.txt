The authors isolated fungi and bacteria from the immunocompromised patient, and reported failure of correct antifungal therapy against this patient due to mixed fungal infection. Since there are few case reports of mixed fungal infections, such a report could provide information concerning to fungal therapy. I however believe the report would be more informative when the authors reveal the sensitivity of isolated fungi against used antifungals (fluconazole, amphotericinB, and Caspofungin) and compare them with their type culture strains.
