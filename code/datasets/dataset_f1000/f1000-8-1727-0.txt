I have read through the replies by the authors, and I think they have provided sufficient efforts to address my previous concerns. The statistically null effect of the mutation on PPI is clear but it still does not constitute direct support for a lack of effect (given the intrinsic nature of hypothesis testing). Nonetheless, the outcome does represent a contrast to some existing reports and would be instrumental in illustrate the fragility of the published finding. To this end, the paper does represents a contribution.
