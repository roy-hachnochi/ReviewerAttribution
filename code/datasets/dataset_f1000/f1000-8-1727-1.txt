While the interpretation that neuron-specific deletion of (NS)-Pten did not substantially alter the acoustic reflex startle (ASR) and PPI of ASR largely agrees with the impression of the data presented, the reporting of the data is not sufficiently stringent. Some responses to the previous comments are inadequate. Please rephrase the sentence: “When assessing the sensorimotor gating paradigm, there were no main effects of genotype for habituation (F[1,27] = 0.17, p 0.05), prepulse inhibition (F[1,23] = 2.65, p 0.05) or startle threshold (F[1,16] = 2.33, p 0.05).” This sentence is awkward because of the word “for”, I think. It simply intends to indicate that the main effect of genotype is not significant in the ANOVAs of the data obtained on the habituation test on day 1, the prepulse inhibition test on day 2, and the startle reactivity profile on day 3. My comment before focuses on the fact that the main effect of genotype cannot inform on the habituation of startle response. Legends of Figure 1: Description of (a) and (c) have been mixed up. Either correct the legends or the placement/labels of the two plots. The reasons behind the drop of animals from Day 1 to Day 3 should be provided in the text, although it is available from the links to the raw data files. Mouse 2355 was reportedly dead on Day 2 but provided body weight on Day 3 (see data file - pten ppi weights.xlsx in the underlying data). It appears that the total number of animals included in the weights analysis across days was 17. It was specified that Day 3 test comprised 9 + 9 = 18 mice. One mouse’s data was missing. I suspect the missing mouse was the one reported dead on Day 2 but not dead on Day 3. The data distribution of the data set for “threshold analysis” was highly skewed. It may be appropriate to log transform the data set, which incidentally strengthen the impression that the two genotypes were closed matched in their reactivity profile (as a function of stimulus intensity). The response to the critique concerning the lack of any attempt to index (indeed, or to define) “threshold” is inadequate. The group by intensity interaction in the ANOVA evaluate the extent to which the two reactivity curves (as function of stimulus intensity) are parallel. The main effect of genotype evaluated the average “height” of the reactivity curve between groups. While it may be true that the genotype and genotype by stimulus intensity did not reach statistical significance. Neither of them directly addresses “threshold”. One may admit that if the two lines are indeed identical and thus no difference in threshold would be possible (no matter how one may define it), then neither the main effect of genotype nor the interaction would achieve statistical significance. The reverse argument does not necessarily stand. The authors may consult this article by Hince et al. 1 for curve fitting methods to obtain proxies for a startle threshold value (e.g., stimulus intensity that yield 50% of the maximum reaction generated by the most intense stimulus) for individual animals. My previous comment was not clear because I had examined the data set in question trial-by-trial, rather than just block-by-block in the reported ANOVA of data on Day 1. Below is the plot that clearly shows that the startle reaction obtained in trial 1 was notably weaker than the rest. This anomaly warrants an explanation. First, this is highly unusual. Typically we expect the highest response in the first few trials. Second, Day 1 was designed to examine habituation, yet it produced a strong sensitization effect from trial 1 to trial 2. Some checking on the SR-LAB programme or derivation of raw data may be warranted, even though it is not likely that a systemic error in, and if limited to, a single trial could substantially change the statistical outcomes. Plot The final concluding sentence warrants revision. it reads “…our study is in support of the literature and helps to further elucidate the relationship between hyperactivation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway and deficits in sensory reactivity”. However, the present null results, if anything, are not supportive of a functional link between hyperactivation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway (as a result of the genetic knockout) and any deficits in sensory reactivity as exemplified by the acoustic startle reflex and its modulation in the form of PPI.

We appreciate your input and believe the paper has been improved as a result of your input. Thank you. 1. Thank you for your comment, the sentence has been modified to state: “When assessing the sensorimotor gating paradigm, the main effect of genotype was not significant in the ANOVAs of the data obtained on the habituation test on day 1 ( F [1,27] = 0.17, p 0.05), the prepulse inhibition test on day 2 ( F [1,23] = 2.65, p 0.05) or the startle response test on day 3 ( F [1,16] = 2.10, p 0.05)” to clarify our results. 2. The figure legend has been changed to reflect that the habitation data is depicted in figure 1a and the startle response data is depicted in figure 1c. 3. Thank you for your suggestion the following sentence has been added to the subjects section of the methods. “A subset of n = 4 KO mice were excluded from the day 2 analysis and n = 11 mice (3 WT and 8 KO) were excluded from the day 3 analysis due to either a protocol malfunction or the death of the KO animal caused by the occurrence of spontaneous seizures.” 4. Per your insight, mouse 2355’s weight for day 2 has been added to the excel weight spreadsheet, as the animal survived throughout testing. 5. The excel page has been updated to include the missing weight data to reflect the sample size used in analysis. 6. The data was transformed using a log transformation per your insight, and analysis for the startle analysis were rerun. No differences were detected, the results and methods section have been updated to reflect this transformation. 7. Thank you for clarifying your previous comment. You raise a terrific point; we should not have referred to graph as startle threshold as it depicts the average startle response at each decibel level which does not in and of itself constitute a threshold. Therefore, the graph title has been changed to: “Average Startle Response.” All other references to this data as startle threshold have been replaced with “Startle Response”. Importantly, the analysis we ran for startle amplitude is in line with other papers in the field such as Frankland et al., (2004), Brody Geyer (2004) etc. which was done to maximize our paper’s points of comparison.

Please see preceding response. 9. To ensure clarity, is the graph in question Day 1 Habituation (Figure 1a) or is it the Day 3 Startle Response (Figure 1c)? The Day 1 Habituation graph does not appear to conform to the pattern you are describing, as the first trial (1-10) exhibits the highest startle amplitude of approximately 1500 for WT and KO mice whereas the next trial (11-20) are below 1500, making the first trial the one with the highest startle amplitude for Day 1 Habituation. Moreover, the pattern of habituation for the remainder of the trial conforms to an expected trend (Schmid et al., 2011). Furthermore, all SR-LAB protocols and data were rechecked, re-exported, and re-analyzed and the exact same figure was generated. Therefore, since the protocol is functioning as expected and the rest of the data points display the anticipated pattern, and the pattern we observed has been previously reported, it indicates that there was no systemic error present. Meanwhile, the Day 3 Startle Response has a slightly higher no stimulus startle amplitude than the 75 dB stimulus, which may be what you are referring to. Importantly, Frankland et al., (2004) also reported a higher startle amplitude for the no stimulus trial and a lower startle amplitude for the second trial, similar to our findings, reinforcing our observations. Additionally, it is significant to note that the difference between trials 1 and 2 is slight and that the rest of the trials conformed to the expected curve (Gould et al., 2004). Once again, all SR-LAB protocols and data were rechecked, re-exported, and re-analyzed and the exact same figure was generated. Therefore, since the protocol is functioning as expected and the rest of the data points display the anticipated pattern, and the pattern we observed has been previously reported, it again indicates that there was no systemic error present. Additionally, when the 75 dB stimulus intensity trial is removed from analysis no significant effects were again found, therefore, the lack of significance reported for Day 3 Startle response was not dependent upon that one trial. Ultimately, we elected to keep the 75 dB trial in the results section of the paper and in the figure in order to be transparent with our data and to judicially report all findings, as the observed data points in question were not due to protocol malfunction or other confounds and did not bias statistical analysis.
