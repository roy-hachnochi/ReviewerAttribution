The review summarizes the utilization of clinical decision support (CDS) systems in three selected states in critical care â€“ shock/hemodynamic (in-)stability; respiratory distress/failure; and infection/sepsis. The background of the study has a strong rationale. The study comprised the results from primary sources, describing models/algorithms used to detect and alert clinicians to the presence of these conditions, as well as models/algorithms developed to predict deterioration in an individual patient state, leading to these selected conditions. The systematic review was performed and the findings are presented in line with the PRISMA guidelines. Variables for which data were sought were clearly stated (PICOS) in Table 1. Specific comments: What I found especially beneficial for the readers and future research in this area, is Table 2 with the presented collected data used for training algorithms. It would be beneficial to provide additional information whether an internal or external validation was performed - within Table 4 (measured outcomes in studies on shock), Table 8 (measured outcomes in studies on respiratory distress/failure) and Table 11 (measured outcomes in studies on infection/sepsis). What was the rationale for including the studies predicting acute kidney injury within the Infection/sepsis results section? If it is about the decline in glomerular filtration rate due to hypotension seen in sepsis, it might have been presented within the Shock section. Table 7: include the abbreviations for ARDS (Acute respiratory distress syndrome), ARDE (Acute respiratory disease events) and DVT (deep vein thrombosis) below the Table. Table 9: include the abbreviation for AKI (Acute kidney injury) below the Table.
