Thank you for your efforts in preparing the manuscript. The paper is elegantly written on an important topic it should be indexed. However, there are some remarks the authors should consider to improve the manuscript: Please make sure to present the case using the CARE (CAse REport) as guidelines. "case report" should be added in keywords. Patient information should be added such as possible primary concerns and symptoms of the patients or from the parents. As well as medical, family and psycho social history. Were patient asked to share their perspective on the treatment received? Please address in the text.
