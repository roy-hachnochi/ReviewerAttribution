This study describes an attempt to clarify which epitope an antibody raised to a candidate peptide EPL001, G530, binds to. A rather crude methodology of using IHC with preabsorption of G530 with tripeptides was applied. One would normally expect a couple of techniques to be used to confirm the sequence, such as using a more sophisticated and definitive analytical method such as using MS, whereas in this study they have relied on the presence or absence of immunolabelling on tissue sections, which is rather more subjective. The findings would have been more convincing if backed up using a more sophisticated analytical technique. As it stands I think the study would need to provide further experimental evidence to be worthy of indexing, such as including experiments where functional studies looking at SgII binding/blocking are carried out with G530 along with a known SgII antibody.
