This is a generally well written case report detailing a rare disease process in an unusual anatomical location. It covers pathogenesis, presentation, problems with diagnosis, treatment and prognosis. It has multiple grammatical errors which need review and correcting: 'Recreational drugs in utero.' The diagnosis is often delayed and easily misdiagnosed as AN aural polyp 'A four-year-old boy presented with a four-month history of recurrent left ear blood and pus discharge' - please revise to A four-year-old boy presented with a four-month history of recurrent haemo-purulent discharge from the left ear. In addition I have the following comments/suggestions: Intra- operatively, a large lesion extending from the middle ear through the tympanic membrane and into the external auditory canal was noted which was resected. The lesion was found to be highly vascular. Was it totally resected? Via a tympanotomy? Or was the tissue lateral to the TM resected. If a tympanotomy was performed what was the status of the ossicles? You say that the facial nerve palsy incompletely resolved. Please give details using House-Brackmann or other suitable classification. How do you arrive at '3% of paediatric rhabdomyosarcoma occurring in the head and neck involving the …………..'? There are only 11 cases reported. You would need 100/3 = 30 cases or more to be able to state this? Could intra operation images and high res CT image be included? Please state the disease free followup to date of your patient. Please comment on hearing outcome. There is no mention specific mention of MDT discussion? You state a second opinion was sought but surely this case went through an MDT?
