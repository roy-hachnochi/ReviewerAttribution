            <meta name="dc.description" content=" Background: Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a major cause of congenital infections. It is more widespread in developing countries and communities with low socioeconomic status. The infection can cause pregnancy loss or spontaneous abortion. Tests are available for the detection of HCMV IgG and IgM antibodies. Many pregnant women in Blue Nile State, Sudan, have suffered from recurrent pregnancy loss, and currently there is no available data concerning the prevalence of HCMV in Blue Nile state. This study aimed to determine HCMV antibodies (IgG and IgM) among pregnant women, who had undergone abortion(s), attending El-Damazin Hospital for Obstetrics and Gynecology. &amp;nbsp; 
 Methods: This was a descriptive, cross-sectional hospital-based study. 270 pregnant women, who had undergone abortion(s) and who attended El-Damazin Hospital for Obstetrics and Gynecology, were included in the study from September to December 2018. Personal and clinical data were collected directly from each participant into a predesigned questionnaire. Serum samples were separated and stored at -20&#730;C until used. Samples were analyzed for HCMV IgG and IgM using enzyme-linked immune-sorbent assay (ELISA). 
 Results: Participants were categorized into three age groups: 15-25 years (33.7%; 91/270); 26-40 years (62.2%; 168/270); and &amp;gt;41 years (4.1%; 11/270). The majority of the participants had IgG antibodies to HCMV (74.8%; 202/270), while only 13.3% (36/270) had IgM antibodies to HCMV. Most abortion cases were documented in the first trimester (85.6%; 231/270) and this had a significant relationship with IgG level (P=0.003). Low socioeconomic status was recorded in 84.8% (229/270) of participants and showed significant correlation with IgG level (P=0.025), whereas illiteracy was reported in 41.9% (113/270) of participants and did not have a significant relationship. &amp;nbsp; 
 Conclusions: Seroprevalence of HCMV in this study population was 74.8% for IgG antibodies. There was an association between HCMV IgG level and first trimester abortion and low socioeconomic status among the studied women.">

  "description": "Background: Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a major cause of congenital infections. It is more widespread in developing countries and communities with low socioeconomic status. The infection can cause pregnancy loss or spontaneous abortion. Tests are available for the detection of HCMV IgG and IgM antibodies. Many pregnant women in Blue Nile State, Sudan, have suffered from recurrent pregnancy loss, and currently there is no available data concerning the prevalence of HCMV in Blue Nile state. This study aimed to determine HCMV antibodies (IgG and IgM) among pregnant women, who had undergone abortion(s), attending El-Damazin Hospital for Obstetrics and Gynecology.  
Methods: This was a descriptive, cross-sectional hospital-based study. 270 pregnant women, who had undergone abortion(s) and who attended El-Damazin Hospital for Obstetrics and Gynecology, were included in the study from September to December 2018. Personal and clinical data were collected directly from each participant into a predesigned questionnaire. Serum samples were separated and stored at -20&#730;C until used. Samples were analyzed for HCMV IgG and IgM using enzyme-linked immune-sorbent assay (ELISA).
Results: Participants were categorized into three age groups: 15-25 years (33.7%; 91/270); 26-40 years (62.2%; 168/270); and &amp;gt;41 years (4.1%; 11/270). The majority of the participants had IgG antibodies to HCMV (74.8%; 202/270), while only 13.3% (36/270) had IgM antibodies to HCMV. Most abortion cases were documented in the first trimester (85.6%; 231/270) and this had a significant relationship with IgG level (P=0.003). Low socioeconomic status was recorded in 84.8% (229/270) of participants and showed significant correlation with IgG level (P=0.025), whereas illiteracy was reported in 41.9% (113/270) of participants and did not have a significant relationship.  
Conclusions: Seroprevalence of HCMV in this study population was 74.8% for IgG antibodies. There was an association between HCMV IgG level and first trimester abortion and low socioeconomic status among the studied women."

It is more widespread in developing countries and communities with low socioeconomic status. The infection can cause pregnancy loss or spontaneous abortion. Tests are available for the detection of HCMV IgG and IgM antibodies. Many pregnant women in Blue Nile State, Sudan, have suffered from recurrent pregnancy loss, and currently there is no available data concerning the prevalence of HCMV in Blue Nile state. This study aimed to determine HCMV antibodies (IgG and IgM) among pregnant women, who had undergone abortion(s), attending El-Damazin Hospital for Obstetrics and Gynecology. &nbsp;<br/> <b>Methods:</b> This was a descriptive, cross-sectional hospital-based study. 270 pregnant women, who had undergone abortion(s) and who attended El-Damazin Hospital for Obstetrics and Gynecology, were included in the study from September to December 2018. Personal and clinical data were collected directly from each participant into a predesigned questionnaire. Serum samples were separated and stored at -20˚C until used. Samples were analyzed for HCMV IgG and IgM using enzyme-linked immune-sorbent assay (ELISA).<br/> <b>Results:</b> Participants were categorized into three age groups: 15-25 years (33.7%; 91/270); 26-40 years (62.2%; 168/270); and &gt;41 years (4.1%; 11/270). The majority of the participants had IgG antibodies to HCMV (74.8%; 202/270), while only 13.3% (36/270) had IgM antibodies to HCMV. Most abortion cases were documented in the first trimester (85.6%; 231/270) and this had a significant relationship with IgG level (P=0.003). Low socioeconomic status was recorded in 84.8% (229/270) of participants and showed significant correlation with IgG level (P=0.025), whereas illiteracy was reported in 41.9% (113/270) of participants and did not have a significant relationship. &nbsp;<br/> <b>Conclusions: </b>Seroprevalence of HCMV in this study population was 74.8% for IgG antibodies. There was an association between HCMV IgG level and first trimester abortion and low socioeconomic status among the studied women. </div> <div class=abstract-for-mobile> <div class="margin-top-30 padding-bottom-30 research-layout is-centered"> <button class="primary orange-text white-bg bigger-text abstract-expand-button-mobile with-border show" style="display: none;"> READ ALL <span class="f1r-icon icon-14_more_small orange vmiddle big"></span> </button> <button class="primary orange-text white-bg bigger-text abstract-expand-button-mobile with-border hide"> READ LESS <span class="f1r-icon icon-10_less_small orange vmiddle big"></span> </button> </div> </div> </div> <div class=clearfix></div> <div class="article-context no-divider"> <div class="article-abstract article-page-general-text-mobile research-layout generated-article-body"> <h2 class=main-title>Keywords</h2> <p class="u-mb--0 u-pb--2"> HCMV, Abortion, IgG, First trimester, Socioeconomic, El-Damazin, Sudan. </p> </div> </div> <div class=article-information> <span class="info-separation padding-bottom"> <div id=corresponding-author-icon class="email-icon float-left"> <span class="f1r-icon icon-6_email orange"></span> <div id=corresponding-author-window class="margin-top-20 popup-window-wrapper is-hidden"> <div class="popup-window corresponding-authors-popup"> <div class=corresponding-author-container> <div class="popup-window-title small">Corresponding Author(s)</div> <div class=authors> Elhadi A.

Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is the most common cause of congenital malformation resulting from viral intrauterine infection in developed countries<sup><a href="#ref-1">1</a></sup>. CMV infects a high percentage of individuals during their life and after recovery of disease it hides in leukocytes. Although this virus is not considered as hazardous to health, in pregnant women it is a major factor that threatens the health of neonates<sup><a href="#ref-2">2</a></sup>. Primary CMV infection occurs in 0.15%–2.00% of all pregnancies and may be transmitted to the fetus in 40% of cases<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a></sup>.</p><p class="" id=d3643e247>Seroprevalence of HCMV in adults ranges from 55% in developed countries to as high as over 90% in developing countries like China<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a></sup>. In Sudan, age is significantly associated with CMV IgM detection, and history of miscarriage was associated with CMV IgG positive women<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a></sup>. Additionally in Sudan, a study conducted in 2013 by Elamin and Omer at Khartoum Teaching Hospital reported the seroprevalence rate among pregnant women with recurrent abortion as 55.3% and 3.2% for HCMV IgG and IgM antibodies, respectively<sup><a href="#ref-6">6</a></sup>. Another recent study in Sudan conducted at Omdurman Maternity Hospital reported a sero-frequency rate of HCMV among pregnant women as 74.4% for CMV IgG and 14.4% for HCMV IgM<sup><a href="#ref-7">7</a></sup>.</p><p class="" id=d3643e266>HCMV can produce maternal infection and exhibits a high tropism for cervical mucosa and is considered as the most implicated virus in recurrent spontaneous abortion (RSA)<sup><a href="#ref-8">8</a></sup>. Many pregnant women in Blue Nile State, Sudan, have suffered from recurrent pregnancy loss, and currently there is no available data concerning the prevalence of HCMV in Blue Nile state; therefore, this study aimed to determine HCMV antibodies (IgG and IgM) among pregnant women, who had undergone abortion(s) in this state.</p></div><div id=article1-body class=generated-article-body><h2 class=main-title id=d3643e276>Methods</h2><div class=section><a name=d3643e279 class=n-a></a><h3 class=section-title>Study design</h3><p class="" id=d3643e284>This was a descriptive cross-sectional hospital-based study aimed to detect the seroprevalence of CMV among pregnant women, who had undergone RSA, attending El-Damazin Hospital for Obstetrics and Gynecology in Blue Nile State, Sudan, between March 2017 and February 2019.</p><p class="" id=d3643e287>Permission to carry out the study was obtained from the College of Graduate Studies, Faculty of Medical Laboratory Sciences, University of Gezira and Ministry of Health, Blue Nile State, Sudan.
