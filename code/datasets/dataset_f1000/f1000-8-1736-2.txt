This paper describes the creation of a national registry for non metastatic rectal cancer. The main issue is a high quality standardization of rectal cancer multimodal treatment, staging and follow up. I think that the core of the project is well explained and clarified. Additional materials are clear and quite user friendly. The methods are well described and expanded enough. The need for well designed databases on rectal cancer is clearly expressed by the literature. I believe that this registry represents a high quality attempt in the direction of a centralized and appropriate treatment for rectal cancer.
