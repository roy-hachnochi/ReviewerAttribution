In the topic number 1 and referring specifically to what was written in paragraph number one of the Introduction, I consider that not only the abdominal waist is the only predictor of abdominal obesity, there are other indicators as important as that, such as the Waist Index- size (taking into account that the Peruvian population prevails people with short stature), the waist waist index, the conicity index, which are usually more accurate than mere measurement than the abdominal circumference. I recommend that this investigation be continued in a larger sample , that it is even necessary to evaluate risk factors such as physical activity and diet, which are major confounders. Otherwise I catalogue the article as excellent.
