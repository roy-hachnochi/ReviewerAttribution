The paper is interesting and well written. I have few suggestions: Methods, statistical analysis: please add some detail on interaction terms introduced in the log-binomial regression models; also in Results some interpretation about estimates obtained for the altitude x gender and altitude x age group would be useful for the reader. Page 6, second paragraph: it is stated that abdominal obesity and obesity prevalence were higher across rural areas than in urban areas; possibly the contrary should be reported. Table 5: my advice is to report in three separate columns estimates for unadjusted PR, adjusted PR without interaction terms, and adjusted PR with interaction terms (full model). It is not clear if PR reported in the Abstract are obtained from the full model; my advice is to report in the Abstract PR obtained by the adjusted model without interaction terms. In Discussion it is reported that differences in socio-economic status might be captured by the urban/rural variable. Are there also differences in ethnic background by altitude? Page 9, findings are summarized of a previous study reporting a higher percentage of overweight and other cardiovascular risk factors in people living above 3000 m vs. those living below 1000 m. However, these results seem to be in contrast with the present study; please explain.
