This is an interesting study in the field of periodontology as the authors have tried to find the correlation between the common risk factors of periodontitis and the different stages of the diseases among Egyptian patients according to the new classification published in 2018. However, the authors have excluded patients with aggressive periodontitis without justification for their exclusion and this group of patients represents most of patients in stages 3 4. The results of the study were low in stage III VI (4.4% 2.05 % respectively) and this may be attributed to excluding aggressive periodontitis from the study design. The aggressive periodontitis should be included in the study design because this type with sever chronic periodontitis represent stage III VI. In addition, the study design did not include diabetes mellitus and smoking among the studied risk factors. One of the strength points of the study is that the national common food and drinks as beans and tea were included among the risk factors. This study has not been conducted before in Egyptian patients according to stages and the finding of different risk factors among the Egyptian patients can reduce the prevalence of these diseases in the future.
