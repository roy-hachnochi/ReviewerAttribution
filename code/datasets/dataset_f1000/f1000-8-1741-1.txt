The authors responded comprehensively to the comments and made corresponding changes in the manuscript. As the authors agree, however, that E-statements are essentially B-statements and that this is intrinsic in all phenomenological surveys that ask participants to reflect on their experiences, it remains unclear why it is stated in manuscript that the aim of the study was to to differentiate beliefs from experiences rather than to focus on the validity and reliability of the scale.
