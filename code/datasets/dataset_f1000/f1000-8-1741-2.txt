I want to thank the authors for the changes they made to the paper and their thoughtful comments regarding the lack of an EFA on the first sample. The suggestion of an EFA was simply a methodological consideration further strengthen the paper; I am aware that an EFA is not always considered to be the best way of confirming a model when theory strongly suggests a particular factor structure. However, it can introduce unexpected results that can contribute to the current theory. I also apologise for my unfortunate use of the term ‘this would probably not give the desired outcome’. I also take the point ‘If a CFA fits well and satisfies all assumptions but an EFA indicates that the underlying structure of the data can be represented by different factors, is this sufficient evidence to discard the original CFA’ is not sufficient evidence to discard the CFA. I am happy to accept the paper based on the current changes, but I still feel that the way the experience items are worded and presented is a weakness with this paper and that an EFA could provide some interesting results in terms of theory behind how the relationship belief and experience is conceptualised. However, this paper does provide a much-needed way of measuring both belief and experience.
