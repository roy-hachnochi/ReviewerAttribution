An interesting work looking at non-communicable disease risks link to microbiome in saliva as an indicator. The discussion could be written better to pull the results together. What is missing is a comparative study with another sedentary population. I would like if the conclusion is added with recommendations to improve the issue facing the Temiar tribe. Noted that sample size is small to make small but still warrants some finding to improve their health status.
