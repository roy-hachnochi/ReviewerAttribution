Ryan et al. present a manuscript for the interactive clustered heat map builder tool that has been widely used in cancer research consortia. The tool is of excellent quality overall, is very useful, and is intuitive in its design and execution. The manuscript is well-written, with some caveats below. Major feedback: The authors are not doing justice to the tool, which offers much more than user-friendly heatmap generation. To put the functionality in perspective, they should contrast it with the Cluster/TreeView suite, which also offers a user-friendly interface to filtering and data transformation. Minor feedback The Operation subsection assumes knowledge of Docker and Tomcat. The authors should cite appropriate background reference material for readers who aren't familiar with these technologies. For the use case, the authors summarized how they transformed the data, but did not indicate how those transformations were done with their tool. This needs to be clarified, because it's not obvious. The sample data in the OSF Storage site is stored as a single tarball. This is awkward, as the entire tarball has to be downloaded and expanded in order to access any single file.
