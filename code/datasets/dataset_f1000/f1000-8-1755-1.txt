The work by Shunji Suzuki analyzes the association between method of delivery and maternal mental status after one month. He found that elective C-sections are associated with higher levels of mental distress, and argued that this result might have to do with the absence of birth-plans and birth-reviews for women undergoing elective CS. Here are my comments: I would not talk about “influence”, which implies causality. Please consider using “association” or “relationship” instead. Are you sure that your sample size is 645? According to the data presented in Table 1 and uploaded to Figshare, the women enrolled in the study are 643. No justification is provided for the cut-offs presented at the end of the Data Collection section. For instance, you used an EPDS cut-off of 9, but more commonly adopted thresholds are 10 (minor depression) and 13 (major depression) (Fellmeth G, et al. J Affect Disord 2019;251:8-14). Please provide adequate references or update your cut-offs. Table 1 and the data set you shared do not match. After analyzing the data uploaded to Figshare, I found very different results (see below). Please check consistency and review the entire Results section, if necessary. Please also consider adding a column for the entire sample, as I did here. Statistical significance should also be described differently in the table footnotes. Table 1. One-month clinical evaluation for women who delivered a singleton baby between September 2018 and June 2019, overall and by method of delivery. --- Variable \ All ( n = 643) \ Vaginal delivery ( n = 387) \ Elective CS ( n = 80) \ Urgent CS ( n = 176) | EPDS score | Mean SD \ 3.7 3.4 \ 3.2 2.7 \ 5.5 4.9*# \ 4.0 3.8* | ≥9, n (%) \ 66 (10.3) \ 23 (5.9) \ 22 (27.5)*# \ 21 (11.9)* | MIBS score | Mean SD \ 1.3 2.1 \ 1.1 2.1 \ 1.9 2.4*# \ 1.3 2.1 | ≥3, n (%) \ 86 (13.4) \ 33 (8.5) \ 22 (27.5)*# \ 31 (17.6)* | Interview time (minutes) | Mean SD \ 12.8 7.3 \ 12.9 7.8 \ 14.1 8.3 \ 11.8 5.3 | ≥25, n (%) \ 52 (8.1) \ 32 (8.3) \ 12 (15.0)# \ 8 (4.5) | --- CS , cesarean section; EPDS , Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale; MIBS , Mother-Infant Bonding Scale. * p 0.05 (elective CS vs. vaginal delivery). # p 0.05 (elective CS vs. vaginal delivery + urgent CS). What about maternal age? Was it similar across the three groups under study? If so, the association between method of delivery and outcomes should be adjusted for age. What about the external validity (generalizability) of the study? The Katsushika Maternity Hospital does not have any “birth-path” for women undergoing elective C-section—is this a common or uncommon situation?
