Thank you for the opportunity to evaluate this report. The paper is about the effect of delivery mode on the postpartum mental status of women. The results of the study indicate that the women who underwent elective cesarean delivery had higher scores of the EPDS and MIBS than women with vaginal delivery and emergent cesarean delivery. I have the following comment: In discussion section, the author state that – "We understand the small sample size for statistical analyses as one of serious limitations in this study. However, a fulfilling birth-plan and birth-review may also be necessary for women choosing elective cesarean section." I don’t think that the current study based on its methodology can support that statement .The conclusion paragraph including main outcomes of the study should be rewritten.
