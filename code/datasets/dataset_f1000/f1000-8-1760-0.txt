I am satisfied with the revisions of the study protocol. One remaining minor comment is that the authors write on page 8: "When the difference between the index and median meta-analytic OR is minimal, we will conclude that any potential selective inclusion had a limited impact on the meta-analytic effect." What is considered here as a "minimal difference"? I recommend the authors to define what they see as a minimal difference.
