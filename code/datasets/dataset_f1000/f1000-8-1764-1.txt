The present study investigated the effect of different types of tooth pastes on the enamel surface properties. The introduction section was informative, brief and well written. The authors highlighted the numerical evaluation of color as well as the different methods and materials for tooth whitening using tooth pastes at home. The white light inteferometer used to measure surface roughness is an accurate method which ensured reliable results. The same applies to the brushing apparatus used although it was not clear the type of tooth brush used nor the frequency of changing the tooth brush. Different formulations of the investigated tooth pastes were not fully written. The results were clear and the SEM micrographs were explained thoroughly. However, more statistical analysis could have been added to compare between more experimental groups, not only with the control. The discussion was written well and explained the outcomes of the research. Overall the present research was written and executed well with clear results.
