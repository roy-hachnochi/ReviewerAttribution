 Generally: There are still a lot of grammatical and spelling mistakes throughout the paper. Therefore, the authors should remove all of the grammatical and typographical errors as well as spelling mistakes. Use past tense and rephrase the sentences. Introduction: Inconsistency in writing in the first paragraph, the first line: it is written as “genus” but in the second row it is written as “species”. Kelabau are ancient fish belonging to the genus Osteochilus of family Cyprinidaes. The species are distributed throughout Thailand, Borneo and Sumatra (etc.). According to local fishers in Riau, kelabau are divided into two types on the basis of morphology. Although there is no detailed information about these fish types, please, the authors should explain what the differences in the characteristics are of the two species which the fishermen know. Sentences from: “The demand for it as…” until “…the population of these as well as many other fish.” I suggest deleting it, because it has no correlation with the theme of this manuscript which explains the verification of the species of fish kelabau using cytochrome c oxidase - it is not about increasing demand and the problem of decreasing populations of kelabau fish. Methods: Cite references in the following paragraph: “The study population was collected and sampled…” until “…of the Faculty of Fisheries and Marine, Riau University, Indonesia.” Results: Ok. Discussion: The Discussion is not up to the mark, especially in paragraphs one and two; please rewrite back with an explanation of how the characteristics of the two species of fish differ according to fishermen and the reason that these differences were caused by environmental changes and overfishing.
