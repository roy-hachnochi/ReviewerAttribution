The manuscript by Antara and colleagues reports on the use of noncontact ECCT treatment to down-regulated expression of CCL2 and IL18 and therefore inhibit breast cancer cell proliferation. Comments: The authors claim that the fluid bathing in breast tumors from ECCT-exposed IT treated rats may affect the tumors size, however, no specific analysis was done to support such claim. For instance, a single cell suspension of whole tumor followed by cell count could suffice. This data is crucial In order to support the claim that ECCT treatment is anti-proliferative, as tumor volume measurements show otherwise. The authors should also elaborate on: The impact of reduction in CCL2 and phenotype skewing in tumor macrophages. The discrepancy between CCL2 levels and CD68 infiltration. The discrepancy between past publications showing activation of the MAPK/NF-kB signaling pathway following AC-EF based tumor therapy (suggested as an example that has been used by the authors to support some of the conclusions in the current study) and the downregulation of IL18 in the current study.
