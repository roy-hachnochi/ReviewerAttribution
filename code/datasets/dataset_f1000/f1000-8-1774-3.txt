This article presents an R package, RCy3, designed to control and automate the network visualization software application Cytoscape. The article describes both a low-level ("generic") and a high-level ("specific") API and presents use-cases with some code samples. Overall this appears to be an API with great potential utility for the bioinformatics community, and the article presents the package clearly and with several useful and informative examples. I have a couple of minor comments and suggestions, which I hope will serve to improve the article. The abstract mentions the potential for RCy3 to deliver reproducible workflows. In my opinion, reproducibility is among the most important benefits of code/script-based workflows over workflows performed using "point and click" GUI-based applications. However, the article does not elaborate on this outside of the abstract. A couple of sentences in the discussion describing the potential for RCy3 to enhance reproducibility would be worthwhile. The article mentions that the Cytoscape App store currently lists over 40 "RCy3-supported apps". A quick note on what is needed for a third party app to be "RCy3-supported" might be pertinent here. This may be already sufficiently covered in existing publications (e.g. reference 6), in which case a simple note to that effect would suffice. The code block for the section "Building maps of enrichment analysis results" is not quite as clear as the other code blocks in the article. A comment indicating that commandsAPI() opens a web browser page (externally; at least in my environment) and comments after the print() statements showing the expected output, as in the other blocks of code, would be helpful. The uses of file.path and paste(... sep='/') are a little confusing here (to be honest, I was surprised to find these actually worked on Windows systems); brief comments added to the code might aid readability here.
