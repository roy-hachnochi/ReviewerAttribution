Alonso et al propose a nice idea for solving the gene to position problem posed in the DREAM single cell transcriptomics challenge, but at the end fall short while finding ways to improve their pipeline. The explanations of why they used such approach are also scarce. Although maybe obvious, it would be important that they explain why they chose genes with maximum entropy. why 100 outgroup genes, how the values of w1 and w2 were selected and why doing a 2 step optimization. Overall the rationale of their approach should be summarized in a couple of sentences in order to make it clearer, unfortunately the diagram does not clarify the rationale either. Also, given that this criteria did not improve significantly while iterating, they should have tried other selection criteria such as high expression level, or maybe other metrics such as the ones proposed in the challenge. Maybe trying to optimize the position and the gene expression correlation as interlocked steps is the source of the problem. Some discussion regarding this should be added.
