In their manuscript entitled “Prediction of cell position using single-cell transcriptomic data: an iterative procedure ” Alonso et al. apply a method to predict the cell position combining single-cell transcriptomic data with a reference atlas. The study is submitted as part of the SCTC DREAM Challenge, which aims to evaluate different algorithms for this prediction task using 20, 40 or 60 genes as reference. The authors test their approach on SCTC challenge data-sets. They have three improvements on a method previously published (ref 7 1 ): gene selection, a new scoring function, and an iterative procedure for improve the predictions. The paper is generally well-written, with a concise description of the problem and challenge. However it has room for improvement, especially in the manner information is presented. My criticisms are related to the clarification of details I thought to be missing from Methods and Results sections. Major comments: I suggest to authors to add a sentence that help to reader to understand the aim of the paper in the Introduction. The fluxogram of Fig.3 seems has not a initial point. Why? I suggest to authors divide the procedure in layers. Also authors must give a description in the legend of this figure. Panel A of Fig. 4 has not legend, please add one. Minor comments: The description of acronyms MCC is duplicated. The author must introduce it in the first time that it is mentioned. Please, add adequate references for Mathews correlation coefficient (in Methods) and for Jaccard distance (in Discussion).
