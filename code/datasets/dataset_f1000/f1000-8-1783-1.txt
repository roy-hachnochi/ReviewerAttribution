A fairly well written report with useful, if not novel information. This case is also interesting because the PSA was quite high at over 40 ng/ml. It is imperative to carefully evaluate these cases for prostatic adenocarcinoma. This not only includes the "hypernephroid" pattern (a term that is no longer used) of Gleason grade 4 carcinoma that may mimic xanthomatous inflammation but also typical coexisting adenocarcinoma that may be hard to identify due to large amounts of inflammation and parenchymal distortion. The discussion can also include the fact that multinucleated giant cells are often seen in this condition. Please perform the corrections recommended below: The images should say axial and coronal in Figure 1. Also, please check if the blue arrow in Figure 1b is in the right place. The word polymorph can be deleted from Figure 2. The pathology image quality should be improved. In the discussion, the author name Cheng is spelt wrong and is not referenced. It is unclear what the authors refer to as Gleason 4B. This is not used in current practice. Clear cell carcinoma should be changed to clear cell renal carcinoma.
