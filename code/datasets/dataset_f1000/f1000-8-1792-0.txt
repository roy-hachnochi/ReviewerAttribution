The manuscript expands on previously published data regarding the management of malaria before, during, and after the Ebola outbreak in Sierra Leone. While the conclusions seem more sound than in the first article published by the same group, this manuscript cannot be interpreted without the first article and is, therefore, more of an addendum than an original article. This should be made clearer in the introduction, including a more elaborate description of why this additional analysis was necessary. While the first article describes a deterioration of malaria reporting in the post-Ebola period, this new analysis claims a higher utilization of health services for malaria is responsible for the higher number of fever cases. However, they could have mentioned some details about the 'other' fever cases, which were higher in the post-Ebola period. Overall the article is a useful addition to the previous article and in combination, the two articles give valuable advice for improvement of the management of febrile illness in under-fives in this area of Sierra Leone. Whether they are generalizable to a wider region is not known to me.
