 The authors used recent references to synthesize the research gap and the generation of new knowledge. However, scientifically strong justification is essential to clarify why the existing records needed a comparative analysis (pre, intra and post Ebola periods). Please include why this research is necessary. The study design used is appropriate in addressing the research question. Sufficient details of the methods used were noted except the list of variables used for analyses. The authors can improve the methods section by adding the type of variables extracted from the morbidity register so as to allow replication by others. For the analysis, in Table 1, the percentages of total cases diagnosed as malaria either by RDT or microscopy out of all fever cases are to be included and interpreted carefully. “Diagnosed malaria among fever cases ranged between 66% and 75%” is not enough. In fact, in post Ebola period, diagnosed malaria among fever cases was lower than pre and intra Ebola outbreak period (66%). This indicates less need for diagnostics despite increased utilization of health services for children with fever. In Table 2, during Ebola period, cases treated for malaria dropped to 47% which should be included in the discussion part. Conclusion part is weak and needs to rewrite and add what needs to be done further.
