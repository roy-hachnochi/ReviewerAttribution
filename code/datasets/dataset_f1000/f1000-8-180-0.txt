This study aimed to identify the characteristics of MOOCs related to biomedical informatics and it was an interesting read. However, there are some serious issues in the presentation of this work. I find some of the sentences difficult to parse. For example, Introduction - second sentence, Introduction - second paragraph, first sentence. Overall, I think a professional proof reading would improve the article's readability considerably. This study has searched for MOOCs using many well-known MOOC platforms. It would have improved the search had the search included MOOC aggregation service for searching. In the Results section it is claimed that "67 MOOCs offered on biomedical informatics in the world" - I think this needs to account for the methodology and scale back to what the search was - selected platforms. It is a little confusing to hear about the "average cost of courses" given that the searches were on MOOCs and whether these were fees to access the course materials or for certification. The authors need to acknowledge that major non-English MOOC platforms such as Edraak and XuetangX were not consulted in this search when making statements about course languages. "However, the platforms studied are those that have the most health or medicine courses 5 " - can this statement be substantiated? "This is the first study that has assessed MOOCs in the area of BI" - can this be substantiated? I find the conclusion "The majority of MOOCs on Biomedical informatics were focused in bioinformatics and data science, they were offered in English by institutions in the developing world" not supported by the evidence and misleading.
