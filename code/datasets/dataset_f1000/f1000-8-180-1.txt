The authors have developed a manuscript examining the use of biomedical informatics in current MOOC implementations. This contribution could be very useful for those looking to examine MOOC implementations in this subject domain. There are a few areas I believe the authors could further develop to improve the work: 1. While the manuscript introduces the subject matter, there is not background for why the course of investigation is merited. There is most likely a clear rationale for this investigation, the authors could improve the manuscript to provide it. 2. Methodologically the authors have not provided details on data extraction methods nor how their keywords were classified and harmonised among the various MOOC platforms. Additionally, to be medical literature, it would have been useful to use a systematic search method applied with this context as this would be more familiar to readers. 3. The authors examine cost, number of implementations and further classifications. In their own right, these are big areas and the authors would do well to consider analysis and comparison of factors of economic impact, learning design, etc - the current discussion and analysis is only approaching these areas at a superficial interpretive level. I recommend the authors address the rationale, strengthen the methodological approach and pick particular areas of analysis to strengthen the richness of this manuscript.
