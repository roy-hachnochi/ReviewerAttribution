I am happy with the detailed responses of my earlier review. The issue with the availability of SPARQL results from one of the SPARQL endpoints remains. Still, the authors acknowledge that and provide solutions (i.e. contact details of support to the individual data providers. "Given that copying, the data fragments to our Github repository might lead to several issues due to licensing problems, as well as to data size, we have made available a preview of the results directly in the Jupyter notebook." This is an interesting point, basically applicable licenses prevent proper reuse or reproducibility of research data, which should concern us. All in all, I am pleased with the responses and additions and think it is an excellent paper that is a good example of how semantic web technologies can be applied in the life sciences.
