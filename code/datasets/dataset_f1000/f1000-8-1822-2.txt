It can be useful to leverage orthologous gene knowledge in genome data analysis like gene function annotations, and the inference. The authors attempted to introduce how to retrieve the orthologous genes for several RDF databases such as OMA, MBGD, OrthoDB, and EnsemblRDF, using concrete SPARQL query examples. In particular, I highly evaluate that the authors explain through appropriate examples of the methods to retrieve the information of the complicated orthologous structures. It is expected to facilitate the understanding of the knowledge, and it would make contributions to increase the usage for genome data analysis. Moreover, the authors provided the Python codes' information to extract orthologous genes from the RDF databases and incorporate them into existing analysis pipelines. That is also worth appreciating. It is essential to further appeal the merits to bioinformaticians and experimental researchers in order to disseminate the orthologous RDF data. I realized that as stated in the section: Aggregations in SPARQL: Combining data from multiple resources (page 11), I can aggregate the data more efficiently using the SPARQL than traditional procedure (file-based data exchange or full database dumps.) On the other hand, the authors did not sufficiently mention the advantage of the RDF and SPARQL compared with the traditional procedure. I hope that the authors would more strongly emphasize the advantage.
