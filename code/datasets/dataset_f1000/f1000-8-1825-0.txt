The authors tried to address a noble issue with research findings. The paper is well written but has some shortcomings which are listed below: The variety "Jasmine" which was used in the study was unsuitable for 'ratoon'. It will impact the result greatly. If a farmer wants to adopt ratoon system, he will select a suitable variety which is the first step of a successful production system. In MM sections, authors have not described the nine special management practices in addition to conventional management. The seed rate under normal condition was 173 seeds per pot which I think give an overpopulated plant density. What is the purpose of this high seed rate? For late harvesting treatment, sowing date was advanced by one week, which may actually promote the growth as well as yield. There is some repetition in the results. The first and second paragraphs of results are almost the same. There is a lack of data in 'Result' section and results are mostly qualitative than quantitative. Results must include the main outcomes of the research in a quantitative term. The yield is the main purpose of ratoon crop and the data related to yield is missing (except the regression graphs). A table comparing the yield under different conditions can well serve the purpose. The citation pattern has a problem. The results section has the most citations while discussion section has no citations. The results section describes the main outcomes of the research while discussion section discusses the possible reasons for outcomes with supporting literature. Authors should look into the citations.
