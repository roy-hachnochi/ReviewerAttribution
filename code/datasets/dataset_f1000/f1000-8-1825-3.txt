The abstract well conveys the research objectives, methods, key research results, discussion and conclusions. However, it needs to be shorter and more precise. The study found very significant results for rice producers in three-crop rice-producing areas or in lowland areas that are vulnerable to natural disasters. However, the results will be more convincing if the collected data is analyzed more deeply, concerning the causes of fluctuating results. For instance, under poor conditions the effect of cutting twice was positive but negative under standard condition, why? What might be the causes? It needs further analyses of the results. In addition, to be more practical and to validate research findings, experiments should be carried out one more time in the net house or in the real conditions.
