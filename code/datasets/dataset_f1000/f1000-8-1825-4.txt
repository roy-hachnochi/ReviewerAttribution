 The work is not yet clearly and accurately presented, nor does it cite the current literature. The literature review is limited, especially about salibu (definition, advantages, yield). The problems are not clear yet. What is the importance of this research (please use Pertanika et al., 2018 1 as reference for example, because the article states the advantages.) Because the methods (the treatments) are not clear and analysis does not use tools, the methods are not provided to allow replication by others. Because the statistical analysis does not explain the tools used, it will be difficult to interpret easily Results: did not need to state references. Results: please just write down the results of the study, without mentioning the references. Fig 1-3, Tab 1: please use statistical analysis to explain the results. Discussion: explain the reasons for the results, use the references to discuss and compare research results. Please, use references for discussion.
