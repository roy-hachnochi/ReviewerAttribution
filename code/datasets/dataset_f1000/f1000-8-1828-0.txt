The study evaluated the Phylogenetic groups and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of uropathogenic Escherichia coli clinical isolates from patients at Mulago National. The topic is very interesting, However, the manuscript needs to be reviewed and there are also some important questions that require consideration. Specific Comments: Abstract: It was not clear the results about ESBL, AmpC, and carbapenem detection. Also, it should be emphasized that 41.3% of the isolates belonged to the unknown Phylogenetic group. Introduction: It is clear. However, I would suggest include more recent references. Methods: Why CLSI (2014) was used? There is probably a more recent edition of CLSI. It was not included how the identification/ classification of MDR was done. Also, it is necessary to include the Demographics data analyses (gender, age..). Results: In case, 41.3% of the isolates that belonged to the unknown Phylogenetic group it is an impressive result. Is there E. coli control for each Phylogenetic group? It deserves more attention and discussion. It seemed to be a high number considering the fact to be new strains or the un-typable by PCR
