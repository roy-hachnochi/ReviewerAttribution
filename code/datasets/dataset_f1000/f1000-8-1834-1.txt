The authors have developed a UNIX-based program to study the phylogeny of large groups of proteins focusing on LPMOs. The program is novel, performs faster and contains features that no other program currently contains. The manuscript is written well, everything is clearly, accurately and sufficiently explained. The methods used, prior art and references are addressed appropriately. Specific comments and questions: LPMOs are a very interesting group of enzymes that have emerged as essential in degradation of biomass. The authors mention this briefly in their Introduction section (first paragraph). How do the authors envisage the utility and impact of their program for people who work with LPMOs in the wet-lab (enzyme discovery and screening, for example)? This should be reflected upon in the Conclusions section. The authors mention development of the program for UNIX-based platforms such as Linux and MacOS. Have they considered, or plan to implement an online solution? Without an online solution - the usefulness of the program will be severely limited. In addition, informing readers about how and when such a tool will be implemented, with a provisional online link (even if the implementation is not entirely completed) - will certainly increase the impact of the article. I understand that most Linux code can be run on virtual machines, but from my experience - this is not necessarily accessible to people that are not bioinformaticians. Therefore, in order to make this tool useful for the scientific community - a user-friendly online solution would be highly recommended. Could the authors comment, as well as include in the manuscript, their plans regarding such implementation?
