I thank you for trusting me with the review of this article which presents a well-designed and executed study. I do approve of indexing the article after some answers and minor corrections to be provided by the authors. Ethical approval: I appreciate that in this study obtaining a written consent from the staff of the pharmacies would have greatly and negatively impacted the results and any “appropriate outcome” obtained would have been a biased one. Pre-piloting the scenario with other than the researchers may have improved the approach. The SPs made their request to the pharmacy staff who first approached them. Were the SPs certain whether “the pharmacy staff who first approached them” a pharmacist or pharmacy technician? In table 3, about 72% were not pharmacist and not able to determine. Moreover, the authors stated in the results that “In most of the test purchases, the advising pharmacy staff were females, between 30 and 49 years of age and did not have a pharmacy degree (non-pharmacist)”. Since those they should practice under the supervision of a pharmacist, the authors need to elaborate on this in relation to their discussion where they state” Non-pharmacists (pharmaceutical technical assistants and pharmacy technicians) have a significantly higher likelihood of achieving the appropriate outcome than pharmacists”. Point 2 must be also discussed in relation to their conclusion where they state” Furthermore, more questioning and involvement by non-pharmacists was identified as relevant factors influencing the appropriate outcome. There is a further need for research to identify why the advice provided is so often poor and particularly why the quality of advice provided by pharmacists is so inadequate”. In table 5, under Queue and Number of questions asked the percentages do not total to 100%. Therefore, the authors need to check their original data, or declare “Missing data” in the table to total the percentage to 100%.
