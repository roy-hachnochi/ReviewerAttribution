Thank you for allowing me to review this article. It is an interesting study using an interesting approach i.e. SP. I have a few comments: The conclusion in the abstract section must be consistent with the objective of the study and main findings. Percentages reported in tables must equal to 100% - kindly check all figures. Tables cited in the main text should in proper order. Even though due to the nature of the study, subjects selected were not asked for consent, did the authors contact them after the study informing that a study was conducted with reasons? This is one way that the researchers could resolve the issue of informed consent prior to the study. Create a paragraph on Study recommendations at the end of the Discussion section. Consider to move some parts of the conclusion. Rewrite the conclusion section.
