Methods: How did the author control confounding factors? Postpartum depression is reported to have associations with multiple factors, as the author stated in “Introduction”. The author performed univariate analysis (i.e., χ 2 test and Student’s t-test), not multivariate analysis. If so, results should be interpreted carefully, or some statement as a study limitation is recommended. Results: It is noteworthy and interesting that we could observe a trend of higher score of EPDS and more women with EPDS score of 9 among exclusive breastfeeding group of women, though the results were non-significant. How did the author interpret those results? Discussion: The first sentence “Although the rate of exclusive breastfeeding may be low in our institute…” does not make sense for readers. The author should contextualize its meaning within the Japanese culture.
