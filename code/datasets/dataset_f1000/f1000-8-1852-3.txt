I would like to applaud the authors' efforts in thoroughly reviewing their article. Again, this study raised a good insight into the importance of considering reporting academic degrees of authors as part of their affiliation in medical journals. I also agree that future studies are needed to assess the impact of reporting academic degrees of authors on the reader's behavior toward the article quality as well as on authors' satisfaction regarding the content of their affiliations.
