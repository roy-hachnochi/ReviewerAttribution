This article addresses an interesting and intriguing question in publishing - why author's academic degrees are published in journals. Editorial guidelines mention this, but do not provide actual guidance. This research showed that journals from North America and from clinical disciplines are more likely to publish the degrees, which is an interesting finding, at least in high-impact journals. The manuscript is written clearly, as a brief report, and follows a logical order, with appropriate statistical analysis. I have two major issues: There is no literature overview on this problem (or a statement that there is no evidence on this issue in literature). The description of the selection of articles in the set of 100 journals is vague. It is not clear what was the method for sampling "approximately ten articles ..." in the two study years. This needs to be clarified.
