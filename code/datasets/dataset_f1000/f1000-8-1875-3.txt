The authors have focused on an important biomedical problem â€“ How to identify the virus responsible for an infection through serological diagnostic tests when many of the potential pathogens display a high level of sequence similarity? While the approach presented represents an excellent start to achieve their goals, a number of issues need to be addressed. They have correctly focused on short poly-amino acid sequences but need to go further and define the epitome of each virus. As an epitope defines the exact sequence of amino acids bound to the cleft of an immunoglobulin, it is the most precise restriction possible for differentiating similar pathogens. This would allow an in silico evaluation of the potential for cross-reactivity that could be confirmed by immunoassays. Furthermore, a peptide of 15 amino acids could limit reactivity with IgM, which is an important component to defining seroconversion. Another important point is that the panel of patient sera was fairly small. It is also unclear if each patient sample was screened for each of the pathogens in questions or only the suspected infection. It is very common for patients from endemic regions to suffer multiple infections without registering them. A small panel size also makes it difficult to perform Receiver Operating Characteristics analyses, which are absent from the study. In addition, a limited combination of peptides was tested rather than a checkerboard. This is all the more important as peptides often show the lowest sensitivity. Methodologically, another important point to be clarified is regarding the cut off value used in peptide immunoassays or the value used by the software to delimit the signal intensity of a positive test from a negative one.
