This article presents a tool to gather and make preliminary analyses on a set of curated sequencing datasets related to primary immunodeficiencies. Regarding replication, I could not reproduce the list of datasets with the criteria that are mentioned in the text. I would have to believe that the authors are indeed reporting their results, and that the manual curation of the dataset list was accurate. The tool that is presented has a number of issues: The list of datasets is rather small, and the authors do not mention whether they plan on adding datasets to the list, The tutorials on how to use the tools are only available to registered users, and I could not find how to register Graphical issues are present when displaying the charts, both in-tool and in png images.
