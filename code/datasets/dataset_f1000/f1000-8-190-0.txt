This is a neat paper describing tail vein injection to attempt to generate an in vivo model of lung cancer in mice. It would be helpful if the authors explain why they chose to use male SCID mice, and not female mice. They should also mention that PCR analysis of the lungs could be one way to look for potential metastases (by amplification of sequences that are human-specific). I think it would be helpful to include a side by side comparison (maybe a table?) of the tail vein results and the models mentioned in the intro, or results from other experiments that have established models using the cell lines mentioned in this study. They mention non-small cell lung cancer is the most prevalent subtype of lung cancer, but don’t discuss how the tail vein injection method could potentially model this specific type of lung cancer. The paper mentions intrathoracic implantation. Have the authors tried this method or are they merely stating it is an alternative option? Are the results comparable to the tail vein injection? They don’t state was size needle they use to inject in the tail vein. The authors could mention that a more laborious attempt (not without drawbacks) would be spontaneous metastasis assays, by first injection a primary tumor – followed by surgical resection – and then allowing several weeks for the development of spontaneous metastases.
