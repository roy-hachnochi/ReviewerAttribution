The authors present a manuscript detailing a novel mass spectrometric method of identifying putative autoantibodies in CSF. Overall, the manuscript is clear and well written. It is however a very preliminary report for the identification of potential autoantibodies, and the authors have addressed this in their limitations. One potentially significant confounding element is the age difference between controls and patients. The AD and PD groups are significantly older, which has the potential to produce false positive autoantibodies, as it is well known that older healthy individuals have a higher rate of autoantibodies in the blood, and presumably in the CSF. The increased rate of autoantibodies may account for the unique autoantibodies found in the PD and AD groups. Use of a control group of a similar age would be preferred. I have a few specific comments/questions: The authors included a positive control antibody, human kallikrein 6, at a concentration of 100 ng. The concentration used may be supraphysiological and hence create an inappropriate positive control. Have the authors titrated the control antibody concentration to determine the lower limit of detection? In regards to the putative autoantibodies identified in AD patients, have any of the antibodies been confirmed using an alternate technique? ELISA or immunohistochemistry? Without corroboration with an alternate methodology, these may all be false positive results.
