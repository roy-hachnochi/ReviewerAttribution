This study surveyed the knowledge and practice of exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) and its relation to various social-economic, demographic factors among mothers with at least one child aged 6-12 months in rural area of Rajshahi district, Bangladesh. Poor knowledge and practice of EBF was reported. Conclusions from this study play an important role in optimizing EBF practices. However, I have some suggestions and major concerns that must be addressed. Title: I suggest you change breastfeeding to exclusive breastfeeding. Because your manuscript fully focused on EBF not breastfeeding. Abstract: In this section, I agree with suggestions from Felix Emeka Anyiam. I think the reviewer had already worked carefully. Introduction: In this section, the statement “To the best of our knowledge, in Bangladesh this type of study has not been conducted” is not exactly correct. Because I had found similar studies conducted in Bangladesh when I searched on Pudmed. Such as two articles, “Exclusive breastfeeding practice during first six months of an infant’s life in Bangladesh: a country based cross-sectional study” (https://doi.org/10.1186/s12887-018-1076-0) 1 . It is the Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey (BDHS-2014) which collected data from 17,863 Bangladeshi married women in reproductive age from the entire country. “Knowledge and practices of exclusive breastfeeding among mothers in rural areas of Rajshahi district in Bangladesh: A community clinic based study” (https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0232027) 2 . It is published on May 2020. The present study was similar with it, including the same study design, sample size and analysis. Is it the same one? I suggest the author reported more findings from previous studies and addressed your novelty in this manuscript. Methods: In this section, I agree with suggestions from Felix Emeka Anyiam. Additionally, there was a minor error. “ten questions about the knowledge of breastfeeding were provided”. But nine questions were mentioned above. Please check it. Results: “a major portion of respondent’s (59.8 %) had a monthly family income 6,999 BDT”. Is it ≤6,999 BDT? Because monthly income was categorized two groups (≤6,999 Bangladeshi Taka (BDT) and ≥7,000 BDT ). Please check it. Also, monthly income was not the same in the four tables (table 1 ≤6,999 7,000, table 2 6,999 ≥7,000 table 3 and table 4 ≤6,699 ≥7,000, which one is correct? I thought 6,699 was just a typing error. Is it?). The statement “There was a good level of knowledge and practice of EBF Among the mothers that participated in this study”, but I thought it is not good enough (32% vs.27.9%). And you mentioned in the discussion “poor knowledge and practice of EBF was seen”. Is it opposite to results? Please check it. For table 3 and table 4, I have different explanations. For table 3, my interpretations were mothers aged ≥31years, gave birth at home and had ≥7,000 BDT monthly family income were less likely to have good knowledge of EBF compared to their counterparts (p0.05). Mothers that were literate, service holder and had single families were more likely to have good knowledge of EBF compared to their counterparts (p0.05). For table 4, my interpretations were mothers aged ≥31 years, gave birth at home, had single families and had ≥7,000 BDT monthly family income were less likely to have good practices of EBF compared to their counterparts (p0.05). Mothers that were literate, service holder were more likely to have good practices of EBF compared to their counterparts (p0.05). Because in my opinion, If OR1, 95% CI did not include 1 and p0.05, the dependent variable was a risky factor. The risk for the dependent variable (which was label as 1) had more times of risks than the dependent variable (which was label as 0). If OR1, 95% CI did not include 1 and p0.05, the dependent variable was a protective factor. Please see more information of logistic regression interpretation. Discussion: In this section, I agree with suggestions from Felix Emeka Anyiam. Moreover, I had different explanations for logistic regressions. This discussion may be rewritten if you agreed with me.
