In this study, the authors clearly show that targeting transgenes to the "safe harbour" AAVS1 results in highly variable transgene expression in iPSCs, which is exacerbated even further following differentiation. This has important implications for researchers contemplating this locus for generating iPSC lines to stably express a transgene of interest (e.g fluorescent reporter, Cas9, transcription factor etc) The study appears well executed and their conclusions are well supported by their findings. One minor comment but certainly not a deal breaker, it would have been nice to see clones analysed by flow cytometry. This would not only give a very accurate picture of the number of cells expressing the given reporter but also a more accurate picture of the level of transgene expression (i.e median peak fluorescence) not only between clones but within clones. Also, might be helpful if the authors indicate how they separate endogenous HOXA9 expression from exogenous (transgene) expression. All in all, a great little study with very useful data/implications for those in the field!
