In this review, the authors summarized recent studies of dental pulp regeneration using stem cells. In general, it is a timely and detailed review of stem cells used in dental regeneration. But this manuscript needs to be carefully modified. Comments: In the abstract and Table 2, the authors described “TDM (treated dentin matrix)” as a growth factor. In fact, TDM is a matrix containing growth factors. “Growth factors derived from TDM” is more suitable. The language of this manuscript should be checked and polished by a native English speaker. According to the methods, the authors searched the databases from January 2000 to June 2019: Since numbers of studies of dental pulp regeneration have published after June 2019, it is recommended for the authors to update their data to June 2020.
