This is an interesting work with many novel concepts relevant to HSV-1 primary envelopment. A few minor points for clarification in the discussion are listed below: The authors discuss about lipid biosynthesis controlled by Us3 that results in INM production. Is this an event restricted to the nuclear membrane? Can the authors discuss whether there is also increased anterograde vesicular trafficking and whether other organelles including the Golgi network display a similar surface increase? The authors stated that fully enveloped virions are present in the PNS. In case of Î”Us3 virus these virions are fully infectious. Can the authors discuss whether the envelope virions acquire from the INM has difference versus the envelope from the TGN? According to Figure 14 there are enveloped virions that move from Golgi to the plasma membrane without losing the primary envelope. Do the authors know whether there are differences between these virions and the virions that acquire envelope from TGN or vesicular structures? Is it nucleus disassembly and not rupture? Can the authors underscore that point? Do the authors think that ESCRT-III recruitment to the nuclear membrane might have some membrane repair function? Minor points to fix in the text: Abstract Under the results "decrement in pore numbers" somewhere the authors need to state nuclear pores. Page 7, Figure 5C may be 5D in some occasions. Figures could have a legend to guide people about results they observe since some time is difficult to conclude from the figure.
