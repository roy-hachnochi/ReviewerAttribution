All the comments made to the previous version have been addressed. Please, consider correcting a few minor typos: Data Acquisition and Statistics: Typo: “steromicroscope” should be “stereomicroscope”. “focus on the desire region” should be “focus on the desired desired region”. “Data is” should be “data are”. Section 3. Primary neurosphere culture: Repetition in the “NOTE”: “will need”, “will be needed”.
