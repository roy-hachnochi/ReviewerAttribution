This manuscript describes a protocol that can be used to generate primary neurospheres from the tissue surrounding the lateral ventricle in mice in the late embryonic period. The method is a relatively simple technique that will provide investigators with viable neurospheres that can be used in further studies. The protocol described here is important, and will likely be useful for many researchers who utilize neural stem cells. However, I have some constructive criticism and points that may require clarification, see below: How long does it usually take to generate neurospheres? Is the fact that this protocol takes 7 days the rationale for developing it? Is there a benefit to generating different sizes of neurospheres? Why only use anti-GFAP (in essence, my question is why only visualize glia)? Under the “Data acquisition and statistics subsection”: The field of view represent s a length of... Bonferroni's multiple comparis o n post hoc test… A total of 5 individual animal s were analyzed… The significance of the protocol is somewhat understated. I would add language to the Discussion to highlight the novelty of this approach. I would also include more suggestions for potential ways that others can use the protocol.
