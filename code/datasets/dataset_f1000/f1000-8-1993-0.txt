This paper presents a laboratory method used for detection of Mycoplasma genitalium in swab samples collected from sex workers. The authors provide descriptions of the method used and the results obtained. I consider that, in order to be indexed, the paper needs some revisions and explanations. Abstract The paragraph on treatment and antibiotic resistance is not necessary because they are not the subject of this article. Introduction The phrase "Most of the detection studies have been conducted in the U.S.A, Europe and Australia, with various strains being discovered" requires citations from literature to exemplify what is stated. The phrase “In this study, it is shown that direct PCR can be applied to the detection of M. genitalium from crude DNA extracts.” should not be placed in this section. It must be moved to the Discussions section. Methods In Sample preparation and Direct PCR sections, the authors declare that they used the manufacturer’s protocol “with slight modifications”. What are these changes and for what purpose were they made? A positive control ( M. genitalium positive sample) was used. Where does it come from? Why two PCR amplifications were made? The authors should explain why they have amplified PCR products. Results I think two Figures are enough: a representative gel for direct PCR and a representative gel for the amplification of the PCR products. There are mistakes in the legends of the Figures regarding the positive positions: e.g. in Figure 1 “The ladder is at positions 1 and 26” and “Clear Mycoplasma genitalium positive bands can be seen at positions 1 , 2, 9, 10 and 17”. How do you explain that in Figure 4 the band corresponding to sample S163 is at a different level than the others? Discussion There is too little discussion about the technique used.
