I suggest changing the title to: "Treating co-existence of hidradenitis suppurativa and psoriasis" Introduction: Please change "We present two cases of comorbidity of psoriasis and HS” to ”We present two cases of co-existence of psoriasis and HS”. For case report 1: Please provide a severity assessment for psoriasis. The authors only refer to “extensive”. It would be important to report PASI or another measure of severity assessment. For case report 2: Please provide a severity assessment for psoriasis as for case 1. Also it reported negative impact on quality of life. Please provide a measure if available. For example VAS pain 6 or DLQI 10.
