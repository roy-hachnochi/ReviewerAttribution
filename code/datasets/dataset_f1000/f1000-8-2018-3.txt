Thanks for inviting me to review this protocol. The author proposes a pilot study to evaluate the IHC learning resources in 3 primary schools in Barcelona. the protocol is well -designed and -written. Few comments below: Introduction I would cite a few references to support each of the 5 arguments for starting the IHC project in primary school. Methods I would justify the sampling methods eligibility criteria of the schools and describe if these 3 schools are representatives to the average school in Barcelona (e.g. a number of students). I would consider TIDier Checklist to better describe intervention details. I would describe the time points for each of the outcome measures. Data analysis – ‘qualitative’ variables should be replaced by ‘categorical’ and ‘quantitative’ variables by ‘continuous’ – Both quantitative measures. Authors should describe whether the resources have been translated and validated into Spanish.
