The authors report successful use of fondaparinux in managing heparin intolerance during pregnancy in a 37 y old pregnant lady at her 11 w of gestation. Hypersensitivity reactions to heparin in pregnancy is not a new issue and is reported in ~ 20% of patients. The successful use of fondaparinux is not new either. So I am not sure if this is still worth reporting. Also, I am not sure I would agree with authors that the experience fondaparinux use in pregnancy is still limited. The most interesting part of this case in my view is to identify the pathology underlying this poor obstetric history (repeatedly complicated pregnancies, labours and multiple IUFDs). The thrombophilia screen is all normal. The authors included APS work up, however these antibodies were only measured once; against the standard diagnostic guidelines. The possibility of APS still exists in this case and requires further investigation. I encourage the authors to shift focus towards diagnosis of the pathology for this poor obstetric history; perform further investigations and rewrite the case report. This will provide some novelty and help educate the scientific community in similar cases.
