This research analyzes the impact of the number of years played in the NFL and position on life expectancy. The question is excellent. The model concisely addresses the question, and the data are comprehensive. This is an important research study that could be replicated for other professional sports. An additional study could break the regressions down by individual position, instead of three categories, to see if there is a further distinction. But that is not necessary for this paper.
