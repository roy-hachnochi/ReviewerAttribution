Thanks for asking me to review this article. The authors of the study have generated very good data to communicate the key message on mitigation of methane emission in rice by different irrigation methods. My recommendation would be in and around "Minor revision". My minor comments to the authors are: In the Introduction text, the previously reported value for reduction in methane emissions due to alternate wetting and drying is 44.0%. But, in abstract it is being mentioned as 47.5%. Right value may be mentioned here. In methods section, treatments can be mentioned in a tabular form for better understanding of readers instead of writing in running text. For figure 2, Authors could have presented the real set-up of closed diffusion chambers used to collect methane emission in the present study instead of diagrammatic representation. Rewrite this sentence "This response was further confirmed an increased in methanotroph population of ..." in results section (page no 7).
