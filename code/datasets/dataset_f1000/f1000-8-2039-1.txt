Hasna and coworkers aimed to demonstrate the success of an endodontic treatment protocol for dens invaginatus committed by pulpal necrosis and apical periodontitis. The authors showed a 6-year control by using cone beam computer tomography confirming the treatment success. First described by Ploquet in 1794 in a whale's tooth 1 , this malformation was once referred to as a "tooth within a tooth". Interestingly, due to the nature of the malformation, the root canal anatomy becomes unique and unpredictable. Therefore, the clinical report here presented using conventional endodontic treatment might still be considered as the gold standard protocol to control the pulpal cavity and invagination lumen contamination. Overall, the manuscript is very well written. A suggestion for improving the content, the authors could include data regarding the bilateral occurrence of this anomaly at upper lateral incisors (43% 2 ) in the Introduction’s first paragraph. The structure named by the authors as “secondary canal” could be instead be named as the “invagination lumen” since structurally they are distinctly developed. The invagination lumen is not filled by pulpal tissue such as the tooth canal. Also at the sentence “Both canals presented necrotic pulp”, I would suggest to replace the term “pulp” for “necrotic tissue” as the invagination lumen is not expected to be found with pulpal tissue either vital or necrotic. Finally, when discussing the effects of calcium hydroxide, mentioning “detoxifies residual lipopolysaccharide”, please consider to cite also the study of Safavi Nichols (1993) 3 who unequivocally demonstrated the LPS lipid A hydrolysis by calcium hydroxide.
