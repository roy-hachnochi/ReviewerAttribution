The importance of this article lies in the active site of Hsp90 which is involved in the process of cellular oncogenesis; Geldanamycin is currently being used, however due to the hepatotoxic damage showed in clinical trials by Geldanamycin, it is necessary to look for Geldanamycin analogs. This article finds or gives solutions to this question by giving as a result through docking, 3DQSAR and quantum similarity of these analogs, so it is an interesting and outstanding result on clinical research, excellent work. I think this paper is excellent and is an important addition to the literature. The evaluation of interaction energies from the interaction with Lys58 residue is essential for the union of the analogues to the active site of Hsp90, and improves its biological activity. This union is formed through a substituent on C-11 of the geldanamycin macrocycle. A small and attractor group was found as the main steric and electrostatic characteristic that substituents on C11 need in order to interact with Lys 58; behavior was observed with hydroxy and methoxy series of geldanamycin analogues, under study.
