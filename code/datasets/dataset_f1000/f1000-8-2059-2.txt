This scoping review systematically sets out how the Authors will consider studies that will record clinical details or biomarkers of relevance in the initiation of immunosuppression withdrawal. It is an ambitious review and although the Authors have laid out their strategy quite clearly by searching the relevant registries, databases and publications they do not specify whether they will include studies in children as well as adults. Most of the references are adult studies, so presumably this is the focus. I think the Authors will need to differentiate between IS minimisation or complete IS withdrawal and be clear which definitions they will include in their review for analysis.. With regard to the review questions: The clinical parameters and biomarkers (Question 1) may be difficult to clearly identify whereas review questions 2 and 3 are more likely to be clearly defined in studies and databases. The relevance of this review and its potential benefit to patients is obvious, I am concerned that it will require an extensive amount of work without identifying a clear outcome of value to Clinicians or Patients.
