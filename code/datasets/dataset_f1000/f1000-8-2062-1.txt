In this work, the authors proposed a dataset for studying interaction of a set of 34 molecules with the Agrobacterium tumefaciens TraR binding site through Molecular Docking and 3D QSAR. The work is well written and readable. I have an unique concern about the ligand-based ComFA model results in table 3. The model 1 presents an R2 of 0.781 while Q2 is 0.697 revealing good robustness of this Model. However, Model 2 has an R2 of 0.856 and Q2 of 0.457. This result is evidence of the presence of data leveraging the model. Can the authors interpret this behaviour? An explanation of this result can be related to noisy variables in predictors overfitting the model. Is this a possible explanation of these results? I considered this work suitable for publication after making these minimum corrections.
