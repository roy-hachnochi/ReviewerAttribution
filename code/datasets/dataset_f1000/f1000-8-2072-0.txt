Pichon et al. conducted a study by comparing two mt genes across tunicates and recovered conserved tunicate-specific mt codon usage and potential Oikopleuridae-codon. The writing of the manuscript is clear and easy to follow. The methods are also valid and the findings should be interesting and important to the field. However, there are a few things I suggest to incorporate in the current draft. In the introduction, the authors mainly discussed the tunicate genetic codon, but we already know there are more codon changes in deuterostomes (e.g. Hemichordates contain two mt genetic codons). So it would be better to incorporate this part of the introduction to make sure readers understand there are many mt codon changes within deuterostomes. The authors also briefly discussed the possible change of tRNA structures responsible for codon change. Is it possible to extract tRNA sequences from available tunicate transcriptomic data and compare them to the existing ones? I am also fine with this if that is beyond the scope of this manuscript.
