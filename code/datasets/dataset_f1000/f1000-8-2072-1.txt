In this short article Pichon and colleagues use publicly available molecular datasets, mostly partial mitochondrial genomes, to re-explore the mitochondrial genetic code across tunicates, based on the analysis of the Cox1 and Cob genes. Their data suggest that the AGR codon was already translated into Glycine in the last common ancestor of tunicates and that additional changes may have occured in some Oikopleuridae at least. The work is important because it shows that all tunicates, including appendicularians should be associated in Genbank to the "ascidian" genetic code (Table 13). A limitation of the work, which the authors acknowledge, is that they could not identify the corresponding tRNAs in appendicularians. They therefore call for the sequencing of full-length mitochondrial genomes for appendicularians.
