The article describes a systematic review and meta-analysis of published studies on the Safenamide for the treatment of motor fluctuations in Parkinson's Disease. First, the topic is interesting because currently, there is an unmet clinical need to find potential agents that decrease the motor fluctuations and the LED in PD midstage and late-stage PD. Second, the methodology is clear and in accordance with the Cochrane handbook guidelines, while the manuscript is well-written in compliance with the standard reporting guidelines (PRISMA statement) - endorsed by the ICMJEs. The statistical analysis was properly done and the data analysis interpretation and discussion are sufficient. I do not find any major concerns in the article; I believe it worth the publication. No further changes are required from my point of view.
