The authors published a systematic review and meta-analysis of safety and efficacy of safinamide for motor fluctuations in patients with Parkinson's disease. The meta-analysis is the first one and has been conducted well. It demonstrates the efficacy and safety of safinamide in Parkinson's disease and its value in patients with dyskinesias. Safinamide can be used in early PD as a single drug or in combination with dopamine agonist. It can be an add on in mid-late PD for motor fluctuations. The methodology states that the studies which did not use safinamide as an add on therapy for motor fluctuations in PD would exclude some studies included. However, the studies included in the meta-analysis include patients with early PD as well as those with mid-late PD. Early PD patients do not have motor fluctuations, dyskinesias, are less likely to have depression, cognitive impairment and thus this subset may undervalue the actual effect of safinamide.
