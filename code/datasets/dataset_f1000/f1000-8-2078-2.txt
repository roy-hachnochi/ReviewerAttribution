The authors published a systematic review and meta-analysis of safety and efficacy of safinamide for motor fluctuations in patients with Parkinson's disease. There are other review on safinamide but the meta-analysis can be interested. However the paper must be revised addressing some important issues: Introduction: Non-motor symptoms should be better addressed and ref. implemented and revised. Within the other treatment, COMTI are not mentioned The meta-analysis is well conducted and gave a number of good information, but there are some problems: The studies were grouped according to the presence of the end-point. However for UPDRS III studies with different population were grouped together, moreover in some of these studies UPDR III was the primary end-point but for the other studies it was a secondary end-point. UPDRS scored in an early population give information about the effect of the drug on symptoms, in fluctuators it does not. Other parameter were influenced by the dose in the original study (PDQ39, UPDRS II) but putting all the patents together this effect does not emerge giving the false impression that the drug is always efficacious. These aspects should be carefully addressed and discussed.
