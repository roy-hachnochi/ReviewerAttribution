The article is a short report which aims to show the higher frequency of selected parasites in H. pylori -positive patients. I believe the manuscript is worth indexing, however, I suggest to apply two corrections: I think that it would be easier for readers to give p-values in tables as an independent column (this way it will be easy to read which results are statistically different from each other). I believe that the discussion should be extended to the immunological part, even though it was not the aim of this article. The results obtained by the Authors indicate a higher frequency of parasites in H. pylori -positive patients aged 1-15 and 46-60. These results indicate that an immature/weakened immune system may influence the parasite- H. pylori relationship in the host. Thus, I suggest that the Authors should discuss this topic and add relevant literature references.
