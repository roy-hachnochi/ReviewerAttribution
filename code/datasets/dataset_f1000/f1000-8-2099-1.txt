We were pleased to review the revised version of the Cheng et al. (2019) manuscript. The authors made several changes that strengthened and clarified the manuscript including a re-organization of the introduction with additional information on Kim et al. (2019) and a very recently published study by Shahab et al. (2020) and an explanation of the common liability theory. The methods section now includes more background information on SEM, which will be helpful to readers not familiar with this type of modeling. We were also pleased to see sensitivity analyses using PATH Wave 3 data as well as analyses including a broader set of covariates (age, sex, race/ethnicity, tobacco product availability in the household, novelty seeking, self-rated health, cigarette smoking harm perception, school performance). The authors provided detail about how missing information was handled. The results section now includes some basic demographic information, revisions to the tables, and additional results based on the new sensitivity analyses described in the methods. We have a few minor suggestions: On page 5, the first letter of the first complete paragraph needs to be capitalized. Table 2 provides results for models M1 to M6 using PATH waves 1 and 2 data. The written results describe models M1 and M2 followed by M5 and M6. Models M3 and M4 are described last. Why not change the order of the models in the table so they are described in sequence in the results? Please revisit the title of table 2. You present estimates for e-cigarette use and onset of ever cigarette smoking as well as estimates for the liability to use tobacco and the onset of ever cigarette smoking. The title only explains the e-cigarette piece.
