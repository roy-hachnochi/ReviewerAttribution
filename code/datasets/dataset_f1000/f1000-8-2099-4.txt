This manuscript focuses on the controversial question of whether e-cigarettes causally lead to later cigarette smoking among adolescents, or whether the use of both conventional cigarettes and e-cigarettes are due to a common liability. The paper uses structural equation modeling to model the pre-existing likelihood of e-cigarette use as a latent factor, finds that e-cigarettes do *not* have a causal effect on later conventional smoking over and above the latent factor. This paper uses an innovative method to address a complicated statistical question. The paper is well-written, and the implications are important. Major comments: The introduction has an excellent literature review that makes a convincing case for the common liability hypothesis, even using papers that at face value support the “gateway” hypothesis of e-cigarettes but identifying interesting counterpoints in the analyses of these papers. My main concern is about the choice to include only substance use variables in the latent factor representing liability to use tobacco products. Propensity to use tobacco products includes a variety of other factors as well (socioeconomic, personality characteristics, risk perception, peer group and family substance use, mental health, etc). Are these other variables available in the PATH study, and if so what was the rationale to restrict only to behavioral tobacco use measures? What would the results look like if other covariates were also included? I would recommend a re-organization of the Discussion, to discuss interpretation of findings, implications, and relation to existing literature first, followed by limitations and strengths. Minor comments: I think a brief description of “standardized threshold” (which appears first in Table 1) would be helpful. On p. 6, last paragraph, why are exact values not reported for the fit measures (“RMSEA 0.02, CFI and TLI 0.90”) as they are elsewhere? What does the acronym ACASI mean (p.7)?
