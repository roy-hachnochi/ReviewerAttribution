The restfulSE software package for bioconductor purports to extend a very useful data structure, the SummarizedExperiment to handle very large datasets wherein dynamic download of the full dataset is neither necessary nor practical. Therefore, Gopaulakrishnan et al. have created restfulSE to make this data structure interactive with remote databases on an as-needed basis. This is a very useful idea from the Bioconductor core team, and likely to be impactful as datasets grow larger, cheaper to produce, and it becomes increasingly necessary for bioinformaticians to leverage available data against local experiments. The tool is technically sound, built on Google BigQuery and HDF5, and the paper is well written and clear. The manuscript includes code examples making it simple to get a quick start and see how the software works.
