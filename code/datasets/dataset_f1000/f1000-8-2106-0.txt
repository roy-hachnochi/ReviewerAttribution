In this brief report by Vrba and Futscher, the authors sought to leverage their previous discovery of 10 cancer-associated DNA methylation biomarker loci to investigate the clinical potential of these biomarkers in assessing the progression of carcinogenesis. The authors analyzed several publicly available datasets that included normal tissue, precancerous lesions and tumor samples to generate in silico models of breast, colorectal, esophageal, pancreatic and lung cancer progression. The rigor of the study design is high as all datasets utilized the same technology (Illumina HumanMethylation450) with appropriate sample size of each group for analysis, except for the pancreatic samples. Although the data presented support the authorsâ€™ conclusions, at least by the eyeball test, the inclusion and description of detailed statistical analyses would increase confidence in the conclusions. The overall results indicate that aberrant methylation of the biomarker loci is an early epigenetic event of carcinogenesis, regardless of cancer type. This is an important finding that further supports the clinical potential of DNA methylation biomarkers in early cancer detection.
