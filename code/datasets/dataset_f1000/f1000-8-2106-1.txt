In this manuscript, Vrba and Futscher examined the DNA methylation status of candidate loci in pre-malignant stages of a variety of cancers (e.g. breast, pancreas, and esophagus). Ultimately, the authors observed that DNA hypermethylation events previously identified in full-blown cancer were already hypermethylated in the precancerous tissues. One particularly interesting outcome was that progressive lung carcinoma in situ demonstrated elevated methylation levels, while regressive CIS more closely resembled normal lung tissue, suggesting that these CpGs may actually be predictive of progression and/or play a role in carcinogenesis. This is a straight-forward in silico analysis study, and seems worthy of indexing since the methylation biomarker field is moving rapidly and showing significant promise. This reviewer has two concerns, however, that should be addressed: While the methylation trends are clearly qualitatively visible, statistical significance is not given for any of the comparisons. Due to pre-malignant lesions showing similar patterns as the corresponding cancer, does that reduce the efficacy of these biomarkers as the target screening population malignancy is indistinguishable from the cancer? For example, healthy individuals are not routinely screened for esophageal carcinoma, but those with Barrett's esophagus are.
