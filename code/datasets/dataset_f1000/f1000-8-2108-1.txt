V. para is not a member of Enterobacteriaceae, that needs correction. It is a Gram‐negative, halophilic bacterium belonging to the family of Vibrionaceae. Basically, this pathogen is the leading cause of seafood‐borne gastroenteritis due to the consumption of raw seafood, not the true pathogen of cultured shrimps. However, this bacterium has recently gained importance following the identification of certain strains of Vibrio parahaemolyticus as the causative agent that caused large scale losses in farmed shrimp production in several parts of the world. I am not clear about the true source of MVP1 used as no clear description is provided. Is it isolated from the surface of the infected animal or from haemolymph or hepatopancreas or from soil and water of the shrimp pond that was tested positive for AHPND? What is the evidence that exists to show that authors have used unfragmented gDNA for library preparation? The genome of Vibrio parahaemolyticus MVP1 is how much comparable to the Reference strain? Additional insecticidal toxin gene generated in the chromosome of MVP1 - does it present in the strains used for the comparative analysis? Is it part of any VpaI identified previously? Do you think just mere presence of such genes would precipitate in the disease/pathogenesis? Could the presence of this gene be linked to demonstrable traits among the isolates? What was the rationale behind the analysis of LuxM/OpaM/AinS family autoinducer? The reference list is biased to the more recent articles published by members of the research group and few older references of others. An up to date literature review is clearly needed.
