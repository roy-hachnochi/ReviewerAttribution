The authors presented a very interesting care report about malignant thymoma and seronegative myasthenia gravis. The case is presented with sufficient clinical details and the discussion included highlights the importance of the findings and their relevance to future understanding of disease. However, in my opinion, there some points which might be empowered especially regarding the details provided about physical examination and diagnostic tests. In particular the conclusion of the abstract where the authors state "This case reports the importance of a multidisciplinary approach to the management of the potential correlation of malignant and benign diseases" is not sufficiently supported in the case presentation. I would suggest to implement the description of the multidisciplinary management including the role of the other specialists (eg. neurologists) that the authors believe to be useful. I would stress the concept of multidisciplinarity also in the discussion (and not only in the abstract).
