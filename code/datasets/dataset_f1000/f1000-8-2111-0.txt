The following are minor suggestions that may improve the clarity and interpretation of the data The title can be “Elevated peripheral blood eosinophil levels in infantile hemangioma patients” or “Elevated peripheral blood eosinophil levels in Chinese patients with infantile hemangioma”. The authors have pointed out that IH is significantly higher in females compared to males. It would be useful to analyse and represent the results in table 1 and 2 based on gender. In other words, in addition to the current statistical analysis, it would be interesting to know whether the eosinophil (EO) levels were significantly different between controls and IH in males and females subjects separately. The authors can also expand the Table 1 parameters based on gender as well. Further, it will be useful to know the normal range for EO in pediatric population. The authors have mentioned the range for Chinese adult population. The authors can calculate the proportion (%) of subjects with IH above the normal range (if available) or the proportion (%) of subjects with IH above the median level in the control group. The authors can also attempt AUC analysis, if possible to improve the clinical relevance of EO levels in the diagnosis of IH. It would be useful to know whether the authors had access to the proportions of other leukocyte subsets other than EO. This would be relevant and the authors can consider addressing this in the discussion. It is unclear how the % of Procalcitonin (PCT) was computed and whether it is possible to include the concentration range for the same. Further, it was not stated as to why PCT was included in the inclusion criteria and how it is relevant to IH or EO levels in the context of IH. Could power calculation be done to show the robustness of the finding with relevance to the sample size?
