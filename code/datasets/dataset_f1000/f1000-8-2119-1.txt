I consider this manuscript suitable for indexing with your journal with some changes recommended: Make a more user-friendly introduction and be sure about some concepts (e.g sphingomyelin is a type of sphingolipid containing sphingomyelin, where every sphingolipid contains it). Introduce some main concepts about breast concept to contextualize your research. In the part of results, include what does each variable mean. I have found difficult to understand all the data from the table and the reader could have the same "problem". In the part of discussion you should focus on the possible explanation about the crosstalk between proliferative and pro-apoptotic SPHINGOLIPIDS (not ceramides, please confirm every concept (e.g. sphingomyelin is proliferative while ceramide apoptotic, and C1P pro-apoptotic). I would like to read a little bit more about your hypothesis instead of the limitations of your study.
