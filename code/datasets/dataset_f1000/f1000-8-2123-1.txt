The paper opens two discussions. One is about the value of programs specifically designed to train physician/scientists, i.e. MD/PhD, with discussion of approaches to determine whether the programs achieve desired goals, while admitting that the goal of having a continuum of basic science and clinical research has not been achieved. The second discussion is how to optimize training of physician/scientists, assuming, for instance, that MD/PhD programs have in place efforts to achieve the goal of the continuum of research as well as discussing other areas in which the dual degree may be valuable. Perhaps ironically, as they argue the case with the basic science and clinical training of MD/PhDs are not well integrated, neither are the two parts of this commentary. Questions that would be interesting to address include how the data they propose to collect determining whether the MD/PhD programs are achieving their goals would be used to inform redesign of the programs. They are assuming shortcomings in their proposed redesign of programs, but don't have data to support that, or at least it is not well articulated. Nevertheless, the discussion is worthwhile and the integration may not be possible. The other topic that might be included is how criteria for career advancement may influence achieving the goals of the programs. Financial issues are discussed, but the criteria used to advance and retain individuals with the training are not.
