The authors studied the correlation between NoV genogroup and severity of acute diarrhea in the pediatric patients with gastroenteritis at the Hospital, Surabaya, Indonesia. NoV was detected in around 20% of the patients. In many cases, GII virus was detected, while GI was detected in one case. Moreover, 30% of the patients showed severe diarrhea. Overall, the manuscript was well written, while I had some minor comments. The authors only examined by RT-PCR method. Did you detect nonspecific PCR products in the amplicons? Please add it in the results. How did you prevent laboratory contamination? Please provide it in the revised manuscript.
