 1. The rationale for developing the new software tool was not clearly explained. Given lots of closed or similar tools such as SCOPA 1 , SIFT, PolyPhen-2, and dbSNP, etc., I was expect more adding value of the present study to describe. One important concern associate with such databases is t hat these tools should get updated regularly with regards to recent GWAS etc. Ideally, these databases are manually curated. 2. I have concern about the format of output and interpretation of the results. I think the author should tested this tool even in very small dataset and report that. 3. One major point is that introducing a new tools need some strong evidences to compete with available and known tools. So the authors should compare the validity and SWOT aspects of this tools with the present tools. So, claiming that “SNPector provides and detects all available information” without a good and clear comparison is only lead to adding a tool to the previous sets of tools.
