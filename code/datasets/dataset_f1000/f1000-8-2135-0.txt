In this case, authors aimed to discuss the epidemiology of cardioembolic stroke in young adults (i.e. females) and illustrate this with a possible diagnosis of PPCM. Manuscrpit is well written but many questions remained. PPCM diagnosis is very difficult and cannot be confirmed in this case. Indeed, in the absence of TTE evaluation before delivery (or in the month before) demonstrating usually parameters observed in pregnant women without other abnormalities (LVEF dysfunction,...), we cannot distinguish a PPCM from another form of previous unknown dilated cardiomyopathy. This is a major pitfall in this manuscript, but also seriously raised concern about the true existence of PPCM diagnosis. Of note, LV diameters are not available, nor aortic valvular evaluation or arguments (or not) for a eventual congenital cardiac disease. Cardiac biomarkers are absent, and extensive coagulation testing must have been realized to exclude a possible diagnosis of catastrophic thrombotic syndrome (aPLS, TTP...). Moreover, despite the absence of robust evidence with its utilization (and also the thrombotic risk), bromocriptine prescription should however have been discussed.
