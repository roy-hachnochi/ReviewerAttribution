 From the technical point of view, the vhcub R package looks quite reliable and well supported. However, there is only one example illustrating it. Moreover, this example shows the mean value for SiD in its range (i.e., 0.491 or approx. 0.5), which is great but makes us wondering if this package could give expected values for other cases. If that is possible, could the authors include a couple of examples where the SiD value were below 0.5 and above 0.5? The tool is very interesting and captivating. The advantages that R offers are infinite, so I consider that it would be invaluable to exploit the output that R offers. It is clear in the article that the algorithm only allows the entry of DNA sequences in Fasta format, although there are other very simple tools to use to transcribe from RNA to DNA, or from RNA- to RNA + and DNA, it would be very nice to use the same R package to carry out this step, especially considering that from biological tests we not only analyze one sequence but many. To the same extent, I consider that the figures presented in the article should be more discussed from a biological point of view, they could be more informative.
