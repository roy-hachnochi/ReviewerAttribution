Viruses in the course of their evolution would optimize their codon usage to their hosts. They rely on the tRNA pool of their hosts in the translation process. Though tools for analyzing the codon usage of organisms are available, none of them focus on examining the codon usage co-adaptation between viruses and their hosts. This software, vhcub, is a tool used to analyze the co-adaptation of codon usage between a virus and its host. This may also help to predict the possible mutations that would accumulate in the virus vis - a - vis its host(s), thereby showing the readiness for the control and prevention of the disease.
