The authors present a benchmark regarding prokaryotic organisms for several state-of-the-art long-read assemblers. The comparison includes both third generation sequencing technologies with real and simulated data, assessing various assembly traits with the conclusion that no assembler is perfect. The manuscript is well written, the figures look neat and all the data is freely available online. Minor comments: Generating the assembly with a hybrid approach which is different from all benchmarked assemblers is a good approach, but is there a possibility to analyse in details datasets which have reference genomes assembled with Sanger sequencing (such as CFT073 and MGH78578 datasets used in De Maio N, Shaw LP, Hubbard A, et al. 1 )? As minipolish is a new pipeline introduced in this paper, I would suggest describing it a bit more in detail. Ra assembler has been published as a conference proceedings here .
