The authors provided an R package for the QRISK3 algorithm to predict the risk of cardiovascular disease. My main comment is related to the size of this package, which has only one simple function with two simple datasets. I am not sure that this tiny package can be presented as an F1000Research article. There are not any new findings represented in this article compared to the author's previous works. I suggest enriching this package with more visualization and data manipulation functions and datasets. Besides, I do not think it needs to highlight validation of R performance with SAS or C. This is part of your quality control, not an outcome. Also, I have some minor comments: Why didn't you use the R 3.6.2 instead of 3.4.2? Why you did not make the categorical variables as ordered factor R object instead of a simple numeric object? (in this case, you do not need to think about the conflict of the meaning of "1" and "0"). The range of patient ages is not consistent between text and table. "Height", "Weight" and "Weight/Height" in table 1 should be lowercase the same as the package.
