We appreciate the authors’ responses to our questions and suggestions. The conclusion in the abstract does not match the conclusion in the article. The health belief model is inappropriate to explain why people do not spontaneously look for healthcare services. The results do not provide any data that allows to suggest a “weak or unrecognized capacity for self-agency in health” and do not evaluate any of the six dimensions of this model (perception of susceptibility, severity, benefits, barriers, self-efficacy, and cues to action) to understand the degree of importance that ex-combatants assign to their own health. In addition, the cited works about the health belief model are not related to the topic or the findings of this research. A more plausible explanation could be related to the transitional moment in which ex-combatants are starting to interact with a healthcare system different from the one they had as an armed group. The new references about rural health provide interesting insights to understand the results The article would benefit from a final proofreading
