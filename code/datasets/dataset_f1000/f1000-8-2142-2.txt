This manuscript describes a systematic literature review on quality of life, symptom burden, and healthcare resource utilization and costs of CKD across different CKD stages and comparing to the general population without CKD. The literature search process, decisions on which publications to include, the summary of review results, and limitations are clearly stated. My only suggestion is to remove the following sentence from Methods, Citation Screening and Full Text Review on page 3 because this information is duplicate from the previous subsection Systemic Literature Review: "For the humanistic burden SR, study publication dates for data extraction were restricted to 2007–2017; for the economic burden SR, the relevant time period was restricted to 2012–2017." I recommend acceptance with this minor edit.
