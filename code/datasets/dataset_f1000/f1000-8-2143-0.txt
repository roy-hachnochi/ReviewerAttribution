The article is well written and relevant in view of identifying the minimum visual acuity demand in schools. Previous articles in this subject used only English language. The need for measurement of minimum visual acuity demand for different languages and its influence is well highlighted in this article. Very high demand in these schools compared to published literature is a surprise and the authors attribute it to language, any other factors need to be reviewed. Use of white boards and the width of the stroke on white boards are smaller compare to blackboards which would be one of the other important factor apart from the language. There is no literature available on the comparison of white board vs black board or smart boards (computer based class rooms) and it is missing in this paper also. Sample size justification is not provided why did they choose randomly 8 schools only. Authors conclude the need for revision of cut off for vision screening, they could use the data and suggest what could be the ideal cut off based on the study results. A discussion on the same and the implications of reducing the cut off like adding more burden on school screening and more students need refraction need to be highlighted.
