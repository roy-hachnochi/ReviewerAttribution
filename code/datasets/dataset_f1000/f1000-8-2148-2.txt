Thank you for giving me the opportunity to review this well described paper about development and test of a prognostic tool for knee pain in adolescence. A very important area. I am very pleased to see the incorporation of psykosocial aspect in the pain. I was wondering about the use of the word ngstelig/deprimeret (anxious/depressed). Do children aged 8 and a bit older understand that word? Would it be better to use the word bekymret (worried) instead? In the statistics section; you write that you will stratify by traumatic/non-traumatic onset. Why do they choose to do so? I think this paper is well written and described and I therefore have no further comments. I am looking forward the seeing the results.
