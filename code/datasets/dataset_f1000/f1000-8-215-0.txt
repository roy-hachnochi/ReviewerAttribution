Pratas et al. describe the case of a patient with a HNSCC localized in the oral cavity. A CT scan after surgery and adjuvant radiation therapy reveals lesions with contrast enhancement in the oral cavity and mediastinal LN suspicious for tumor progression. Hence, a palliative chemotherapy was added resulting in complete response. It would be interesting to discuss whether these findings could be explained by sarcoid like lesions or sarcoidosis, as well. A control CT and PET-CT scan, then, revealed mediastinal LN suggestive for metastatic lesions. Biopsy of the LN leads to the diagnosis of sarcoidosis and no further therapy was conducted. Although histopathological findings show sarcoidosis, a residual risk of overlooking metastases in systemic inflammatory diseases still remains existent because it is not possible to take biopsies of every hypermetabolic lesion. This would be an interesting addition to the discussion section of the manuscript.
