This is a useful case report of a patient with locally advanced oral cavity carcinoma treated with surgery and adjuvant radiotherapy. CT soon after completion of treatment was suggestive of local recurrence in floor of mouth and development of new mediastinal LN. A complete radiological response was obtained following palliative chemotherapy. It would be useful to know what imaging modality this was and to explicitly state whether the local recurrence also showed a complete response. A subsequent PET-CT showed avid mediastinal LN strongly suggestive of distant metastases. Would be useful to comment on whether there was any uptake at primary site. Biopsy showed sarcoidosis and patient remains well several years later. It would be interesting to know the explanation for apparent local recurrence which resolved with chemotherapy - was this thought to be misinterpretation of radiology or also a sarcoid process? Overall a useful message regarding the importance of confirming recurrence by biopsy.
