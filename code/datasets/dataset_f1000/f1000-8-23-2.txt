This is a national survey in Peru performed in drugstores and pharmacies in 2015. The authors stratified their respondents in: (i) non self-medication (NSM, purchased based a prescription); (ii) responsible self-medication (RSM, paid an OTC); or (iii) irresponsible self-medication (IRM, acquire a prescription drug without prescription). The results reveal that RSM and IRM are more frequent in males and without health insurance, and more uncommon in 39 years old. Some suggestions for improvement: In Table 1, please stratify the characteristics of participants by the three response variables (NSM, RSM, IRM) and exclude the Table 2 (male data are missing). Change the Figure 2 to table for better visualization. I believe that the results are influenced by the NSM group. This population had a prescription, which is, visited more health services and probably had poor health status. Such characteristics are attributable to women and elders. The poor health status of the NSM group induced their best behavior. Sexism is important, but I think that it is not sufficient to explain worse male health behavior. Please review these aspects in the discussion.
