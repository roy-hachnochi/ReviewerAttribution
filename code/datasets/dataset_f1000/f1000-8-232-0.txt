The article reports on a visualization tool for seqcluster outputs, a software tool to characterise small transcriptome data. It is a smart tool for sRNA visualization. The interactive view makes it attractive, especially the visualization of secondary structures. The performance of the tool fits description and the filter option is very helpful for jumping to the desired information. The tool is restricted to seqcluster.db file as input and cannot be used as a general-purpose sRNA visulization tool using map files. Sufficient information is provided to allow interpretation of the expected output data sets and results generated with the tool. The example expression profile provides clear distinction between samples. The editing option makes it even better, but when one switches to the line view different lengths can be seen. It is not clear whether this is related with the length of the sRNA that map at that position. A summary of the lengths that mapped would be useful additional information. Alongside the description section in Figure A (left side) information on the length of sRNA should be included.
