This article by Pantano et al. describes a novel software, SeqclusterViz, to visualize and help the interpretation of small RNA-seq data mapped using Seqcluster. Moreover, the authors illustrate its usage with a case study of small RNAs dysregulated in the brain of patients with Parkinson’s disease. This software is of importance to help researchers do in depth analysis and compare the exact mapping of reads across multiple samples. The subject of this manuscript is interesting and seems adequate for indexing in F1000Research. The work looks solid although minor edits could be performed to improve the quality and usability of the SeqclusterViz. Minor comments: The SeqclusterViz displays the sequence of the reads mapped to a precursor RNA such as a pri-miRNA. In particular, mature miRNA is well known for having isoforms (isomiRs) with the addition or internal edit to non-templated nucleotides. The field of isomiR study is of growing interest, SeqclusterViz will benefit from a display of non-templated nucleotides. A secondary structure prediction is implemented on SeqclusterViz, please describe in more the prediction method used. Include input parameters (such as if GU pairs at the end of helices) and outputs such as MFE, bracket-dot notation... Provide units for the Y and X axis in “Abundance profile along precursor”. Provide normalized read counts on “Table with Sequences”. Repair the path to make the button “Load example” active. The buttons of “Add filter” and “Change line” can’t be linked to the samples easily.
