I think at this stage, asking to do any more work would be asking too much of an already impressive manuscript. While I am still a little cautious about the results and the correlations due to the treatment of time series data, I don't think that at the present this should stop this MS from being indexed and more widely used, discussed, and built upon. Thank you to the author for being so considerate of the recommendations from myself and the other reviewer, and thank you for such a good piece of work! Banyak selamat!
