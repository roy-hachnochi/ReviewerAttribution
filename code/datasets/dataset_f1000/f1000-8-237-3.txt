The author has made various improvements. However, the revised paper suffers from two problems that I would like to request the author to address. The first problem is a major one, while the second one is more minor. First, the results section consists of just one sentence and doesn’t properly present and explain the results. Instead, a summary of the results is presented in Table 1 and this table then provides references to other tables and figures. Based on Table 1, I find it difficult to get a good understanding of the results. Without such an understanding, I also struggle to understand the discussion section. My recommendation is to remove Table 1 and to provide a proper presentation of the results in the results section. Since I didn’t manage to properly understand the results, I refrain from commenting on the discussion of the results in the discussion section. The author could also consider combining the presentation and the discussion of the results in a single section called ‘Results and Discussion’. Second, in the principal component analysis, I don’t think the first component should be labeled ‘research performance’. The term ‘research performance’ is very general and could mean many different things. Therefore, ‘research performance’ is not a very helpful label for the first component. The essential difference between the two components is that the first one consists of size-dependent variables (i.e., variables that increase with the number of publications of a country) while the second component consists of a size-independent variable (i.e., a variable that is independent of the number of publications of a country). The first component could be labeled ‘research output’ (since all variables depend on the size of the research output of a country), while the second one could be labeled ‘research impact’.
