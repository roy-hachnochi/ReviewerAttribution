This article proposes to establish an international center for antimicrobial research and development. The center would develop and then sell drugs to according to a principle of "shared burden." There is a need for such a center, since the private pharmaceutical industry has largely abandoned research in this area since it sees little prospect for profit. While this is an innovate idea, it would be helpful to see it flushed out a bit more in two directions. First, while it seems the authors' intentions that all research findings be open, a slightly clearer statement on this principle would be helpful. For example, do they envision something like the Bermuda Principle, where results are posted to the web, if not nightly, as quickly as practical. The second area that could benefit from clarification is the meaning of the principle of "shared burden." Since the research costs are being paid upfront, it is unclear why there would be any reason to charge a price above the marginal cost. (There could an issue where countries that did not contribute to research costs get charged more, but that should be explicitly stated.) Anyhow, this is a worthwhile proposal which should advance the debate on the best way to finance the development of prescription drugs.
