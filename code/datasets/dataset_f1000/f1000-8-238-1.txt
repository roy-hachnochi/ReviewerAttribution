The authors have written a bold, interesting and well argued opinion piece. It discusses alternatives to reviving antibiotics drug development beyond the ‘push-pull’ incentives offered to pharmaceutical industry. They would essentially result in making novel antibiotics a public commodity. This should trigger much needed debate. I have two comments. One is in detail. In the opening of the third last paragraph we find the sentence "Resulting drugs would be sold globally ...". Is that consistent with the approach. After all selling could again make the invented drugs private property and prohibit keeping their further development in open areas. Would not licensing be better? My second question is about comparable stories. I am no great expert in vaccines but it seems to me that in this case we have seen rather successful cases of public-private partnerships in the last decades. Maybe worth considering. Historical reading could start from "Galambos, Louis, and Jane Eliot Sewell. Networks of Innovation: Vaccine Development at Merck, Sharp and Dohme, and Mulford, 1895-1995. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1996."
