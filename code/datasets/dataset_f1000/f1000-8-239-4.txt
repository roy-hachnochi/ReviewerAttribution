The authors utilized a self-structured questionnaire to test KAP of 225 patients at Sigatoka Sub-divisional Hospital in Fiji, and used independent t-test and ANOVA to test the differences between demographic variable and practical score while non-parametric tests were used for knowledge and attitude which allowed guidance to promote effective public health interventions to high risk groups. The power of using the survey tool in three languages was demonstrated through the high response rate, although the sample size was very small that lack the generalization of the results to all the population. It would be interesting in the discussion to compare this findings to any Fiji findings with other low income countries, including in the region if that is available. Clarification is needed regarding definitions of the three ethnic groups since the results are discussed using the different ethnicity category, as usually data for Fiji is based on three groupings. The method and discussion both mention the problem of poor knowledge and education level affecting data, yet the issue is not really explored as to its possible impact on the outcomes of the analysis. What are the implications of this? This should be discussed in the discussion section. The discussion focuses only on ethnic differences with KAP, would it be possible to also discuss the gender differences with KAP? It is interesting that many aspects of lifestyle are better in females than males according to STEPS 2002, and this should be discussed.
