The paper is good presented and used enough references to support the discussion. The experiment done is not used in the complete design of the experiment (DOE) but some of the results use statistical analysis. They used OFAT design. The methodology has discussed well and properly such as on the preparation of durian peel (raw material), the process of pyrolysis, analysis of smoke (product), antibacterial testing. It is a good paper and can be applied in the agriculture industry sector.
