This article presents an interesting way to introduce gene ontologies and related vocabulary to high school students to enhance biological education. While the proposal describes the method in detail, there is no data presented to show that the method actually works. While this is an interesting protocol, it is not a fully fleshed out methods article. The authors will need to present data to show the viability of the method, or resubmit potentially as a protocol. A few more specific comments about the article are listed below: The abstract is worded as more of a proposal rather than a paper. The protocol seems very much like following a set of directions (not very thought-provoking or inquiry-based), without relating it to the neuroscience. I think the paper would be much stronger if the authors were to relate it back to the behavioral neuroscience projects that are mentioned in the abstract.
