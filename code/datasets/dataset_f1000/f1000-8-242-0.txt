Bello et al. completed a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate if pulse oximetry screening improves the diagnostic accuracy over physical examination alone for early detection of CCHD. Authors conclude that pulse oximetry in addition to neonatal physical examination improves sensitivity and may be particularly helpful in early detection of CCHD in low-resource settings. Authors have used appropriate search and statistical tools to complete their review. The manuscript is well written and easy to follow. Please correct the typing error at the end of introduction section - authors state their objective as "to define ..... CCHD in NB younger than 37 weeks without suspicion or prior diagnosis of CCHDs" but the review is based on data collected on term infants. Authors provide no data to support their conclusion that pulse oximetry is likely to be more helpful in early detection of CCHD in low-resource settings.
