With the high prevalence of obesity and Non communicable diseases (NCDs), it is important to investigate how it affects the other underlying problems associated with it. This study provides very important findings as research in this area is still virgin in the region. The change in the food habits and nutrition transition further complicates this problem. Oral health and NCDs risk factors is established in several studies however the correlations were not significant. The association between dental health and obesity has not been studied in the region although there has been a significant change in the food habits and socioeconomic levels of the different populations. This will further increase the burden on public health system.
