The paper by Abbass et al., evaluated clearly and accurately the potential impact of age, gender, body mass index, socioeconomic status and dietary habits on the prevalence of dental caries among Egyptian adults. The title and abstract are appropriate for the content of the text. The cross-sectional study design is appropriate and the work is technically sound. Sufficient details of methods and analyses were provided and it has an external validity as well as internal one and thus it can be reproduced. Non parametric statistical tests were performed as the data are categorical in type. The data obtained are interpreted appropriately and the results are valid. All the source data underlying the results are available and thus full reproducibility can be attained. The conclusions drawn are adequately supported by the results. In addition, the paper is well written and precisely formatted.
