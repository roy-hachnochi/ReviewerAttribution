This submission by Ahmed et al . is an attempt at a systematic review and meta-analysis of azithromycin in prevention of exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It should be noted that azithromycin should not be capitalized, nor should placebo. A primary limitation of this review includes only 4 studies that differ in the proportion of males and females. The largest of the studies,1142 subjects, had 58% males, the next largest, 92 subjects, had 43% males. A study with 84 subjects had 75% males. This suggests that the 4 studies may not be looking at the same disease. The heterogeneity of COPD is well established 1 - 3 . Moreover, another meta-analysis that included 11 studies with 1910 subjects 4 was not included in the current submission. The interest of macrolide antibiotics, particularly azithromycin, was the serendipitous discovery of the curative effect of these antibiotics in diffuse panbronchiolitis 5 through a mechanism not related to their antibiotic effect. The wide range of immunomodulator effect of azithromycin has resulted in studies of various obstructive lung disease including cystic fibrosis, an asthma phenotype, post-transplant bronchiolitis in addition to non-pulmonary inflammatory diseases 6 . However, no other disease has been associated with essentially absolute cure as seen with diffuse panbronchiolitis. As such, a report such as this by Ahmed et al . needs to consider the heterogeneity of COPD and whether the 4 studies are looking at subjects with the same COPD. With the number of subjects predominantly from one study and the failure to include a larger systematic review and meta-analysis further limit the relevance of this report. The authors need to expand their source of data and consider the complexity of COPD and whether azithromycin might best target a specific COPD phenotype.
