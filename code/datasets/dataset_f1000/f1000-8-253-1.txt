Noting that the macrolide antibiotics have immunomodulatory (and not anti-inflammatory) properties, these authors have performed a limited systematic review and meta analysis of one of these medications, azithromycin, for the prevention of exacerbations of COPD. After a search of SCOPUS, PubMed, and ClinicalTrials.gov they identified three studies for the acute exacerbations frequency analysis and concluded that the use of azithromycin for three to six months reduces the frequency of exacerbations; but it is not clear if this is clinically significant, if the effect is greatest in severe or less severe exacerbations, or if the dosage or dosing frequency makes a difference. The authors refer to this as a “research study”. It is in fact a systematic review which not does not directly evaluate the safety or efficacy of long-term administration of azithromycin as the authors claim in the first paragraph of their Abstract. The greatest shortcoming of this study is the authors’ failure to perform a complete literature search of clinical trials studying the use of macrolides in the prevention of COPD exacerbations. In October 2018 a Cochrane review by Herath et al. 1 on this exact subject, includes studies of all macrolide antibiotics for the prevention of COPD exacerbations. The Cochrane review is not only much more comprehensive and robust in terms of analysis and conclusions, but Ahmed et al., fail to cite this previously published systematic review. Furthermore, there was an additional complete systematic review on this subject published in the JAMA in 2014 2 also not cited by these authors; strongly suggesting that their literature review was superficial at best. Therefore, although, the current manuscript is a narrowly focused systematic review; given the published Cochrane review this paper adds little to the literature.
