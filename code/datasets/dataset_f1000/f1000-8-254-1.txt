This study has reported new information that is very important to explain the effect of genes mutation in canine impaction. This research is very interesting. The researcher analysed the relationship between mutations and Pax9 gene polymorphisms with cases of canine tooth impaction. This research has been carried out using gene sequencing. The results showed an association between Pax9 gene mutations (SNPs 3 and 4) with the appearance of maxillary canine teeth impaction. The abstract contains concise and clear information about the background, objectives, methods, results and conclusions, so that it is quite easy for the readers. The following are inputs to improve the quality of this manuscript: In the abstract, it is written in the background section: "Paired-box gene 9 (PAX9) mutation is often associated with impaction in some patient populations." This indicates that previous researchers may have conducted similar studies in different populations. It is advisable to write about this in the introduction, to strengthen the reasons for choosing the pax9 gene and also in the discussion, to analyse possible similarities or differences in pax9 polymorphism in different study populations. The results showed that gender has no effect on the incidence of canine impaction, gender-associated genetic variation has no contribution. It would be better if the authors explain the possible causes, or show references from previous research reports that are relevant to the phenomenon. Does this occur only in canine impaction or is it possible for other tooth impaction cases? Please add to the discussion section, factors that are likely to cause the emergence of Pax9 gene polymorphism. Material and methods: the researcher conducted a sequencing analysis, please explain whether the method used is next generation sequencing.
