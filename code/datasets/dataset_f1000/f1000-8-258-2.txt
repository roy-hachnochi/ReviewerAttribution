The study protocol submitted by Byrne et al. is an exciting and well-thought out experiment, aimed at investigating the impact of diets with different carbohydrate quality (i.e. low fibre, whole high fibre and disrupted high fibre) on the gastrointestinal microbiota and appetite in humans. The repeated ileal sampling provides for a real time analysis of the response of the microbiota to these different diets. Minor comments: Some lines of research indicate that different dietary fibres (e.g. inulin, rhamnose) differentially impact the gut microbiota and subsequent SCFA production (Baxter et al. 2019 1 ; Reichardt et al. 2018 2 ). This is well-controlled for when comparing the HF-whole and HF-disrupted groups, but not so much for the LF-refined group. It might be good to, if possible, analyse dietary fibre profile of the diets. This will increase the interpretability of the data and allow for a better comparison between the LF and HF groups, as LF will likely have a different dietary fibre profile. It is likely that the food intake patterns of participants prior to the study will influence their microbiota and therefore how their microbiota will respond to the different diets. Performing a food frequency questionnaire to assess their diet prior to the visit date might therefore provide valuable insight into how day-to-day food intake patterns can influence the microbiota and its response to these diets.Or any other measure to have an record of baseline food intake and food quality. Both males and females will be recruited, but its not stated if the aim is to recruit at a gender balanced level. Use of oral contraceptives and menstrual cycle should be recorded (oral contraceptives possibly excluded).
