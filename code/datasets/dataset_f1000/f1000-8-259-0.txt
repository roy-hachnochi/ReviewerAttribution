The authors describe their experience of endoscopic DCR with marsupialization versus endoscopic DCR with "other techniques". They compared their first 7 cases of endoDCR with marsupialization to the others. They found similar results (non-statistically significant) in comparing the surgical techniques. Major comments: Patients included in this study are not the same. Of the 24 patients, 2 had congenital disease and two had previous DCR (unclear endo or external). Thus, 16% of their patients had atypical disease. It is unclear how various patients were assigned to have marsupialization versus other types of surgery. The authors stated they collected subjective symptomatology outcomes, however this is not reported. Three patients were lost to follow-up (all in the non-marsupialization group). These should be excluded from the analysis.
