The article is a focused investigation of the haplotype variation observed in mosquito populations trapped at three locations in Kenya. The authors noted variation in all the 11 species reported including a number of novel observations. However, the authors do not include basic data on the actual distribution and species assemblage at the collection sites. By arbitrarily selecting 25 samples for extensive genetic analysis and ignoring the remaining samples that apparently included 894, 824 and 720 mosquitoes appears to be a fundamental omission. It is difficult to see how the authors can conclude that “The distribution varies in density” when the dataset has not been analysed. Whilst it may be beyond the resources of the team to molecularly type all 2,438 samples, without some attempt to include morphological identification of a significant proportion of these samples the manuscript is considerable diminished. The authors should check the capitalisation of pathogens throughout. As a general rule, names derived from a place are capitalised e.g. Rift Valley fever virus, whilst those that are not are in lower case e.g. yellow fever virus, malaria. The authors must revise the conclusions section to reflect the findings of the paper stating precisely what they have derived from their observations. At the moment the two sentences’ provide a revision of the manuscripts aim and a vague statement that is unsupported by the results. The reference for Morrill et al is incorrect. It should be Morrill et al., 1991, J Trop Med Hyg, 94, 166.
