I appreciate the revisions and responses that the authors have made. I believe that the manuscript is now more understandable. I have several editorial suggestions: The heading for the fourth column of Table 2 is still confusing. Can you change it to match the heading for the 4th column of Table 3? "AEs with trigger"? Delete the duplicate sentence under Sample Selection. Change 1st paragraph of Review Process as follows: "The third reviewer was always a physician. The physician did not review the CRs, but had to authenticate the consensus of the two primary record reviewers. The physician authenticated the findings of the adverse events, the rating of severity and provided answers to questions of the record reviewers about findings in a specific record." I'm not sure all readers would understand that an "isolated trigger" in Table 1 is a "single positive trigger" in the 2nd paragraph of results. I'd change the sentence to "single, positive trigger". Some of the numbers in the 3rd paragraph of Results do not match Table 1. First sentence of 4th paragraph of Results should read: "We detected 1542 AEs in 975 CRs (i.e. patients) with AEs." Finally, under Limitations, first sentence, delete "some".
