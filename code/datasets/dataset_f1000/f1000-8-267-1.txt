Caries has been the one of the most prevalent dental conditions which needs effective treatment. Products currently in use such as mouthwashes recommended for oral hygiene are not very effective against dental biofilm formation. This study evaluates the efficacy of colloidal silver gel formulations in inhibiting bacterial biofilm formation by S. mutans, S. sanguis, and S. salivarius which cause plaque formation. The choice of colloidal silver over ionic silver in view of its lower toxicity is well justified and so also the choice of bacteria for evaluating the efficacy of colloidal silver. The effectiveness of colloidal silver has been demonstrated by quantifying colony forming units (CFU). Appropriate controls and statistical analyses have been provided to support the results. The results are further supported by scanning electron microscopy. The results show that no biofilms are formed in the presence of colloidal silver gel but do form in the control experiments carried out with placebo. Since the objective of the work is to develop a treatment for the prevention of caries, it would be desirable to optimize the concentration of colloidal silver in the gel in future. In addition to prevention of biofilm formation if colloidal silver is shown to be useful in disrupting biofilms already formed, it would enhance the scope of treatment. I recommend the indexing of the paper “Efficacy of a silver colloidal gel against selected oral bacteria in vitro”.
