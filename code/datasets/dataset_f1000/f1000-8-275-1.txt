Since fibrosis is a major complication in IBD patients and the published literature indicates a fibrogenic role of myofibroblasts, the authors have an important rationale for understanding the characteristics of myofibroblasts in the intestines (IMF). However, this study has introduced a number of variables, such as mucosal tissues versus IMF and IBD patient versus control groups that are confusing to the overall aim of the study. Some of the areas that can be better explained include: It is unclear in the Results pertaining to Figures 2 and 3 from which of the four groups of patients the IMF cultures were characterized. When examining the inflammatory potential of IMF, an elevated level of IL-6 and IL-8 is reported, but not TNF and IL-17. It would be interesting to hear a speculation on why this is so. IMFs from control groups and IBD groups did not vary in their expression of fibrosis markers - doesn't this undermine the role of IMFs in IBDs, where fibrosis is a major complication? Several references have been made to the lung mucosal surface that differs significantly from the intestinal mucosa.
