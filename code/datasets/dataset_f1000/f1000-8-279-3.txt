This short note describes the ability of two cardiomyopathy associated actin alleles to incorporate into body wall myosin filaments in C. elegans . The authors find that whereas transgenic, tagged wild-type control actin ACT-4 incorporates well into the muscle, the two mutant variants do so with lower efficiency and also accumulate as non-filamentous aggregates. This report is technically sound and the conclusions are appropriately drawn from the evidence provided. In future studies it would be of interest to incorporate these mutations into the genome so that the relative dosage of the mutant protein would better reflect that seen in cardiomyopathy patients.
