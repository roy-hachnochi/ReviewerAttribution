Queiroz dos Santos et al. made an attempt here. I really appreciate their effort but there are some points to mention. Objective of the study is not clear. Results are not presented well. Discussion part is also not up to the mark. Lot of grammatical errors. SDS-PAGE is good, rest of the graphs are of poor quality. Thus in its present form it is difficult to accept, but it can be reconsidered as a short communication rather than a full length paper with major revision. Present the results and discussion separately. Give the microscopic image of hemagglutination and hemolysis. Better try anticoagulant activity in-vivo. Carry out APTT and PT assay
