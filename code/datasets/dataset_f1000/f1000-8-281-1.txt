Infertility and ID are important health problems. There are several reasons in the etiology of each of the two diseases, but genetic causes are more important. Among the genetic reasons, chromosomal rearrangements are remarkable. In this case, both infertility and mild-ID are seen. Genetic studies in this case indicate a chromosomal rearrangement that has not previously been in the literature. In the diagnostic pathway, physical examination and family history of the patient were first investigated. No dysmorphic features were observed in the patient. Then, routine laboratory tests were performed, and azoospermia was detected in the patient. In addition, according to the information obtained from patient, in vitro fertilization process failure was noted. Hypergonadotropic hypogonadism was also observed in the patient. According to the algorithm, genetic tests to be performed for the diagnosis of both infertility and ID were started with conventional cytogenetics and continued with aCGH. As a result, a balanced chromosomal translocation was detected in the patient. Insertional translocations affect various genetic mechanisms and disrupt gene functions. This type of translocation may lead to increased or decreased gene functions. These chromosomal translocations may also affect epigenetic mechanisms. If the affected genes in chromosomal fracture regions can be determined with more advanced methods, they will contribute to the etiology of infertility and ID. Some minor corrections may be required in this case. It is necessary to determine the number of areas studied during cytogenetic analysis, to indicate whether the change is in all areas, and the pedigree drawing shown in Figure 1 should be redrawn and numbered according to the basis principles. In order to clearly understand the fracture regions shown in Figure 2, it is useful to show to centromere subregions in the ideogram.
