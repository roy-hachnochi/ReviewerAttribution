This paper represents an extension of the authors' extensive work in this area - which aims to provide an accessible web-based platform for researchers to perform multi-cohort analysis of pooled transcriptomics data. The Introduction outlines the scientific rationale to support the development of such a platform, which I mostly agree. There are a number of reasons why such a platform can assist researchers, including (1) help researchers to leverage on publicly available dataset to address each researcher's own research question, (2) obtaining a large sample size for analysis, which is otherwise not feasible by a single research group, (3) provide access to a diverse range of patient population and varying degree of disease severity, thereby generating more biological insights, which are not achievable by a single-centre study. For these reasons, the platform provided by these author represents an important contribution to the research community. To further place this into perspective, one can estimate the likely cost (in time and money) to obtain the same analysis if such a platform is not available. To collect 31 transcriptomics datasets of viral respiratory infection (as outlined by this paper), a researcher need to perform an extensive literature review and database search. After all the datasets are collected, the researcher then need to bring in a bioinformatic team to perform a pooled analysis, which required advanced expertise due to the huge variability in technical platform, assay methods and normalization approach among different datasets. This bioinofrmatic work is extensive - if such work is outsourced to an external bioinformatician/company, the cost is in excessive of US$15,000 (our group has commissioned similar work in the past - hence our knowledge into the estimated cost). Here, the authors provides access to the analysis platform to the wider research community for free...an important step in democratising scientific data for the benefit of all researchers.
