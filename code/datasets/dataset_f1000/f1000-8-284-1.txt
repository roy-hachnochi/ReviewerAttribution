The paper by Bougarn et al. describes the use of an interactive web application, GXB (Speake et al.(2015) 1 ), for investigating the blood transcriptional response to viral respiratory tract infection and vaccination. A curated dataset collection was established for this purpose encompassing 31 datasets retrieved and selected from the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) public repository. The rationale for creating the dataset collection and the methodology used in the paper are clearly described. The functionalities of the GXB tool are well explained to the reader, as well as the quality control procedures adopted by the authors. However, the GEO datasets do not always provide detailed information on virus genotypes. Distinct RSV genotypes induce very different PBMC transcriptional responses (see, for instance, Rodriguez-Fernandez et al. 2017 2 ; and Vieira et al. 2019 3 ). The authors could insert a comment on this issue in their paper.
