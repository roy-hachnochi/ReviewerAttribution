The article is written in a clear and concise way. Illustrations perfectly complement the content. I have only 3 comments to the authors and I would like them to be taken into account in the revision: For unknown reasons, the authors introduced a new spelling of the name pseudoknot. Throughout the whole article, they use spelling with space: "pseudo knots". I haven't met such a form before. The authors of the article also used the term "pseudoknot" and not "pseudo knot" in their previous works. So, the spelling should be corrected. On page 3, the authors write about FR3D suite, but they do not cite the paper about the tool. Please, include the appropriate citation here. As the paper subject is calculating helix angles and stacking parameters, I would expect to see the formulas used to calculate these data (or - at least - the pseudocode showing how they are calculated). The lack of such details is serious negligence.
