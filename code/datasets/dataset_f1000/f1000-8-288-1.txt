This is a very important project and the authors have put a lot of effort to ensure a structured approach to self-evaluation of the organisation. It would be helpful to have more details on the methods: Did all four authors go through all questions and sections, or was it divided between them with at least two people independently having seen each section? Did individuals respond to the question based on their experience or knowledge, or did it additionally involve any review of policies and documents internally by them? I was not sure what you meant by “reasonably” – did you mean that PCORI has generally met the recommendation, even if there is room for improvement available (unlike “area of growth” which is a gap and needs improvement). The table provides a very good summary but in some cases like area 4 and 12, it isn’t clear where the areas of growth are, so would be helpful to explain it (which is the part I mentioned is missing from the data to be able to reproduce).
