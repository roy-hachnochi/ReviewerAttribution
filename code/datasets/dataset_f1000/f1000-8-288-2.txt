The study is a report of a self-audit done by one of the top 10 non-commercial funders in USA. The aim was to evaluate to what degree the funding agency follow international recommendations to improve the value of research investments. This self-audit is very important for a general audience as: Researchers can understand the context and environment of funding and the reason for the requirements related to application for funding Other funding agencies can see how to change their policies in order to improve the value of research investments Readers will understand the challenges related to improve the value of research investments The report should include a date for when to expect an update of the self-audit. An update - for example 2 to 3 years from now - would show the improvements and identify the biggest challenges related to improve the value of research investments. The method is only partly described as the reader is unable to see from where the 17 recommendations and 35 subrecommendations originates. None of the link leads the reader directly to the source. In addition, as the authors use another funders self-assessment method, the possible alterations or adjustments made in the present self-audit should be mentioned. If no alterations were done, this should also be mentioned. Using the same assessment method makes is possible to compare, and this could have been mentioned in the Discussion. There is an * and a â€  in Table 1, I cant find what these refers to. In conclusion: this is a very important and useful report of a self-audit (see above), and with the minor adjustments mentioned is should be published the sooner the better.
