The text presents a disease that, although uncommon, is extremely relevant because it affects pregnant women. The text presents a good introduction and clinical description, but it suffers in the part of the intervention, which is poor, without images, without description of the procedure, doses of radiation, contrast, difficulties or technical facilities. In short, there is a lot described in these themes (which after all is the main reason for reading this article). I believe that, if these suggestions are implemented, it will become a rich article, which will be widely read.
