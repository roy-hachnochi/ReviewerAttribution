Adiponectin is a secretory protein and the most plentiful adipokine in circulation. It induces insulin sensitivity, has anti-inflammation and anti-atherogenic effects. Its low concentration is associated with an increase in body fat mass, insulin resistance and dyslipidemia. Adiponectin gene polymorphism has been shown to affect protein production and thus, its plasma concentration. In this manuscript, the authors have studied association between +45TG polymorphism of the adiponectin gene (ADIPOQ) and risk of type 2 diabetes (DM2) and metabolic syndrome (MS) in subjects from Maracaibo municipality, Zulia state in Venezuela. Their data suggest that presence of the G allele at this position of adiponectin gene may protect the carrier individuals against MS and DM2, at least in this population. The study is well thought of and well written, worth indexing. However, since low adiponectin level is associated with DM2 and MS and adiponectin gene polymorphism affects protein production; in the case of sample availability and technical support , it would be interesting to measure the level of adiponectin in the studied population. In addition, the presence of G allele may have an effect on stability of adiponectin RNA and thus the protein level, thus, determining the level of adiponectin RNA by semiquantitative PCR may shed some light on protective role of G allele.
