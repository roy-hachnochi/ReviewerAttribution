The authors studied the relation of +45TG adiponectin gene SNP and the parameters of type 2 diabetes mellitus and metabolic syndrome a Venezuelan population. They found that the rare G allele of this polymorphism may be protective against most of those parameters. Comments: The title should be modified to: (Association of +45TG adiponectin gene polymorphism with type 2 diabetes mellitus and metabolic syndrome in a Venezuelan population). The language of the manuscript should be revised. Sometimes, the authors repeat sentences. For example, in the statistical analysis, the sentence (A p-value 0.05 was considered statistically significant) was repeated twice. I did not understand the purpose of Table 6. I think genotype and allele frequencies should have been compared in the study groups using chi square test to assess the relation of the polymorphism with the development of metabolic syndrome. In the legend of Figure 1, please define the genotype of each lane in the figure. Genotype TG is not clear at all due to the relatively faint bands. The conclusion is very long. I suggest summarizing it and mentioning only the important findings of the study.
