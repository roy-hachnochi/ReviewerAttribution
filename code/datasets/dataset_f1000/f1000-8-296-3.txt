The authors address an important problem, which is the need for systematic and reproducible approaches for assigning cell type labels based on single cell transcriptome data. They use three data sets with gold standard cell type annotations available and compare the performance of four computational tools on these data sets. The authors measure performance using ROC curves and plots of precision versus recall. They also assess performance over subsamples of the data used as reference gene expression patterns for cell types (either cell type-specific gene sets or cell type-specific expression profiles). In general, they found that all four methods perform reasonably well, although ORA and GSVA perform more consistently well across the three data sets. I do have some questions about the details of how the work was done. The answers to these questions are important for interpreting the results, reproducing the work, or extending it to include additional tools. Presumably the approach to creating the cell clusters, and how dense versus diffuse the clusters are, can have an impact on performance and confidence in the output? How exactly were clusters mapped to cell types? From Figure 1E, it appears that each of the four tools generates a numerical vector for each cell type that contains a score for each cluster, presumably corresponding to the likelihood that that cluster is of the corresponding cell type. Is a cluster always assigned to the cell type corresponding to its highest score? (presumably yes). In the example, each cell type and each cluster has only a single high score with all other scores being very small. What is the distribution of scores typically? Do clusters sometimes have multiple high scores? Were ties ever observed? Can multiple clusters map to the same cell type? Must a cluster be assigned to a cell type? Or could some remain unassigned? How were the performance curves generated? What parameter was varied?
