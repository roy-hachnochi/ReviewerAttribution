I think this paper is an excellent and important addition to the literature on the subject of teenage pregnancy in Nigeria. The abstract is informative and self-explanatory. The introduction provides a clear statement of the problem, relevant literature on the subject, and an adequate approach to the subject matter. The study is understandable, while the methods used are appropriate, nevertheless, the sample size is small and therefore the question of generalization is brought to bear. However, the procedures were adequately described; the more recently published study should be cited. The theory used for the study was well situated in the study and was able to explain why people acquire and maintain certain behavioural patterns, thus, as shown in the study, there are a positive influence role models has on teenagers and this, in turn, reduce risky behaviours that may lead to teenage pregnancy and childbirth. Results were presented with clarity and precision. The discussion was able to interpret the findings given the results obtained.
