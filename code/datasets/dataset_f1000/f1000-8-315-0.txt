This article reports findings from a randomised study within a host RCT assessing pens within trial invite packs as an incentive for recruitment. Recruitment to RCTs is often problematic and there is little evidence on effective methods to optimise recruitment, so research in this field is worthy. A Study within a Trial (SWAT), as undertaken by this study group, is a potentially effective and efficient way of generating robust evidence to redress the gap. The work is clearly presented, drawing upon evidence from key literature, and the methodology appears sound. I’m not wholly convinced by the authors' conclusion that more trials are needed given that this was a study with robust methodology undertaken in a population who ‘may’ be less mobile and therefore appreciative of a pen to hand, and given the existing literature already around pens as an incentive to participate in research. I would like to have seen a wider discussion on the use of incentives and initiatives more generally to optimise recruitment, with consideration of the reason for their findings and direction for future research. Overall though, a focus on strategies to optimise recruitment to RCTs to build on the evidence base should be encouraged and I therefore recommend this article be indexed.
