This article reports the findings of a study within a trial (SWaT), a methodological design currently promoted by at least one major funder within the UK. Many SWaTs, including this one, are aimed at improving participant recruitment to RCTs, the principal source of study failure. The study is well conducted and, in almost all regards, suitable to be indexed as is. I have only one observation, which regards the conclusion that more trials are warranted. It is not obvious to this reader that the background or results support this conclusion. In the background, the authors cite, as a warrant for this trial, Clark et al. 's paper (Clark et al. , 2001 1 ) in which a pen did not improve the response rate of a survey. In White et al. â€™s study (White et al. , 2005 2 ) the opposite was the case. In this study, the inclusion of a pen did not increase participant recruitment. 'The best of three' - the pen loses. So, if we're going to do this on a purely empirical basis, it would be useful to know at what point we will decide that the pen is ineffective and White's success can be put down to the play of chance. What are the 'stop-go' criteria? On the other hand, if we look at this more mechanistically, we could ask why an incentive which is insufficient to motivate people in this population group would be any more likely to motivate people in other population groups. Is there some plausible link between returning your form more quickly and consenting to study entry? It's not obvious to me that there is. Otherwise, the report is a useful addition to the growing evidence for what works in the conduct of trials and I recommend it to be indexed.
