This study, one of a series of reports by the group, is on the impact of sub-lethal concentrations of biocides on the ability of Escherichia coli to resist three different antibiotics, commonly used in the treatment of human diseases. Presently, the primary focus of research on antibiotic resistance is either on surveillance of drug resistance genes or on characterizing mechanisms of drug resistance. Research on anthropogenic agents which co-select for drug resistance or equip bacteria to resist drugs by alternative mechanisms is underexplored. Data presented in the manuscript addresses this knowledge gap. Previously published experiments protocols and analytical pipelines were used to generate data in this study. Significant findings are logically discussed, citing examples from available literature. Although I am not an expert in statistical analysis, the authors have used the standard methodology. The overall results on the statistical analyses were therefore easy to follow. Interpretation of results is convincing and supports conclusions presented. There is one typographic error in the manuscript. Page 5, right hand column first line: “pHJ01 transformands of BW25113…..” Please change “transformands” to “transformants”.
