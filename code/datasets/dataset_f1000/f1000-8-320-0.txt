Authors constructed a draft genome assembly by whole genome sequencing and identified SNPs from Tenualosa ilisha of the Bay of Bengal. This paper is well written, and that the analysis methods are generally appropriate. I have several suggestions to improve this manuscript as follows: Authors described that “We captured ten T. ilisha specimens from the seashore of the Bay of Bengal” in the Method section. But it is confusing because one individual was used finally in this study. Please revise this point. Authors said that three different ecological types of hilsa shad have been recognized in Bangladesh. What kind of ecotype is the individual used for genome assembly expected to have? This information may be important for future studies focusing genomic bases of the ecotype divergence. Authors described that “These results suggest higher completeness of the T. ilisha genome assembly of the Bay of Bengal.” It is a difficult problem whether it is higher completeness or not, but it seems that there are too many missing genes to say higher completeness. SNP typing was performed with a reference-free method. However, I think that it would be better to detect SNP using the reference constructed newly in this study (mapping and SNP calling by samtools etc). The SNP information (e.g. vcf file) based on the constructed reference genome should be useful for readers.
