The authors provide a new reference genome for the hilsa shad fish of significant commercial importance in the Bay of Bengal. The methods they use are standard and the resulting completeness analysis by BUSCO showed approximately 78% of core genes present. While it would be ideal to have added libraries for scaffolding the assembly (reads from 5-20kb inserts, or 10X Genomics reads, or Pacific Bioscience), this initial assembly will certainly allow some general comparisons and the building of genomic resources to better study the fish.
