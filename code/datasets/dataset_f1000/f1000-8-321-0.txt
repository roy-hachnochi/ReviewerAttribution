The authors addressed the major points of criticism from the original submission, with updates and additions to discuss the newer publication and discrepancies with this work. The unusual results and findings at odds with other CbAgo papers are discussed more, adding to the ability of the reader to consider this work in the field. I'd still suggest some different presentation on some of the data figures but the authors disagree and have supplemental versions with fuller images, so this can be attributed to a matter of preference. I feel the revised version is stronger and sufficient for indexing.
