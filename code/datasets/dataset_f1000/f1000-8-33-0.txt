While I disagree with the author that "The inclusion of non-EHEC is necessary as outgroup comparison groups and does not debunk the validity of the analysis pipeline". As including non-EHEC genomes in an EHEC core genome analysis does alter the results of the output EHEC core genome, which is evident by the author removing those genomes from the analysis. However, the author has done an excellent job of incorporating a huge amount of only EHEC serotype genomes into the analysis, and as a result has generated a much stronger study. The second version of this manuscript is tremendously better, and the author's additional work has made it significantly higher quality paper. The only comments are extremely minor: In the results and discussion section: Amino acid position 140 is ranked third with 34.9%, but the position 189 is 2nd with 24.4% frequency, these should be switched. I would also recommend switching the Figure 2A,B, and C around, so that they are introduced in order of A, B and C. Otherwise, no further comments.
