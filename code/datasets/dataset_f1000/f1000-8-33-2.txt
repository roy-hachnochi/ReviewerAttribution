The present manuscript presents a state-of-the-art pan genome analysis of EHEC strains and a subsequent analysis of the variation in sdiA. The analysis of sdiA could have been completed with simple KA/Ks analysis and compared to that of the core genome. For now, there is no connection between the two analysis, the authors could have simply performed the analysis of sdiA. Some mutants have frame shifts in the gene, this is not discussed. I think the author could try to connect more the two parts of the analysis.
