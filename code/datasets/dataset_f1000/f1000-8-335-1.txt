The manuscript entitled, ‘The effect of a one-time 15-minute guided meditation (Isha Kriya) on stress and mood disturbances among operating room professionals: a prospective interventional pilot study’ reports an interesting finding and is well written. Following comments will further help in improving the manuscript. Comments Out of the 362 participants who completed the PSS, the data is presented for 313 participants including 101 anesthesiologists, 61 surgeons and 151 nurses. Who were the remaining 49 participants? Why were they excluded from the study? In Table 1, the total number of participants in each column i.e. surgeons, anaesthesiologists and nurses under the categories/parameters such as age, race, ethnicity, clinical role and years of service does not match with number of participant i.e. 101 anesthesiologists, 61 surgeons and 151 nurses included in the study. For example, the sum of participants under surgeon column and race parameter is 70, which is more than the 61 surgeons who had completed the PSS.
