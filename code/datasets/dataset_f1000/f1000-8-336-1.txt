Paradoxical effects of anti-cytokine therapy is a very important area that the authors have highlighted in this case study. As has been well documented, the use of therapies, such as anti-TNF, although groundbreaking does raise a multitude of issues - including higher risk to infections - specifically tuberculosis. The authors have documented well that the patient who was on anti-IL-17 therapy did not suffer from any infections, an important advantage of using secukinumab. Some of the points that could have been elaborated: Would decreasing the dosage of the drug (from 150mg every 4 weeks) been able to reduce the ACH like eruption along with treating PsA? It would be useful if the authors could reference successful cases, if any documented, where the drug has been functional at lower doses. A cytokine imbalance leading to an increase in TNF during secukinumab treatment has been suggested - is there corroborating evidence that implies this? If blood samples from the patient has been saved, can systemic levels of TNF be assayed for? The authors raised an excellent point about underlying genetics contributing to the potential cytokine imbalance. This might be a very crucial finding and if so, could the authors highlight the nature of the polymorphisms to look for in future cases?
