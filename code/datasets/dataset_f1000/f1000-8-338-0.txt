The authors have attempted to quantify the magnitude of misclassification among new smear positive pulmonary TB patients. In the current scenario of universal DST and removal of Category II regimen, this information may not of much value. Nevertheless, the 11% misclassification emphasizes the importance of appropriate history taking which could benefit patient management. Though new and previously treated patients are treated with the same 6-month daily regimen if found to be drug sensitive the distinction based on previous treatment would be important to analyse the response to treatment in future. The major limitation of this study is that it was not planned but rather incidental as mentioned by the authors. Hence, the reasons for such misclassification from patient and provider perspective which could have added more value to the study is lacking. The findings are worth communicating as a Brief communication article. Some clarifications are requested on the following: What was the time interval between registration for treatment and the patient interview The rationale for considering distance from DMC as a factor for misclassification
