This paper showed basically the confirmation of the previous report of the POEM paper. However, because this report showed that the relationships between pollen tube contents and seed coat formation statistically, including the data for agl62 mutants, they clearly confirmed that almost all ovules started seed coat formation without fertilization but just required for the pollen tube contents. I believe this report is a sort of important discoveries in the plant science field and will contribute to further research for seed coat formation in angiosperms. Introduction: At the introduction part, it is clear what they need to understand and what sorts of approach were taken. I believe their approach conducted here is adequate and leads to a neat statistics for seed coat initiation and completion study. Results and Discussion: I agree with the first reviewerâ€™s comment. Authors could improve the paper if they change the colors for Fig. 1. However, I think this change is not mandatory because if authors change the color dramatically, it could be too showy. I thought current style looks fair enough. I also agree with the first reviewer's comment that because the study of agl62 was not the authors study, "our previous agl62 data" sounds strange. But this is just a very minor correction to be done. Data availability: I think the data title agl61-3v. tif is wrong. Title should be "agl62-3v".
