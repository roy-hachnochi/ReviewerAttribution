Normal seed formation required for the birth of the progeny is a critical phenomenon for plant production and breeding field. This research note reports that the involvements of the fertilization and the normal endosperm development in seed coat formation. First, the involvement of the pollen tube contents was analyzed showing the reproducibility of their previous report. Also, it was indicated that normal endosperm development is required for successive seed coat formation, using agl62 mutant. Introduction Authors described constructively what they wanted to clarify. The experimental design and the statistical analysis performed in this study were enough to examine the questions. Results and Discussion In the present state, the descriptions and the graph (Fig.1E) were confusing to understand the results. How about using different colors for each SF, VSF, AS, and VSP. Also, if the graph-bars obtained with the same female parent-genotype are grouped and indicated, it would be helpful for easy comparing the results. As a conclusion, the authors claimed that "for completion of normal seed formation, normal endosperm formation is required in addition to normal fertilization." In the previous studies, the aborted seed caused by the single fertilization of the central cell seemed to have developed the seed coat (kokopelli, gex2, dmp9 mutants, etc...). These studies are supportive of the authors' claim, but the endosperm of these mutants was not normal as the wild type seed. Therefore, how about describing "normal endosperm 'development' is required for seed coat formation." As a minor point, authors describe the previous study of agl62 (Kang et al., 2008) 1 as 'our previous....' but no same authors in this paper. Overall, the content of this research note is logically written. If the points described above are re-considered, it would be improved.
