In the manuscript entitled "Case Report: A rare cause of vaginal bleeding at Keren Zonal Referral Hospital, Eritrea", the authors have described vaginal bleeding. This manuscript is interesting and educational, but there is no figure related to the leech, that should be added. By the way, there are some grammatical and spelling errors in English too that should be corrected by an expert. Abstract: “This report presents the case of a 65-year-old woman who presented to Keren Regional Referral Hospital, Eritrea, with vaginal bleeding of two and half weeks duration, dizziness and fatigue. On the day of her admission complete blood cell count and speculum exam were done and she was diagnosed with anaemia due to cervical leech infestation”. The sentences are unclear and need revision. The conclusion should be revised according to study aim again. Hence, “Routine speculum exam for vaginal bleeding is recommended in cases with history of holy water or springs visits to prevent unnecessary diagnostic tests and for rapid management” to be omitted. Introduction: “…more frequently found in tropical and subtropical areas”, this sentence needs another newer reference. Please add this 1 . “If it is not diagnosed as early …. Anaemia and shock” the sentences are unclear and needs a revision. Discussion: This section should be revised as predisposing factors to leeches in other studies. The conclusion should be revised according to study aim and the results again.
