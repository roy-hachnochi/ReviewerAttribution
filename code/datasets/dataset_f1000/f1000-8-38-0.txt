This is a useful paper for demonstrating and discussing how an established formula could be used for calculating all possible pairs of comparisons for interventions in a network meta-analysis. Thus, reviewers would be able to find out how many potential comparisons have not been carried out. I have some minor suggestions numbered from 1) to 4): In the abstract the following sentence should be amended for clarity perhaps as follows: “A total of 133 trials included in the network generated 163 comparisons (16 unique direct comparisons for 8 interventions)”. Amendment: “A total of 133 trials of 8 interventions were selected which included 163 comparisons. The network of these showed 16 unique direct comparisons.”. On page 2, it says that N is a triangular number. Either this point is not relevant, or why being a triangular number is important should be described. I think they should say that the formula they have used is an established formula from combinatorics for calculating number of pairs for a number of items in a set. On page 3 under “Comparisons in network meta-analysis plots”, line 2 and line 11 “though” should be changed to "through".
