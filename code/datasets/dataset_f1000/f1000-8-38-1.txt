In my opinion, this is a novel approach which allows the quantification of comparators in trials and network meta-analyses. Following on from this, the comparators which are possible versus how many were reported can be discussed in further depth. This formula has great applicability in terms of network meta-analysis methodology which is still very much a developing area. Some very minor points; Please add a table which demonstrates the use of the formula to quantify how many comparators are possible for trials from 2 interventions up to 10. Pg 3, paragraph with the heading 'Reported comparisons within the trials' - line 2 change 'there to 'the'. Explanation of Figue 4 in text is not clear.
