High frequency jet ventilation (HFJV) is an alternative method to conventional ventilation which is known to minimize movement of the thorax and abdomen what finally could facilitate surgical procedures. The aim of the study of the revised manuscript was to analyze usefulness, efficacy and safety of HFJV during stereotactic ablation of liver tumors with particular emphasis on gas exchange. The study was performed on 25 patients with malignant liver tumors. In conclusions, authors demonstrated possibility and benefits of HFJV’s usage during the liver’s surgical procedures. However, influence of some disadvantages on patients’ gas exchange was also critically discussed. In general the work presents interesting results and, in my opinion, could be accepted.
