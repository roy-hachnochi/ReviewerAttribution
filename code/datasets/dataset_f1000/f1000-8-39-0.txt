This is a very useful article and will have policy implications especially in countries with medium to high HIV/AIDS prevalence. The results advocate the importance of the need of support from social agencies and development sectors for the patients of HIV/AIDS to improve their quality of life. I believe the results of their article can be used as a guiding principal. The title needs to be rephrased. You may avoid words such as "factors influencing" and "a cross sectional study" – there is no need to put in abbreviations in the title. I believe an appropriate title would be: “Quality of life among elderly caregivers of people living with HIV/AIDS in Phayao Province, Thailand". The article is otherwise well written and the study design and the statistical methods employed are correct.
