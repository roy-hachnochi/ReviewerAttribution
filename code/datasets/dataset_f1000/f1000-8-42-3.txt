The authors describe a new REST API as an interface to the well-established Orthologous Matrix database. As identifying and evaluating orthologs is a central step in many biological analyses, an easy way to query the over 2,100 species in OMA is highly valuable. To further facilitate querying the data through their API, the authors present packages for R and Python. The API is well documented on the OMA website and the R package comes with vignettes describing different use cases. The manuscript presented here focuses on the OmaDB R-package and showcases some of its functions. Being somewhat "ahead of it's time", the R package as described in the manuscript requires both the development version of R (v3.6) and Bioconductor (v3.9). The package installation instructions at the beginning of the manuscript only glances over it, more complete instructions are only found in the Software availability section at the end. We recommend including more explicit warnings/instructions about the required versions at the beginning, otherwise potential users might be confused when trying to follow along with the examples given in the manuscript (As happened to us and it took us some time to figure out what's going on). While the Python package is not extensively discussed in this manuscript, the authors provide a Binder that can be used to reproduce the same analyses using Python. We recommend putting a link to it ( https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/DessimozLab/pyomadb/master?filepath=examples%2Fpyomadb-examples.ipynb ) in the manuscript, to help users with taking up the Python library. We welcome the switch from the SOAP API to a more modern REST implementation and the provided packages to interface with the API will be valuable for a lot of researchers working with orthologs.
