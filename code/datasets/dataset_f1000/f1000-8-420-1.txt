Most comments are appropriately addressed by the authors. Please see minor comments below: The aims in the last paragraph of introduction should be revised, it is not very clear that the target population is elderly people with normal pure tone audiogram who complain of speech in noise difficulties. The title should be revised too:'... elderly listeners with speech in noise difficulty.." Citation is needed for the following sentence: 'In addition, it has been shown that auditory spatial processing ability is lower in the elderly with normal hearing than in young people.' 'Normal hearing' in the text should be changed to 'normal pure tone audiogram'. 'auditory thresholds ≤25dB within the 250–8000Hz frequency range for ensuring the normal pure tone audiogram' as per ASHA protocol? 'normal peripheral hearing' in the inclusion criteria section should be removed. 'complaint about speech in noise perception difficulties' as judged by SSQ?
