Authors have described a case of young woman presenting with spontaneous rupture of a renal sarcoma managed by RA partial nephrectomy. The management was unconventional as the standard approach to such a case is to manage conservatively as they did in the first few days, waiting for the resolution of hematoma and stabilization of the kidney function. Once the serum creatinine is normal she can be imaged either with contrast enhanced CT or MRU or contrast enhanced MRI. If the diagnosis is still uncertain a percutaneous biopsy and followed by definitive managment. The definitive managment, as the authors also pointed out is radical nephrectomy. The differential diagnoses included anaplastic sarcoma of the kidney (ASK), anaplastic Wilms tumor, mesenchymal chondrosarcoma, sarcomatoid renal cell carcinoma, clear cell sarcoma of the kidney, rhabdoid tumor of the kidney, congenital mesoblastic nephroma, and synovial sarcoma. The managment is highly dependent of the histology(Chen and Liao. Ci Ji Yi Xue Za Zhi. 2019 Apr-Jun;31(2):129-132 1 ) My suggestions to the authors are: Justify the indication of RA partial prior to establishing a diagnosis in a stable patient. Discuss the histopathological aspects of the tumor and how to differentiate various types of sarcoma. How the authors intend to follow up patient considering her young age. Is there a role of re biopsy of the tumor bed, for how long should the CT contrast or MRI scan be done. Are there any recommendations for just doing ultrasound if the CT or MRI are normal after first year.
