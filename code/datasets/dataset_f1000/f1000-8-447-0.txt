Although the use of magnesium sulfate in preeclampsia and eclampsia is indeed a very important issue, the study is very small, it was conducted in a single center, the objectives are not clearly defined, the sample size has not been calculated, the data collection was performed for only 4 months and the study fails to add any new finding to the current state of the art. If we consider for example the outcome "seizure recurrence", which occurred at 7% of patients, considering a confidence level of 95% and an absolute precision of 2%, a sample size of 625 patients would be required. The effectiveness of magnesium sulfate for seizure prevention and control in patients with preeclampsia and eclampsia has already been demonstrated in solid randomized controlled trials and systematic reviews available from the Cochrane Library, so an observational study would have to provide important additional information to be considered valid. With unclear objectives and inconsistent methods, without adequate presentation of the analysis variables, this is an important concern. I also question a fact that seems very strange to me, only 39% of the patients had the loading dose of magnesium sulfate administered. How is this possible? A maintenance dose can only be done without an loading dose. If this was a prospective study it is a very serious and ethically unjustified mistake because this problem being identified the authors would have to warn the clinical staff and provide the patient with the best available treatment. The study also does not follow STROBE recommendations. Therefore, I do not recommend its indexing.
