This is a timely and well written review on associative memory from an expert. The author has been working on this topic for many years, and this extensive review is a very nice summary of the field. All three figures are well presented. I also have a few comments: The manuscript will be greatly improved by including a table or a chart to show historic perspective (e.g., milestones) of the concept development by different groups. It is interesting to discuss specific miRNAs involved in this process. It will help the readers if the author can include an illustration or a figure to show how specific miRNAs regulate associative memory via specific molecular targets. Overall, discussion on molecular mechanisms of associative memory could be strengthened. People often say “no pain, no gain” 1 . Is this related to associative memory? The author discussed some pathological conditions. After anesthesia, there is cognitive decline, such as delirium, especially postoperative delirium in elderly. Is this a related pathological condition?
