The authors tried to detect positive selection in mtDNA coding proteins within 11 species of darters, using a selection model, MEME and FEL method. they found some positive selection signals with six genes, and they detected one common site in CYTB using different methods. Here are a couple of pieces of suggestion for the paper: This paper should be able to present a better biological question and answers to it, such as evolutionary constraints acted on the mtDNA of darters with different habitats. If they could take a distinct environmental factor as evolutionary constraint and found their effects on the evolution of the darters, it will make this paper more biologically meaningful. To test adaptive evolution, I suggest the author try models in codeml package in PAML, so they could test if the evolutionary rate differs for different species/lineages, and which gene(s) are under positive selection in the lineages of interest 1 . Furthermore, they could use RELAX to test if the branches of interest is under relaxed selection or intensified selection 2 . They could project the sites under positive selection to the 3D models of the proteins, which will show the effect of the evolution events at protein level. Furthermore, if they could link the substitution of amino acids to the biological function of the proteins, the paper will be more attractive. I think the authors still need to do a lot of work.
