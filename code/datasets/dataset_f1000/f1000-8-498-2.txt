The majority of the comments are addressed. However, please find a few minor comments that need your attention: In Study settings: first paragraph, consider using "catchment area" or any other word rather than "drainage". Please rephrase the statement. In conclusion: I am skeptical about the words "diagnostic yield" - the study was not designed to measure the diagnostic yield. Please rephrase the sentence. Thank you with regards, Sharath BN
