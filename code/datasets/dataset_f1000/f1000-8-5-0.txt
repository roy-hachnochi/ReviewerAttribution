Avoiding the nocebo effect may have significant clinical implications by improving treatment effect and reducing potential side effects. In this manuscript, the author discusses basic and clinical studies on nocebo effect and concludes with recommendations on avoiding this negative effect. This is a well-written manuscript. My comments are as follows: Not informing patients about negative treatment information, such as potential side effects or the possibility of no treatment response, may significantly reduce the nocebo effect. A critical issue here is how to strike a balance between telling the truth and not telling patients negative information. This can be very challenging as both law and ethics are involved. Thus, the author may also want to discuss the role of law, ethics, and culture in disclosing negative information that may produce the nocebo effect. The author may want to include more brain imaging studies on nocebo and placebo effects, as well as the role of consciousness in these effects. Better understanding the brain mechanism underlying the nocebo effect and how this effect may be produced unconsciously may deepen our understanding of this important phenomenon.
