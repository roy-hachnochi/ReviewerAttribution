This is a well-written short summary of the studies on a very important issue which deserves much more attention than it actually gets. I have only two major concerns. First, the paper is focused mainly on verbal information as a source of the nocebo. Although I do agree that it is the most common source of the nocebo effect in clinical practice and clinical trials, two other sources are also important and their role should be discussed, i.e. previous experience (classical conditioning) and observation of other patients/participants of clinical trials (see for example 1). Especially, the role of those two additional sources should be included in the recommendations and conclusions sections of the paper. Second, through the paper the nocebo effect is discussed mainly in terms of negative expectations, however, it is only one of the explanatory mechanisms of the nocebo effect. Although nocebo effects induced by verbal information and observational learning are usually mediated by expectations, there is growing evidence that the nocebo effect induced by classical conditioning may not always be mediated by expectations (see references 2-8). Thus, I would rather avoid discussing the nocebo effect as the result of sole negative expectancies as well as I would avoid defining it in terms of negative expectations.
