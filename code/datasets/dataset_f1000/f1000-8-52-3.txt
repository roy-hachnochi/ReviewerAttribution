In the manuscript “Conserved structure of the NPR1 gene distal promoter isolated from a chili pepper (Capsicum annuum L.) in West Sumatera”, Dr. Jamsari Jamsari and co-authors offer us the structure of the distal promoter of the NPR1 gene, which will lay a foundation for the understanding of the mechanisms of pepper resistance to viral infection. But there are some issues that need to be explained: The PD_CbNPR1 is cloned by gene walking approach, which needs to be confirmed by PCR amplification with a full-length primer pair. The authors suggest that the structure of PD_CbNPR1 is conservative based on the comparison with the reference gene (Figure 2) and on the cis-element distribution (Figure 3). I think that this is not enough. The comparison of nucleotide sequences among distal promoters from several different plant species should be performed. The PD_CbNPR1 is amplified from a pepper variety with viral susceptibility. I suggest the authors compare the PD sequences between virus susceptible and resistant varieties, which is beneficial to understanding the mechanisms of pepper resistance to viral infection.
