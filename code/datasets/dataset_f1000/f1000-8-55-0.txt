Lyassu et al. describe a rare case of adult small bowel-small bowel intussusception caused by an intestinal hemangioma that was treated with surgical resection. The diagnosis was challenging because of the lack of institutional availability of cross-sectional imaging (CT/MRI). It would be informative to add an image of the abdominal x-ray showing air-fluid levels. Also, it is unclear what the "pockets of fluid collections" visualized on abdominal ultrasound represent. It would be interesting to show histopathological correlation of the intestinal hemangioma (HE section). There are only a handful of such cases causing intussusception in the literature, and the authors may want to summarize this experience in the discussion. Figure 1. legend should read "bowel", rather than "bowl".
