This manuscript is an important contribution to the field of antibiotic resistance development in Neisseria gonorrhoeae . The "NG Morbidostat" detailed by the authors has many advantages for studies on evolution of antibiotic resistance in culture. The construction and use of the system is well described. I have a few technical questions that require the attention of the authors: Please indicate the colony type of the two strains employed (state of piliation and opacity). For azithromycin, Etest strips can give variable results so it is important to verify the deduced MIC by the more accepted agar dilution method. Also, was the Etest assay performed on outgrowth of single colonies or the batch culture? Did the authors check single colonies? It is not clear as to why blood agar plates were employed as opposed to the more conventional GC agar? It would seem that the progression in azithromycin MICs represented initial mutations in the mtr locus followed by 23S rRNA genes, This could be checked quickly by PCR/sequencing.
