Urrunaga-Pastor and co-authors evaluated the performance of the physical performance of the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) in older adults living in 11 Peruvian high Andean communities. This work has a clear objective; the results are interesting and provide novel information in these regions of Peru with very particular characteristics given the geographical location and the height above sea level. I consider statistical analysis is proper to a cross sectional study using Poisson regression and was reported prevalence ratio with their confidence intervals.
