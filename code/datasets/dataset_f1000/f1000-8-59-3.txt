This work has a clear objective. The lack of studies in communities far from the big cities will always be a solid point to support the publication of these studies. The strength of the study is that it includes the possibility of studying the physical performance in populations with height above sea level greater than 2500 meters. I have some considerations to correct in the methodology: I understand that the authors preferred to use a Poisson regression due to the fact that the characteristics of the dependent variable (physical performance) were adequate (by distribution?) to prefer this analysis regression, however it should be specifically noted and included why they did not use logistic regression if the dependent variable presented only had two categories. On the other hand, include if medical doctors and medical students were compared with any statistical test to corroborate concordance. Do the authors have information about the migration of those with high comorbidity? The above could explain why a low frequency of chronic diseases and good performance were found. Include some result of the final Poisson regression model that allows to know if the fit of model regression were adequate to present the results obtained. In conclusion, the manuscript must be accepted with some corrections that the authors must consider, the results are interesting and provide novel information in these regions of Peru.
