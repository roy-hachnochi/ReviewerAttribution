The paper provides some valuable insights into the transmission of HIV in India. The findings are consistent with other international studies in showing that an increased number of lifetime sexual partners and lower condom use is associated with higher HIV prevalence. It also confirms other ecological studies showing an inverse relationship between circumcision rate and HIV prevalence. The data for the study was obtained from the NFHS-4 survey and in the methods section, where you discuss ethics, could you clarify that it is the survey that had ethical approval rather than this study. I did have some difficulty following the geography outlined in the paper. In Figure 1, some of the circles for union territories appear not to be associated with any particular area (e.g. DN). There is double labelling for DD and PY and LD is not in the legend. In the text there was mention of 11 groups of states which should have appeared in Table 2 but there are only five states mentioned in this table. Table 4 might be the more appropriate table. Table 2 and Table 3 are almost identical with only the last row different - you could probably get rid of one table by combining them. In the discussion, whilst I accept that there is overlap of the circumcision rates between various states with high and low HIV prevalence I don't think there is enough data available in the study to support the contention that circumcision is not an important factor. I think the study supports high-risk sex and condom use as being the most important factors but in states where circumcision rates are low and HIV prevalence high - there should be some consideration of the role of circumcision in the public health response to HIV.
