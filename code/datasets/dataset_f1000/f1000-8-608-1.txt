The paper investigated KM awareness among tertiary level institutions. Respondents were academics. Data were collected appropriately. However, the paper seems to be missing theoretical framework.

Some unique constructs may play important role in the awareness level of KM in Nigeria. A detail lit review may help to determine this.
