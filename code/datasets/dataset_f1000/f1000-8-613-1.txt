The authors presented report on their NGS study on anaplastic ependymoma grade III by Ion Proton next generation DNA sequencing. The article looks interesting, and is well written. Since this report is from a single case, a necessary correction has to be made in the material section. Also, the authors need to mention the tumor content of the FFPE block which was taken for the NGS analysis. I feel, the author need to cut down on the text significantly while explaining NGS data analysis and variant identification statistics. There is too much of information which is not required. The authors have already shared the coverage analysis report which is sufficient. Except for IDH1 mutation, other variants are non significant and hence do not add much value clinically. Identification of FLT3 p.(Val592Val) does not carry any meaning unless and until the authors show the functional impact of this variant. Overall, good article but the text needs to be significantly cut down considering this to be a single case report.
