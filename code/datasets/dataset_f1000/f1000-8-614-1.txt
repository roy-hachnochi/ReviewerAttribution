The following points should be clarified before I would consider this article to be “scientifically sound”. Can we please give details for the following statement: Although cannabis is illegal, the number of cannabis users is increasing throughout the country 12 . Please indicate also how solid the underlying data are. To my knowledge, 0.2% of the Thai general population used cannabis in the last year (Angkurawaranon et al. , 2018 1 ), and it would be very hard to be sure about increases in use. The original sampling is not at all clear. What is a “registered user” in Thailand? Registered where? Please indicate exactly this process and what potential biases it may introduce. It is also not clear if these people were medical cannabis users or not. The biggest problem seems to me that it is not at all clear for which group the results are representative or typical? Less than 20% of the original sample was re-interviewed, and it is not even clear what the original sample stood for. So the discussion needs to focus on this question way better. Who were the people who consented to follow-up and why? Then, the role of stigma, which may be the most important part of the study, should be clarified. The used scale needs to be described in greater detail, and the results need to be better contextualized. No causal language should be used. The authors report some perceived associations, and this should be described as such. With respect to the gateway drug, if I am not mistaken, the conclusions are based on N=3 cases. Much more caution in the interpretation is necessary. The authors speak about cannabis-related disease. Please define, what disease groups were considered as cannabis related. Given all of the above, the authors should make a detailed limitations section in the discussion and based on this state, what conclusions can be drawn from the study with what uncertainty.
