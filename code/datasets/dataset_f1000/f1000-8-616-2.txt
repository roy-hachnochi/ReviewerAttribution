[Suggestions] I recognized the revised parts in the Abstract (Background) as follows; "However, the study regarding the identification and distribution of oral Veillonella are limited. The oral Veillonella community may affected by the differences in geographical location, age, diet, lifestyle, socio-economic status and oral hygiene status." I think that the above-mentioned parts should be included in the Introduction, but I was unable to find the revised parts. The authors need to revise the Introduction, like as in the Abstract. [Typographical errors] Introduction (6th paragraph) "difficult to idnetify" should read "difficult to identify".
