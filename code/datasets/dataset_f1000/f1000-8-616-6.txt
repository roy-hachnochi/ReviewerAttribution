This study is good for identification and phylogenetic analysis of oral Veillonella species isolated from saliva samples of children in Japan. The aim of this study was to analyze the composition and proportion of oral Veillonella species in the saliva of Japanese children compared to previous studies in Thailand. The manuscript is certainly well written but I have some major concerns on the data analysis: The number of samples in this study was fewer (15 children) compared to the number of samples in the previous study from Thailand (107 children). It is suggested that the analysis uses proportions so that it can describe the oral Veillonella species according to the number of samples. To find out the comparison of the results of this study with the results of a previous study from Thailand, a correlation analysis is suggested. It is also necessary to add the results of a correlation analysis between the results of Veillonella 's oral identification and oral health status. Minor comment: Some references used are older than 10 years. I suggest to use current references from at least the last 10 years.
