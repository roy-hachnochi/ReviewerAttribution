The authors describe an interesting and unique case of submucosal basal cell adenoma in the esophagus presenting as a symptomatic esophageal nodule, and diagnosed when resected by endoscopic submucosal dissection. Endoscopic submucosal dissection is an innovative minimally invasive technique for resection of early cancers of gastrointestinal tract. It became popular in Japan in early 2000 for treatment of superficial gastric cancers and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. It has gained momentum in other parts of the world for treatment of early superficial neoplastic lesions of the gastrointestinal tract. A byproduct is incidental detection of rare and unique submucosal lesions at unusual sites that present as a nodule and are amenable to endoscopic resection, such as this case. The diagnosis rests on the histopathological description and supportive images. The histopathological description and the images provided in the case report to support the diagnosis are not very clear. Good quality microscopic description accompanied with quality images will enhance the quality of the submission. Only one hematoxylin and eosin (HE) stained image is provided. Addition of a couple of more HE stained images that depict clear unequivocal pathology of this lesion as basal cell adenoma will help improve the case report.
