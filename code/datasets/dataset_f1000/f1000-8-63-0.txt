This study is about the antimicrobial potential of Xylocarpus granatum leaf extracts against tiger shrimp post-larvae pathogens i.e. Vibrio harveyi and Saprolegnia sp. Comments: Authenticity of test organisms should be confirmed. Did the authors perform any additional experiments to decide the concentration of bacteria for infection? In methods, (‘Treatment’ section) the sentence “The treatments were leaf extract, extracted with ethanol solvent, distilled water or seawater solvent” is confusing. Tables 2-5 contain various values, which should be presented with standard deviation. The authors concluded that “the ethanol and distilled water leaf extract at concentrations of 800 and 1,000 ppm exhibited higher activity in inhibiting and reducing the infection of V. harveyi and Saprolegnia sp. than antibiotics.” Effective concentration of antibiotic should also be mentioned here. If possible, provide the picture showing the difference between infected and extract-treated shrimp.
