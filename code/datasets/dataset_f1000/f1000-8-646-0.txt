The revised version is clearly more focused and directed to researchers is life science, although its application is much wider. It has been shortened and some figure removed. Discussions are more objective and some technicalities corrected. Some more general discussions that have been suggested in the first review were simply added as assertions. This helps keep the paper compact, which is understandable. As a second notice, though, we still think that the third module could be discussed in more depth. The toolbox provides five (“four plus one”) methods to analyze the network robustness (from a structural controllability/observability point of view) and to place driver/sensor in such a way that the relative degree of the network system does not exceed a specified threshold. Although the relevance of the third module is now more well-justified, it is not yet clear what is the difference between these five methods. What are the pros and cons of each method? How can this be perceived in the studied neural network of C. elegans ? We found no compatibility issues with Octave in this version. Minor problems: In the definition of the observability matrix there is a “^” missing. The last T within the square brackets should be a transpose. “Since the generated measures can be presented by large tables, they are attached in Excel format to the toolbox [9].” Ref. [9] is a link to the old toolbox (in Zenodo website). It would be nice to link the site with current version (GitHub).
