 In Abstract There was no recommendation in conclusion section, or is there a word limit for the abstract? In the keywords: there was no mention of "evaluation factors" in the abstract, and what do you mean by "Elderly rural" or "association"? In Introduction 2nd paragraph; "In Thailand, recent surveys …" and last line in that paragraph "Recent research …", these two lines should shift to the conclusion section. In Methods What about the sampling procedure? In Data Collection Face to face interviews of 40 minutes and the results showed that 62% have no education, is it possible that it took too much time to get the right answers. What about their responses? This survey was pre-tested and validated outside of the study, so what are the operational definitions from this? In Results 67% of participants were women (meaning that 33% were men). But in Table 1, alcohol consumption was 45.4%. Does this mean all the men has alcohol consumption and few of elderly women has alcohol consumption? 50% of the participants were single but in the discussion, more than half of the elderly participants had a low level of stress management and were living with their grandchildren. And in the results about two thirds (69%) of participants lived with family members. What about these two connections? In Table 4, why the sample is 402 and why not 403? In Conclusion No recommendation or other relevant evidence for association? How about recommendations for the next study? In References No. 28 reference is where citations in manuscript? Overall Conclusions Please answer my questions and correct for some facts. Its just minor corrections.
