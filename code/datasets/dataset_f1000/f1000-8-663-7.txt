How many of the NCSE were focal versus generalized? Did not the mortality vary with etiology of NCSE and PDs? I would add in the final section on limitations of the study that there is perforce selection bias as the EEG techs were not available during certain periods (if I remember, overnight and other times) and this should be stated. Possibly an EEG example of NCSE should be provided.
