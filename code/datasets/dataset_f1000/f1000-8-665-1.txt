The work by Cherfils and Navaza proposes to use the central sections from cryo-EM images, rather than the reconstructed maps or its associated Fourier coefficients, as the data for model refinement and validation. To achieve it, the section orientation and the origin shift that centers the section are incorporated in the evaluation of the two-dimensional Fourier coefficients of the model. In this way cryo-EM refinement can become similar to X-ray crystallography refinement. This is a very interesting proposal that could provide (implementation pending) an elegant approach to overcome major limitations in the accuracy and quality of the cryo-EM models obtained with the available methodologies. It might be good if authors could add some considerations about: Noise in the individual cryo-EM sections could be high, which would degrade the accuracy of the observed two-dimensional Fourier coefficients. How these (large) errors could affect to the proposed refinement approach? With orientation and translation of individual sections applied to the model, how the “improved” experimental maps can be efficiently computed?
