The authors identified that a novel deleterious missense variant is causal to hypomagnesemia. They found this variant from a pediatric patient in consanguineous family. Both parents are heterozyous carriers while the patient is homozygoty carrier. They inferred the pathogenicity of this variant using in silico method. This variant is never seen in any large population datasets, it is predicted to be deleterious using various prediction tools. This variant is also indicated disrupting stabilising TRP domain from the protein structure analysis tool. The call is also verified to be true using chromatogram. Most importantly, TRPM6 has been reported to be associated with hypomagnesemia. Therefore, I agree with the authors conclusion, this variant is a causal variant to this patient.
