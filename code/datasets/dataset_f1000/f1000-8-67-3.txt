As the authors said "This study has moved channeling research forwards by evaluating physiological measure differences between the channeling and no-channeling states using rigorous controlled methods". A further strength of this study is the test of the reliability of their physiological measures. Main comments: Both in the introduction and the discussion of their study, it is important to make explicit the exploratory approach for the choice of the variables and their parameters, unless pre-defined in the grant protocol of the funding institution. In this case, the authors should make this document available. The procedure to read stories both in non-channeling and channeling condition is unusual and should comment a little bit further in particular considering how to convince the purported entity to read a story chosen by the experimenters. The data presented in Table 3, shows a clear trend from session 1 to 3 that, in my view, is important to take in consideration. As for all other variables, add the descriptive statistics of the ECG and respiration data. The difference in the GSR variable must be considered given the non trivial difference and not ignored simply because the p value exceed the conventional cutoff of .05. In fact, as acknowledged by the authors, the statistical power with only 13 participants is not sufficient to detect medium to small effect size differences. For the EEG data, I wonder whether it could be more appropriate to cluster the 64 channels in order to investigate specific regions of interest, enhancing the statistical power of the statistics. Minor comments: Channel or channeler? I wonder whether to use channeler instead of channel could be more precise in conveying the difference between the agent and his/her action, e.g. in the sentence "Well-known trance channels primarily channel one being"
