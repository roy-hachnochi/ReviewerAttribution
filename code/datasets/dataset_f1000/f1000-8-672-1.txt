The manuscript develop a science mapping analysis of the physical activity on children and the effect in their quality of life. To do that, VOSViewer software tool is employed. In general, the paper is well organised and written. Moreover, the software tool is appropriate for this analysis and authors use it properly. In what follows, some comments and suggestions are listed: I miss some references to the origins of co-word analysis, science mapping, or generally, science of science. Authors focus too much on bibliometrics on health, but there are important references out of this field. Moreover, authors should cite some recent bibliometric studies developed in health, for example in cancer, rehabilitations, etc. The reference to VOSViewer is incorrect. Author should cite the paper where the software is presented. Figure 2 is confusing. Authors should provide other kind of visualisation. Also, authors should describe better the conceptual evolution of this research field. Discussion should be better described. At this moments it is just a sequence of itemises. Author should provided a clear speech. Conclusions are just a summary of the paper.
