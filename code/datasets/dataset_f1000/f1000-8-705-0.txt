This study explores the optimal duration of video recording in a post-discharge eLearning platform for cardiac patients. The purpose of the study is important in order to understand the attention span of patients, providing digital educational media for secondary prevention of CVD. The scope of the study and the aim is very simple and limited to test patients' retention. The videos were divided into two groups based on their duration. The short group included videos with duration 100 sec and the long group included videos with duration 100 sec. The video retention rate was defined as the ratio between video viewing time and total video duration. Results showed mean values were not significantly different in retention rate, however, the variance was higher in the long video clip group. The aim and the study are clear, however, the methodology and results analysis are not as so. Increase in retention rate is the primary goal and the null hypothesis, however, it's not demonstrated in the results. Please consolidate the means to show increased retention. If variance in retention is the primary end point, please clarify it or other methods to test video retention. Statistical analysis should be reconsidered, using more than two groups with 100 sec cut off (e.g. short/intermediate/long). Fig 4 is not clear. Provide more data about the procedures in the methods. The authors' conclusion is that videos shorter than 100sec are mostly watched fully without a break. In contrast, longer videos are often rewound, and parts watched again or not watched to the full length at all. Please provide relevant data such as number of brakes and relays. The study end point and conclusion, exploring the optimal duration of video would be much more solid if authors would have provided a pre/post questioner to test patients' understanding and knowledge.
