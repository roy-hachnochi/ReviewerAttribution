Addition of nitrite to tuna aiming at fresh reddish looking tuna has resulted in consumption of old tuna products with allergic reactions due to the formation of histamine. A systematic use of nitrite injections to rejuvenate tuna meat has been identified. The article "Identification of nitrite treated tuna fish meat via the determination of nitrous oxide by head space-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry" is well written, the method seems sufficiently valid to me. We do not know of an alternative method to prove nitrite treatment. We would be very pleased if the manuscript could be indexed, as there is no published adequate method to prove the falsification.
