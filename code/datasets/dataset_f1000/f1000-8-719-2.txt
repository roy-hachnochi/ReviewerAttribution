The manuscript describes a Ph2b clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a universal vaccine candidate against influenza. The novel vaccine is a fusion protein of MVA, with NP and M1 viral proteins that are conserved and hence, are expected to provide broad cross strain protection. The vaccine candidate activates cell mediated immunity. The trial focuses on the at-risk elderly group that will be administered once with the experimental vaccine together with the licensed inactivated vaccine against flu. A sub cohort will be tested for immunogenicity. Main study: There are multiple viruses that cause ILI (other than Influenza) that are not expected to be affected by this vaccine. It is not clear why the sponsor expects to have reduced influenza like illness by immunizing against Influenza. Why they do not confirm Influenza illness (e.g. by PCR) and evaluate the reduction of illness in this sub population. Sub cohort: The specificity of the immunological parameters is not described. Do they plan to evaluate the response to the vaccine Ags? or to different influenza viruses/antigens? How will they show the broad response to the vaccine?
