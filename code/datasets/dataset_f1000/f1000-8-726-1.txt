This submission introduces MetaDEGalaxy, which is a workflow intended for 16S differential abundance analysis in the open source Galaxy platform. The workflow incorporates various currently popular open source algorithms, the proposed workflow support the application of such methods by Galaxy users. In particular, the workflow supports differential OTU abundance testing for common measurement platforms (454 and Illumina). Step-by-step tutorials are provided to support the use. The overall work is sound and clearly written. Appropriate references are provided, and the work is based on commonly used methodologies and open source resources. Data and software are openly available with a unique DOI and permanent archiving through Zenodo. The work does not contribute to methods criticism, validation, or benchmarking. This work is a technical contribution that provide new software plugin for the broader Galaxy platform. This is relevant for the limited community of researchers who use Galaxy for 16S microbiome analysis. The contribution is a contribution to scientific software, rather than scientific discussion. This, in my understanding, fits the F1000Research scope. Minor: Why the software has GPL3 license that is more restrictive than e.g. MIT which is often recommended for research software? See DOI: 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002598 1 Instead of QIIME, it could be more appropriate to cite QIIME2?
