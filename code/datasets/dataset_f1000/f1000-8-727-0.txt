In this manuscript, the authors generated two herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) mutants harboring a deletion of US3 and insertion of a fluorescent tag on gK. They used these viruses to assess the effect of the US3 deletion on the gK expression levels and localization. Intriguingly, they observed an increased expression of gK and localization of the protein to the nuclear lamina. The manuscript is exciting and well written. However, as the other reviewers pointed out, it would be worth sequencing the recombinant BACs (or the resulting viruses) to ensure that the effect is not due to secondary mutations in the virus genome. Nowadays this would be quick and relatively cheap to sequence the virus genome by miSeq and would eliminate the need for a revertant virus.
