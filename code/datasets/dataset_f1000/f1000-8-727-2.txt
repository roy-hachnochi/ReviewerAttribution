In this manuscript results are presented indicating that deletion of the HSV-1 US3 causes internal membrane proliferation and rearrangements and is accompanied by over expression of glycoprotein K (gK). The results point into a potential functional relationship between US3 and gK that has not been previously reported. Authors should note that a previous publication showed that overproduction of gK causes accumulation of enveloped capsids inside the nuclear membranes. This reference should be included and discussed. Authors should also sequence the gK region to ensure that the overproduction of gK is not independent of US3 due to secondary mutations in the genomic area.
