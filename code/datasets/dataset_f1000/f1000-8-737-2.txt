In the research article "Management of infected diabetic wound: a scoping review of guidelines" Huidi et al. have conducted a study and concluded that all guidelines and reviews have consistent suggestions on the assessment of the severity of infection, diagnosis, start, selection, and duration of antibiotic therapy. Overall the research work is well organized and presented. The methodology is sound and can be replicable. The author has concluded due to the lack of evidence, the therapeutic status of treatment options like hydrocolloid gels, NPWT, hyperbaric oxygen, and alligate dressings could not be ascertained. There is a need to generate stronger evidence regarding the commonly used methods in the treatment of diabetic wound infections.
