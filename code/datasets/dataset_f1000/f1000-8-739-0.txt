This is a well written manuscript that provides experimental design on an important topic. However, to enhance reader comprehension, some points should be addressed prior to indexing. Introduction This publication described a repeated cross-sectional study, can the author give details about the number of studies (waves) they want to perform and the frequency? Study aim and design The participant section should be clarified for a better understanding, e.g.: ADD: a clear definition of stratum should be mentioned (Prefecture?) ADD: Small towns: population lower than? ADD: The total number of PSUs. EXPLAIN: How are households ordered in PSU to apply a regular numeric interval? EXPLAIN: Why do the authors apply the next birthday method, compared to other methods, such as the last birthday method? Using the sampling described, i.e. 500 PSUs * 50 households/PSU * 1 person/household + the young adult sample for the oversampling quota, more than 25,000 will be contacted, and in the study sample size calculation paragraph only 5,000 were interrogated. Can the authors explain this difference? There is no information about the type and sources of questionnaires used for this cross-sectional study. For instance, do they use questionnaires developed and validated for the US market and translated to Japanese or developed and validated for the Japanese market? Data availability Can we access to the appendix_1_Questionnaire.pdf (study questionnaire)?
