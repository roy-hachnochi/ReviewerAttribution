The author presents a study comparing effectiveness and safety of PCNL in single functioning kidney versus both. The study, despite does not be particularly original, could further enrich the literature on this issue. Introduction: “Percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) is the best choice for treatment of stones […] ” is too affirmative and absolute. Multiple articles report the use of RIRS for even larger stones size with satisfying results. It would be better to add “for stones 2cm” for example. “The PCNL is used for management of stones sized 2 cm 3 and above” : refer to guidelines Methods: “We recruited patients with and without nephrostomy tubes in this study” . Move to inclusion criteria “patients with single functioning” . Define single functioning kidney (previous evaluation, solitary kidney…). How did you evaluate those kidneys? Renal scintigraphy? “if they attended hospital” : This is unnecessary as you have already defined the population recruited for the study as patients of your hospital. Could you add further information on the surgery? (tract size, type of lithotripter, same or different surgeon). Did you use a standardized technique? Which were the indications for tubeless PCNL? Which was the mean duration of postoperative follow up? Results: I would define the gender prevalence as slightly predominant considering the thin difference in percentages How did you define the residual stone? An important addition could be operative and hospitalization time, if data are available Discussion: Enrich the discussion with more literature on the issue. Report limitations of the study and do not rush the conclusion
