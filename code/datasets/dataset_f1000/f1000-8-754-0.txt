The aim of this work was to compare the measurements of sleep and wake obtained from Apple Watch and Philips Actiwatch Spectrum. To this aim, 14 participants (9 males) were asked to wear on non-dominant wrist both equipments for two consecutive nights. On the whole results show that Apple Watch performed well. The manuscript is potentially interesting. However, there are several limitations and features that Authors should better explicit. The sample size is relatively small, but above all the number of nights is too small. Several researches show that actigraphy output reaches stability after at least seven nights. I feel that it is still possible to improve the manuscript. For example, Authors did not show the mean age of the sample. Authors did not explain how they calculated sleep onset. Authors did not clearly explain why they adopted a sampling rate of 15 seconds when usually, to asses sleep by actigraph, is adopted a 1 minute epoch. In Figure 1 there is a mistake. It is reported 25 Hz but should be 32 Hz. Pearson correlations are not useful. Do Authors really think that when a wrist is moving one of two devices could record no movements? The interpretations of Bland Altman plot are a little bit questionable. Six minutes for total sleep time are few, I agree, representing more or less a variation of around 2%. However, 30 minutes for wake after sleep onset are not few because they correspond more or less to a variation of 75%. In other words, Authors have developed an algorithm very good to assess sleep (sensitivity) but less performing to evaluate wake (specificity). About this, data reported in Table 3 are very unusual because changing threshold leads to an increase in both sensitivity and specificity. Usually when one increases, the other one decreases. A last note is about the Cole-Kripke quotation at page 9. In my memory, such algorithm was implemented for another brand of actigraph (Ambulatory Monitoring). Are Authors sure about this?
