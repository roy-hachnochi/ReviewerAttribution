While this case does not report any new information, it fulfills an important role in highlighting rare disease cases worldwide, raising awareness and further informing health care practitioners. However there are several errors that must be corrected. Abstract The English grammar is at times difficult to read, improving translation would increase readability. Cerezyme (Imiglucerase) is one drug for enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), there are two others as well as substrate reduction therapy (SRT). While more work needs to be done characterizing Gaucher disease in Latin America, currently the ICGG does contain almost 16% of its population from Latin American cases of Gaucher disease (GD) and describing the information as very limited is not entirely accurate. It may certainly be accurate in describing Ecuadorean cases of GD. Description of the case Give the patient’s values its own column in Table 1. The case is described well, and the figures add depth to the presentation. Referring to this case as an “incidental diagnosis" is not valid as the patient had numerous manifestations. Likewise, it cannot be said that she does not show “serious symptoms”, as it is stated that she had bruising fatigue, pain, weight loss etc. Were there other diagnoses that the medical team considered? The differential list can be of value to those reading the case report. The genotype is not provided! Discussion “Glycolipid glucosylceramide in to ceramide and glucose” GD should not usually be diagnosed by bone marrow biopsy! Bone marrow biopsy is a painful procedure and is not needed to diagnose GD. Enzymatic and genetic testing is the preferred method of diagnosis, as stated in the manuscript. The author states that genetic analysis was performed, but the genetic mutations are not included in the case report. This would be very helpful and should be included.
