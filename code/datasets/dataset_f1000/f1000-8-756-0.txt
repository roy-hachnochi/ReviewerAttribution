Observation case 6: it's up to the editors consider if this case is suitable to be incorporated or not in the field of dentistry or oral health. In the lack of oral involvement, there is no rationale to include this case. Observation case 7: if a confirmatory PCR was performed, authors must clearly state this PCR was based on a sampling obtained from the oral lesion. Due to this is a DisL case, PCR sample could be obtained from any of the more accessible samples. Observation paragraph 4: the sentence "Leishmaniasis should be considered in immunocompromised patients" is unclear (it is assuming any Leishmaniasis, even localised cutaneous Leishmaniasis should be ....). "Unusual manifestations as DisL or purely oral Leishmaniasis should be considered in immunocompromised patients" is probably more accurate and supported by their findings. Observation regarding therapy: again, references 17 and 21 are case reports. The authors must familiarise with evidence-based recommendations as the one provided in the prior review. Local treatment is exclusively recommended to localised cutaneous leishmaniasis. It's a wrong and dangerous recommendation to suggest local therapies are suitable for the treatment of mucosal leishmaniasis.
