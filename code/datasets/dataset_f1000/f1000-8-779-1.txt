This article highlights the difficulties in the clinical and histological diagnosis of a rare adnexal tumour. The number of properly described bona fide trichilemmal carcinomas is low, therefore case reports describing the observed histological features are valuable. The authors also highlighted the long clinical history related to a pre-existing pilar cyst - transformation of the tumour can occur, sometimes in a long and unpredictable clinical course. I would suggest one area, which could be expanded more is the differential diagnosis (perhaps use and differentiating value of immunohistochemistry) as well as it's relationship to the follicular/infundibular squamous cell carcinoma. I would recommend indexing this article as it is - the short and succinct description and important clinical and histological points make this useful, and the point raised above is probably beyond the scope of a case report.
