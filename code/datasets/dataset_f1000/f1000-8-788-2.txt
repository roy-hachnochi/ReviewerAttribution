Authors described limitations of the BLUE protocol about one case of hemoptysis. The authors should be commended for this task. The case report is well written, “English” seems to me very good. I have only 2 comments to add to the discussion part: Blue protocol is not for ICU, we agree, and Lung US ICU protocols or guidelines are not available. But review written by experts are available. Please quote Bouhemad Anesthesiology, 2015 Feb;122(2):437-47 1 , and Mojoli, Am J Respir Crit Care Med, 2019 Mar 15;199(6):701-714 2 . Moreover, in these papers, the issues of the needed “examinations points” (at least 6 X right/left) and probe are discussed. In the conclusion, authors should precise that lung ultrasound "as all imaging technique should be considered in the patient’s….etc".
