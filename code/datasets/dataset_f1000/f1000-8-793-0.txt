This paper has not undergone many changes from the original version. It has some added material in the introduction regarding the immediate post-Ebola period as an opportunity to fix the human resource deficit. The methods section has some material describing the healthcare human resources development pathway and states that the major obstacle is insufficient financial resources largely due to restriction imposed by the IMF. The cited reference, which, in fairness, did appear in the previous version as well, does support this, though it dates from 2007, and so the reader must assume that the current fiscal policy environment has not changed. As the paper's major recommendation is a reversal of IMF policy, some confirmation that this is still the major obstacle to Sierra Leone's healthcare human resources meeting the country's goals would be welcome if such a reference is available. The paper now has a sentence directing readers to the authors' previous work for more information on the details of the staffing shortfalls. A quick examination of the two tables mentioned does prove interesting. For example, the 92% of the 92% non-medical staff shortfall comes from just the cleaners and security officers. As the authors mention the consequences of insufficient waste management staff, and it would help the reader to have presented at least the quantification of the shortfall for this category to support their argument in this paper, as it would seem quite relevant.
