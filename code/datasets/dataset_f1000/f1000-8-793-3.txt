The article is very well written with clearly defined aim/research question and methodology designed to answer it. The question of interest is of high importance as it relates to Ebola (highly contagious and dangerous virus) which could become a threat for the whole world. The problem discussed in the article (under-staffing) is worrisome and calls for an urgent actions. It seems there is a need for more information on settings. Particularly regarding financing and hiring/staffing of the health facilities in the article. While the presentation of the problem is clear it will be really interesting and important to understand root-causes of the problems which may help to solve the issues discussed. Most importantly if there was a standard setting for minimum staff levels by the Ministry (so, assuming there is political will) then what are the constrains for not increasing number of human resources. The lack of qualified professionals may cause the under-staffing of medical resources but we observe no change in the number of non-medical staff so there should be other causes preventing the capacity increase in terms of human resources. If the data is not available researchers might want to address it in the limitations and call for further investigation of the topic.
