The manuscript is written well. It will be better to provide some more background about the scale of involvement of CHWs during Ebola outbreak. How CHWs were involved, time points when the Ebola cases came down, post outbreak responsiblities for CHWs related to Ebola Impact/severity of Ebola outbreak in the study district Kenema compared to others. Study design: Instead of retrospective cross sectional study, I suggest this 'We performed trend analysis using routinely reported aggregate CHW programme data' Methods: Provide information on the total population of the district, malaria and diarrhea statistics, number of health facilities, number of CHWs present during the pre-Ebola period, how they report (paper based/electronic). Missing reports: present the facts in the results section and then can be brought under 'discussion' section Reporting on number of CHWs would be good in the results section. Were there any deaths among CHWs due to Ebola? What could be the possible reasons for 80% increase in reporting of Pneumonia during post Ebola period? It would be good to discuss the possible reasons
