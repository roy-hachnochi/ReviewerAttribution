This is a good study, a kind of situational analysis of NCD in Sierra Leone during Ebola episodes. The methodology is good and the investigator has done a good job in evaluating the NCD reports across the PHUs. The only concerned thing here is the conclusion. This is very generalized and did not necessarily explain about the artifacts. Its obvious that it would be increased awareness and increased surveillance/screening activities as a result of the endemic but the same can not be generalized to the overall scenario. I recommend more clarity in the conclusion.
