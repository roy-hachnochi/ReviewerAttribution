This study investigated the dental caries prevalence among Egyptian children and adolescents in association with different risk factors. At the beginning, I would like to congratulate the authors for attempting to undertake this work, due to data shortage or even lack of data regarding this subject. I found it very interesting and of valuable additional knowledge. The manuscript is well-written and well-structured. The relationships between different caries indices, SES and parental education haven't been investigated before among Egyptian children. Moreover, this is the first work that deals with the correlation between cariogenic and non cariogenic dietary elements with the caries indices among Egyptian children. The discussion is well written covering all the study results. The data from this work could be used to make regression analysis to identify the causative risk factors. However, the paper is clear substantially easy to read but still there are suggested minor comments the author could deal with, or discuss for additional impact. The results are given in full details, the great amount of data make it difficult for the reader to understand some relations. The age ranges differed, as they were 3- 12 and 13-18 years when mentioned in subjects and methods, meanwhile in data collection, the age groups were classified into 3-5, 5-7, 7-9, 9-12 and 12-18 years. On the other hand, in the tables, the age groups were 3-4, 5-6, 7-8, 9-11,12-17 years. So, they are to be corrected.
