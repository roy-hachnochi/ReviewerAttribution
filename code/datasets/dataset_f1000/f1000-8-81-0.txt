I reviewed this manuscript thoroughly. Overall, the article is well written. As claimed by the authors, this MS will provide a baseline studies on antimicrobial and phytochemical analysis of some medicinal plants. However, it needs some major revision before it can be accepted for indexing. Some negative effects of using these need to be addressed in introduction. These adverse effects should be briefly elaborated so that readers can understand the nature of adverse effects of these chemicals. Methodology is not explained well. No statistical analysis description in methodology however SEM analysis is present in results which software is used or how it is calculated The results showed that none of the tested effects was comparative to the used controls (antibiotics or other drugs) and this should not be explained as effectiveness as described. The authors may try to use other solvents and analyze the plant constituents before judging its effectiveness. Until this work is supported by, some experimental work such as using other solvents and the manuscript should be reconstructed.
