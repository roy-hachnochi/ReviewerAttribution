The manuscript has been reviewed thoroughly and it was felt that the work is too preliminary and lacks the scientific rigour. There are some points which led to this conclusion: The phytochemical analysis has not been described clearly and satisfactorily for the interpretation and usage by the readers. No quantitative isolation and analysis has been done for the detected phytoconstituents, which does not justify the objective of screening a plant for scientific validation its medicinal values. Material and methods section needs to be rearranged appropriately, where phytochemical analysis should be mentioned after preparation of culture media and standardization of test organisms. Conclusion of the study and its significance not drawn appropriately. Why is saline used as negative control for antimicrobial screening of the ethanolic extracts and not 95% ethanol? Study done against only 2 bacteria and 1 fungus, which is not satisfactory. More test organisms should have been included to scientifically validate the spectrum of the tested plants. In figure 1, legends are not explained. Does not convey the meaning to readers. Also, 5mm wells were prepared in the medium for antimicrobial activity. How is the inhibitory zone of 5mm or less justified if the well size is itself 5mm. Also in figure 1 and 2, as per the title...the mean SD is of how many replicates?.. and to the best of our knowledge ,now a dayâ€™s SD is not used, instead Standard error is more appropriate. No statistical analysis of the data has been done for comparison of the antimicrobial potential. No MIC studies or other antimicrobial activities have been done to scientifically justify the potential of the given plants. Only Agar diffusion results alone are not validated.
