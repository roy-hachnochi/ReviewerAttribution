The concept of the work is very interesting about the antimicrobial activities of medicinal plants in Africa. Though there are some crucial points needed to be clarified scientifically. In the title, declaration of 6 plants, though there are 5 plants. It is needed to clarify that they are different preparations of extracts not different species. It is crucial scientifically to describe the methods e.g. quantification of A. fumigatus and its experimental standardization as it is fungi. How the fungi grows and be inhibited by extracts in agar which should be different from other organisms which are bacteria that should not be measure in exact same way. Crucial statistical analysis and validity of the data is required to compare antimicrobial activities of the plants to antibiotic of choices. Phytochemical analysis in the research is qualitative. It may not be used as a referable or validate results in a quality scientific paper.
