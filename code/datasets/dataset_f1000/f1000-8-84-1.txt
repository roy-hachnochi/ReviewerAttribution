Eliseev et al. demonstrate the ability to use cadmium divalent cations, X-ray data collected on an in house X-ray source (Cu Kalpha), and single wavelength anomalous dispersion (SAD) phasing to determine the structure of a protein, in this case the anti-ErbB3 single domain antibody (sdAb). They originally solved the structure by molecular replacement (MR) and reported it in a previous publication, but here they demonstrate the applicability of Cd-SAD to this data set to determine the structure. By our examination of the literature, at least two other structures have been solved by Cd-SAD but both of these structures were solved using data collected at a synchrotron source at a longer wavelength (PDB IDs 2X7K and 5AM6). This particular application provides an excellent alternative method to others presented in the literature and referenced in this paper. A couple of notes and comments: The authors may help the reader understand the number of electron possible for phasing by referring the reader to the UW X-ray anomalous scattering web page (http://skuld.bmsc.washington.edu/scatter/) designed by Ethan Merritt. The authors do an excellent job of data collection on their in house instrument by using the kappa goniometer to increase completeness and enhance the anomalous signal. The authors should also site a second paper by Terwilliger et al. from the same issue as reference 15 but with pages 359-374 1 which provides additional information on experimental design and execution. We performed an overnight soak at 5 mM CdCl2, collected a high resolution data set in house on a Cu Kalpha source, and obtained sufficient anomalous signal to solve the structure by Cd-SAD. This provided us with good confidence that this method should be generally applicable. Overall, the current paper by Eliseev provides a good alternative approach to experimental structure determination, complementing previously reported techniques.
