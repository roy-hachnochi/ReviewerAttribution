The article describes the implementation of de.NBI Cloud, which gives integrated access to currently five compute centers through one portal. The end user needs are well stated, and the technical challenges to meet those needs are clearly described. It is outside of my expertise to comment on the technical soundness of the implementation, and no user survey statistics are provided to assess user satisfaction. As de.NBI Cloud is clearly not the first implementation of such a system, I am surprised that the authors don't discuss precedents. For example, I have been a happy user of XSEDE, which is probably the largest similar network. Within XSEDE, Jetstream provides access to virtual machines (run off machines at either TACC or Indiana University). I believe the backend implementation is rather similar, but maybe that should be discussed in the article.
