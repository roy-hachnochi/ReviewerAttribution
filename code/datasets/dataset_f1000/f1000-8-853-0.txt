In the current manuscript, the authors reported a rare infective complication following percutaneous coronary intervention. They underlined the difficulty of the diagnosis, particularly when neither surgery nor autopsy is performed. Generally, the manuscript is well written and the topic is quite interesting for the reader. The paper seems suitable for indexing in its actual version.
