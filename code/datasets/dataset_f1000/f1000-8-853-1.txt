In this paper, Ben Messaoud and colleagues reported a very unusual case of a patient who developed a subacute stent thrombosis in the setting of a tricuspid acute endocarditis. The ST was associated with an image of aneurysm on the distal edge of the stent. Although there are other causes of coronary artery aneurysm (including iatrogenic media disruption, stent fracture or severe stent malapposition) that could appear after initial thrombus dissolution, the authors concluded to a mycotic aneurysm. This conclusion makes sense regarding the clinical context, CT scan data and subsequent evolution following antibiotics therapy. The main limitation of the report is the lack of pathology analyses and was acknowledged by the authors. The manuscript in this current version raises the following issues: What was the antiplatelet drug regimen of the patient after the first STEMI ? What about the patient compliance? The CT scan initial data could be better explained and a cross sectional image of the RCA showing the hematoma might be a nice addition. Do the authors have a 1 year CT scan or angio to illustrate the aneurysm disappearance (or no)? What is the authors opinion about implanting a new device in an actively infected stent?
