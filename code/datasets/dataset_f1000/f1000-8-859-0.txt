The results are well presented and the underlying material is impressive. This is a paper dealing with the quality of life and costs for patients with heart failure the data are extracted from databases, three types. Economic burden is readily understood but “humanistic burden”, how is that measured and defined? The study refers to health-related quality of life measurements of three different types. In total 124 studies were found dealing with the two types of outcomes that the study was looking for. Prognosis, quality of life, and costs relevant parameters for patients with heart failure. All three are well known and with discouraging results in several previous studies. The novelty in this paper is debatable since no new conclusions are drawn from the results. Only passive observations so common in this type of statistical work. Why do the authors use the expression humanistic burden? It is not well defined and can be substituted for suffering, mental stress, low QoL etc. The last sentence in the first part of the discussion should be emphasized in order to justify the amount of statistics and work put down in this paper. In the discussion part about cost and resource use, the authors conclude with suggestions on how to reduce the increasing cost for HF management. Both the conclusions for increasing QoL and how to reduce the costs are very similar. Should that not stimulate the authors for more distinct conclusions about the interpretation of their findings?
