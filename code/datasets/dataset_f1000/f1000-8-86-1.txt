This is a very valuable addition to the literature which is timely and needed. It is well planned and executed and should be highly cited and encourage further development in this avenue of research. There is increasing recognition that technology has a central role to play in improving visual function and such studies are an integral part of this process. Is the study design appropriate and is the work technically sound? The study involves a straightforward survey of patient responses to questions on use of technology. It is not a validated questionnaire , but does not claim to be so. It uses entirely appropriate survey methodology to acquire information on patient perceptions of technology use. Are sufficient details of methods and analysis provided to allow replication by others? The methods of survey collection are described and the questions also provided. The responses to these questions are provided in enough detail to provide the reader with a snapshot of patient perceptions. It should be noted that this cannot necessarily be translated to all populations globally and the paper accepts this. The validity is limited to the population under question and is not necessarily transferable to other populations. It is however still very useful information as real world data a patient population in a typical teaching hospital in U.K There is very little existing information on this topic and therefore this paper is very important in informing doctors and developers on patient attitudes to technology.
