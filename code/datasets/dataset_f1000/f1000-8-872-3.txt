The article is well written and addresses the Global issue of DM screening among TB Patients which is one the common co morbidity recognized with TB that may affect the TB outcome. The points which need to be explained are: The selection criteria of the centres and how public vs private centres were selected moreover was the urban rural representation was also considered or it was random? Moreover it was stated in abstract that health centres without DM screened larger number of patients while in methods it was stated the DM services were mainly in tertiary care hospitals which might create assumptions of large screening in tertiary care hospitals contrary to what was stated in abstract. Table 1 also shows the DM services to be already present in 3 out of 7 centres so this need to be better explained. The average number of daily patients screened was also less in these 3 centres so it might mean that tertiary care where already DM services are present were not part of study? In discussion it was mentioned using only FBG to diagnose DM can underestimate the prevalence of DM by as much as 50% when compared with the gold standard test, the oral glucose tolerance test, which is more accurate but unavailable at primary health care level, so how this should spell out in the policy implication? When the program should plan to do this DM screening of TB patients, more focus should be on the availability of gold standard for FBG using Glucometer, this should also be explained.
