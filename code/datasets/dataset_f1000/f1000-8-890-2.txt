The article evaluates the effects of self-harm and suicide prevention interventions for children and adolescents. The rationale behind the study is sufficiently supported by different research. The methodology provided is sufficient except it is unclear why only systematic reviews published in 2012 or later are included. It is also unclear what search terms were used for future replications. The authors report a range of outcome measures in the results that may not be directly related to self-harm. Such outcomes (e.g. treatment engagement) were not further commented on or summarised. Overall, the systematic review is very comprehensive but the discussion and summary could be more coherent and with a better flow. For instance, the authors can attempt to comment on the implications of TAU control group versus other active intervention control groups.
