In this article, the authors demonstrate a refinement of the widely-used formalin test. They show that if the formalin injection is performed while mice are under brief general anaesthesia (Sevoflurane) the second phase behaviour is largely unaltered, even though the first phase behaviour is largely lost. Since the second phase is the more useful measure, this means that the procedure can be performed in a less stressful way, resulting in a significant improvement in animal welfare. The results of the study are generally convincing, and the article is clearly written and well illustrated. One concern is the relatively high level of pain behaviour in the control group for the Pink1 study (Fig 4). While the area under the curve for other groups is typically around 1000, for the controls in Fig 4 it is nearly 2000. In fact, compared to other cohorts, the Pink1-/- mice seem to have normal behaviour, while the control group show an exaggerated response. Some explanation is needed here. Also – what are the units for area under curve? Minor points: It would be helpful to have some explanation of why the Pink1 and Slit1 mouse lines were chosen for this study, at the end of the Experimental Animals paragraph in the Methods section. Page 4: In the 4 th line of the Results section "it is" should be inserted before "being" – otherwise it would be the experimenter who received the injection. Page 5: left column, 6 th line "led" rather than "lead". Page 6: left column, 6 th line – omit "seem to".
