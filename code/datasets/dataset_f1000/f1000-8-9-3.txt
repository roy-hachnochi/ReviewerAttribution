This study focuses on mangrove forests, an important ecosystem in coastal areas. The study focuses on the economic value of wood production and also of fish production in brackish water ponds, which, along with overharvesting, contribute to the destruction of the mangrove ecosystem. Nonetheless some mangrove ecosystems have been restored through natural reseeding. The study provides interesting economic data on the value of mangrove forests. The impacts of thinning and also of restoring mangrove are assessed in economic terms, demonstrating that thinning can increase the economic value by about 25%. The economic value of fishing is also quantified. The greater economic value of fishing as measured in the daily income also contributes to overfishing. My criticism of this paper is that the authors also discuss "ecosystem services", but seem to equate ecosystem services with the economic value of the wood or fish harvested. I consider ecosystem services to include other impacts related to water quality, habitat for flora and fauna, and other environmental impacts that are difficult to monetize. These are not really considered, only the economic value of wood production. Thus the authors should limit their discussion to the “economic services” of mangrove forests, and their contribution to the livelihoods of the local people. This, of course, does not diminish the importance of the mangrove forests as an economic resource, but evaluation of ecosystem services would require a different approach to evaluating all the environmental benefits of mangrove forests.
