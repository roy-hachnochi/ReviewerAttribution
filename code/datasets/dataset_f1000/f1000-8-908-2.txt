In this study, the authors improved a cytoscape network tool to analyze and visualize drug target interaction in the context of signaling pathways. The detailed examples are very helpful to indicate the importance of the functions of the tool. Overall it is well written. A couple of comments are as follows: Discuss the possibility of zoom in/out the signaling pathways, considering that multiple signaling pathways are often activated in a specific disease. If it is possible to list/visualize all drugs targeting on all the pathways, and users can check the details, like the google map. For the drug-target interaction, it is better to indicate the target names directly beside the color bar (because it is hard to match so many colors to drug names in the legend area) Minor: the resolution of Figure 1 is low. The subfigures (though these sub-figures are presented again the manuscript) are not clear.
