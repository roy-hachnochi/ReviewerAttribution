This is an important article that clearly describes what may be going wrong in our quest to reduce neonatal mortality in high mortality settings like Kenya. The article does point out that the correct umbilical cord care practices need to be entrenched into routine practices, especially in lower-level facilities. There are a few issues that need to be clarified; In the introduction, the authors state that there are no guidelines for cord care in Kenya, contrary to that there are actually basic pediatric protocols of 2016 here . These protocols clearly recommend the use of 4% Chlorhexidine for cord care. The authors used a 1:2 case-control matching, what was the rationale? Why not 1:1? My guess is that this has to do with powering the study enough, if this is the case then it needs to be clearly stated in the methodology. In the results section, Table 3 seems to be entirely described by the text preceding it. I believe the authors can just highlight the key elements in the table and leave the other details in the table. The authors could have enriched the discussion by contextualizing the findings further, for example, commodities are usually a challenge in low-level facilities and also human resources who would have correctly advised the mothers, I was hoping to see this as possible postulations in the discussions and conclusions.
