This is a well written and interesting paper describing the effective use of cetuximab and nivolumab in an extensive thoracic cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma resistant to all previous lines of chemotherapy. The authors provide a detailed description of the case with its findings comprehensively summarized in the Table. I think it is a useful publication describing current therapeutic strategies for NMSC and encouraging readership to perform serial biopsies in skin cancers where collision tumours may be present.
