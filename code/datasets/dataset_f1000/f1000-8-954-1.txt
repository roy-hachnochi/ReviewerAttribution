The authors use routine data from two MSF hospitals in Pakistan to explore factors associated with in-hospital mortality among infants and neonates. As such the manuscript presents interesting analysis of an important research question. The authors nicely characterize the benefits and limitations of the retrospective data (e.g., lack of age data) used in the presented manuscript. The manuscript would benefit from further details pertaining to the statistical analysis, as well as justification of the model selection. Additional details should include analysis performed to assure the assumptions of the Poisson model hold (e.g., measure of dispersion), and clarity on how the offset was modeled. Additionally, as the key finding of the manuscript relates to differences in mortality associated with days since admission, (descriptive) analysis comparing characteristics of children with exits in the first 48 hours to the reference would be strengthen the manuscript, and help explore implications of the regression findings. Finally, global tests for month of admission (seasonality) appear only significant for Chaman (not DMJ). Discussing this distinction would also strengthen the manuscript.
