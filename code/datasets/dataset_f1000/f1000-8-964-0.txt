Firstly I congratulate the authors for doing great work on the title "Dermatoglyphical impressions are different between children and adolescents with normal weight, overweight and obesity: a cross-sectional survey." Introduction: The introduction was very clear and the authors have clearly described obesity and dermatoglyphic features in relation to a variety of diseases. The aim of the study was well determined about obesity in children and adolescents aged 10 to 19 years in the centre west region of Santa Catarina. Methods: Under this section, the study design and study participants were well documented. But I feel that the census was made only between 2013 - 2014. It could be more productive if they have done in at least 5 years census. The collection of demographic characteristics and fingerprint collection and analysis within the schools was done properly by the authors. Statistical analysis using ANOVA was well apt to the study and the results were well documented under the results section. The table and figures are giving proper information about the study. Discussion: The whole study was well summarised under this section. The limitations of the study were well documented. Overall it's a very good study which is most beneficial.
