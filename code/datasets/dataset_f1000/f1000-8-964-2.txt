Few corrections to be made – Introduction section – last paragraph –last sentence - kindly check the sentence formation. Under Methodology - Collection of demographic details - avoid using ‘patient’ can alternate it with ‘participants’. Under Results section – Paragraph 1- The description is repeated, can avoid repetition. Under results section – Paragraph – 2 - the codes used for digits are varying. Can use any one form of representation either Mesql2 or MET2. Under the results section in the description, the digits are represented as MET / But in the reference table, it is represented as Mesql. Kindly fix with one form of representation and use the same in both description and data table. The article is recommended for publication after the above said corrections.
