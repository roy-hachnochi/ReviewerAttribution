This is a well written manuscript. The authors have nicely described the case, pathogenesis of Purple Urine Bag Syndrome (PUBS) and followed up with excellent management points. PUBS is a rare but important phenomenon seen in elderly patients with UTI and indwelling foley catheters. Such patients can be nonverbal and asymptomatic with purple urine bag being the only sign of UTI! Doctors and other health care professionals should be familiar with this phenomenon due its morbidity. I recommend this manuscript for indexing.
