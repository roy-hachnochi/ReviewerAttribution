This is a well-written paper on microplastic abundance in the bottom sediment east of the Java Sea. I have only trivial points to be improved. P. 3, "Methods": Please add "Bengawan Solo River" into Figure 1. P. 4, "Microplastic analysis": What was the maximal size of microplastics in your analysis? I recognized that the minimal sizes was 0.3 mm according to the mesh filter. The maximal size was however not specified. P.4, "Microplastic analysis": How did you avoid the contamination of fibers floating in the air in both the field and laboratory? We sometimes set a "blank" to monitor air-borne microfibers during the experiment. If you did not conduct the monitoring, please add the sentence: the abundance of microfibers detected in this study might be overestimated by the contamination due to air-born microfibers.
