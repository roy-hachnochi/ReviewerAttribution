We reviewed the article sent to us. In our evaluation, the organization is well-defined with a brief but complete introduction, interesting comparisons in the discussion and a precise presentation of the case. In this very last part however, we found a paragraph that we consider not appropriate at all in the context of the case discussion and is also somehow repetitive; thus, probably, it would sound better in the introduction. It would be necessary to insert some more recent citations. Lastly, a little grammatical mistake about the verb "to be" is present in the introduction.
