The article ‘ccbmlib: a Python package for modeling Tanimoto similarity value distributions’, by Vogt and Bajorath is clearly written and concretely describes a method for determining the significance of tanimoto similarity scores. The statistical technique detailed in the paper outlines a mathematical method for converting tanimoto similarity scores from various binary molecular fingerprints into significance (p) values. Consequently, the method provides a way of normalizing similarity scores so that comparisons between results of searches utilizing different fingerprinting methods can be conducted easily. The paper also outlines a ‘conditional method’ that provides a technique for estimating the distributions of similarity scores for a given reference compound. This allows one to estimate how well a test compound would rank in a large-scale similarity search. The explanations and mathematical equations in the paper are easy to follow. The graphs in the results section clearly support the findings of the study. I would recommend this paper to be indexed in its current form.
