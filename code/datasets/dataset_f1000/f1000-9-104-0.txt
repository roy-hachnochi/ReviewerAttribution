The Introduction of the article points to the 2007 recession as a key event regarding the financial concerns of today’s students. I believe that updating this text to incorporate the Covid-19 related economic conditions will allow this article to remain relevant for a much longer time. Some of the cited papers actually diagnosed patients with mental illness (such as depression or anxiety). Others were epidemiologic studies which relied on psychometric tools that provided evidence of symptomology but did not actually diagnose patients. It may be helpful to make this distinction in the current review when relevant. For example, the Garlow et al. paper (reference #50) repeatedly refers to “depressive symptoms” while the relevant section of the current review (end of page 5 and beginning of page 6) refers to mild, moderate, and severe depression—not symptomology. I would encourage the authors to use language consistent with the referenced papers. Both Liu et al. (reference #111) and Kerr et al. (reference #116) described sexual minorities as gay/lesbian. Yet on page 14 the authors used the term “homosexual” in the phrase “There is evidence that homosexual students experience poorer mental health and higher suicidality compared to heterosexual students 111,116 .” This term is outdated and should be replaced in that paragraph and the following paragraph.
