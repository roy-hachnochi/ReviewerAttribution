This article is a protocol for a systematic review that aims to describe the meta-analysis methods (and some of the systematic review methods) used in systematic reviews that include interrupted time series (ITS) studies. The protocol is thorough and well written. A comprehensive search of the literature will be undertaken to identify reviews of health, public health, psychology, education and economic interventions. There are clear eligibility criteria for reviews, and the data to be extracted is well described, as is the planned analysis. I have a couple of minor suggestions. In the abstract it would be preferable to state how the 100 reviews will be selected (for e.g. "We will identify up to the 100 most recently published reviews"). You could also add in that you will be looking at the tools used to assess bias/methodological quality of ITS studies (which one could argue is more looking at systematic review methods that meta-analysis methods). You could also clarify, by adding to the summary of data extraction items, that you will be looking at the review authors' definition of ITS studies. I presume you will also be extracting whether any of the ITS studies included a control group, and perhaps how the control group was used (especially if any re-analysis was undertaken)?
