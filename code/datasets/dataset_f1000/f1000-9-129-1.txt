Since December 2019, a plethora of cases resembling viral pneumonia has emerged exponentially in Wuhan, China, which is now coined Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19; formerly known as 2019-nCoV). Chen et. al. reported the computational modelling and virtual screening results of the 3C-like protease (3CLpro) of SARS-CoV-2. This study is timely in view of the recent outbreak of COVID-19. The rationale of repurposing existing drugs to tackle the global viral outbreak is sound. The manuscript is also well-written and structured. It should be noted that: The authors compared their model with the recently published crystal structure of 3CLpro and found a high similarity between the two structures. They also obtained a similar list of top-ranked drug candidates when the crystal structure was subjected to the same screening protocol. Several studies using similar modeling and virtual screening approaches have also been published recently. Some suggestions for improving the manuscript: The authors proposed that the HCV drugs velpatasvir and ledipasvir, and thus Epclusa and Harvoni, could be attractive drug candidates for treating SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, there is no direct evidence to support this claim. To support this claim, the authors should connect the computational results with experimental data. To test their hypothesis, the authors should at least prove (or disprove) that the two HCV drugs could inhibit the biochemical activity of 3CLpro of SARS-CoV-2. To further test the hypothesis, the two NS5A inhibitors should be tested using in vitro assays such as viral RNA PCR assay. If there are no such experimental data to support the claim, the authors may consider revising their conclusion to "the computational results provide a rationale for further experimental validation of treating SARS-CoV-2 with velpatasvir and ledipasvir".
