This is a well written report of a Hackathon activity in the area of semantics and ontologies for life sciences with a view to using these semantic technologies and knowledge structures to enhance the reproducibility and I would say the use and re-use of life sciences data and methods in a number of typically gene and protein related areas. While the report is on an activity which I presume took place in 2015 the material is very relevant and not dated. The report contains very good summaries of the prior art on the areas, especially ontologies that cover the areas of interest and are of potential use across the whole of the scientific research life cycle. The details of the challenges, data made available, teams and goals are provided and will benefit the community though it will need detailed reading to absorb the extensive material provided by the authors. The extensive references are themselves a very useful research source. I consider this to be a well written and useful contribution to the literature which will help the community in building new and useable systems (and also not to re-invent things that do already work).
