The Authors use an in silico approach to identify antigenic peptides derived from 2019-nCoV. First, they screened ten open reading frame of 2019-nCoV sequence used the IEDB database, finding a series of peptides potentially immunogenic. The first piece of data relies on the identification of 28 peptides that were exactly matching SARS CoV peptides. Moreover, using combinatory approaches, modelling HLA and TCR binding, they identified 13 peptides potentially able to bind a given TCR in HLA A2 restriction fashion, and cutting a list of peptides able to bind several HLA alleles and characterizing several peptides that may be de novo candidates or crossreactive peptides to be used either to study immune response to 2019-nCoV or to set a vaccine.
