This is an important manuscript identifying potential vaccine targets for 2019-nCoV, using computational prediction. In the absence of patient samples, such approaches are instrumental to guide towards quick and efficient identification of vaccine candidates. The authors used 10 open reading frame sequences of 2019-nCoV deposited at NCBI and conducted sequence alignment against immunogenic peptides deposited in the Immune Epitope Database and Analysis Resource (IEDB) database. They identified 28 peptides with sequences matching exactly to severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS CoV), that have previously been characterised as immunogenic by T cell assays. These findings are very promising and have the added benefit of potentially developing a vaccine against both SARS and COVID-19. Additional peptides were identified to most likely bind common Chinese and European HLA alleles and have high immunogenicity potential. The authors provide a shortlist of peptides as potential vaccine candidates. While this manuscript presents a good model for identifying such targets, a comment should be included in the discussion about the necessity of expanding the analysis to include wider HLA allele types, considering that the virus is likely to spread worldwide. Minor comment: Please explain the methods and analysis in greater details, including the following terms: ‘Towards target peptide length 3’. ‘Normalized alignment scores’ (and their scale, such as the significance of 4 for the data presented in Figure 1). The importance of leucine (L) and valine (V) in anchor positions for MHC binding (for data presented in Table 5).
