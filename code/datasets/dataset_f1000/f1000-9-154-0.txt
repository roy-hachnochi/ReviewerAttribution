It has been shown previously that postal questionnaire response can be increased by using an SMS reminder (Edwards et al. , 2009 1 ) and that questionnaire response can be increased by personally addressing participants by name on cover letters (Scott and Edwards, 2006 2 ). There have, however, been few randomised trials of a personalised reminder SMS. This study is therefore a welcome addition to the literature. This is a report of the results of a randomised controlled trial nested within an RCT of occupational therapist-led home environmental assessment for the prevention of falls in older people. The nested trial sought to evaluate the effect on questionnaire response of a personalised text message compared to a standard (non-personalised) text in this elderly population. 403 participants who had agreed to receive text communication during participation, had provided a mobile number, and were due to receive their four-month post-randomisation follow-up postal questionnaire, were randomised into this nested trial. The proportion that responded in the personalised text message group was 97.8%, lower than the proportion that responded in the non-personalised text message group (98.6%); there was thus no evidence that the intervention had any effect on questionnaire response (p=0.63). The report is a clear and concise account of the study, citing the current literature. The authors may consider it helpful to include Pippa Scottâ€™s study in their introduction or discussion. The study design seems appropriate and the work appears to be technically sound. The conclusions are adequately supported by the results, and the study makes a useful contribution to the data collection literature.
