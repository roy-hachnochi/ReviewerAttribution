            <meta name="dc.description" content=" Background: The Informed Health Choices (IHC) Key Concepts are principles for evaluating the trustworthiness of claims about treatment effects. The Key Concepts provide a framework for developing learning-resources to help people use the concepts when treatment claims are made, and when they make health choices. 
 Objective: To compare the framework provided by the IHC Key Concepts to other frameworks intended to promote critical thinking about treatment (intervention) claims and choices. 
 Methods: We identified relevant frameworks from reviews of frameworks, searching Google Scholar, citation searches, and contact with key informants. We included frameworks intended to provide a structure for teaching or learning to think critically about the basis for claims, evidence used to support claims, or informed choices. For a framework to be included, there had to be a description of its purpose; a list of concepts, competences, or dispositions; and definitions of key terms. We made independent assessments of framework eligibility and extracted data for each included framework using standardised forms. 
 Results: Twenty-two frameworks met our inclusion criteria. The purpose of the IHC Framework is similar to that of two frameworks for critical thinking and somewhat similar to that of a framework for evidence-based practice. Those frameworks have broader scopes than the IHC Framework. An important limitation of broad frameworks is that they do not provide an adequate basis (concepts) for deciding which claims to believe and what to do. There was at most some overlap between the concepts, competences, and dispositions in each of the 22 included frameworks and those in the IHC Framework. 
 Conclusions: The IHC Key Concepts Framework appears to be unique.&amp;nbsp; Our review has shown how it and other frameworks can be improved by taking account of the ways in which other related frameworks have been developed, evaluated, and made useful.">

  "description": "Background: The Informed Health Choices (IHC) Key Concepts are principles for evaluating the trustworthiness of claims about treatment effects. The Key Concepts provide a framework for developing learning-resources to help people use the concepts when treatment claims are made, and when they make health choices.
Objective: To compare the framework provided by the IHC Key Concepts to other frameworks intended to promote critical thinking about treatment (intervention) claims and choices.
Methods: We identified relevant frameworks from reviews of frameworks, searching Google Scholar, citation searches, and contact with key informants. We included frameworks intended to provide a structure for teaching or learning to think critically about the basis for claims, evidence used to support claims, or informed choices. For a framework to be included, there had to be a description of its purpose; a list of concepts, competences, or dispositions; and definitions of key terms. We made independent assessments of framework eligibility and extracted data for each included framework using standardised forms.
Results: Twenty-two frameworks met our inclusion criteria. The purpose of the IHC Framework is similar to that of two frameworks for critical thinking and somewhat similar to that of a framework for evidence-based practice. Those frameworks have broader scopes than the IHC Framework. An important limitation of broad frameworks is that they do not provide an adequate basis (concepts) for deciding which claims to believe and what to do. There was at most some overlap between the concepts, competences, and dispositions in each of the 22 included frameworks and those in the IHC Framework.
Conclusions: The IHC Key Concepts Framework appears to be unique.  Our review has shown how it and other frameworks can be improved by taking account of the ways in which other related frameworks have been developed, evaluated, and made useful."

The Key Concepts provide a framework for developing learning-resources to help people use the concepts when treatment claims are made, and when they make health choices.<br/> <b>Objective: </b>To compare the framework provided by the IHC Key Concepts to other frameworks intended to promote critical thinking about treatment (intervention) claims and choices.<br/> <b>Methods:</b> We identified relevant frameworks from reviews of frameworks, searching Google Scholar, citation searches, and contact with key informants. We included frameworks intended to provide a structure for teaching or learning to think critically about the basis for claims, evidence used to support claims, or informed choices. For a framework to be included, there had to be a description of its purpose; a list of concepts, competences, or dispositions; and definitions of key terms. We made independent assessments of framework eligibility and extracted data for each included framework using standardised forms.<br/> <b>Results: </b>Twenty-two frameworks met our inclusion criteria. The purpose of the IHC Framework is similar to that of two frameworks for critical thinking and somewhat similar to that of a framework for evidence-based practice. Those frameworks have broader scopes than the IHC Framework. An important limitation of broad frameworks is that they do not provide an adequate basis (concepts) for deciding which claims to believe and what to do. There was at most some overlap between the concepts, competences, and dispositions in each of the 22 included frameworks and those in the IHC Framework.<br/> <b>Conclusions: </b>The IHC Key Concepts Framework appears to be unique.&nbsp; Our review has shown how it and other frameworks can be improved by taking account of the ways in which other related frameworks have been developed, evaluated, and made useful. </div> <div class=abstract-for-mobile> <div class="margin-top-30 padding-bottom-30 research-layout is-centered"> <button class="primary orange-text white-bg bigger-text abstract-expand-button-mobile with-border show" style="display: none;"> READ ALL <span class="f1r-icon icon-14_more_small orange vmiddle big"></span> </button> <button class="primary orange-text white-bg bigger-text abstract-expand-button-mobile with-border hide"> READ LESS <span class="f1r-icon icon-10_less_small orange vmiddle big"></span> </button> </div> </div> </div> <div class=clearfix></div> <div class="article-context no-divider"> <div class="article-abstract article-page-general-text-mobile research-layout generated-article-body"> <h2 class=main-title>Keywords</h2> <p class="u-mb--0 u-pb--2"> critical thinking, evidence-informed decision-making, evidence-based practice, evidence informed decision-making, argumentation, causal inference, cognitive biases, epistemic cognition, health literacy, logical fallacies, meta-cognition, scientific thinking, frameworks, models, concepts, competences, concepts </p> </div> </div> <div class=article-information> <span class="info-separation padding-bottom"> <div id=corresponding-author-icon class="email-icon float-left"> <span class="f1r-icon icon-6_email orange"></span> <div id=corresponding-author-window class="margin-top-20 popup-window-wrapper is-hidden"> <div class="popup-window corresponding-authors-popup"> <div class=corresponding-author-container> <div class="popup-window-title small">Corresponding Author(s)</div> <div class=authors> Andrew D.

They are found in the mass media, advertisements, and everyday personal communication. Some are based on trustworthy evidence. Many are not, and many people have difficulties determining which claims to believe and act on. Acting on untrustworthy claims and not acting on ones that are trustworthy can result in unnecessary suffering and waste.</p><p class="" id=d3365e200>In response to these challenges, we developed the Informed Health Choices (IHC) Key Concepts as the first step in the IHC project<sup><a href="#ref-1">1</a>–<a href="#ref-4">4</a></sup>. The aim of the IHC project is to help people, particularly primary and secondary school students, learn to assess treatment claims and make informed health choices<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a></sup>.</p><p class="" id=d3365e214>We use ‘treatment’ to refer to any intervention or action intended to protect or improve health<sup><a href="#ref-6">6</a></sup>. People in other fields have found the IHC Key Concepts relevant for assessing claims about the effects of other types of interventions<sup><a href="#ref-7">7</a></sup>. This includes agricultural, educational, environmental, management, social welfare, economic, international development, nutrition, policing, and veterinary interventions.</p><p class="" id=d3365e225>The IHC Key Concepts provide a framework for designing curricula, learning resources, and evaluation tools<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-8">8</a></sup>. We first published the framework in 2015<sup><a href="#ref-1">1</a></sup> and have continued to update it yearly. The current (2019) framework includes 49 concepts in three groups (<a href="#T1">Table 1</a>), 20 competences in four groups (<a href="#T2">Table 2</a>), and 16 dispositions in four groups (<a href="#T3">Table 3</a>)<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a></sup>. The concepts are principles for evaluating the trustworthiness of treatment claims and the evidence used to support these, and for making informed choices. The methods used to develop the framework are described elsewhere<sup><a href="#ref-1">1</a>,<a href="#ref-3">3</a></sup>. The framework is a starting point to help teachers, journalists, researchers and other intermediaries to identify and develop resources to help people learn to assess treatment claims and make informed choices.</p><a name=T1 class=n-a></a><div class="table-wrap panel clearfix"><div class=caption><h3>Table 1.

These include critical thinking frameworks, logical fallacies and argumentation frameworks, cognitive frameworks, frameworks for scientific thinking, and frameworks related to evidence-based health care. For each category of frameworks there are disagreements about definitions and what is included. For example, learning to think critically is widely held as an aim of education<sup><a href="#ref-9">9</a></sup>, but there is not agreement on the definition of “critical thinking” and there are several different frameworks (conceptual structures intended to serve as a support or guide) for critical thinking<sup><a href="#ref-10">10</a>–<a href="#ref-14">14</a></sup>. Similarly, there are different definitions and frameworks for scientific thinking (reasoning and literacy)<sup><a href="#ref-15">15</a>–<a href="#ref-18">18</a></sup>, epistemic cognition and meta-cognition<sup><a href="#ref-19">19</a>,<a href="#ref-20">20</a></sup>, health literacy<sup><a href="#ref-21">21</a>–<a href="#ref-23">23</a></sup>, and various aspects of evidence-based health care<sup><a href="#ref-24">24</a>–<a href="#ref-26">26</a></sup>.

Two frameworks had a similar purpose: Ennis’ <i>taxonomy of critical thinking dispositions and abilities</i><sup><a href="#ref-12">12</a>,<a href="#ref-50">50</a>–<a href="#ref-59">59</a></sup> and Baron’s <i>model of the good thinker</i><sup><a href="#ref-12">12</a>,<a href="#ref-36">36</a>,<a href="#ref-69">69</a>–<a href="#ref-75">75</a></sup>. Ennis’ goal is for students to learn to think critically about what to believe or do. Baron’s goal is for students to learn to think more rationally, that is, in a way that helps them to achieve their goals. Both those goals are broader than that of the IHC Key Concepts Framework, which is to enable people to make informed decisions about which claims to believe about the effects of things they can do (interventions) for their health, the health of others or for other reasons, and about what to do to achieve their goals<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a></sup>. The purposes of the two other critical thinking frameworks that we included (the <i>Model of critical thinking</i> and <i>List of critical thinking skills</i>) were also somewhat like the purpose of the IHC Key Concepts Framework.</p><a name=T8 class=n-a></a><div class="table-wrap panel clearfix"><div class=caption><h3>Table 8.

Although the IHC framework focuses specifically on critical thinking about health effects and choices, the same Key Concepts can be applied to many other types of interventions (actions) and decisions<sup><a href="#ref-7">7</a></sup>. Because achieving our goals depends on what we do (actions), deciding what to believe about the possible effects of our actions and what to do is at the centre of critical thinking. However, critical thinking also applies to many other types of beliefs, such as beliefs about religion, history, or art.</p><a name=f2 class=n-a></a><div class="fig panel clearfix"><a target=_blank href="https://f1000researchdata.s3.amazonaws.com/manuscripts/24099/830bc12c-700a-4d97-97cd-08b073bf894f_figure2.gif"><img alt="830bc12c-700a-4d97-97cd-08b073bf894f_figure2.gif" src="https://f1000researchdata.s3.amazonaws.com/manuscripts/24099/830bc12c-700a-4d97-97cd-08b073bf894f_figure2.gif"></a><div class=caption><h3>Figure 2.

Our formulation of that goal was influenced by how Ennis and Baron formulated their goals. We have adapted Baron’s definition of a “good decision”<sup><a href="#ref-36">36</a></sup> to explain what this means: a good decision is one that makes effective use of the information available to the decision maker at the time the decision is made. A good outcome is one that the decision maker likes. The aim of thinking critically about treatments is to increase the probability of good outcomes (and true conclusions), but many other factors affect outcomes aside from critical thinking.</p><p class="" id=d3365e4869>The purpose of one of the logic and argumentation frameworks that we included had a somewhat similar purpose to that of the IHC Key Concepts Framework. The <i>evidence-based reasoning framework</i><sup><a href="#ref-87">87</a></sup> was developed as an analytic tool intended as a foundation for assessing students’ ability to reason from evidence in writing and classroom discussions. The relationship between argumentation – critical evaluation of arguments – and the IHC Key Concepts Framework is illustrated in <a href="#f3">Figure 3</a>. The purposes of four of the evidence-based health care frameworks were also somewhat similar to the purpose of the IHC Key Concepts Framework: health literacy<sup><a href="#ref-21">21</a>–<a href="#ref-23">23</a>,<a href="#ref-145">145</a>–<a href="#ref-149">149</a></sup>, the <i>Evidence-based practice (EBP) core competencies</i><sup><a href="#ref-26">26</a></sup>, <i>GRADE</i><sup><a href="#ref-25">25</a>,<a href="#ref-30">30</a>,<a href="#ref-154">154</a>–<a href="#ref-160">160</a></sup>, and critical appraisal tools<sup><a href="#ref-29">29</a>,<a href="#ref-166">166</a>–<a href="#ref-179">179</a></sup>.</p><a name=f3 class=n-a></a><div class="fig panel clearfix"><a target=_blank href="https://f1000researchdata.s3.amazonaws.com/manuscripts/24099/830bc12c-700a-4d97-97cd-08b073bf894f_figure3.gif"><img alt="830bc12c-700a-4d97-97cd-08b073bf894f_figure3.gif" src="https://f1000researchdata.s3.amazonaws.com/manuscripts/24099/830bc12c-700a-4d97-97cd-08b073bf894f_figure3.gif"></a><div class=caption><h3>Figure 3.

Evidence-based practice is a framework for health professionals, whereas the IHC Key Concepts Framework is for young people, patients and the public, and policymakers, as well as health professionals. Evidence-based practice is a broader framework, which includes critical appraisal of other types of evidence besides evidence of effects. It also includes formulating clinical questions, acquiring evidence, and evaluating performance, which are largely outside of the scope of the IHC Key Concepts Framework. The aim of evidence-based practice is to improve health outcomes, and that depends on what health professionals, patients and the public do. Thus, the IHC Key Concepts Framework – critical thinking about effects and choices – is at the centre of evidence-based practice, in much the same way as it is at the centre of critical thinking.</p><a name=f4 class=n-a></a><div class="fig panel clearfix"><a target=_blank href="https://f1000researchdata.s3.amazonaws.com/manuscripts/24099/830bc12c-700a-4d97-97cd-08b073bf894f_figure4.gif"><img alt="830bc12c-700a-4d97-97cd-08b073bf894f_figure4.gif" src="https://f1000researchdata.s3.amazonaws.com/manuscripts/24099/830bc12c-700a-4d97-97cd-08b073bf894f_figure4.gif"></a><div class=caption><h3>Figure 4.

However, most logical fallacies are not directly relevant to this.

Ennis aimed to produce a taxonomy which enables critical<br class=br>thinking to be used practically. He says that his taxonomy is ‘simple and<br class=br>comprehensible’ and considers that it can be implemented successfully in<br class=br>different ways, though he acknowledges that it needs further research to<br class=br>validate detailed aspects<sup><a href="#ref-12">12</a></sup>.</td></tr><tr><a name=d3365e6299 class=n-a></a><td align=left colspan=1 rowspan=1 valign=top><a name=d3365e6301 class=n-a></a>Model of critical<br class=br>thinking</td><td align=center colspan=1 rowspan=1 valign=top><a name=d3365e6306 class=n-a></a>No</td><td colspan=1 rowspan=1><a name=d3365e6309 class=n-a></a></td><td align=center colspan=1 rowspan=1 valign=top><a name=d3365e6311 class=n-a></a>Yes</td><td align=left colspan=1 rowspan=1 valign=top><a name=d3365e6314 class=n-a></a>Paul's lists of abilities and traits do not have any significant omissions<br class=br>when compared with those of Ennis or Perkins, Jay and Tishman.

The model is extremely flexible,<br class=br>applicable to any subject matter and to any level of thinking. Paul’s major<br class=br>contribution to the area of critical thinking is his idea of ‘weak’ versus<br class=br>‘strong sense’ critical thinking. The latter is what Paul refers to as the ability<br class=br>to discover and contest one’s own egocentric and socio-centric habits<br class=br>of thought. Paul claims that his nine traits of thought, which are moral<br class=br>commitments and intellectual virtues, transfer thinking from ‘a selfish,<br class=br>narrow-minded foundation to a broad open-minded foundation’<sup><a href="#ref-12">12</a></sup>.</td></tr><tr><a name=d3365e6346 class=n-a></a><td align=left colspan=1 rowspan=1 valign=top><a name=d3365e6348 class=n-a></a>List of critical<br class=br>thinking skills</td><td align=center colspan=1 rowspan=1 valign=top><a name=d3365e6353 class=n-a></a>No</td><td colspan=1 rowspan=1><a name=d3365e6356 class=n-a></a></td><td align=center colspan=1 rowspan=1 valign=top><a name=d3365e6358 class=n-a></a>Yes</td><td align=left colspan=1 rowspan=1 valign=top><a name=d3365e6361 class=n-a></a>Halpern does not claim to have provided comprehensive lists of critical<br class=br>thinking skills. It is possible to identify many gaps in her lists. More than<br class=br>any author whose work we have reviewed, Halpern has endeavoured<br class=br>to translate theory and research from cognitive psychology into a form<br class=br>where it can be useful in everyday life. There is up-to-date teaching<br class=br>material to accompany the main text. She has also drawn on relevant<br class=br>sources outside psychology. Halpern is a strong believer in the application<br class=br>of rational methods in problem-solving, including the use of<br class=br>controlled experiments. She points to the need for people to learn how to learn and to<br class=br>be critically selective in responding to the barrage of information (including<br class=br>advertisements and political rhetoric) around them. She argues that<br class=br>teaching and assessing critical thinking will improve the quality of teaching<br class=br>and learning at college level and will increase social capital and economic<br class=br>competitiveness. These are pragmatic arguments, in support of which she<br class=br>cites several studies to illustrate the transferability of critical thinking skills<sup><a href="#ref-12">12</a></sup>.</td></tr><tr><a name=d3365e6399 class=n-a></a><td align=left colspan=1 rowspan=1 valign=top><a name=d3365e6401 class=n-a></a>Model of the good<br class=br>thinker</td><td align=center colspan=1 rowspan=1 valign=top><a name=d3365e6406 class=n-a></a>No</td><td colspan=1 rowspan=1><a name=d3365e6409 class=n-a></a></td><td align=center colspan=1 rowspan=1 valign=top><a name=d3365e6411 class=n-a></a>Yes</td><td align=left colspan=1 rowspan=1 valign=top><a name=d3365e6414 class=n-a></a>When compared with other critical thinking theorists, there are some<br class=br>serious gaps in their enumeration of the qualities of a good thinker.<br class=br>Empathy, humility, respect for other points of view, clarity and integrity<br class=br>are signally absent.

Few critical appraisal tools had<br class=br>documented evidence of validity of their items, or reliability<br class=br>of use. Face validity was established in nine critical appraisal<br class=br>tools, seven of which were developed for use on experimental<br class=br>studies and two for systematic reviews. Intra-rater reliability<br class=br>was established for only one critical appraisal tool as part<br class=br>of its empirical development process, whereas inter-rater<br class=br>reliability was reported for two systematic review tools (for one<br class=br>of these as part of the developmental process) and seven<br class=br>experimental critical appraisal tools (for two of these as part<br class=br>of the developmental process).<br class=br><br class=br> Hyde<sup><a href="#ref-175">175</a></sup> reported a systematic review of evaluations of the<br class=br>effects of critical appraisal workshops, most of which use<br class=br>checklists. Sixteen studies met the inclusion criteria. One<br class=br>study was an RCT, 8 were non-randomised between group<br class=br>studies, and 7 were before-and-after studies. The impact of<br class=br>critical appraisal teaching on clinicians’ behaviour (principally<br class=br>reading behaviour) was mixed. Of the eight comparisons for<br class=br>this outcome six had major threats to validity. Most, but not<br class=br>all, of the comparisons showed benefit of critical appraisal<br class=br>teaching, two acting in the opposite direction. Critical appraisal<br class=br>teaching was seen to consistently increase skills: fourteen of<br class=br>the sixteen comparisons for this outcome showed a positive<br class=br>effect. The strength of the effect remained when self-assessed<br class=br>comparisons were removed. Five comparisons were thought<br class=br>not to be subject to major flaws: four of these indicated a benefit<br class=br>of critical appraisal teaching. The strongest and most consistent<br class=br>impact of critical appraisal teaching was seen on knowledge<br class=br>outcomes: 7 of the 12 studies showed a statistically significant<br class=br>positive effect. However, consideration of the size of the benefit<br class=br>revealed heterogeneity. There were four comparisons of the<br class=br>impact on attitudes - all were positive, but it was not possible<br class=br>to separate out real effects from a tendency for participants to<br class=br>respond in a “desired” manner. There were inadequate data to<br class=br>assess whether there was variation in outcome according to the<br class=br>mode of delivery of the educational intervention.<br class=br><br class=br> </td><td align=center colspan=1 rowspan=1 valign=top><a name=d3365e7525 class=n-a></a>Yes</td><td align=left colspan=1 rowspan=1 valign=top><a name=d3365e7528 class=n-a></a>There is variation among available critical appraisal tools.</td></tr><tr><a name=d3365e7532 class=n-a></a><td align=left colspan=1 rowspan=1 valign=top><a name=d3365e7534 class=n-a></a>Risk of bias</td><td align=center colspan=1 rowspan=1 valign=top><a name=d3365e7537 class=n-a></a>Yes</td><td align=left colspan=1 rowspan=1 valign=top><a name=d3365e7540 class=n-a></a>West <i>et al.</i><sup><a href="#ref-185">185</a></sup> and Bai <i>et al.</i><sup><a href="#ref-181">181</a></sup> assessed whether instruments<br class=br>considered all or most of the elements for each domain and<br class=br>did not omit any element defined as essential.

Only one framework, the <i>framework for K-12 science education,</i> had clear inclusion criteria for one of three dimensions (“core ideas”). We judged the elements to be coherent in five frameworks, distinct in nine, and organised logically in eight. There were no inappropriate elements in seven frameworks and no missing elements in two. Overall, the <i>evidence-based reasoning framework</i><sup><a href="#ref-86">86</a></sup> was the only framework that we assessed positively for all five criteria (coherent elements, distinct elements, no inappropriate elements, no missing elements, and logical grouping of the elements).

We found evidence that most of the frameworks were being used. For four (the <i>taxonomy of concepts and critical abilities related to the evaluation of verbal arguments</i>, the <i>evidence-based reasoning framework</i>, the <i>AIR model of epistemic cognition</i>, and the <i>model for scientific thinking</i>) we found little evidence of use. Two had only been available for one or two years (the <i>evidence-based practice core competences</i> and the C<i>atalogue of Biases</i>), and we were uncertain about their use. Twelve of the frameworks appeared to be intended primarily for teachers and students, and we found learning resources based on 14 of the frameworks.</p><p class="" id=d3365e8598>Nine of the frameworks appeared to be intended primarily for researchers. One (the <i>evidence-based practice core competences</i>) appeared to be intended primarily for curriculum developers<sup><a href="#ref-26">26</a></sup>. We found at least some evidence that six other frameworks were used for curriculum development, including three of the critical thinking frameworks. We found evidence that 12 of the frameworks were used as the basis for one or more assessment tools. Other ways in which the frameworks have been used or have been proposed for use include: self-teaching; by parents, institutions, and government; by employers developing training programs; professional development; establishing norms or standards; developing ways of protecting against cognitive biases; theory development; intervention design; policy advice; and reporting standards.</p></div><div class=section><a name=d3365e8609 class=n-a></a><h3 class=section-title>Strengths and weaknesses of the frameworks</h3><p class="" id=d3365e8614>Strengths and weaknesses of each framework and ideas for further development of the IHC Key Concepts Framework are summarised in <a href="#T12">Table 12</a>.

These include making the evidence that supports each IHC Key Concept explicit, including evidence of the extent to which each IHC Key Concept is not widely understood or applied; designing a website to popularise teaching and learning about, understanding of, and application of the IHC Key Concepts Framework; and developing a visual model of the IHC Key Concepts Framework.</p><p class="" id=d3365e9935>Overall, our review of the concepts, competences, and dispositions in the 22 frameworks led us to add four new concepts to the IHC Key Concepts Framework, to modify 16, and to add 10 new competences and four new dispositions<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a></sup>.</p></div></div><div id=article1-body class=generated-article-body><h2 class=main-title id=d3365e9946>Discussion</h2><p class="" id=d3365e9949>We identified 22 frameworks that overlap with the IHC Key Concepts Framework. We found that the purpose of the IHC Key Concepts Framework is most like two frameworks for critical thinking: Ennis’ <i>taxonomy of critical thinking dispositions and abilities</i> and Baron’s <i>model of the good thinker</i>. However, in terms of concepts and competences, there was more overlap with Halpern’s <i>list of critical thinking skills</i>. Although the IHC framework drew on evidence-based health care frameworks, there was at most some similarity with the purposes of those frameworks and the purpose of the IHC Key Concepts Framework. There was some overlap in terms of concepts with GRADE, critical appraisal tools, and the <i>Catalogue of Bias</i>. There was overlap in terms of competences with health literacy, the <i>evidence-based practice core competences</i>, and critical appraisal tools.</p><p class="" id=d3365e9967>We found the IHC Key Concepts Framework to be central to critical thinking and evidence-based practice, both of which have broader scopes than the IHC Key Concepts Framework. An important weakness we found with these and other broad frameworks, such as those that focus on argumentation, is that they do not provide an adequate basis (concepts) for thinking critically about claims about the effects of interventions and decisions about what to do. As noted by Dewey: “It would be impossible to over-estimate the educational importance of arriving at conceptions: that is, meanings that are general because applicable in a great variety of different instances in spite of their difference. They are known points of reference by which we get our bearings when we are plunged into the strange and unknown. Without this conceptualizing, nothing is gained that can be carried over to the better understanding of new experiences”<sup><a href="#ref-196">196</a></sup>. The IHC Key Concepts are applicable to a great variety of claims about the effects of interventions, not just health interventions<sup><a href="#ref-7">7</a></sup>, and they are essential points of reference for deciding which claims to believe and what to do.</p><p class="" id=d3365e9978>We did not find any overlap between the IHC Key Concepts and those included in the <i>framework for K-12 science education,</i> and little overlap in the competences. That framework places little focus on applied science, practical understanding and use of science by non-scientists, and what children will remember and make use of in their daily lives. This may be the case for many national science curricula.</p><p class="" id=d3365e9984>Our review has helped us to clarify the goal of the IHC Key Concepts Framework and led us to add four new concepts, 10 new competences, and four new dispositions. In addition, we have identified ways in which we can improve the methods we use to further develop and evaluate the IHC Key Concepts Framework and make it more useful.</p><p class="" id=d3365e9988>Previous systematic and unsystematic reviews have reviewed different types of frameworks with similar purposes, including frameworks for cognitive biases<sup><a href="#ref-190">190</a></sup>, epistemic cognition<sup><a href="#ref-42">42</a></sup>, health literacy<sup><a href="#ref-22">22</a></sup>, assessments of the certainty of evidence and recommendations or decisions<sup><a href="#ref-24">24</a>,<a href="#ref-157">157</a>,<a href="#ref-193">193</a></sup>, causal inference<sup><a href="#ref-162">162</a></sup>, critical appraisal<sup><a href="#ref-29">29</a></sup>, and assessment of the risk of bias<sup><a href="#ref-181">181</a>,<a href="#ref-185">185</a></sup>. Moseley and colleagues<sup><a href="#ref-12">12</a></sup> conducted a comprehensive review of frameworks for thinking, which overlaps with and informed our review. However, we are unaware of other reviews with the same scope as this review, whether in terms of the included frameworks or the data that were collected for each included framework.</p><p class="" id=d3365e10033>We used explicit inclusion criteria for frameworks and two review authors independently collected data from included frameworks using a data collection form. Both the eligibility assessments and the data collection required judgement. Although we frequently disagreed, most of our disagreements were minor and all our disagreements were easily resolved. We did not conduct an exhaustive search for relevant frameworks. There may be other frameworks that meet our inclusion criteria. It is possible that other frameworks could add to our findings, but unlikely that they would otherwise substantially change the findings of this review.</p></div><div id=article1-body class=generated-article-body><h2 class=main-title id=d3365e10040>Conclusions</h2><p class="" id=d3365e10043>As defined by Moseley and colleagues: “Framework is a general term for a structure that provides support”<sup><a href="#ref-12">12</a></sup>. We have systematically considered 22 frameworks that are relevant to supporting critical thinking about claims about the effects of interventions (actions), comparisons (evidence used to support those claims), and decisions about what to do. We have found that the IHC Key Concepts Framework is unique and that it can be improved by building on the ways in which other related frameworks have been developed, evaluated, and made useful. Much of what we have found can also inform the development and evaluation of other frameworks.</p></div><div id=article1-body class=generated-article-body><h2 class=main-title id=d3365e10053>Data availability</h2><div class=section><a name=d3365e10056 class=n-a></a><h3 class=section-title>Underlying data</h3><p class="" id=d3365e10061>All data underlying the results are available as part of the article and no additional source data are required.</p></div><div class=section><a name=d3365e10065 class=n-a></a><h3 class=section-title>Extended data</h3><p class="" id=d3365e10070>Norwegian Centre for Research Data, Enabling Sustainable Public Engagement in Improving Health and Health Equity, <a target=xrefwindow href="https://doi.org/10.18712/NSD-NSD2817-V1" id=d3365e10072>https://doi.org/10.18712/NSD-NSD2817-V1</a><sup><a href="#ref-197">197</a></sup>.</p><p class="" id=d3365e10079>This project contains the following extended data:</p><div class=list><a name=d3365e10082 class=n-a></a><ul style="list-style-type: none"><li><p id=d3365e10089><span class=label>- </span> File 1: Search strategy</p></li><li><p id=d3365e10098><span class=label>- </span> File 2: Critical thinking frameworks eligibility form</p></li><li><p id=d3365e10107><span class=label>- </span> File 3: Critical thinking frameworks data collection form</p></li><li><p id=d3365e10116><span class=label>- </span> File 4: Use of the frameworks</p></li><li><p id=d3365e10125><span class=label>- </span> File 5: PRISMA checklist</p></li></ul></div><p class="" id=d3365e10130>Data are available under the terms of the <a target=xrefwindow href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode" id=d3365e10132>Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license</a> (CC-BY 4.0).</p></div><div class=section><a name=d3365e10137 class=n-a></a><h3 class=section-title>Reporting guidelines</h3><p class="" id=d3365e10142>The PRISMA checklist for ‘Comparison of the Informed Health Choices Key Concepts Framework to other frameworks relevant to teaching and learning how to think critically about health claims and choices: a systematic review’, <a target=xrefwindow href="https://doi.org/10.18712/NSD-NSD2817-V1" id=d3365e10144>https://doi.org/10.18712/NSD-NSD2817-V1</a><sup><a href="#ref-197">197</a></sup>.</p><p class="" id=d3365e10151>Information about this dataset can be found in English here: <a target=xrefwindow href="http://nsddata.nsd.uib.no/webview/index.jsp?v=2&amp;submode=ddi&amp;study=http%3A%2F%2Fnsddata.nsd.uib.no%2Fobj%2FfStudy%2FNSD2817&amp;mode=documentation" id=d3365e10153>http://nsddata.nsd.uib.no/webview/index.jsp?v=2&amp;submode=ddi&amp;study=http%3A%2F%2Fnsddata.nsd.uib.no%2Fobj%2FfStudy%2FNSD2817&amp;mode=documentation</a></p></div></div><div id=article1-back class=generated-article-footer><div class=back-section><a name=d3365e10161 class=n-a></a><h2 class=main-title id=d3365e10163>Acknowledgments</h2><p class="" id=d3365e10166>We would like to thank Astrid Dahlgren, Iain Chalmers, and Joe Chislett for comments on the protocol;
