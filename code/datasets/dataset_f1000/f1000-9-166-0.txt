 Key Words Only the following can be considered key words : Van der Woude, congenital lip pits, autosomal dominant, trismus, absent uvula Case Presentation Abbreviations used must be explained e.g. HEENT, G3P1011 “Trismus” is a very important finding yet it was described and also not demonstrated in the picture. Trismus was mentioned because it was limiting visualisation of the oropharynx. No muscle is in spasm, preventing mouth opening. What is being described as trismus is actually syngnatia, a condition caused by fibrous or bony adhesions between the mandible and the maxilla, which is rare finding in patients with Van der Woude syndrome( Ref. No.6). The patient has a high arching submucosal cleft palate and an absent uvula. The uvula is absent because the soft palate is also cleft. In a cleft of the soft palate the uvula is absent. It can be recreated only at surgery. Discussion In the discussion of the neonate with cleft palate with respiratory obstruction and whose respiratory distress improves when nursed in the prone position, the differential diagnosis should not be limited to Van der Woude syndrome. The Pierre Robin Syndrome (sequence) is the first to be considered. These patients have micrognatia (small chin), glossoptosis, cleft palate and neo-natal respiratory obstruction. Speech therapy by age ten is too late. Speech development begins at six months of age. Speech therapy should start by age one No mention was made as to the surgical correction of the submucous cleft palate and uvula which is more likely to cause speech problems. The title of the paper should read: Van de Woude Syndrome with syngnathia: a rare presentation
