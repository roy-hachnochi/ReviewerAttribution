I think that section headings must describe the section contents and not be a reference, pointing to some portion of a Figure in the article. For example: ‘ Note 1. The “other causes” . This may be changed to The “other causes”. (See Note 1). This is only a suggestion. The manuscript is acceptable even if this change is not incorporated.
