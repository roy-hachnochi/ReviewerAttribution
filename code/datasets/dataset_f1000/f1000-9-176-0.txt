This article describes first derivative ATR-FTIR spectroscopic method as a green tool for quantitative determination of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug diclofenac sodium in its tablet dosage form. The proposed validated method is a new green analytical technique as it avoids use of organic solvents or tedious extraction methods. The article expresses all the necessary scientific parameters for quantitative analysis. The procedure can be applied simply for other similar applications. The simplicity and low cost of the technique offer advantages over other analytical methods in the area of drug analysis. Statistical evaluation of data are sufficient and represents clearly the precision as well as accuracy.
