Overall, the authors did the correction according to the comments and suggestions. However, I have another one more question on wound healing assay. Why only methanolic extract tested for wound healing since ethyl acetate extract showed activity for all tested bacteria and also had the highest DPPH activity? Anti-bacteria and antioxidant contribute greatly in wound healing process, so why ethyl acetate extract has not tested for wound healing in this case?
