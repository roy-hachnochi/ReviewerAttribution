I think that this manuscript is addressing a very important gap in knowledge that is relevant for the current ‘treat all’ recommendations. They accessed the gaps in routine viral load monitoring at six months for children and adolescents who initiated antiretroviral therapy in a hospital in Zimbabwe. Their sample number is good enough for this analysis. The manuscript is very well written, it is very clear and concise. The study was based on analysis of secondary data which was approved by IRB. I only have one comment that need clarification- the authors keep comparing their analysis with a study done in Harare and it is not clear whether this study that they are comparing to was conducted on adult population or the same population as they describe in their analysis. This needs to be clarified. In addition, they need to explain what could be accounting for the differences found.
