The study reports on viral load monitoring at 6 months for of children and adolescents who were initiated on HIV treatment in a tertiary hospital in Bulawayo. The study is important because of the HIV epidemic in Zimbabwe, and the need to reach the third 90 of UNAIDS 90-90-90 targets. The methodology is sound and clearly reported on. Appropriate statistical analysis is done, and these are aligned with the objectives of the study. Few other sociodemographic and clinical factors were collected and analysed; which is a limitation to the study. This should be indicated. In the discussion, enhanced adherence counseling is mentioned as being implemented in the hospital. However, little information on this is provided in the background. Also, it would be useful if the analysis could report on how many of the current cohort received enhanced adherence counseling.
