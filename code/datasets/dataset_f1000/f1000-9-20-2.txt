In this brief report manuscript, entitled “The effects of microchipping C57BL/6N mice on standard phenotyping tests”, Bains et al. describe the development of a home cage analysis system which tracks activity mouse activity through a RFID microchip placed in the groin in 12 male and 12 female c57bl/6 mice at 7 weeks of age. This is of particular value as RFID microchips can measure a large number of phenotypic responses with frequent measurements over large time periods without handling or stress inducement in the animal. The results demonstrate that importantly, the procedure of chip implantation does not significantly alter across a large number of measurable phenotypic responses - only causing significant changes in measurements of bone density. Overall this is a well written report. I have only minor criticisms relating to the methods: In the husbandry section, it is stated that “While the method of randomisation was simple…”- it is not described. What was the method of randomisation? Are animals sedated or under general anaesthesia for chip insertion? Under the microchipping section, it states “This procedure was performed on sedated mice” but elsewhere in the manuscript general anaesthesia is frequently referenced. It also states “we have found that a combination of these anaesthetics is the most refined method of delivering these scientific data, as this minimizes any acute discomfort the animal may feel after recovering from the general anaesthetic.” There are no details of the manufacturer/source of the RFID chip or software used which would present problems in attempting replication of this experiment.
