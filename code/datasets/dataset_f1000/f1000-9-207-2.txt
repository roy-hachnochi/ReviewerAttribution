Thank you for the chance to review this paper titled “Visualizing highly cited scientific output of Indian physiotherapists: A bibliometric study”. The major strength of this paper is that they have attempted to undertake a study on this title. The title is interesting. The design and outcome measures are appropriate to answer the question and I’m sure a lot of hard work went into conducting this study. Abstract: The search is limited with one database (WOS), what about the other databases? Introduction: The introduction part is superficial. Why is the search duration limited to 1999 – 2018? Methods: How many reviews were collected in the articles and what are their kappa score? Indian physiotherapist means, who works only in India or Indian physiotherapists works throughout the world? Selection criteria should be more specific. Discussion: The strength and the limitations of this study are not mentioned. Conclusion: Rephrase the conclusion and make it more precise and clear.
