This study describes a case of a purulent infection that originated in a dentigerous cyst associated with an ectopic third molar in the maxillary sinus. Three diagnostic methods were utilized in this study. A panoramic radiograph was employed initially, followed by a more accurate imaging technique of CBCT to get more detailed information on the extent of the lesion, and to elicit a more accurate differential diagnosis. Finally a histopathological examination was done to achieve a final diagnosis. Successful treatment outcomes were accompanied by a satisfactory follow-up period, and this further increased the chances for a good prognosis. The term “ectopic eruption” was used throughout the text, however, taking into consideration the age of the patient and the definition of “eruption”, it is preferable to replace it with the term “ectopic tooth”. Literature review was thorough, however, several references were published more than a decade ago. It would be much improved by inclusion of more recent literature, especially case reports that tackle the topic of ectopic third molar in the maxillary sinus, and that take in consideration the young age of the patient. Discussion: first paragraph mentions that exact aetiology is not clear, what do you think the aetiology for ectopic tooth is in your case? Discussion: How many cases of ectopic teeth in the maxillary sinus were reported so far? And how many of them were for third molars? I thank authors for the informative manuscript and the solid treatment plan. I also encourage them to write a literature review on this topic.
