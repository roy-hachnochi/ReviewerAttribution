I believe that the research proposal clearly lays out its objectives and aims. Although there are some minor edits as per the below list: The abstract should specifically mention PICO data extraction rather than data extraction generally. The "Aims" section outlines this but seems to contradict with the more general "Introduction / Objective" section. While the Tsafnat et al. workflow is considered the first, other papers such as Clark et al. (2019) or Macleod et al. for animal testing are a little more current and also fix some of the gaps with Tsafnat. Since there are a few in this area now a reason should be given for the preference. "We plan to run searches for new studies every second month" - There is currently an effort to get this adjusted to bi-monthly as you suggest but the guidelines specify that this should be monthly. Perhaps just a quick sentence acknowledging this and saying that it is excessive for the subject area? The generated search strategy has a specific filter for English / German papers which seems to contradict the more general phrasing of "We will translate non-English reports where feasible". Data sets are obviously not provided as this is an ongoing paper.
