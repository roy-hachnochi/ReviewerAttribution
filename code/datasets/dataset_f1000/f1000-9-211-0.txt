 It is surprising that this manuscript has only one author. This means the lone author did everything from conceiving the ideas, data collection, analysis, writing the manuscript. It has to be confirmed that NO one else has participated in this work. Age ranges in table 1 variables are too narrow to provide useful information on the outcome variable. The analyses are weak perhaps because the design was also weak. When A low post delivery Hb level is considered as a risk for PPH it brings the confusion what would otherwise be expected. Similary, when Ruptured uterus is tested for its association with PPH. Many of the predictors are obviously inherently related to the outcome variable. It is unclear what information this manuscript attempting to bring forth.
