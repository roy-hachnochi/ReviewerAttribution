This Software Tool article, describing a web-based sequence alignment viewer (AlignmentViewer), is well-written and very clearly presented. The introduction nicely motivates the need for this tool, given the many other available alternatives. The main features of the software are clearly explained in the article. The tool in itself seems useful and ran quickly and efficiently when tested on sample data. I have only a few minor comments that may be considered by the authors: Minor: A little bit of detail may be added to the “Sequence space” section. “Two- or three-dimensional sequence space” is at first a bit confusing, as no information has been given at that stage as to what it means. How is UMAP applied to the Hamming distances? Is each sequence first represented by a vector of Hamming distances, with each element corresponding to one of the included sequences? Maybe this can be clarified with a few additional words. The following sentence is somewhat confusing: " Figure 1 shows the main functionalities from AlignmentViewer ( Reguant, 2020 ) explained in more detail in the next subsections.” "This view lets the user examine in depth the alignment.” - should it be “examine the alignment in depth"? When loading an alignment using a somewhat older version of Safari (12.1.2), the “computing conservation” window does not disappear after the operation finishes. This problem was absent in Chrome.
