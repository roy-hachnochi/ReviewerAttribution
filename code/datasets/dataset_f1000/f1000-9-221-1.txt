The authors describe in details the highlights of this study protocol. Pneumococcal disease is one of the main causes of morbidity and mortality in children under 5 years old. In 2018, the number of newborns in China exceeded 15 million, and there is a huge clinical demand for the vaccine. In China, there are two types of vaccines. The first type of vaccine refers to the vaccine provided by the government to public free of charge, and the public shall be vaccinated in accordance with the government's regulations, mainly with the routine immunization vaccine for children and the second type of vaccine refers to the vaccine that is provided by the public at their own expense and voluntarily, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae vaccine. Due to the huge burden of disease and the acknowledgement of protecting the children’s’ health about pneumococcal disease, it also shows the importance and feasibility of this study. I think it be useful to create a comprehensive map of this topic in China. About information sources, the author chooses the China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang Med Online, there are two important Chinese databases. I believe that the integration of these database together with Pubmed will make the future scoping review more complete and perfect. Possible recommendation of future scoping review: In recent years, China's economy has developed rapidly, but the gap of economic level still exists in different regions of China, and the distribution of medical resources will also be affected. Is there known to be differences in education levels or income levels in selected articles? It might be good to discuss what possible other socioeconomic differences might exist in geographical regions that would account for differences in the vaccination rate in the scoping review. The authors describe the objective and material and methods of study clearly.
