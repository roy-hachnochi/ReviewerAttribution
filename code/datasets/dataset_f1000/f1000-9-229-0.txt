The article is well written and I would like to accept it. I do have the following suggestions to improve its overall impact. In figure 1: Addition of a clinical picture showing OSCC would benefit the article. It would be better if PVL is mentioned as a distinct form of oral leukoplakia and not as a destructive form. It would be better if areca nut as a risk factor of OSCC also mentioned separately in heading “Common etiological factor of OSCC”.
