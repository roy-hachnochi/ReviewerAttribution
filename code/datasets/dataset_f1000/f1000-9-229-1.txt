The review on Oral squamous cell carcinoma is a well written comprehensive article. It summarises the aetiology, metastasis and current diagnostic methods of OSCC. It also sheds light on possible use of salivary proteins to aid diagnosis. All the information provided is scientifically valid. I would like the author to review the following minor suggested changes: Recheck reference 1, I have not found any content related to the incidence of OSCC or Head and neck cancer. Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) is one of the leading cause of OSCC. It should be included in the aetiology.
