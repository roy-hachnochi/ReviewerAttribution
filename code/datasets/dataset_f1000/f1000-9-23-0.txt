The article describes the results of large number of thyroid FNA in Sudan where similar studies are scarce. Therefore, this study is useful to give us insight about that area. However, it's not clear to me how the FNA categories were made. The authors talk in the beginning about the use of Bethesda system; which is a 6-tier system (unsatisfactory, benign, atypia of uncertain significance, follicular/Hurthle cell lesions, suspicious and malignant). Then, authors divide their results into 4-tiers only excluding both atypical categories (AUS and susp.). Does that mean they always have a definite diagnosis in cytology? Or these are final results correlating with other parameters in these cases? It is also a well known face that cytology can not discriminate in follicular or Hurthle cell lesions between adenoma and carcinoma. Yet in this article, we see some cases labelled as adenoma or carcinoma, while others are labelled as neoplasm. It's not clear how that distinguishing was made. Is it based on availability of histology in some cases? Or other criteria e.g. lymph node metastasis by radiology? It's also slightly unusual as authors stated that anaplastic carcinoma carcinoma is the most common type in the malignant category. Are there any possible causes? E.g. population selection or criteria used? As authors stated lack of follow-up data or surgical excision data for negative cases is a limitation of this study. However, it was not clear if they have any excision data in other categories. If this data is available, I think that will add to the strength of the study and its reflection of the usefulness of thyroid FNA in making diagnosis.
