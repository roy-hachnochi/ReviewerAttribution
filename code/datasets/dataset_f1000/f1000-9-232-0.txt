In Koppel et al. , the authors propose a SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infected, Removed or Recovered) differential equations model estimating the spread of COVID-19 in the city of Heidelberg. The proposed modelling approach is performed on a closed population with no new entry/leave. As declared by the authors, a more realistic approach could extend the current model with taking into account the scenario where people with different underlying health conditions/immune systems would have an unexpectedly higher rate of susceptibility/infection, or a second scenario where a "recovered" case does not necessarily mean "not susceptible" anymore. However, for the sake of this paper, the deployed model benefits from high robustness which makes it a reliable prediction algorithm. A sensitivity analysis of the model has been performed via applying on a range of assumptions for countermeasures and infection rates. As a result, changing the number of initially infected individuals at the beginning of the pandemic seems to only shift the distribution linearly with no effect on the peak. Considering the limitations in the intensive care unit, a set of policies have been introduced to help the authorities in Germany. While using a well-known robust algorithm, and bearing in mind that this is not supposed to be a methodological research, the paper still lacks some validation tests. A validation test on the existing benchmarking experiment can be carried out in several ways. At the time of this review, there might be access to the real data of COVID-19 spread in Heidelberg in order to compare with the estimated results. Alternatively, the same approach (of course with a different rate of daily infection) could be applied on a data of SARS to test the performance of the model.
