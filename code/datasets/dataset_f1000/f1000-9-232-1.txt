The authors used a compartmental model that they referred to as a SEIR model where they divided the population into four compartments: Susceptible (S), Exposed (E), Infected (I), and Removed (R; Removed == "Recovered" or "Died", hence cannot be reinfected, although this assumption could be modified but for the sake of argument, we will accept that those who recovered could not be reinfected and hence removed). Now the model could be specified differently as their scheme of the equations was not clear to me. The susceptibles pool depleted at a constant rate of exposure (typically mixing rates and rate of contact with another infected person), but they seem to have substituted and mixed up with an SIR model (susceptible, infected, and Recovered/Removed model). S - E - I - R should be the correct order of their model specification, so one way to formulate would be dS/dt = - Rate of Exposed dE/dt = Rate of Exposed - Rate of Infected dI/dt = Rate of Infected - Rate of removal dR/dt = Rate of accumulation of removed persons from the pool But from reading their formulae it does not appear that they went with these equations, nor did they explain the basis or provide a reproducible code. Hence, although the epidemic curves look plausible, it is difficult to interpret how they were specified or their true significance. The authors may want to clarify this aspect of the methods section.
