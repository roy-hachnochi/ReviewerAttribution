Overall, the findings match with Peruvian estimates of the global burden of disease (GBD) in osteoarthritis done by the Peruvian Ministry of Health and the Social Health Insurance in their previous reports over the years. A study strength is that the authors report both methodologies (1994 and 2015) for the global burden of disease estimations, in that sense, they address a gap of knowledge between Peruvian reports. This study contributes to Peruvian GBD estimations especially in chronic non-communicable diseases with great impacts on elderly people.
