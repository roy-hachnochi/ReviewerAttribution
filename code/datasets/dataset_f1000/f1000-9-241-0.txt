 The authors reported a case of PVL that was attributed to the placenta previa itself, despite the absence of moderate/severe decelerations. Similar cases were analyzed together based on Japanese cerebral palsy registration data. In the Discussion, previous researches suggested the possible pathophysiology that placenta previa could induce PVL. However, rather than simply listing suggestions from past cases, the author should specifically describe which of these possibilities are more relevant in relation to this case. Please change the author's name of reference #9 to Kumazaki and describe it in Discussion section.
