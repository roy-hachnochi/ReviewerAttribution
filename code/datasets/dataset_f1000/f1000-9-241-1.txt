I read the article by Suzuki S entitled: "Placenta previa as a risk factor for antenatal- and peripartum periventricular leukomalacia resulting in cerebral palsy in Japan: a retrospective study" with interest. The argument is very interesting but I have some points to highlight in order to improve the manuscript itself: Major issues: The abstract does not reflect in a proper manner the content of the manuscript. In particular, the conclusion in the abstract is a clear overstatement. In fact, the data analyzed in the manuscript do not allow any kind of conclusion about a correlation between placenta previa and neonatal periventricular leukomalacia. In the dataset, only cases of neonatal periventricular leukomalacia without controls are present. For the same reason, the title of the article is also not appropriate, and also the manuscript's main-text itself should be fixed. For the clinical case report, I suggest following the CARE guidelines. Minor issues: A minor issue is that the clarity of the whole manuscript would benefit from a revision of the English language.
