The authors of this case report argue that there is insufficient evidence on the effectiveness of RICE therapy for specific soft tissue injuries. Hence, further development of the intervention for soft tissue injuries is warranted. With that, they presented a case of a professional footballer who suffered a grade II ankle sprain and subsequently treated with six 30-minute foot immersion in hydrogen-rich water (3 L, ~8 ppm). The author concluded that the treatment might be safe and helpful in reducing pain and swelling, and regaining the range of motion after an ankle sprain. It seems that it is the left ankle, as shown in Figure 1, but the authors reported it as right ankle sprain in the text. Further clarification is needed. The treatment was given every 4 hours throughout the 24 hours after injury, and it is reasonable to assume that the nighttime sleep would have been disrupted. Does it represent a feasible and ideal therapy for the athlete? The water temperature for the foot/ankle bath was 20C, how does adding hydrogen-producing magnesium tablets into it help the blood flow? Further explanation of the mechanism for improved blood flow after the treatment is relevant to the understanding of hydrogen medicine in soft tissue injury.
