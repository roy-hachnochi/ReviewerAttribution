I thought there was good documentation of the injury including physical examination, photographs and pain scales. The application of hydrogen water as treatment with reference to schedule and treatment application was well documented and should be repeatable. The ankle injury was to a professional athlete. Was the athlete able to return to athletic competition as soon utilizing the hydrogen water method as would be possible using the more traditional “RICE”, approach to treatment of ankle injuries, primarily sprained ankle injury?
