The authors revised the article carefully and collected different studies using cutting edge methodology. Though, we are a bit confused for repetition of word in study design mentioned on page no-4. Same on page 6 repetition of subgroup analysis, otherwise the paper is well written and structured. However, in our opinion the paper has some shortcomings with regard to some text but it may be accepted.
