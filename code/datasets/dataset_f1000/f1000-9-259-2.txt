 Title: The title is sufficient and reflects the content of the study. Abstract: Well-constructed. Introduction: Adequate. Materials and Methods: Please mention in the Time, site, and sampling or LWRs analyses section that male and female fish were measured/analysis for LWR separately. In the fields observation, it is stated that, the weather condition, tides, and water turbidity are also observed visually during the sampling. Is the observed visual data recorded? If yes, please mention in the result section. Results: Please add field observation results (if the data was recorded as mentioned in the Materials and methods). In the Condition factors section, it mentions about the dry session and rainy session; which dry or rainy session between July and November? Please add information. Discussion: Develop the discussion by mentioning about the relationship between the environment factor and the results of LWRs and CF fishes', ex: what prey and predator of both fish. It is also mentioned in the discussion that the relative weight condition factor also corresponds to fish health conditions, stock estimates, and management levels. This can be an interesting discussion to be developed. Conclusion: Sufficient, but it is better to add a conclusion regarding the condition factors related to the sex (male/female) of both fish. References: Sufficient.
