 Introduction: Some literature stated that CH could be performed bilaterally even though mostly unilateral. It will be more clear if the terminology is used as unilateral CH or CH. The terminology of CH only is referring to the research subjects including both unilateral and bilateral overgrowth. It should be stated consistently from the beginning (from the title). Methods: Too many criteria in determining facial asymmetry which will generate heterogeneous samples that lead to wide variation of samples. It seems the aim of the study to evaluate the dental arch in facial asymmetry subjects, thus extra oral (photography) or skeletal (PA cephalometric) parameter will be enough to differentiate a facial asymmetry. Then TMJ assessment was not correlated to this as well as dental record (posterior crossbite and midline deviation) which in some cases were not inline with the facial or skeletal asymmetry. Data analysis: Data analysis means statistical data analysis. Measurements should be explained as research methods. Measuring a 3-dimensional object will be more accurate by laser or digital device, such as Coordinate Measuring Machine. Result: Wide range of age including growing and non-growing patients. Asymmetry is a result of growth and development. Dividing into two groups will give deeper analysis. Asymmetry is a qualitatively relative comparison between right and left side. This study's aims seem to describe dental arches condition in a facial asymmetry due to CH. So that, the amount of the measurement itself was not really important information. For this instance, categorical data (symmetrical and asymmetrical) would serve a better analysis than quantitative data, and would be emphasizing the intended context consistently,thus developing a sharp conclusion. Otherwise it needed control group for quantitative comparison.
