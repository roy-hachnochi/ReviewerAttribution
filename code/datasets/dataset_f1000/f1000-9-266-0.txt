Globally, I think this paper can be indexed, but I have to make a few remarks on some aspects that I would like the authors to address in the paper before its indexed. When the patient had the primary colon tumour, how was the CEA? It is not registered then, we only know that it was elevated when the cervical mass was noted, three years later. What about colonoscopy? Was it done any time during the three years of follow-up? Or not? And in a cervical mass, apparently a metastatic lymph node, in a patient who had a colon cancer three years before, shouldn’t it be done as part of the patient study? How was the follow-up of the primary tumour done? And how should it be done? This would be a valuable piece of information for this case and its report. A cervical lymphatic metastasis in the left supraclavicular notch can originate virtually anywhere below the diaphragm, in the abdominal cavity and the testis, following the thoracic duct, as it is said. Besides the head and neck, and the left thorax, of course. The Virchow’s node and the Troisier’s sign are very appropriately referred to in the text. Such a metastasis coming from the colon or the rectum is not common, but it is not “unexpected”… I am sure we agree that the colo-rectal cancer prognosis improved a great deal combining an appropriate surgical treatment with an efficacious chemotherapy. It was a pity the patient did not accept chemotherapy twice. Anyway, I think this is the report of an interesting case, that should be indexed, giving further information on supraclavicular metastization.
