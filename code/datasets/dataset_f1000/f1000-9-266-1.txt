The manuscript is accepted in its current form. This is an interesting and well written paper. The radiological and histological documentation is adequately represented in support of the case report. Metastatic cancer in the cervical region is always a challenge to the head and neck specialist, in particular if the primary tumour site is unknown. This paper can be useful especially to a young readership of head and neck surgeons/trainees.
