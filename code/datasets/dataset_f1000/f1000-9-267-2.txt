The article analyzes the effect of the bio-electrospray (BES) technique on human neural stem cells (hNSCs). Although the BES provoked a decrease in hNSC metabolic activity, there was no increase in hNSC death. The differentiated assays were also successful, showing that the BES did not adversely affect the differentiation capacity of the hNSCs or their gene expression. The figures are very illustrative and very well executed. Please correct VERY instead of “VEY well and could….” In the line 1 on the second column of the Introduction. The paper is very well written and it could probably be indexed without additional revision. Having said that, there are a few minor errors which could be adjusted, but they are small details. I have 6 more additional examples if you need them. In the Abstract: “Bio-electrospray (BES) is a jet based” – change to “Bio-electrospraying (BSE)” “…has the ability to form...” – “..has the ability of forming...” “...different hNSC lines..' – '...a number of hNSC lines...” “...from which cells recovered...” – “...from which the cells recovered...” “...as efficiently as controls…” – “...as efficiently as the controls…” “...and oligodentocytes as shown by...” – “...and oligodentrocytes, as shown by...”
