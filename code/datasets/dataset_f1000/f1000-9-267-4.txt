Overall, this study is a report of useful, incremental research. Previous reports, including some by the same lead author, have shown that a range of mammalian cells tolerate BES well. This report effectively says “and so do hNSCs”. Not a surprise (there was no obvious reason that the wouldn't) but a useful thing to know nevertheless. Specific comments: I liked your use of both transported and un-transported controls. In the methods, it would be helpful to have catalogue numbers of all of the biologics (growth factors etc), because these can be purchased in subtly different forms (native, recombinant, etc). Knowing the exact one helps the cause of reproducibility. In the first paragraph of the Introduction, 3 lines up, it would be helpful to know what BES conditions can be altered (otherwise it is hard to make the comparison with the less advantageous techniques mentioned in the subsequent sentence). Methods, 2 nd paragraph, last line – what is N2? If it is the culture supplement that ThermoFisher (and maybe others) sell, please give a reference or at least an explanation. Can you say more about the needle? (eg supplier code) and the field strength (you keep quoting 10kV, but not the distance over which this potential exists). Again, this is for reproducibility. It is also critical that you provide more information about the BES setup (distances etc); assuming this is one you have described in previous publications, you can just cite these publications. But without this information, nobody could reproduce this work. Strictly, the whole manuscript requires careful copy-editing to remove minor errors of punctuation and syntax, but these errors do not make the existing manuscript too hard to understand.
