This study provides an overview of GBV survivors presented to two urban GBV care services. The article is well written, and carries important findings that will help improve GBV service provision in Sri Lankan hospitals. The study explains the types of survivors seeking care, the different types of violence they were experiencing, the health effects of such violence, health seeking behaviors of survivors, etc. According to the study, a large majority had suffered emotional and economic violence, although physical or sexual violence were the reasons for referral to the centers. This finding needs to be highlighted and could be useful for future policy decisions on GBV referrals. The alarming number of suicidal tendencies indicate the need of their urgent psycho-social support along with follow up. However, it is disturbing to note that only 5% came for follow-ups, and only 2 attended a second follow up. This point needs discussion and recommendations should be made to improve GBV follow ups in the GBV care centers.
