The current literature is a well written concise commentary. The title and the abstract precisely summarize the content of the article. The authors provided evidence supporting Raineâ€™s model on the presence of the neural circuitry of antisociality. The concluding paragraph also clearly reflects the author's argument. This commentary would be useful to design or establish further research or hypothetical model regarding the insula, cingulate cortex, and striatum regions as parts of the neural network of morality or antisociality. (there are some typos (circutries) in the manuscript).
