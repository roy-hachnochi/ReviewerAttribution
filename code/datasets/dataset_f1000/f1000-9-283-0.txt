Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a worldwide pandemic that has been affecting Portugal since 2 March 2020. The Portuguese government has been making efforts to contradict the exponential growth through social isolation measures. In this regard, the authors have developed a mathematical model to predict the impact of such measures in the number of infected cases and peak of infection. They have estimated the peak to be around 2 million infected cases by the beginning of May if no additional measures are taken. The model shows that current measures effectively isolated 25-30% of the population, contributing to some reduction in the infection peak. Importantly, their simulations showed that the infection burden can be further reduced with a higher isolation degree, providing information for a second intervention. The considered study is interesting in this regard and has the potential to give some sound information about COVID-19. The work is good but there are some issues to be addressed: Provide the existence of the model. What is the feasible region for the considered model? Also, simulate the model for a long time that is months, 40 days, etc. What techniques for numerical simulation have been used? Some relevant and recent work in this regard also must be included.
