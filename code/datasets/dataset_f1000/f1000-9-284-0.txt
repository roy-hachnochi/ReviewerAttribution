I read with great interest the paper titled 'Use of strictureplasty technique for surgical treatment of ileal endometriosis: a case series'. The Authors explain very clearly a new technique to remove ileal endometriosis nodules. This technique, called strictureplasty, derives from the experience of general surgeons in the treatment of Crohn's disease. The Authors report two patients treated with this technique who have had excellent results without post-operative complications and recurrence after 12 months of follow up. Excellent job!
