I read with great interest the report written by Med Amine Mesrati et al. about a case of sudden death due to cardiac hydatic cyst of the right ventricle. Only few similar cases were reported in the literature. The authors attributed the sudden death to ventricular arrhythmia. I think that other causes, such as anaphylactic shock (although the cyst was intact) or pulmonary embolism or right ventricular obstruction are not excluded based on the lack of some data, especially imaging exams. Additionally, other cyst locations, such as cerebral or renal, should be excluded by authors (only lungs and liver were reported) to confirm the cardiac etiology of the death.
