 The study was designed to answer the question on uptake and retention comparing the before treat all period to the treat all period. Statistically speaking the analysis was well done and reflects the pure data analysis as well as the outcome of the analysis. The paper lacks a clear disclaimer of the limitation(s) of the study. No information on the lack of tracing one patient from one clinic to the other as soon as they get outside the ePMS. Lack of information on the mobility of patients in the city and the country in general. Lack of information on how easy or difficult it is to enroll in a new clinic. The lack of patient unique identifier outside the ePMS clinics. The difficulty when you reach the 80% enrolment to find the last 20%. No comparative analysis on how easy or difficult the enrolment and the treatment was within Harare between the before treat all period to the treat all period. The methodology does not reflect the reality of the country as there are still stigma and discrimination in the country and people tend to get tested out of their area of residence where they are not known and after enrollment tend to move closer to home for treatment which may justify the high rate of LTFU which actually may not be LTFU but enrollment in a different clinic closer to home. The WHO not-published survey in Harare in 2018 shows that out of 100 LTFU only 25 were LTFU, 75 have just changed clinics or regions. It is quite easy in Harare to move from one clinic to another clinic (the reason why the duplication in number is so high). WHO recommends index tracing and testing to move from 70% to 95% which is the new target.
