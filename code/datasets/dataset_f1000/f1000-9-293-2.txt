The authors have addressed the issues and suggestions in the earlier draft. However, I have notice that the statement in the revised version "Presently, no information is available on the best starter for biofloc in the cultured system of Nile tilapia Oreochromis niloticus ." is still there and no additional information was given. The authors must indicate a thorough literature search if indeed no best starter is currently available. If the authors can address this issue, then the manuscript can be considered to be accepted and indexed in the journal.
