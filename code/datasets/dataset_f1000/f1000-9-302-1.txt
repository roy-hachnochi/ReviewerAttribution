The authors present a useful and insightful study on an approach that leverages genetically encoded Halo-tags fused to a fluorescent protein to show how new protein synthesis can be readily detected using a novel colorless blocking agent. The experiments are clear, analyzed in quantitative detail and the results appear very robust. I have the following suggestions which I think would improve this manuscript: There is only a side mention of how the data of cell # 2 in Figure 6D should be interpreted. A cell was labeled with OG, chased with CPHX and the pulsed with JF646. Why would the OG fluorescence go down? Does this reflect some reversal of OG binding or purely background washout? Related to this point the ability to use this scheme to get estimates of new protein synthesis does depend on the irreversibility of dyes binding to Halo. It seems this point could have been fleshed out a little more by asking how stable fluorescence in a fluorescent label followed by CPHX chase in more than just the anecdote in Fig 6. It is probably worth discussing the fact that the measurements depend to a certain extent on the relative maturation times of the mTurq versus Halo proteins. I imagine is it not limiting on long time scales but could become so on shorter ones.
