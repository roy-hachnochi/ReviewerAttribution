The authors provide a concise and useful summary of two widely-used tools for genomic analysis, GffRead and GffCompare. The paper is written well and provides clear guidelines and examples on how to use those tools. I only have very minor suggestions and overall have no objections to this work being approved for indexing: Ref. 1: This is a great reference that describes the GFF3 format in detail. Nevertheless, I think the present paper would benefit from a concise, technical summary of the format in the Introduction section and maybe a sentence about issues surrounding different definitions of the format and the availability of GFF3 validators. Page 2, first paragraph, “rich GFF3 annotation files”: Does this mean “data-rich”? Maybe reword to clarify. What does “rich” entail? The same paragraph, “perform conversions from one from to another”: I think this is meant to read” from one format to another”. Page 6, “Basic usage example of the GffCompare utility” This paragraph states that query input can be GFF or GTF (text says GFF and example uses a GTF file), but Table 3 states for the -i option “provide a text file with a list of (query) GTF files”. Could you please clarify whether the -i option also accepts GFF files (similar to the description for -r option)? Page 8, “The “super-locus” concept”, “When multiple GFF files with are provided as input to GffCompare”: This seems to be a typo, or there is a word missing in the sentence? Remove “with”? Page 8, “Annotating transcripts with GffCompare”, 3 rd line: Change “produce an GTF file called” to “produce a GTF file called”.
