 Introduction : "We describe a patient whose extubation and discharge were delayed due to a florid COVID-19-related laryngo-tracheitis causing upper airway obstruction." The title of the paper is now 2 patients. Has to be corrected. Case report 1 â€œAn 8-mm external diameter endotracheal tube (ETT, Portex, Hythe, UK)" as it a n 8 portex tube. Are you sure that external diameter is 8 mm? Case report 2 OK. Discussion Well built.
