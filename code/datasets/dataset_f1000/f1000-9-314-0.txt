This report of isolated lingual dystonia could be improved. The description of the phenomenology can be improved, although overall the description of the case is convincing for isolated lingual dystonia. Lingual dystonia is not extremely rare and seldom reported as the authors state. A recent paper Yoshida et al. 2017, highlighted occupational risk factors in 95 patients with isolated, task-specific, speech induced, lingual dystonia. 1 The lack of genetic testing is a weakness. There was a lack of references in some sections.
