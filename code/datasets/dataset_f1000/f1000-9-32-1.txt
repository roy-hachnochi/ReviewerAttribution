Thank you for the opportunity to review this interesting short opinion paper. The SmPCs for gabapentin and pregabalin include respiratory problems under ‘undesirable effects’; however, as the authors say, there are no recommendations to apply this to practice. This applies in all countries, particularly post-industrial societies. Our trial and observation study found too many unaddressed respiratory problems 1 , 2 . Whilst I concur with the sentiments expressed, I feel these should be placed in the context of full patient monitoring for the full range of possible adverse effects of prescribed medicines. Respiratory depression is extremely important, as indicated, but it is also important to check patients for other possible undesirable effects of medicines and unmedicated problems, including pain, sedation and falls. We have shown the effectiveness of this approach, and would like to see it more widely adopted 1 , 2 . Our website gives free access to our strategy. http://www.swansea.ac.uk/adre/ .
