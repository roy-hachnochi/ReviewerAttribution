The article 'Impact of technologies on cervical cancer screening practices in Lagos, Nigeria (mHealth Cervix): Protocol for a RCT by Okunade KS et al. , set out to understudy a very relevant and timely aspect on cancer preventive initiative in Nigeria specifically in Lagos the economic hub and most populous city of Nigeria. This is aimed at preventing the incidence and mortality from cervical cancer in the urban city of Lagos in Nigeria. The methodology to study MHealth Cervix in Lagos is excellent and will cover the relevant population of Lagos city. The power 80% is significant enough and the sample size is robust. The statistical analysis package is more than adequate to analyse the research result specifically by using the two tests for comparison of means or test of significance. The research report is anticipated and I hope the author will proceed to the more predictive test using HPV screening in their future research on this very important subject matter.
