The research addresses the importance of improving compliance with cervical screening using mobile phone technology. I am not familiar with the platform described and would suggest another reviewer comments on the appropriateness. This manuscript presents methods but no results yet. I suggest the paper will make for more interesting reading when results are available. Also the endpoints of the study are attendance for screening. As the purpose of screening is to prevent cervical cancer, a more important goal will be difference in outcome between the two study groups in terms of detection rates of premalignant lesions and eventual outcome. I appreciate the numbers may be too small to demonstrate a reduction in cervical cancer. Finally I question why cervical smears are the chosen screening methods when all available data indicate that HPV testing is more reliable and objective and is indeed the method of choice in the national cancer plan.
