In this study, the authors conducted a phone interview to investigate the COVID-19 testing capabilities at urgent care centers in states with the greatest disease burden. This is an interesting and meaningful topic, especially during this pandemic crisis. However, there are some issues that need to be addressed. How did the authors validate the data from the UCCs to ensure no wrong information was conveyed? Even at the same center, two receptionists may give different answers to the same question. Is it possible to double confirm with two different receptionists? As the authors state that UCCs were randomly selected. How to differentiate big city centers vs rural area centers? High burden states still have rural areas that may have a very low incidence of COVID infection that does not supplement with UCCs with test capability. What is the percentage of these UCCs? Based on the above-mentioned reason, wouldn't investigating UCCs in cities with high COVID-19 incidence be a more reasonable design? Lastly, in the discussion part, the authors merely analyzed the results but did not put forward how it can be utilized for improvement. Namely, what's the meaning of this study?
