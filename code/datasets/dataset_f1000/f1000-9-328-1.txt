This study provides a snapshot of the COVID-19 testing landscape in ambulatory clinics in the United States in March 2020. Overall, only 22.8% of UCCs offered COVID-19 testing. Turn around time was up to several days in several centres. Testing and tracing are vital means to control community COVID-19 epidemics. Testing is the first step in the test-isolate-quarantine paradigm that has successfully contained COVID-19 in many parts of the world. Deployment of testing to a wide section of symptomatic individuals in the communities is a challenge. UCCs are a potentially convenient location where such testing can be performed; widespread testing at these centres would also generate vital surveillance data. The fact that less than a quarter of all UCCs in affected states offered COVID-19 testing represents a lost opportunity and a lesson for future pandemic preparedness. Some suggestions for improvement are as follows: This data is now 4 months old. While it would be too much to ask to repeat the survey, it would be good if the authors can provide any available updates on the number of UCCs offering COVID-19 testing or turn around time of state laboratories. Is the low availability of testing at UCCs improving in these states, especially in heavily affected areas like Florida? Briefly discuss the obstacles to UCCs offering COVID-19 tests. How does this snapshot in March reflect the situation today in July? Do the authors observe an association between a higher proportion of testing UCCs in March with better COVID-19 control today?
