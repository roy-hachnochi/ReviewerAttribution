Lee et al . have presented an interesting and important work for estimating the missing data in dose-response meta-analysis. It is so appreciated for these authors for their contribution in this area. I have some further comments that hope will be helpful for the authors. The background seems not well introduced. In dose-response meta-analysis, the non-reference effect estimates were correlated, when combining the dose-response relationship and taking into account the study correlation is essential for a BLUE estimation. And based on the GLST method, the group size information (cases, non-cases) were generally used to estimate the correlation. And further, some of the studies failed to provide such group size information that make it hard to get an estimation. Therefore, this article and previous one by Hamling are all an attempt to solve this problem. I believe a clear introduction for this could help readers get a better understanding. The missing information about the group sizes could be an important issue for the GLST framework, as it uses GLS estimation which requires the co-variance matrix. There is another framework based on the robust-error to deal with the correlation, which was first proposed by Hedges et al. 1 , and has been introduced in dose-response meta-analysis (called robust error meta-regression method, REMR) by Suhail et al . And based on REMR framework, the group size information are no longer needed 2 . The authors should discuss it. The updated software allows the cross-sectional study. This is an important and useful update. In my experience, I noticed that many systematic reviewers combine the cross-sectional study and cohort/case-control study together. However, this is not true. I suggest the authors add 1-2 sentences to the difference of cross-sectional study to the other two and remind the readers to avoid the problem.
