This article looks into the determinants of safe delivery in the eastern part of Indonesia. The report addresses an important topic and contributes to the advancement of knowledge on maternal health and in reducing maternal mortality. I only have a few comments regarding the research article: The authors mentioned that the dependent variables were facility-based delivery and assisted delivery. Will it be more appropriate to consider a) place of delivery and b) proportion of women assisted by skilled birth attendants as dependent variables? It was reported in the article that 71.6% used a health facility and 86.2% were assisted by a health professional at their last birth. I wonder, isn’t that health professionals typically assist health facility delivery? What is the reason for the discrepancy? Please clarify women’s knowledge level. This variable pertains to women’s level of knowledge about what? An interesting finding in this study was that women who wanted no more pregnancies when they became pregnant were more likely to give birth in a health facility. The authors mentioned that it might be related to the social norms and health system of the country itself. Can the authors expound on this? Can the researchers offer their plausible explanation of this result? Can the authors restate the conclusions in the abstract? Can household factors be changed to a more encompassing term reflective of the result? Can the facility-based delivery term be deleted and focus on safe delivery as directed in the title of the article? Can the use of secondary data be mentioned in the abstract? Thank you very much for the opportunity to review this article.
