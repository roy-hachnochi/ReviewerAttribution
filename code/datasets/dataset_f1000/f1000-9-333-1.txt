The paper deals with a forecasting procedure to analyse and evaluate the early stage of the COVID-19 outbreak in China. Inspite the classical SEIR model, the authors define a set of iconic indicators to study the status of disease contagion and the extent of epidemic spread. Then, they divide the cycle of the epidemic in four stages corresponding to the four meaningful milepost moments: two turning points and two “zero” points, related to the tuning of the proposed indicators. The authors characterize the first stage: the Outbreak period , by its end, which is represented by the arrival of the first tuning point (T_1), when the newly diagnosed patients (denoted E_t) after a rapid rise, begin to decrease (E_t E_{t-1}). The second stage is the Controlled period , that sees an increasing of hospitalised patients (denoted N_t) until a second turning point (T_2), when N_t, after to have reached a peak, starts to decline. The Mitigation stage corresponds to the third stage and it continues until the daily confirmed cases reach the zero (E_t=0). That represents the first “zero” point (Z_1). This condition is also reformulated and referred to the time when the daily confirmed cases are less then “5” for 3 consecutive days. The Convergence Period , the four stage, is characterized to reach a second “zero” point (Z_2), when the number of hospitalised patients is closed to zero (N_t=0). That signs the end of the epidemic. The procedure is corroborated on public available data in mainland China beyond Hubei Province from the China CDC during the period of Jan 29th, 2020, to Feb 29th, 2020. The results show the proposed procedure has provided to a prediction of the tuning and “zero” points, very near to the exact dates also in a very large stage of the epidemic. An analysis of the robustness of the method has also been performed on the time windows and on the four milepost moments. The results have revealed the influence of the parameter “m”, related to the width of the time windows used to estimate the average change rate of the daily diagnosed cases and of the daily removed cases. The paper is clear and smoothly written. I agree for its indexing after to have kept into consideration the following remarks: Section 2. Methods Equation (1) 1) N_l in brackets (1+K_l - N_l) should to be replaced with I_l Section 2.3 2) I suggest of referring explicitly the exponential model of the infection rate K_t and of the removed rate I_t (in the window m); 3) the term “average” for V_{K|(t0,m)} (and V_{I|(t0,m)}) is confused, it would be better to refer to it as “unitary rate of change” (and “unitary rate of removed”). I think, that is more properly the “rate of change” (and the “rate of removed”) associated with a unitary time step. Algorithm 1 Main Prediction Procedure. 3 Prediction: updating the predicted results ….. 4) The first equation R_t|to = \hat{R_t|to (l)} should to be replaced with K_t|to = \hat{K_t|to (l)} Section 3: Application 5) All the Figures must be improved, especially the Figure 2. And the Figure 4. 6) The proposed strategy has been verified on data referred to a very early stage of the epidemic and it performs short-term dependency. Given to the spread of the epidemic in world wide, maybe it can be proved on data related to the outbreak of the pandemic in another Countries.
