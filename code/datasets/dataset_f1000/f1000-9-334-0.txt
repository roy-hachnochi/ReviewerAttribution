Dear Author(s), Please The aim of this study is vague. The abstract is incomplete and the results and the method parts are not accessible. In addition to this, your keywords are not able to reflect the whole details of the study. One of the psychological scales was introduced, however, there is not any hint to find out about that. In the method part, there is not solid ground to opt Web-sampling? it could lead to bias definitely. Is there any previous knowledge to select age and sex as covariates? I would suggest the authors add the following citation: Ahorsu, D. K., Lin, C. Y., Imani, V., Saffari, M., Griffiths, M. D., Pakpour, A. H. (2020). The fear of COVID-19 scale: development and initial validation. International journal of mental health and addiction . 1
