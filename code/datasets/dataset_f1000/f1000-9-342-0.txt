The authors tried to illustrate the effect of metformin on pristane-induced mice in terms of IFN-Î³ levels and FOXP3 mRNA expression. However, the authors did not see the significant difference of renal histopathological score between intervention groups. It is better to provide evidence of effect of metformin on other manifestations, i.e. serological, in this model. The conclusion of "intravenous administration in human, could provide a novel route of administration...." could not be drawn from the data provided in the manuscript.
