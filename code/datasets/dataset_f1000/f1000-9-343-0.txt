I believe that the case-report is interesting, well reported and should be accepted. However, I have a minor concern: Did the authors perform a liver resection of the gallbladder bed? Is it reported in the literature? Since most of the reported patients died within 2 years from cholecystectomy, the author should discuss if in the finding of incidental metastases from breast cancer, a more extensive procedure (radical cholecystectomy with resection of the gallbladder bed) should be applied similarly to the incindetally gallbladder carcinoma.
