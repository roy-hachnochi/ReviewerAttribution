This is a manuscript that describes an important tool. The authors may need to discuss other proteogenomic tools similar to this and provide the advantages. If such tools don't exist, perhaps make a strong case. Zhang lab tools can also be discussed with references. Can the authors also discuss and refer previous attempts on onco-proteogenomics? One of the first paper on onco-proteogenomics came in 2012: Mathivanan, S., Ji, H., Tauro, B.J., Chen, Y.S. and Simpson, R.J. (2012) Identifying mutated proteins secreted by colon cancer cell lines using mass spectrometry. Journal of Proteomics . 76, 141-9 1 . Does CurVardb provide only non-synonymous point mutations? What about frame shit mutations? Is that also provided or perhaps will be added in next version.
