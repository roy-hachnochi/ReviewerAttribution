 There is no need to mention the type of the study in the title. The second paragraph in the introduction focused on health care violence. Security personnel canâ€™t be considered as health care workers. The topic is violence in a health care setting rather than violence among health care workers. This issue should be considered in the whole part of introduction. The authors did no mention the response rate among participants and whether there was any refusal to participate. What is the justification of categorization of participant by age at 35 years? In table 4, event reporting to nursing syndicate is not logic and strange. It is logic to be reported to authority that can deal with the accident. What is the authority of nursing syndicates to deal with accidents occurring at the entrance of the hospital or the wards? In table 5 how the exposed worker to violence feel guilty? I can understand he/she may feel ashamed but being guilty is not clear to me. In discussion the authors repeated again most of figures mentioned in the results section. They should discuss information and not repeated results in discussion
