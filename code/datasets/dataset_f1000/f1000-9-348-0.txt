The case report describes an autopsy of a person who almost certainly died of COVID-19 lung disease, on the basis of the circumstances of death and the lung histology (all other organs were normal for age). The problems of getting virology tests done on cadavers is addressed - though it should be noted that currently this situation has improved and most mortuaries are now able to access viral tests for COVID-19. The lung histology is typical for COVID-19 infection and the illustrations are good.
