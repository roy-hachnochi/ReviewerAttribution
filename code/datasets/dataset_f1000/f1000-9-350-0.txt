 Abstract: Although comprehensive, it would be better if the authors would make the abstract concise. Introduction: It would be better to word that 'ileo-sigmoid-vesical fistula is uncommon rather than calling it 'exceptional' which implies that it is very rare, which its is not, especially in Crohn's disease where severe disease can have complex fistulas. Case report section: 'diagnosed by ultrasound with a right kidney dilation'- I am presuming the authors mean right renal hydronephrosis? - Please correct. March 2011- What CT was performed? Lumbar spine of abdominopelvic CT? Without or with contrast? May 2011- How does CRP lead to the conclusion of inflammation of ileum region? Was imaging performed at this instance? May 20012 and June 2012- Unfortunately, this case has no images shown. It is difficult to believe that CT would not pick up a large intra-abdominal abscess. Overall, the case is not very novel as complex fistulizing disease is known to happen with Crohn's disease. Multiple shortcomings mentioned above. Lack of figures/imaging is a significant shortcoming. I would refer authors to read the following review of fistulizing disease in Crohn's: Booya, F., Akram, S., Fletcher, J.G. et al.
