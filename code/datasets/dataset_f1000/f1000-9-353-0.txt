 Summary: Previous studies in mice have shown that APOE is highly expressed by neural stem cells (NSCs) and that it has an isoform-dependent regulatory role in their maintenance. Whether this function extends to human NSCs is not known. Here, the authors begin to address this knowledge gap by characterising the expression of APOE in APOE3/APOE3 human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived NSCs undergoing differentiation. Through qPCR and immunocytochemistry (ICC) techniques, the authors show a reduction in APOE gene expression during the differentiation of NSCs to NPCs and observe a change in the cellular distribution of APOE. General comments: This short study is concise and provides preliminary but important data to contribute to our understanding of the role of APOE in NSCs of human origin. Although the qPCR data is robust and clearly demonstrates a significant decrease in APOE gene expression as NSCs differentiate, the qualitative assessment of the ICC data is not as convincing. Specific comments: Fig 2 C: APOE appears to be more widely expressed at D18/19 for all three NSC lineages (DSi, DS-Wi and DS-WHi). Quantification of the signal intensities of APOE and the differentiation markers should be carried out to validate the conclusion that APOE expression decreases as NSCs differentiate. Fig 2 C: It may be more helpful and striking to compare D18/19 images with D7 images instead of D12 since APOE mRNA levels are highest at this time point. Notably, D7 is also used as the baseline for the qPCR data. The authors describe an increase in intracellular localisation of APOE following NSC differentiation â€“ providing higher magnification images may reveal changes in APOE distribution more clearly.
