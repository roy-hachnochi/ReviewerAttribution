 Summary: It has previously been shown that APOE regulates neural stem cell (NSC) maintenance in rodent models but until now this has not been demonstrated or validated in human cells. The authors address this important question through use of human induced pluripotent stem cells (APOE3 homozygous) and monitor APOE status throughout neural differentiation. APOE gene expression was notably much lower following induction of differentiation and coincident with this was an apparent change in the cellular distribution of APOE with the authors describing a much more pronounced intracellular localisation of APOE. Major comments: This is a very focused piece of work and although the findings are quite preliminary they are very interesting and worth reporting particularly because of the human cell context. A key question going forward will be whether the APOE4 genotype influences NSC maintenance or differentiation as this could have clear implications for neurogenesis in Alzheimerâ€™s Disease. The gene expression data presented here is clear and the changes in APOE are quite dramatic but the immunostaining is rather descriptive and is not quite as convincing. Specific comments: The resolution of the images in the composite cell panels in Fig 2 is not great and it is difficult to clearly see or judge the intracellular expression described. Can these be improved at all? For the gene expression changes, data is provided for D7, D12 and D18, yet for the cell staining only D12 and D18 are shown. Is D7 cell data not available to present here? The most obvious change at the protein level is the apparent increase in cellular APOE staining between D12 and D18 (certainly for DSi and DS-Wi) and as Hoe33342 has been performed I would have thought some quantitative data could be provided here which would help support the conclusions made.
