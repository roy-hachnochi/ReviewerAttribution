This a very interesting review, addressing a relevant topic in the context of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), its impact on pregnancy. Although I congratulate the authors for the efforts, before can be fully acceptable it deserves some improvements, including an update of the review. This review is based on two searches in the literature in two databases. The last review on April 8, 2020. Then, this means, more than four months have passed. For COVID-19 this is a lot. Multiple case reports, studies, and even reviews, and systematic reviews have came out. Then, this needs to be updated, including other additional databases, such as Scopus, and Web of Sciences. The section of Mother-to-Child transmission should be reviewed carefully, as new evidence suggested, that although sporadically, some cases ended in vertical transmission. Finally, I would suggest to extend more the Conclusions, specially to better discuss the current and future implications of the COVID-19 on pregnancy.
