This article reports the results of an initial survey of Health Technology Assessment (HTA) stakeholders in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). The authors aimed to identify where and how HTA methodologies can improve health system priority-setting and universal health coverage efforts at national level. The authors are experts on HTA and have a wealth of experience in priority-setting, health systems policy, and global health. In this interesting and important article, they have painted the current HTA landscape in SSA and highlighted areas in need of further investigations. Capacity-building efforts for HTA in SSA can now be refined based on the critical areas highlighted in this initial survey. The limitations of this survey have been acknowledged. I think the low response rate and incomplete answers are a reflection of the stage of development of HTA in SSA. Specific comments are provided below: The authorship of the article could have included African researchers currently on the continent on a full-time basis to help with local capacity development and international collaboration. Abstract: just semantics and preferences. "...tool to support.." may sound better as "...tool for supporting.." Methods: the authors state that "We used an existing framework.." I think they should have provided more information on this "existing survey". Was the survey used before and what were the findings? Ghana is mentioned as having given most of the responses and I know they have done a lot of work on local HTA use. The article could have given more detail on the developments in Ghana. It may help others to learn from such examples on the continent.
