This manuscript present the research protocol of a well thought through and designed ongoing study on the effects of bilingualism on the brain structure and function of children. This study fills an important gap in the young but expanding literature on the effects of bilingualism on cognition and the brain, by expanding it to a severely under-researched age-range (young children)- crucially, the study is administering comprehensive behavioural and MRI batteries which will help uncover whether and how brain differences between bilingual and monolingual children translate to differences in behaviour. I found the rationale and objectives of the study clearly described, and the study design is very appropriate, although the use of the entire behavioural battery could have also been addressed with appropriate hypotheses, in order to further strengthen the study. In terms of methods, all three main testing components (demographic and language backgrounds, behavioural experiments tapping language and executive functions and the MRI battery), are appropriate, contemporary, and described in full detail allowing for replication of the study. The adaptations of the MRI data analyses to make them appropriate for a paediatric sample is of particular importance here. Finally, with respect to data analysis, it is not clear to me whether the authors were planning to look at grey matter measures (esp. since their T1 images have sufficient resolution) with methods included in FSL, such as whole-brain VBM and subcortical vertex analysis (FIRST). I would strongly advise that, as it will result in a much needed multi-modal investigation of the developing bilingual brain (e.g. see https://psyarxiv.com/kjq6m for a preprint of our recent work looking at both grey and white matter structure of the developing brain, but not brain function at rest (Pliatsikas et al. , 2020 1 ). In all, this is a well-designed study and its outputs will be more than welcome in the field.
