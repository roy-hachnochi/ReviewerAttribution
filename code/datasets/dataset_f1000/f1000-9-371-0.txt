This article from Begum et al. entitled “Analyses of spike protein from first deposited sequences of SARS-CoV2 from West Bengal, India" reports a detailed analysis spike protein sequences deposited in GSIAD repository from clinical isolates of SARS-CoV2. The report relies on algorithms to predict the secondary structure of the SARS-CoV2 spike protein variant from Bengal and proposes that novel mutations in the SARS-CoV2 S2 domain could result in changes in the virus infectivity and escape mutants. Because the structures were all based on the CFSSP algorithm it would be important to show how these structures relate to the known crystal structure of SARS-CoV2 spike from Wuhan. Also, the authors compared the sequences to Wuhan's original virus, but more mutations in S2 notably have been reported in clinical isolates from other parts of the world. An important question is whether the mutations from Bengal are new and unique or whether they are found also in the circulating virus in North America and Europe for instance. Overall the observation and the hypothesis are interesting but at this point, it is purely speculative and these mutations could be passengers with no consequence on virus natural infection and transmission. These questions could only be solved by infection experiments in vitro or in animal models. The authors have used the CFSSP method, but many other algorithms are available for secondary structure prediction. What was the rationale for choosing this specific algorithm? Would other algorithms yield similar predictions? In the introduction, the authors mention that the CoV undergo rapid mutations but compared to other RNA viruses CoV tends to mutate more slowly due to the proofreading exonuclease. Figure 1: it is not clear what consensus 100% 90% etc… represent. Minor comments: few typos (osolate instead of isolate etc…)
