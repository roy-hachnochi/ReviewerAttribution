The manuscript submitted reports mutations in newly sequenced SARS-CoV-2 isolates of West Bengal origin. The information presented here is a useful addition to the ongoing COVID 19 research. While the manuscript is well written and sufficiently documented, the authors should consider adding the following additional information. Mutation 614 D to G has been in discussion in recent times extensively. The authors could add few lines in the discussion about the possible importance of this mutation as they also report the same in West Bengalâ€™s sequences. DynaMut analysis for only G1124V has been done. Since mutation at the 723 position is also unique, a similar analysis for the same should also be included.
