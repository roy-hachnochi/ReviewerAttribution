The authors presented an unusual but interesting case of APAC in a young female of 39 years old. Major points: Since the cause of this type of APAC is important, an ultrasound biomicroscopy examination should be included to present the anterior segment structure especially the ciliary body, iris and anterior chamber angle. The difference of the AC between the affected eye and unaffected eye is relative large (2.62 vs 2.16), hence a differential diagnosis is needed in the discussion part, like the discussion on lens dislocation and zonula weakness. The authors should provide a table or relevant figures to show the results of the eye examination about of the VA, IOP, visual field, optic disc evaluation of the LE of different visits. Minor points: In the Abstract, Please delete “second only to cataract” in the first sentence, because the sentence structure gives a wrong impression that cataract is also a kind of irreversible blindness. Did the authors intend to stress how the presented case is so unusual as in the second sentence they mentioned PACG is usually bilateral but the presented case is unilateral? What does the “digital image” of the optic disc as mentioned in the 6 th sentence in the second paragraph of the abstract stand for? Do you mean the fundus photo? In the third paragraph of Introduction, Please elaborate more about the “process” mentioned in the last sentence in this paragraph. In Table 1, What are the units of the measurements of the parameters in Table 1? In the third paragraph of Discussion, Can the authors please name the parameters specifically that being mentioned in the second last sentence? In the fifth paragraph of Discussion, Can the authors provide a value about the “increased risk of corneal edema after phacoemulsification”?
