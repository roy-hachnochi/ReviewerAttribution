I have read it through, and it seems to be an interesting brief report. Some comments below: 74.2% of those studies are mention as "Randomized" and 40% as blinded, from researchers. Authors of this brief report can "discuss" those numbers and prepare readers that most of those may have a high risk of bias (maybe with no control group, or bias arising from the randomisation process, etc). "Additional effort is needed to ensure that minors are included in COVID-19 clinical research, so that therapeutic decisions are based upon high-quality evidence". I am not very sure if it is necessary to discuss this in the brief report
