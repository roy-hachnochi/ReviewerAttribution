This study is very relevant to our today practice and important for the patientsâ€™ well-being and continuous health-care after suffering from cancer pain. Overall coverage and discussion are appropriate. The main limitation for this study is the number of sample and monitoring of the results which may hinder the purpose of the study. Adequate and covering the area of research but some area may need sources of the references. The methodology and flow of the study was clearly organized inclusive the randomization performed. This study was well constructed which included intravenous administration and back up with the patient controlled administration of morphine to hinder potential pain during the study. The table and the analysis of the result are adequate. The coverage of the discussion and suggestion are adequate. I would agree that the result might be different if the samples more that 20 patients for each arm. However, if the monitoring interval be shorter for examples 4 hourly or 6 hourly then we might see the significant different results of the study with the similar sample. Even-though Nefopam have multiple mode of action but how much they covered nociceptive and neuropathic pathway were not covered in this study and discussion. Cancer pain can be prominent either nociceptive or neuropathic pain and sometimes both which causing dilemma for palliative to manages. It is good if in this study or discussion to highlight more on the aspect of nefopam coverage either on nociceptive or neuropathic or both to certain degree.
