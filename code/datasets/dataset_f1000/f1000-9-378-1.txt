This is a placebo-controlled double-blind RCT comparing nefopam and placebo in moderate to severe cancer pain. The methodology and analysis is properly done and the results are clear. Unfortunately, the sample size is small with only 20 patients per group. As the patients in both groups were given an IV-PCA pump to use, I am not surprised that there was no difference in the NRS pain scores for 48 hours. A better indication would be a difference in the morphine consumption - which could have been the primary outcome of this study.
