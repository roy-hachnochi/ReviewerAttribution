The major issue with this article is that the background is poorly developed. There is abundant evidence in literature on the effect of visual, auditory or cross-modal effects in STM. Also, while the authors associate the findings to aging effect, it could well be that the effects are merely the effect of learning, since children become more experienced learners with age. The findings are not discussed adequately in context of the existing literature. I suggest addressing these issues before the article is accepted for indexing.
