This is a very relevant study in the growing scholarship around predatory publishing. It is one of the first studies that look at how predatory or at least questionable journals that have been delisted from citation database continue to have a presence in academia. More specifically, the paper asks the very important question why databases like Scopus (and others) continue to track the citations of journals that have been removed. This creates a distortion at many levels, including at the individual publication profile level. I am happy to recommend indexing of this paper as it is (some minor grammatical editing is required).
