This is an impressive and important piece of methodology research, which has been reported in a clear and succinct manner. I am pleased to have been asked to review it. The reported randomized trial is an example of a very large SWAT, that was embedded in the CASPER trial of behavioural activation therapy for older patients with sub-threshold levels of depression, to test the impact on recruitment of an optimized information materials for people being invited to consider participation in the clinical trial. It might be helpful to readers if the authors could include a little more information about the SWAT concept, perhaps by citing one or both of the relevant Trial Forge papers: (a) Treweek S, Bevan S, Bower P, et al. Trial Forge Guidance 1: what is a Study Within A Trial (SWAT)? Trials 2018; 19: 139; and (b) Treweek S, Bevan S, Bower P, et al. Trial Forge Guidance 2: how to decide if a further Study Within A Trial (SWAT) is needed. Trials 2020; 21: 33. Although the optimized information materials did not improve the proportion of invitees who were recruited into CASPER, it would be interesting to know if there were other benefits, such as a better understanding of the clinical trial. The paper concludes with some comments about this but the authors' comment that “further research examining this is warranted” seems to suggest that this type of qualitative research might not be done with the CASPER trial patients. However, given that they will be collecting retention data for CASPER, I hope they will revisit this SWAT later in the CASPER trial to answer their own question about the potential for an impact on retention. If they have not already done so, I suggest that the authors register this SWAT in the SWAT repository. It might also help readers if they referred to two similar SWAT that are already registered there (SWAT 101 and SWAT 105).
