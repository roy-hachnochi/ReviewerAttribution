This is a useful and significant study on the levels of glycoalkaloids that would be of benefit to consumers. There are two points I think would be helpful to state clearly: 1) Was any sample above recommended health guidelines? Overall, this is of interest to a general reader - especially if none were; 2) In your description of statistical analysis, there was not a statement on how having different numbers of samples for comparisons was handled. It is recommended that this be included for clarity. Minor points: Abstract, Results ".. lowest levels of glycoalkaloids" Methods, Study area. Perhaps food stuffs should be written as 1 word rather than being separated into 2. Recommend replacing "purposively" with "purposefully" Methods, Determination of moisture content. "Memmert" , not "memmmert" Methods, Sample preparation. Better to say "all samples " and "all markets". Use "cloth towels" instead of "cloth towel" Methods, Chromatographic analysis. "....standard stock solutions". Also author Abong spelling is different for text and listed citations. These should be the same, if possible.
