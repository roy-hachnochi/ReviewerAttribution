A very accurate latitude and altitude data are given for the location of the site, which belongs to one specific site; however, there are 3 different altitudes in the text, at which 3-3 sampling points per altitude were mentioned. In the Material and Method, it would have been good to include a site description section, in which the vegetation of the study area could have been described. Also describing what is grown in agricultural areas; how much biomass remains in the area; how long the natural vegetation has been removed (since when the area has been under cultivation). It would be good to know if there was a difference between the slope of each slope because this can also affect SOM and MBC through erosion. Soil moisture and temperature fundamentally affect the MBC of soils, so it would be good to mention the values for specific sites in this manuscript as well. Furthermore, it would be good to know the particle composition of the soil, as the rate of the clay fraction significantly influences the SOC content. The above-mentioned variables and parameters can all influence the final result.
