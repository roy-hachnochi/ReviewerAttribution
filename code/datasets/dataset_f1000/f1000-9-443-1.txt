The authors report changes in soil microbiological parameters and their ratio at different altitudinal levels of the Ecuadorian Amazon region. The study is well written and straightforward; anyways, in parts needed to be improved to increase readability, and lead readers to better understand the importance of the research findings. First, in the introduction, authors discuss the role of MBC and, then SOC in assessing soil microbiological activity, but what missing for me is the lack of explaining their ratio MBC/SOC as a microbial indicator. The importance of ratio is mentioned in the paper, but its role is unclear. Up to date and relevant literature is cited. Methods are well written, but missing some information. How many samples were measured for MBC and SOC, 15 (as sampled) in quadruplicated? It is not clear until we open the supporting material. Observation: generally in mobilization studies, apart from the altitudinal variant, sampling depths are also involved in the analysis. It is not clear to me why the authors disregarded different depths in the study that could provide a more complex image of examined changes. Results are presented logically, and succinctly. Conclusions are correct. Overall, it can be said that it is a well-designed study. In any case, I suggest making the following minor changes before article indexing: Expand introduction, and highlight the role of ratio MBC/SOC. State number of samples used for biomass analyses. Please clarify why depth was not involved in the analysis.
