This is an interesting study on the initial phases of adhesion and spreading of platelets on two different substrates, collagen IV and fibrinogen. The authors report that on collagen IV a short-term phase of filopodial extension is followed by lamellipodia based-spreading, correlating with the insertion of 1-2 microtubules at the core of the filopodium. On fibrinogen, in contrast, there was only partial filopodia-to-lamellipodia transition, and microtubule extension was not observed. The quantification and image analysis of platelet spreading based on interference reflection microscopy, allowing a temporal profiling of attachment vs detachment and cryo-EM data are particularly interesting. The methods are state-of-the art, the results convincing, and the conclusions are sound. The results should be discussed in the context of previous work on the distribution of microtubules in resting platelets and platelet filopodia (Patel-Hett et al. Blood, 2008 1 ). Some of the Figures should be improved for clarity. Figure 1: label panels A-C on the sides. Figure 3 D-E: label panels on the side (D- collagen, E-fibrinogen). Figures 7, 8 and 9: please use dot plots and not bar-graphs. Figure 10 label Panels (A and B), and schematic panel (left) for fibrinogen, to make the difference clearer (only collagen is shown). In the overview of platelet temporal functional interplay (Fig 10) it is not clear why the lamellipodia shape phase is there, since the filopodia-to-lamellipodia transition is partial?
