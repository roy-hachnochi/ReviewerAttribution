it is a good work with sufficient data analyzed. It was good written, but I have minor comments which should be done for final approval: The result in the abstract should include some numbers and clear results rather than narrative. this will strengthen the abstract. Please provide more explanation about 85 days in fig 1 page 4, it seems to be same results in loose and strict, Please clear it in result part or discussion part. Great work and hope all the best to authors.
