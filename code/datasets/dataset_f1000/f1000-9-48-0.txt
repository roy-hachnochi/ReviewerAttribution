 This is a systematic review of the efficacy and safety of microbiota transfer therapy for the management of ASD in children. The following databases have been searched up to April 2018: MEDLINE via PubMed, LILACS IBECS via BVS, EMBASE via Ovid, Scopus and Cochrane Library. The authors found only one study published in 2017 (18 patients), that fitted the inclusion criteria. With one study, it is not possible to index this paper. I would suggest to re-do the search, updating it to March 2020 (last search was in April 2018). If other papers (at least 2 beyond the one already identified) will be found, so it could be worth to index.
