In this case report, the authors have discussed a patient with chronic myeloid leukemia and metachronous IgG multiple myeloma. The clinical presentation and disease course are well described and discussed. Adding the following details would add more clarity to the case and help readers: Please mention the transcripts at diagnosis (as knowing typical versus atypical transcripts is important for follow up, the latter might not be detectable in routine PCR and warrants RT-PCR). At CML disease relapse, please indicate if the patient was still in the chronic phase. Was there a bone marrow biopsy done at that time, if so what was the percentage of plasma cells. As the diagnosis of MGUS requires BMBx? Please indicate if the clonal plasma cells were 10% facilitating the diagnosis of MGUS. Please indicate if the x-axis in Figure 1-2 denotes months? It will be interesting to know the most common Grade 3 AEs experienced by the patient (to know if there were any specific side effects that were more common with concomitant imatinib and myeloma therapy.
