The authors have made some changes according to the other reviewer but have not addressed my comments yet. I would like to highlight the comments below: It is better to support the computational method with experimental clues. The authors should show the paired positions in Figure 1. Figure 3, it is better to use multiple sequence alignment (MSA) to predict secondary structure and show the co-evolution. For 3D structure prediction, it is difficult for an automatic method (e.g., RNAComposer) to handle a structure of more than 150nt without a good secondary structure assignment. This paper tries to use RNAComposer to predict a structure of 350nt. This is beyond the current capability of automatic prediction. From Figure 5, we can find severe atomic clashes, which are not expected in 3D structures. To improve, I suggest to focus on the mutational region, use the MSA-based 2D prediction result to predict 3D structure, and use energy minimization (e.g., Rosetta) to optimize the 3D structure. However, the only information from 3D structure prediction is the feasibility of the 2D structure rather than the functional inferences expected from this paper. "RNA Composer" should be "RNAComposer"
