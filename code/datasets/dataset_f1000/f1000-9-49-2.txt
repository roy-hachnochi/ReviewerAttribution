 It would be very helpful if the authors included the full structure of the wild type and compare it with the two constructed mutants' structure. Figure 2 showed a subtle difference in MFE and other thermodynamics characteristics, is there any value that can be presented as a result of statistical analysis or based on best fitting model? Figure 3 seems to have significant importance in terms of the structure stability (clinical consequence, for example). Any supporting literature? However, the author did not elaborate more on this. For example, IVS1nt5GT mRNA structures that showed a significant difference (blue-circled). This needs to be discussed more. Again, the value needs to be shown here: "In the secondary structure, the higher the number of the larger loops, the more unstable the structure". Figure 5 seems to differ significantly between WT and the mutants, but the author stated otherwise? Except this statement: "excluding a small change as presented in the lower left part". This needs to be clarified and explain/discuss any structure-function relationship alteration.
