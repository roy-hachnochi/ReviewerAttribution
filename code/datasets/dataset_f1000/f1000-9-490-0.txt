The report by Agha and colleagues is well-researched and well-written, describing an uncommon presentation of a GE junction melanoma. The time course is clearly delineated and the timeline figure allows the reader a full appreciation for the significance of the patient's unfortunate but not unexpected mortality given the debilitation associated with the anatomic location of the lesion. In order to more clearly describe the tumor, it would be helpful if the grade and stage could be included. Namely, was PET-CT conducted to establish distant metastasis? Otherwise, the case is strong and will serve as a helpful addition to the literature.
