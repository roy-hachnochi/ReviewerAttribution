Very interesting and rare case presentation of gastrointestinal melanoma occurring at the GE junction. A sufficient background and case presentation were presented followed by a well thought of discussion. This case is not only novel but also highly important to describe in the literature given its rarity and lack of proper understanding of risk factors, tumorigenesis, and ultimately treatment. Unfortunately the patient expired which is not surprising given poor prognosis of this disease. I would suggest the authors include grade and stage of the tumor. It appears that the tumor was not metastatic on presentation but this needs to be clearly established.
