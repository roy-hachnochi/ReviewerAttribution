The authors report a case of COVID-19 with respiratory compromised that was tipped over by pulmonary embolism from lower limb venous thrombus. The patient also had hepatic compromised in this case probably hemodynamic related given the admission parameters with hypotension and metabolic acidosis. Hepatitis secondary to COVID-19 is a possibility. The focus of the authors in this case report is that initiation of HCQ and NAC, the authors theorized had contributed to the recovery of the patient. There is a lack of information; not certain if there were additional therapies provided? Antimicrobials (for sepsis given the high CRP), lopinavir/ritonavir, azithromycin, and inotropes. Based on the information provided, the patient also had septic shock and co-infection must be considered. There is strong evidence and is now widely accepted that HCQ does not work in COVID-19. NAC use in COVID-19 is novel and there are several publications that hypothesis its role. NAC replenishes glutathione stores and helps mitigate the oxidative injuries during inflammatory process not just for COVID-19 but also other diseases. There is nothing concrete in the information presented that supports the authors' claim as the recovery may well have been related to the hemodynamic supportive provided.
