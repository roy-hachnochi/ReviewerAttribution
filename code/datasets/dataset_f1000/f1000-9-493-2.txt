The manuscript is provides interesting findings; however, several points need to be addressed: About plant material: it is important know the time of the year of harvesting. Leaf extract preparation: a the beginning you indicate '1 g of powdered leaf was extracted with 50 ml solvent' In Leaf extract preparation ' 100 mg dry weights of each plant leaves were mixed, vortexed in 1 ml of solvent; explain it. About saponins test it is not clear why you report just one kind of result in figure 6, if you obtain it from the leaf powder and not from the 2 different extracts, I cannot understand why you make correlation with the two different kind of extracts. The same for the ppo test. You did not compare the 2 different extracts. About the figure 7 HPLC is not clear why you left numbers and names, it is really difficult read it. Please, could you add numbers for each compound in the figure 7 and the same numbers and Rt in the table 1. Moreover, you report 'quantification of different bioactive compounds present in the extracts' . Why have you identified compounds by the HPLC-DAD for ethanolic extract only. Table 2: Zone of inhibitions of leaves extracts against different bacterial strains. Please, write 0 or Nil
