The manuscript by Singh and Florez presents the discovery of drugs against COVID19 using molecular docking methods. Major: The authors must discuss in further detail as to how this work compares with other published reports of drugs targeted against SARS-CoV-2. The authors should cite references for the results mentioned in the Introduction section of the manuscript. How was the -6 kcal/mol free binding energy cut-off selected? As I understand this is not the lowest, the highest or the average of the reference molecule binding energies. Then what is the basis for the selection of this cut-off value? The authors have discussed the docking results for the reference and the test molecules independently, but have not provided a comprehensive comparison of the observations. In my opinion, such a comparison is necessary for assessing the effectivity of the new drugs as compared to the existing drugs. The authors have also not discussed the importance of the residues Tyr237, Leu272, Leu287 etc. Are these known to be critical residues in the functioning of the main protease? Minor: The statistics on the number of cases and deaths need to be updated before the indexing. The authors should be more careful about the technicalities mentioned in the paper. For example, "6m03" has been mentioned loosely in the Introduction section without pointing to the fact that it is a PDB structure; the HTVS abbreviation has not been introduced in the manuscript before the first instance of its use. The paper requires English editing by a professional and/or a native English speaker.
