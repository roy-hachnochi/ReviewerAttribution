The case report is well described in terms of investigations performed and the treatment modality selected. It helps the practitioners by adding to the limited number of case reports and presentations available. However, the authors fail to describe the patient's symptoms and physical examination in sufficient detail: The chief complaint in an emergency department as abdominal pain requires a further detailed description of presenting symptoms especially pertaining to relevant negative history about bowel habit changes, bleeding per rectum and weight loss. It would help to describe smoking as pack years rather than chronic tobacco smoking for better interpretation. The authors mention measurements that were unremarkable along with vital signs, it would be helpful to describe what these were (Guerra, 2006 1 ). During the staging process, it would be helpful to know the relevant system used (AJCC 7th or 8th edition staging for rectal carcinoma (Tong et al. , 2018 2 ). During discussion, the authors mention "Compared to adenocarcinoma of the rectum, RSCC occurs more often in younger Caucasian women with an average age of 60 years". A recent update mentions the age of the patients usually range from 39-93 years with average 63 years with no apparent ethnic predisposition (Guerra, 2006 1 ). It would also help if in the discussion the authors could explain how this particular case was unique. Thank you for giving the opportunity to review and learn from your case report.
