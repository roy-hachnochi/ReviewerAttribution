This case report discusses a 9 year old boy who presents with persistent, multiple vocal tics, and one motor tic. Based on history and physical exam, he clearly meets criteria for multiple chronic tics, but has no demonstrated impairment. I would argue that he has mild distress, as evidenced by the fact that he finds them annoying, but from a practical perspective, they do not functionally impact his life. The author argues that this child's tics would not fit into any of the current DSM-5 tic disorder classifications, and most specifically, that he would not fit into either of the two that are closest to his presentation--Tourette's Disorder, because he does not have multiple motor tics, or persistent vocal tic disorder, because he does have one motor tic. This highlights a gap in the current diagnostic criteria (even leaving out the question of whether impairment should be necessary for a diagnosis, which is also addressed). Genetic and emerging clinical data suggest that chronic tics, whether primarily motor,vocal, or a mix of both, emerge from the same underlying genetic causes, and thus are likely to be manifestations of the same disorder. The argument is made, appropriately, for a revisiting of the tic disorder diagnoses in the DSM, to account for this gap, and perhaps also to incorporate the current genetic information when determining the disorder definitions for the next update.
