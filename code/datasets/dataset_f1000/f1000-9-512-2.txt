 Executive Summary Choosing between different model designs is a common first step in hypothesis testing. Here, Soneson et al. created an R/Bioconductor package called ExploreModelMatrix that provides an interactive Shiny interface for exploring such model designs. While the potential utility of such a package in a guided teaching setting is evident, its utility in a research setting is currently limited by its inability to accommodate larger, more complex designs common to real biological research. Most pressingly, it remains unclear how each of the explorer's modules can be used to guide a non-mathematical user to choose the appropriate model design. --- Major comments: Overall, it is unclear to me who is intended to be the target user for this package. The authors suggest that ExploreModelMatrix can be use in biological research or teaching, where many users will not be formal mathematicians. However, if I try to model using redundant variables, I get a warning "The design matrix is not full rank," which is a difficult message to interpret, particularly for non-mathematicians. Likewise, if the number of observations in the design matrix is the same as its rank, I get a warning "The residual degrees of freedom is 0. Values such as variances or dispersions can not be estimated from data with this design," which again is a difficult message to interpret, particularly for non-mathematicians. A more actionable jargon-free set of recommendations would be important for users. In biological research, it is not uncommon to have dozens of patients and dozens of cell-types for multiple treatments across multiple time points for example. For designs with more than a few options per predictor, the current interface becomes quickly unusable. For example: ``` celltype - factor(sapply(1:10, function(x) rep(paste0('celltype', x), 30))) patient - as.factor(sample(1:10, 300, replace=TRUE)) levels(patient) - paste0('patient', 1:10) names(celltype) - names(patient) - paste0('cell', 1:300) sampleData - data.frame(patient, celltype) head(sampleData) ExploreModelMatrix(sampleData = sampleData, designFormula = ~ patient + celltype) ``` The 'Fitted values', 'Pseudoinverse of design matrix', and 'Correlation plot', all become overlapping and illegible, rendering the interface unusable. Testing two different design formula (one with and one without intercepts): ``` ExploreModelMatrix(sampleData = sampleData, designFormula = ~ genotype + treatment) ExploreModelMatrix(sampleData = sampleData, designFormula = ~ 0 + genotype + treatment) ``` I was unable to achieve the author's stated goals of "extract[ing] the interpretation of each individual coefﬁcient, and formulat[ing] desired linear contrasts" and ultimately deciding which design was best suited for my data. It is not clear how the 'variance inflation factors', 'Pseudoinverse of design matrix', 'Co-occurrence plot', and 'Correlation plot' should be used to inform my decision. A video tutorial or walkthrough showing how this could be done would be useful. --- Minor comments: I was unable to install the package using the instructions provided: ``` BiocManager::install("ExploreModelMatrix") Bioconductor version 3.9 (BiocManager 1.30.10), R 3.6.0 (2019-04-26) Installing package(s) 'ExploreModelMatrix' Warning message: package ‘ExploreModelMatrix’ is not available (for R version 3.6.0) ``` Instead, I had to use: ``` devtools::install_github('csoneson/ExploreModelMatrix') ``` The "Choose reference levels" dropdown panels order the options alphabetically rather by the given level ordering. The fitted values plot does use the correct order though. All the functions and utilities that are available are not clear. For example, the "Flip coordinates" toggle was very useful and it took me awhile to find it. Again, video tutorial or walkthrough highlighting these features will be very helpful. If the annotation names ("subjectdummy", "condition", "count", etc) is too long, the Fitted values visualization becomes illegible as the text overlaps each other without wrapping.
