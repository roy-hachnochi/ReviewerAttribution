Thank you for the opportunity to review this interesting work. The authors describe use of GIS testing to looking at patterns of linkage to care in Western Kenya with the goal of identifying notable areas of less successful linkage that may suggest potential opportunities for program innovation. The work is framed as a demonstration of the potential benefits of GIS mapping tools to support linkage to care. There is significant literature on this topic already, some of which I have added in citations here 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 . If the authors wish to focus on this as the rationale for the work, more clarity would be needed regarding what their methods add to the existing literature regarding the use of GIS in evaluation of HIV linkage and care in similar settings. For their particular results here, the distribution of those not linked was noted to be random which would suggest that the GIS provided relatively less information in this setting. The conclusion drawn from this was a little bit unclear, namely that given the distribution was random blanked distributions of messages was not helpful. One could interpret this in the opposite manner, namely that since there is no clustering, widespread distribution of messages is needed. Targeting interventions to clients identified as out of care wherever they are does not leverage the information from the GIS analysis. While a potentially helpful tool, in this case it appears that the tool did not yield clearly actionable information and some clarification is needed with regard to the focus of the manuscript and what it adds to the existing literature.
