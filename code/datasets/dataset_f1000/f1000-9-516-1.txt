This study is a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial that used nefopam 30 mg perioperative period for assessing its efficacy in spine surgery. The primary efficacy was defined as the percentage of a reduction in 24-hour morphine consumption during each time of nefopam administration (every four hours). However, one question I have is why the results of morphine consumption (table 2) were showed in the only milligram of morphine consumption at each time point.
