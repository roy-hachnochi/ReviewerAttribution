Possibly the ISM method invented by the authors has high potentiality. Here, apparently, the method is applied to answer urgent questions in relation to sequence analysis of the novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV. It is interesting to verify that different papers at the moment seem to have reached the same conclusions, although in my opinion a comparison with other methods which are already published would add to the paper. On top, R.Yan et al , 1 Science 2020 4 March, beautifully detailed the putative region of the virus/ACE2 interaction. I recommend the authors quote this finding as well and if possible add the reference. This would help in validating a quite interesting method of sequence analysis.
