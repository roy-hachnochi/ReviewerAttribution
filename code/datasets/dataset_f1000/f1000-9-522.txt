            <meta name="dc.description" content=" Background: High maternal mortality rate is a major public health concern in developing countries.&amp;nbsp; Skilled birth delivery is central to reducing maternal mortality, yet health facility delivery remains low in Kitui County, Kenya. Our study estimated prevalence of unskilled delivery and identified factors associated with health facility delivery in Kitui County. 
 Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted December 2017-February 2018. 245 women from five administrative wards were interviewed. A structured questionnaire was used to collect data. Variables that had p value &le;0.05 in bivariate analysis were included in multivariable regression model to assess for confounders. Variables with a p value of &le;0.05 in multivariate analysis were considered statistically significant at 95% CI.&amp;nbsp; 
 Results: We interviewed 245 (240 analyzed) women from the five wards; the majority were 16-25 years age group (45.5%; 110/240).&amp;nbsp; Mean age was 27&amp;plusmn;6.6 years. Prevalence of health facility delivery was 50.4%. Distance from a health facility, number of children in a household, occupation of the respondent&rsquo;s partner, number of antenatal clinic (ANC) visits and means of transport were significant factors for not delivering in a health facility. On multivariate analysis, women who lived &amp;gt; 5km from health facility were less likely to deliver in a health facility (AOR =0.36; 95% CI 0.15- 0.86). Women who attended &ge; 4 ANC visits were 4 times more likely to deliver in a health facility (95% CI 2.01-8.79). 
 Conclusions: More than half of the respondents delivered in a health facility. A long distance from the health facility is a hindrance to accessing ANC services. Inadequate ANC visits was associated with home delivery. Improving accessibility of health care services and health education on family planning would increase delivery at a health facility. We recommend Kitui County introduce five satellite clinics/ambulatory services for expectant women to access ANC and maternal services.">

  "description": "Background: High maternal mortality rate is a major public health concern in developing countries.  Skilled birth delivery is central to reducing maternal mortality, yet health facility delivery remains low in Kitui County, Kenya. Our study estimated prevalence of unskilled delivery and identified factors associated with health facility delivery in Kitui County.
Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted December 2017-February 2018. 245 women from five administrative wards were interviewed. A structured questionnaire was used to collect data. Variables that had p value &le;0.05 in bivariate analysis were included in multivariable regression model to assess for confounders. Variables with a p value of &le;0.05 in multivariate analysis were considered statistically significant at 95% CI. 
Results: We interviewed 245 (240 analyzed) women from the five wards; the majority were 16-25 years age group (45.5%; 110/240).  Mean age was 27&amp;plusmn;6.6 years. Prevalence of health facility delivery was 50.4%. Distance from a health facility, number of children in a household, occupation of the respondent&rsquo;s partner, number of antenatal clinic (ANC) visits and means of transport were significant factors for not delivering in a health facility. On multivariate analysis, women who lived &amp;gt;5km from health facility were less likely to deliver in a health facility (AOR =0.36; 95% CI 0.15- 0.86). Women who attended &ge; 4 ANC visits were 4 times more likely to deliver in a health facility (95% CI 2.01-8.79).
Conclusions: More than half of the respondents delivered in a health facility. A long distance from the health facility is a hindrance to accessing ANC services. Inadequate ANC visits was associated with home delivery. Improving accessibility of health care services and health education on family planning would increase delivery at a health facility. We recommend Kitui County introduce five satellite clinics/ambulatory services for expectant women to access ANC and maternal services."

Skilled birth delivery is central to reducing maternal mortality, yet health facility delivery remains low in Kitui County, Kenya. Our study estimated prevalence of unskilled delivery and identified factors associated with health facility delivery in Kitui County.<br/> <b>Methods: </b>A cross-sectional study was conducted December 2017-February 2018. 245 women from five administrative wards were interviewed. A structured questionnaire was used to collect data. Variables that had p value ≤0.05 in bivariate analysis were included in multivariable regression model to assess for confounders. Variables with a p value of ≤0.05 in multivariate analysis were considered statistically significant at 95% CI.&nbsp;<br/> <b>Results:</b> We interviewed 245 (240 analyzed) women from the five wards; the majority were 16-25 years age group (45.5%; 110/240).&nbsp; Mean age was 27&plusmn;6.6 years. Prevalence of health facility delivery was 50.4%. Distance from a health facility, number of children in a household, occupation of the respondent’s partner, number of antenatal clinic (ANC) visits and means of transport were significant factors for not delivering in a health facility. On multivariate analysis, women who lived <u>&gt;</u>5km from health facility were less likely to deliver in a health facility (AOR =0.36; 95% CI 0.15- 0.86). Women who attended ≥ 4 ANC visits were 4 times more likely to deliver in a health facility (95% CI 2.01-8.79).<br/> <b>Conclusions:</b> More than half of the respondents delivered in a health facility. A long distance from the health facility is a hindrance to accessing ANC services. Inadequate ANC visits was associated with home delivery. Improving accessibility of health care services and health education on family planning would increase delivery at a health facility. We recommend Kitui County introduce five satellite clinics/ambulatory services for expectant women to access ANC and maternal services. </div> <div class=abstract-for-mobile> <div class="margin-top-30 padding-bottom-30 research-layout is-centered"> <button class="primary orange-text white-bg bigger-text abstract-expand-button-mobile with-border show" style="display: none;"> READ ALL <span class="f1r-icon icon-14_more_small orange vmiddle big"></span> </button> <button class="primary orange-text white-bg bigger-text abstract-expand-button-mobile with-border hide"> READ LESS <span class="f1r-icon icon-10_less_small orange vmiddle big"></span> </button> </div> </div> </div> <div class=clearfix></div> <div class="article-context no-divider"> <div class="article-abstract article-page-general-text-mobile research-layout generated-article-body"> <h2 class=main-title>Keywords</h2> <p class="u-mb--0 u-pb--2"> Home delivery, Health facility delivery, skilled birth delivery, delivery practices, Kitui </p> </div> </div> <div class=article-information> <span class="info-separation padding-bottom"> <div id=corresponding-author-icon class="email-icon float-left"> <span class="f1r-icon icon-6_email orange"></span> <div id=corresponding-author-window class="margin-top-20 popup-window-wrapper is-hidden"> <div class="popup-window corresponding-authors-popup"> <div class=corresponding-author-container> <div class="popup-window-title small">Corresponding Author(s)</div> <div class=authors> Mathew Munyamaara Mutiiria (<a href="mailto:mutiiriam25@yahoo.com">mutiiriam25@yahoo.com</a>) </div> </div> <div class="margin-top margin-bottom float-left"> <button id=close-popup-window class=general-white-orange-button>Close</button> </div> </div> </div> </div> <span class="icon-text float-left" data-test-id=box-corresponding-author> <b>Corresponding author:</b> Mathew Munyamaara Mutiiria </span> <div class=clearfix></div> </span> <span class="info-separation padding-bottom competing-interests-display"> <span class=competing-interests-title>Competing interests:</span> No competing interests were disclosed. </span> <div class="info-separation padding-bottom grant-information-display"> <span class=grant-information-title>Grant information:</span> The author(s) declared that no grants were involved in supporting this work. </div> <span class="f1r-article-desk info-separation padding-bottom"> <span class="copywrite-icon float-left"> <span class="f1r-icon icon-100_open_access"></span> </span> <span class="icon-text float-left" data-test-id=box-copyright-text> <b>Copyright:</b>&nbsp; © 2020 Mutiiria MM <em>et al</em>.

This made it impossible to achieve the MDG 5<sup><a href="#ref-2">2</a></sup> that aimed to reduce maternal and neonatal deaths (now Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 3). However, maternal deaths have reduced from 546,000 in 1990 to 358,000 in 2015 representing a 34% reduction. Between 2016 and 2030, as part of the SDGs, the target is to reduce the global maternal mortality ratio to less than 70 per 100 000 live births<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a></sup>. In order to achieve, universal health care has been recognized as one of four pillars of government policy and is therefore receiving support from many quarters.</p><p class="" id=d9359e208>According to Safe Motherhood Initiative (SMI) introduced by World Health Organization (WHO), hospital deliveries were fewer than home deliveries in many regions of sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). The reason for this is that the initiative lacks a clear, concise realistic strategy<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a></sup>. As a result, a high number of still births (3.2 million), 4 million neonatal deaths and more than half a million maternal deaths, continue to occur. Most of these deaths are preventable<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a></sup>, and when skilled health personnel provide delivery services within health facilities to pregnant women, maternal and neonatal health outcomes improve<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a></sup>.</p><p class="" id=d9359e222>In Kenya, skilled birth attendance has remained far below the international target of 90% at 44%. Skilled birth attendance during delivery is a benchmark indicator for safe motherhood<sup><a href="#ref-6">6</a></sup>. Delivery by a skilled birth attendant reduces chances of maternal complications. A study by Nyongesa <i>et al.</i> found that the gender of a service provider, cost, number of antenatal visits and education level were strongly associated with client’s intention to deliver with a skilled birth attendant at delivery<sup><a href="#ref-7">7</a></sup>.</p><p class="" id=d9359e236>In Kitui county, Kenya, skilled birth attendance has equally remained very low. Moreover, Mwingi North Subcounty has recorded a low number of deliveries in the health facilities. The district health information system (DHIS2) reported 1472 normal hospital deliveries in 2015 were 1472, 1594 in 2016, and 1194 in 2017<sup><a href="#ref-8">8</a></sup>.</p><p class="" id=d9359e243>Even though delivery by skilled birth attendants have remained low, the immunization coverage at a country and county level have remained above the national government rate, showing that immunization coverage is not proportional to the number of skilled birth attendants. According to the Kenya health information system (KHIS), the number of Bacillus Calmette Guillen (BCG) antigen doses administered in Mwingi north Subcounty in 2017 was 3268, while the number of deliveries recorded by skilled birth attendants was 1154<sup><a href="#ref-8">8</a></sup>. This means that over 65% of babies were delivered at home without the help of a skilled birth attendant, as BCG vaccines are administered within 6 weeks of birth.</p><p class="" id=d9359e251>Improving maternal delivery care is an essential element of attaining improved maternal health. In order to achieve this agenda, information about the rates and trends in maternal mortality is essential for resource mobilization, monitoring and evaluation of progress towards the SDGs. However, for this to be attained, maternal health programs should be based on quality evidence. Therefore, this cross-sectional study aimed to identify factors affecting health facility deliveries in Mwingi North Subcounty, Kenya.</p></div><div id=article1-body class=generated-article-body><h2 class=main-title id=d9359e257>Methods</h2><div class=section><a name=d9359e260 class=n-a></a><h3 class=section-title>Study setting</h3><p class="" id=d9359e265>The study was carried out in five administrative wards of Mwingi North Subcounty, which has a catchment population of 160,938.

attended less than four visits. Among these, 21.3% delivered in a health facility while the rest delivered in their homes. The majority of those who attended more than four ANC visits (70; 29.2%) delivered in a health facility as opposed to 12.9% (31) who delivered in their homes. When we carried out bivariate analysis, number of ANC visits was significant for giving birth in a health facility (chi<sup>2</sup>=23.6, df=1, p=0.001).</p><p class="" id=d9359e1830>A quarter of the respondents (65; 21.1%) had a parity of 1+0, among them 64.6% (42) delivered in a health facility while the rest delivered in their homes. There were 31 respondents who had a parity of &gt;5 (12.9%), of these the majority (24; 10%) delivered in their homes.</p><p class="" id=d9359e1833>Regarding family size (number of children) in household most of the respondents 48.8% (117) had 1–2 children. Of these 64.9% (76) delivered at a health facility while the rest delivered in their homes, however respondents who had more than 7 children were few 6.7% (16) of which 81.1% (13) delivered in their homes Chi<sup>2</sup>=21.6,df=3, p=0.00007 (<a href="#T2">Table 2</a>).</p><p class="" id=d9359e1842>In a multivariate model, four or more ANC visits (AOR=2.914, 95% CI 1.105-7.682), parity of the woman (AOR=0.12, 95% CI 0.01-3.44) and the number of children in the homestead (AOR=1.96, 95% CI 0.06-35.02) did not significantly influence place of delivery (<a href="#T2">Table 2</a>).</p></div><div class=section><a name=d9359e1849 class=n-a></a><h3 class=section-title>Facility and cultural-related factors affecting delivery in a health facility</h3><p class="" id=d9359e1854>Most of the respondents (86; 35.9%) lived approximately 6 to 10 km away from a health facility. Among these 18.8% (45) delivered at home, while only 17.1% (41) delivered in a health facility. Very few respondents lived a distance less than 5km from a health facility (71; 30.1%) (chi<sup>2</sup>=19.7, df=2, p=0.0001).</p><p class="" id=d9359e1860>Distance from a nearby health institution, means of transport, cost of transport and presence of traditional practices were factors that were statistically significantly determined place of delivery (<a href="#T1">Table 1</a>).</p><p class="" id=d9359e1866>In a multivariate model, only distance that was associated factor for delivery in a health facility. Those who lived over 5km from a health facility were less likely to deliver in a health facility (AOR=0.37, 95% CI 0.19-0.72), presence of traditional practice (AOR=0.36, 95% CI 0.15-0.86) and means of transport (AOR=0.001, 95% CI 2.38-9.56). Those who used an ambulance on referral were more likely to deliver in a health facility than those who used other means of transport (Crude odds ratio (COR)=2.21, CI 95% 1.11-4.54) (<a href="#T2">Table 2</a>).</p></div></div><div id=article1-body class=generated-article-body><h2 class=main-title id=d9359e1876>Discussion</h2><p class="" id=d9359e1879>The percentage of women who delivered through the help of a skilled birth attendant is one indicator in meeting MDG 5 (now SDG3 – ensuring good healthy lives and promote wellbeing for all ages). In almost all countries where health professionals attend more than 80% of deliveries, maternal mortality rate is usually below 200 per 100,000 live births.</p><p class="" id=d9359e1882>In Kenya, delivery by skilled birth attendants (health professionals) is available at very few births<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a></sup>. This study therefore considered factors affecting delivery in a health facility. The study has shown that that only 50.4% of the respondents had a delivery conducted by a skilled delivery attendant. Our results are slightly different from those from KDHS, whereby statistics for skilled attendants were 44% in Kenya.</p><p class="" id=d9359e1889>Our study demonstrated that there is no significant relationship between age and delivery in a health facility. However, other studies, e.g. a study by Mrisho <i>et al.</i><sup><a href="#ref-10">10</a></sup> in Tanzania, showed that a higher percentage of younger women deliver at health facilities in contrast to older women who often choose to deliver at home. A study by Bhattacharyaya <i>et al.</i> on factors associated with preference of a health facility delivery indicated that older women preferred health facility delivery as opposed to younger women<sup><a href="#ref-11">11</a></sup>. The reason given for this discrepancy according to studies in Zambia and Tanzania was that younger women were inexperienced and also more afraid of birth complications than older women.</p><p class="" id=d9359e1905>The present study showed that attendance of &gt;4 ANC visits influenced the place of delivery. This study agrees with a study that indicated that women who attended &gt;4 ANC visits were likely to deliver in a health facility than those who did less visits<sup><a href="#ref-11">11</a></sup>. In addition, the study by Bhattacharyya <i>et al.</i> indicated that marital status had little influence on the attendance of ANC during the mother’s last pregnancy and consequently on delivery in a health facility; in this study, single and married women mostly delivered either at home or at a government health facility. A study conducted in Myanmar<sup><a href="#ref-12">12</a></sup> showed similar findings. In this study, the majority of divorced women delivered at home whereas widowed women delivered at either a private or government health facility. Women who make more than 4 ANC visits may have bad obstetric history or perhaps have started ANC visits at earliest gestation<sup><a href="#ref-12">12</a></sup>.</p><p class="" id=d9359e1924>In our study, the number of children (parity) had a negative impact on delivery in a hospital. We found that women with higher parity and having more than two children in the family were more likely to deliver in their homes than their counterparts with low parity and one or two children. These study findings are similar to a study in Myanmar that indicated that women who have given birth more than once are less likely to seek maternal care at a health facility because they feel they can manage the birthing process without the assistance of a health care professional<sup><a href="#ref-13">13</a></sup>. It was also shown in the present study that the respondent’s partners played a role in determining place of delivery; those women whose partners had formal jobs were more likely to deliver in a health facility as opposed to those whose partners’ job was casual or otherwise. The findings are similar to those of a study by Okang and Kaseje in Eritrea found that partners who had formal employment were more likely to deliver in a health facility than those with non-formal employment<sup><a href="#ref-14">14</a></sup>.</p><p class="" id=d9359e1935>Level of education is recognized as having an influence on the place of delivery. Women with non-formal education are more likely to deliver at home as opposed to a formally educated woman with a higher probability of delivering at a health facility<sup><a href="#ref-15">15</a></sup>, as shown by studies carried out in Nepal, Columbia and Kenya<sup><a href="#ref-16">16</a></sup>. Additionally a study by Feyissa and Genemo in Ethiopia showed that the level of education has a significant influence on health facility delivery<sup><a href="#ref-15">15</a></sup>. Contrary to above, the results of this study in Mwingi North Subcounty show that education has little or no influence on the place of delivery. From the data obtained from our respondents, most of the women, irrespective of their level of education, delivered either at home or at a government health facility except for women with adult education who exclusively delivered at their own homes. This finding was in contrast to the anticipated results that would have shown a distinction in place of delivery depending on a woman’s educational attainment.</p><p class="" id=d9359e1950>Similarly according to Addai<sup><a href="#ref-13">13</a></sup>, in this study farming women were less likely to seek medical care at the time of delivery than women in other occupations. This was also influenced by the occupation of partners. This may be because partners with formal employment may be able to provide insurance cover; limitation of financial resources and poor access to health services are cited as the two reasons why farming woman give birth at home<sup><a href="#ref-17">17</a></sup>.</p><p class="" id=d9359e1961>Regarding health facility-related factors, most of the respondents in this study lived more than 10km from a health centre and therefore delivered at home due to the long distance from their homes to the heath facility. The number of ANC clinic visits were proportionately reduced; as distance increased the number of ANC visits decreased. Our study findings concur with Bhattacharyya <i>et al.</i><sup><a href="#ref-11">11</a></sup> whose findings in a study in India showed that women who gave birth at home would rather have delivered at a health facility but the long distance accompanied by transport challenges proved to be a hindrance. Moreover, a study in Nepal by Devkota <i>et al.</i><sup><a href="#ref-18">18</a></sup> drew a similar conclusion, where they found that approximately 18% of women who had intended to deliver at a health facility ended up delivering at home. These findings are in agreement with Kenya’s KDHS that showed that most of the health facilities are over 5km radius from the consumers of services<sup><a href="#ref-19">19</a></sup>.</p></div><div id=article1-body class=generated-article-body><h2 class=main-title id=d9359e1983>Conclusions</h2><p class="" id=d9359e1986>Health facilities are the preferred sites for delivery regardless of the level of education, marital status and occupation of the respondents. Multiparous women are less likely to give birth at a health facility in preference of home deliveries. Long distance from the health facility is a hindrance to accessing health services and in turn maternal health care from qualified medical practitioners in Mwingi North Subcounty, Kenya.</p></div><div id=article1-body class=generated-article-body><h2 class=main-title id=d9359e1993>Data availability</h2><div class=section><a name=d9359e1996 class=n-a></a><h3 class=section-title>Underlying data</h3><p class="" id=d9359e2001>Figshare: Factors associated with health facility delivery in Kitui County; A cross sectional study, <a target=xrefwindow href="https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.12295466.v1" id=d9359e2003>https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.12295466.v1</a><sup><a href="#ref-20">20</a></sup>.</p></div><div class=section><a name=d9359e2011 class=n-a></a><h3 class=section-title>Extended data</h3><p class="" id=d9359e2016>Figshare: Questionnaires, <a target=xrefwindow href="https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.12374702.v1" id=d9359e2018>https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.12374702.v1</a><sup><a href="#ref-9">9</a></sup>.</p><p class="" id=d9359e2025>This project contains the following extended data:</p><div class=list><a name=d9359e2028 class=n-a></a><ul style="list-style-type: none"><li><p id=d9359e2035><span class=label>- </span> Questionnaire in the language it was asked with an English translation.</p></li></ul></div><p class="" id=d9359e2040>Data are available under the terms of the <a target=xrefwindow href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode" id=d9359e2042>Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license</a> (CC-BY 4.0).</p></div></div><div id=article1-back class=generated-article-footer><div class=back-section><a name=d9359e2051 class=n-a></a><h2 class=main-title id=d9359e2053>Acknowledgements</h2><p class="" id=d9359e2056>The authors thank the study participants and their families.
