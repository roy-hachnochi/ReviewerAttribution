The authors should be congratulated for prospectively collecting information regarding risk factors for advanced liver fibrosis in patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. The medical literature lacks enough data. The main predictors obviously include thrombocytopenia and components of metabolic syndrome. The authors may want to discuss the metabolic syndrome is an independent factor for predicting more advanced fibrosis (if the statistics confirms it). The discussion can be simplified by minimizing results of animal studies and enhancing more results of human studies.
