The authors present a Dashboard's development to analyze the COVID-19 contagious and death base in open data available. The paper is well-written and presents interesting results clearly and concisely. I have enjoyed reading this paper. I have the following comments for the authors that should be addressed before indexing: The model presented to predict the time series's tendencies is easy to understand and has a fast implementation. However, I recommend reviewing time series analysis like ARIMA, recurrent neural network, or systems dynamics, which let to include more data in the estimation of the tendencies of the time series. It will be interesting to review initiatives like presented in Kaggle wherein collaborative works, have presented alternatives since the data science field could help to combat the COVID-19 disease.
