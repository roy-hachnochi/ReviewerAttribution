The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has created a worldwide crisis and inspired an urgent search for prevention and treatment of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Barh and his colleagues describe in this article the important role of immuno-informatics by using molecular modeling and docking for chimeric peptide design anti-Spike peptides for SARS-CoV-2 potential therapeutics against the covid-19 infection. The introduction provides a good, generalized background of the topic that quickly gives the reader an appreciation of the applications of the technique. “A large global effort is required to stop viral epidemics and pandemics, and these manuscript insights may lead to identifying novel ways to stop infection.” To this end, this manuscript highlights clearly the potential opportunities several peptides blocking the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 Spike RBD and hACE2 as probable application in clinical practice. Overall the topic and the data are very interesting. The manuscript is very well written, well organized, easy to follow, and appropriate in scope and method. Certainly this study will contribute much to the literature.
