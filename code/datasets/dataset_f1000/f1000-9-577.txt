            <meta name="dc.description" content=" Background: Poor response to questionnaires collecting outcome data in randomised controlled trials (RCTs) can affect the validity of trial results. The aim of this study within a trial (SWAT) was to evaluate the effectiveness of including a pen with a follow-up postal questionnaire on response rate. 
 Methods: A two-armed RCT was embedded within SSHeW (Stopping Slips among Healthcare Workers), a trial of slip-resistant footwear to reduce slips in NHS staff. &amp;nbsp;Participants were randomised 1:1 to receive a pen or no pen with their follow-up questionnaire. The primary outcome was the proportion of participants who returned the questionnaire. Secondary outcomes were: time to response, completeness of response, and whether a postal reminder notice was required. Data were analysed using logistic regression, linear regression and Cox proportional hazards regression. 
 Results: Overall, 1466 SSHEW trial participants were randomised into the SWAT. In total, 13 withdrew from the host trial before they were due to be sent their follow-up questionnaire, 728 participants received a pen with their questionnaire, and 725 did not receive a pen.&amp;nbsp; A questionnaire was returned from 67.7% of the pen group and 64.7% of the group who did not receive a pen. There was no significant difference in return rates between the two groups (OR 1.15, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.43, p=0.22), nor level of completeness of the questionnaires (AMD -0.01, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.05, p=0.77).&amp;nbsp; There was weak evidence of a reduction in the proportion of participants requiring a reminder and in time to response in the pen group. 
 Conclusion: Inclusion of a pen with the follow-up postal questionnaire sent to participants in the SSHeW trial did not statistically significantly increase the response rate. These results add to the body of evidence around improving response rates in trials.

  "description": "Background: Poor response to questionnaires collecting outcome data in randomised controlled trials (RCTs) can affect the validity of trial results. The aim of this study within a trial (SWAT) was to evaluate the effectiveness of including a pen with a follow-up postal questionnaire on response rate.
Methods: A two-armed RCT was embedded within SSHeW (Stopping Slips among Healthcare Workers), a trial of slip-resistant footwear to reduce slips in NHS staff.  Participants were randomised 1:1 to receive a pen or no pen with their follow-up questionnaire. The primary outcome was the proportion of participants who returned the questionnaire. Secondary outcomes were: time to response, completeness of response, and whether a postal reminder notice was required. Data were analysed using logistic regression, linear regression and Cox proportional hazards regression.
Results: Overall, 1466 SSHEW trial participants were randomised into the SWAT. In total, 13 withdrew from the host trial before they were due to be sent their follow-up questionnaire, 728 participants received a pen with their questionnaire, and 725 did not receive a pen.  A questionnaire was returned from 67.7% of the pen group and 64.7% of the group who did not receive a pen. There was no significant difference in return rates between the two groups (OR 1.15, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.43, p=0.22), nor level of completeness of the questionnaires (AMD -0.01, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.05, p=0.77).  There was weak evidence of a reduction in the proportion of participants requiring a reminder and in time to response in the pen group.
Conclusion: Inclusion of a pen with the follow-up postal questionnaire sent to participants in the SSHeW trial did not statistically significantly increase the response rate. These results add to the body of evidence around improving response rates in trials.
Trial registration: ISRCTN 33051393 (for SSHEW). Registered on 14/03/2017."

The aim of this study within a trial (SWAT) was to evaluate the effectiveness of including a pen with a follow-up postal questionnaire on response rate.<br/> <b>Methods:</b> A two-armed RCT was embedded within SSHeW (Stopping Slips among Healthcare Workers), a trial of slip-resistant footwear to reduce slips in NHS staff. &nbsp;Participants were randomised 1:1 to receive a pen or no pen with their follow-up questionnaire. The primary outcome was the proportion of participants who returned the questionnaire. Secondary outcomes were: time to response, completeness of response, and whether a postal reminder notice was required. Data were analysed using logistic regression, linear regression and Cox proportional hazards regression.<br/> <b>Results:</b> Overall, 1466 SSHEW trial participants were randomised into the SWAT. In total, 13 withdrew from the host trial before they were due to be sent their follow-up questionnaire, 728 participants received a pen with their questionnaire, and 725 did not receive a pen.&nbsp; A questionnaire was returned from 67.7% of the pen group and 64.7% of the group who did not receive a pen. There was no significant difference in return rates between the two groups (OR 1.15, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.43, p=0.22), nor level of completeness of the questionnaires (AMD -0.01, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.05, p=0.77).&nbsp; There was weak evidence of a reduction in the proportion of participants requiring a reminder and in time to response in the pen group.<br/> <b>Conclusion: </b>Inclusion of a pen with the follow-up postal questionnaire sent to participants in the SSHeW trial did not statistically significantly increase the response rate. These results add to the body of evidence around improving response rates in trials.<br/> <b>Trial registration:</b> ISRCTN <a href="http://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN33051393">33051393</a> (for SSHEW).

Considering these to be true effects, in order to receive one additional questionnaire, 33 participants would have to be sent a pen, at a cost of approximately 33x32p=£10.56. Approximately 91 participants would need to be sent a pen to prevent one reminder mailing and therefore to save £2.42. Hence, roughly one reminder is required per three retained participants, and the cost per retained participant is approximately £10.</p></div></div><div id=article1-body class=generated-article-body><h2 class=main-title id=d17095e1123>Discussion</h2><p class="" id=d17095e1126>Whilst the results of all outcomes in this SWAT favoured the pen group, we found that the addition of a pen did not statistically significantly increase the response rate to, or completeness of, a follow-up questionnaire sent at 14 weeks post-randomisation among participants of the SSHeW trial. There was some evidence of a reduction in time to response and the number of reminders required.</p><p class="" id=d17095e1129>It may be that, in this group of participants, the pen failed to act as a facilitator or was not a sufficient incentive to return the questionnaire, given the fact that participants in the trial already received a free pair of shoes (although offer of shoes was not conditional on returning the questionnaire).</p><p class="" id=d17095e1132>However, the trial ultimately only had about 40% power to detect a difference of 3% in response rates (from 64.7 to 67.7%) and is therefore at risk of a type II error. Another potential weakness is that, due to the select population of healthcare workers, the results may not be generalisable to other populations or contexts.</p><p class="" id=d17095e1135>The strength of this study is that it was a randomised trial.</p></div><div id=article1-body class=generated-article-body><h2 class=main-title id=d17095e1141>Conclusion</h2><p class="" id=d17095e1144>This SWAT suggests that enclosing a pen in a questionnaire mail out may be an effective method to increase response rates but was likely underpowered to detect a statistically significant difference of the 3% observed. Since pens are inexpensive, even a small difference is likely to be cost-effective. The results contribute to the body of evidence regarding this intervention and may be included in future meta-analyses to improve power.</p></div><div id=article1-body class=generated-article-body><h2 class=main-title id=d17095e1151>Data availability</h2><div class=section><a name=d17095e1154 class=n-a></a><h3 class=section-title>Underlying data</h3><p class="" id=d17095e1159>Open Science Framework: SSHeW Trial Pen SWAT, <a target=xrefwindow href="http://dx.doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/YQ76U" id=d17095e1161>https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/YQ76U</a><sup><a href="#ref-12">12</a></sup>.</p></div><div class=section><a name=d17095e1169 class=n-a></a><h3 class=section-title>Reporting guidelines</h3><p class="" id=d17095e1174>Open Science Framework: CONSORT checklist for ‘Enclosing a pen to improve response rate to postal questionnaire: an embedded randomised controlled trial’, <a target=xrefwindow href="http://dx.doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/YQ76U" id=d17095e1176>https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/YQ76U</a><sup><a href="#ref-12">12</a></sup>.</p><p class="" id=d17095e1183>Data are available under the terms of the <a target=xrefwindow href="http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/" id=d17095e1185>Creative Commons Zero "No rights reserved" data waiver</a> (CC0 1.0 Public domain dedication).</p></div></div><div id=article1-back class=generated-article-footer><div class=back-section><a name=d17095e1194 class=n-a></a><h2 class=main-title id=d17095e1196>Acknowledgements</h2><p class="" id=d17095e1199>The authors would like to thank the embedded trial participants who returned their trial documentation and the data administration staff at the YTU who worked to support the study.</p><p class="" id=d17095e1202>The paper was written by the authors on behalf of the SSHeW Trial team, which is made up of the following individuals: Emily Bain (Health and Safety Executive); Sarah Cockayne (University of York); Rachel Cunningham-Burley (University of York); Caroline Fairhurst (University of York); Gillian Frost (Health and Safety Executive); Catherine Hewitt (University of York); Heather Iles-Smith (Leeds Teaching Hospital NHS Trust); Mark Liddle (Health and Safety Executive), Misbah Mogradia (Health and Safety Executive); David Torgerson (University of York), Michael Zand (Health and Safety Executive) and others.
