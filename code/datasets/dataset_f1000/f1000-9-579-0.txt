This manuscript projects interesting findings and correlations on diagnosis delay with deaths of dengue patients in Myanmar. For a country with high dengue burden, interventions on such findings will greatly enhance dengue diagnosis, referral, timely treatment and patient survival. Methods are clearly elucidated; strengths and weaknesses have been described well. Language and command in general is good, however, may need to be re-looked into in some sentences. I have some suggestions as below: In the abstract: Most of the patients who died did not have a diagnosis of dengue before admission. This Sentence needs rephrasing . In the introduction: Dengue death is commonly associated with co-morbidities and clinicians should be aware if dengue patients fulfil the severe case definition on admission . Word “severe” may be in inverted commas In the methods: Doctors are first available at sub-township level station hospitals. Remove “first” Some general comments: Definition of “delay” is not clear. After how many days would it be considered as delayed? In table 3, would it be more appropriate to use the word “duration” since there is no clear definition as to from which day “delay” would imply? Ecological factors in this manuscript described include rainfall. Rainfall can be one of the factors among other such as temperature, vegetation and urbanization. Information on these variables, if available may be interesting. Some papers have been cited for your reference. In the discussion: Mo st of the patients did not have a diagnosis of dengue fever before admission and more than half of the patients were in shock at admission. Does that mean patient previously visited some kind of health centres prior to admission? For those that were diagnosed, how was the diagnosis made?
