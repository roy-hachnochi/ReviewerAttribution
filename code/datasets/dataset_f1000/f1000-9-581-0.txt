Feng et al . described a novel method named seqpare, to measure the similarity between two sets of genomic intervals. I think the authors picked an important problem to work on and they presented a nice solution. The performance, from their studies, seem quite impressive. It is a nice new tool for solving such problems. but I do have a few issues with the paper. I never get what exactly does “self-consistent” really mean. I do not think this is the same as the consistent used in statistics which is an asymptotic property. I think the authors should provide a better explanation of this term and why this is important for such a problem. Genomic intervals, in my opinion, should come with genomic coordinates, to indicate where does it come from in terms of the reference genome. Of course, this will not be the case if the data does not come from a model organism. I am surprised that such information is not used in their method. I think it is a disadvantage if this is not used. Since the problem can be much easier if order is being considered. I am interested to know what do the authors think about this. Figure 1C is not mentioned in the paper. Not sure why.
