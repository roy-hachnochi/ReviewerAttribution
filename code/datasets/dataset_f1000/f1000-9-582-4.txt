Thanks for the valuable article posted. The selection of cases is well done and the research path is well described. Given the problems of people with hearing loss with more falls, please explain if the results are positive, is it possible to do this protocol in more hearing loss or not? In the section on formal validity and reliability, please indicate the number obtained from the information collected from eight academic members of the university. In the future perspective of this protocol, if the results are positive, it is appropriate to have auditory rehabilitation in the control group. Please explain why the degree of education must be at least a diploma?
