The paper profoundly presents what the World Health Organization has been stressing on the need to develop research capacity at the supply side of healthcare. In the developing countries, training of researchers through traditional institutions, such as the University is one of the reasons we have very few qualified researchers since most people cannot afford the cost of attaining the universities. The paper is well written, concise, clear, and compelling. I strongly recommend the acceptance and immediate publication of the manuscript, to motivate the local onsite training of researchers and preparation for the next epidemic.
