As pointed out by this review, the evidence for hypokalemia in COVID-19 is weak, promulgated by a single unpublished article that was not corroborated by larger series studies. My chief concern about the review, is that it amplifies the myth. Furthermore, the frequent use of loop diuretics in ARDS, which cause hypokalemia, makes a causal connection between the development of hypokalemia and COVID-19 precarious. At the very least, the title should be changed to minimize the connection between hypokalemia and COVID-19. Paragraph 1 is somewhat misleading. Although COVID-19 does have an array of different sequela, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) seems to be the most common serve form of the disease. The first paragraph should provide an incidence of this and the other sequela. Reference to large studies from China, Europe and North American should be cited. Paragraph 2 The statement “SARS-CoV-2 may affect the kidneys directly and indirectly by both renal and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAS) involvement,” has no factual basis. There are a few small studies that demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 can infect the kidney but it is presently unclear if this is a key mechanism of AKI in COVID19. Paragraph 3 Provide a reference to Mas receptor on type 2 alveolar epithelial cells as stated. Paragraph 3 last sentence. This is evidence for SARS-COV, not SARS-COV2 Provide a reference to “hyperaldosteronism does not always cause hypokalaemia.” Although “Switch” activation has been a popular explanation for this, it has never been proven. Perhaps, the authors could cite clinical studies, demonstrating the development of severe hypokalemia in normokalemic PA patients following thiazide administration as evidence. The limitations of TTKG should be articulated.
