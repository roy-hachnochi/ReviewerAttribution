A very challenging case and its management has been described in a clear manner by the authors. However, the absence of any supporting evidence - i.e., radiological or clinical pictures, histopathology pictures - severely limits the utility of this case report to another clinical practitioner. I recommend that the authors provide the entire gamut of clinical and radiological images along with histopathology to enrich the value of this article.
