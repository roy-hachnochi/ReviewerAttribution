Mitchell et al. elegantly describe a SWAT of personalized vs. non-personalized reminder text messages embedded in a randomized orthopaedic trial. The primary outcome was questionnaire return at 12 months, and the secondary outcomes were proportion of completed questionnaires, and time to questionnaire return. There was no difference in any outcome between groups. Minor issues: There is a large body of evidence outlining strategies to improve return rates of postal questionnaires 1 . The primary outcome in this study, questionnaire return at 12 months, could be confounded by the host trial efforts to improve postal questionnaire return. Can the authors report more information on the host trial efforts to optimize postal questionnaire return? The questionnaire return rates for this subgroup of host trial participants was very high (~89%). Can the authors report the questionnaire return rates for the 809 people in the host trial who were not included in the SWAT, or if this is not available, the overall questionnaire return rate for the host trial? In Figure 1, can you please clarify the difference between those excluded in the first box for “did not provide a valid mobile phone number” and those who were sent a questionnaire and “did not provide a valid phone number”?
