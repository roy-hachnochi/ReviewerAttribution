This is an interesting topic for investigation, with very little scientific research done so far, but may have large implications. However, the study has some substantial limitations, mainly the very limited sample size, and the fact that the order of conditions was not randomized. Even though the authors discuss these, I strongly question the validity of the outcomes and conclusions. The authors state that a priori power calculation was not possible, but they could have considered what would be a relevant difference to detect in their outcomes, also based on the available literature on (changes in) smell/taste function under similar circumstances. This small sample size is likely the reason for their null effects, so I am not sure how valid it is to actually publish these findings. At least, phrase this clearly as an exploratory pilot study (e.g. also in the title etc). At what time of day were the assessments done? The authors should then in more depth discuss potential effects of time of day or fatigue (also given the trend towards increased sleepiness during the 2 nd assessment). Moreover, specifically for wine tasting, time of day and circumstances/context are important. It does not make sense to me that intensity was assessed on a hedonic scale. Why was this chosen, and not an LMS or VAS? Also, why was intensity chosen as the main outcome (which is better assessed with a trained panel), rather than liking (which is better suited for a consumer panel, such as used here)? The authors m​​​​​issed out on a relevant paper, on liking of foods in airplanes: Holthuysen et al. (2017 1 ). I am not convinced that figure 1 adds any relevance to the paper and study described.
