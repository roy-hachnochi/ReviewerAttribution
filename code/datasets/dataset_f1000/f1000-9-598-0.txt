This model predicts that any disease that causes elevated [Ca 2+ ] i may trigger central insulin resistance, and explains why central insulin resistance is related to the pathogenesis of AD, and glutamate excitotoxicity is a comorbidity. The model also predicts that any intervention aimed at maintaining low [Ca 2+ ] i can be used to treat central insulin resistance. It is an interesting theory between brain insulin resistance and AD. Although not much experimental data support the theory directly, it is worth following.
