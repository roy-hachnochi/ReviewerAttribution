            <meta name="dc.description" content=" Background: Although there has been an extensive scale-up of malaria interventions in Kenya, malaria infections persist at unacceptably high levels in some of the regions. Even with renewed calls to eradicate the disease through increased international donor assistance and country-specific government involvement, malaria is still a cause of worry in endemic regions. The objective of this study was to determine the factors associated with the incidence of malaria in Kisumu County over time. 
 Methods: The study conducted secondary analysis of data from a cross-sectional survey of routinely reported malaria cases. The population of interest were patients confirmed to have malaria by laboratory test. A sample size of 384 was randomly selected from all laboratory-confirmed malaria cases as reported by health facilities in Kisumu County from January 2014 to December 2017. The analysis involved descriptive, trend analysis and time series analysis (ARIMA). A negative binomial regression model was used to measure the effect of each of the selected predictor variables on incidence of malaria and the incidence rate ratio, was reported. Frequency distribution of each of the categorical variables was calculated. 
 Results: The overall pattern of the reported malaria cases had seasonal variations for weekly cases. The best-fitting time series model developed for predicting the number of weekly reported cases of malaria was ARIMA (2, 0, 1). It was observed that the negative binomial was actually the best model to fit the incidences of malaria because the dispersion parameter given by Poisson regression model had been reduced from 70.292 to 1.103. 
 Conclusion: There is a need to encourage health professionals to regularly review and report cases of malaria in their facilities. This is because reporting rates, completeness and the consistency of malaria reported cases remain extremely low.">

  "description": "Background: Although there has been an extensive scale-up of malaria interventions in Kenya, malaria infections persist at unacceptably high levels in some of the regions. Even with renewed calls to eradicate the disease through increased international donor assistance and country-specific government involvement, malaria is still a cause of worry in endemic regions. The objective of this study was to determine the factors associated with the incidence of malaria in Kisumu County over time.
Methods: The study conducted secondary analysis of data from a cross-sectional survey of routinely reported malaria cases. The population of interest were patients confirmed to have malaria by laboratory test. A sample size of 384 was randomly selected from all laboratory-confirmed malaria cases as reported by health facilities in Kisumu County from January 2014 to December 2017. The analysis involved descriptive, trend analysis and time series analysis (ARIMA). A negative binomial regression model was used to measure the effect of each of the selected predictor variables on incidence of malaria and the incidence rate ratio, was reported. Frequency distribution of each of the categorical variables was calculated.
Results: The overall pattern of the reported malaria cases had seasonal variations for weekly cases. The best-fitting time series model developed for predicting the number of weekly reported cases of malaria was ARIMA (2, 0, 1). It was observed that the negative binomial was actually the best model to fit the incidences of malaria because the dispersion parameter given by Poisson regression model had been reduced from 70.292 to 1.103.
Conclusion: There is a need to encourage health professionals to regularly review and report cases of malaria in their facilities. This is because reporting rates, completeness and the consistency of malaria reported cases remain extremely low."

Even with renewed calls to eradicate the disease through increased international donor assistance and country-specific government involvement, malaria is still a cause of worry in endemic regions. The objective of this study was to determine the factors associated with the incidence of malaria in Kisumu County over time.<br/> <b>Methods:</b> The study conducted secondary analysis of data from a cross-sectional survey of routinely reported malaria cases. The population of interest were patients confirmed to have malaria by laboratory test. A sample size of 384 was randomly selected from all laboratory-confirmed malaria cases as reported by health facilities in Kisumu County from January 2014 to December 2017. The analysis involved descriptive, trend analysis and time series analysis (ARIMA). A negative binomial regression model was used to measure the effect of each of the selected predictor variables on incidence of malaria and the incidence rate ratio, was reported. Frequency distribution of each of the categorical variables was calculated.<br/> <b>Results: </b>The overall pattern of the reported malaria cases had seasonal variations for weekly cases. The best-fitting time series model developed for predicting the number of weekly reported cases of malaria was ARIMA (2, 0, 1). It was observed that the negative binomial was actually the best model to fit the incidences of malaria because the dispersion parameter given by Poisson regression model had been reduced from 70.292 to 1.103.<br/> <b>Conclusion:</b> There is a need to encourage health professionals to regularly review and report cases of malaria in their facilities. This is because reporting rates, completeness and the consistency of malaria reported cases remain extremely low. </div> <div class=abstract-for-mobile> <div class="margin-top-30 padding-bottom-30 research-layout is-centered"> <button class="primary orange-text white-bg bigger-text abstract-expand-button-mobile with-border show" style="display: none;"> READ ALL <span class="f1r-icon icon-14_more_small orange vmiddle big"></span> </button> <button class="primary orange-text white-bg bigger-text abstract-expand-button-mobile with-border hide"> READ LESS <span class="f1r-icon icon-10_less_small orange vmiddle big"></span> </button> </div> </div> </div> <div class=clearfix></div> <div class="article-context no-divider"> <div class="article-abstract article-page-general-text-mobile research-layout generated-article-body"> <h2 class=main-title>Keywords</h2> <p class="u-mb--0 u-pb--2"> Malaria, Trend Analysis, Modeling, Reported cases, ARIMA model, ACF and PACF plot, Negative Binomial, Poisson regression </p> </div> </div> <div class=article-information> <span class="info-separation padding-bottom"> <div id=corresponding-author-icon class="email-icon float-left"> <span class="f1r-icon icon-6_email orange"></span> <div id=corresponding-author-window class="margin-top-20 popup-window-wrapper is-hidden"> <div class="popup-window corresponding-authors-popup"> <div class=corresponding-author-container> <div class="popup-window-title small">Corresponding Author(s)</div> <div class=authors> Elsen Achieng (<a href="mailto:elsen_a@outlook.com">elsen_a@outlook.com</a>) </div> </div> <div class="margin-top margin-bottom float-left"> <button id=close-popup-window class=general-white-orange-button>Close</button> </div> </div> </div> </div> <span class="icon-text float-left" data-test-id=box-corresponding-author> <b>Corresponding author:</b> Elsen Achieng </span> <div class=clearfix></div> </span> <span class="info-separation padding-bottom competing-interests-display"> <span class=competing-interests-title>Competing interests:</span> No competing interests were disclosed. </span> <div class="info-separation padding-bottom grant-information-display"> <span class=grant-information-title>Grant information:</span> The author(s) declared that no grants were involved in supporting this work. </div> <span class="f1r-article-desk info-separation padding-bottom"> <span class="copywrite-icon float-left"> <span class="f1r-icon icon-100_open_access"></span> </span> <span class="icon-text float-left" data-test-id=box-copyright-text> <b>Copyright:</b>&nbsp; © 2020 Achieng E <em>et al</em>.

Sub-Saharan Africa bears its burden than any other region across the globe. The parasites are spread to humans through bites from infected <i>Anopheles</i> mosquitoes, introducing the protozoans into the human body. Even with renewed calls to eradicate the disease through increased international donor assistance and country specific government involvement, malaria is still a cause of worry in the endemic regions.</p><p class="" id=d29353e196>According to the world malaria report, anti-malaria progress has slowed down in many parts of the world and it is unlikely that the world will achieve targets for 2020 set by the World Health organization (WHO) Global Technical Strategy in reducing malaria incidences. A year on from this recognition, still there is no significant progress in global malaria control (<a href="#ref-14">WHO, 2018</a>). Globally, 219 million cases of malaria were estimated to have occurred in 2017 as compared to 239 million cases that occurred in 2010. Even though there were 20 million fewer cases by in 2017 than in the year 2010 worldwide, from 2015 to 2017 there was a slight upward change in trend, suggesting that progress had generally stalled (<a href="#ref-14">World Malaria Report, 2018</a>). The WHO statistics of 2017 reveal that Sub-Saharan Africa is still suffering greatly from malaria deaths, with 200 million cases comprising of 92% of the global burden. Malaria has impacted the health and economic development of Sub-Saharan African countries negatively and is considered a major impediment to sustainable development in the world’s poorest regions (<a href="#ref-10">Gallup &amp; Sachs, 2001</a>).</p><p class="" id=d29353e208>The 2030 Agenda adopted in September 2015 by world leaders was to ensure sustainable development globally. The aim is to eradicate poverty, improving health, reduce inequity and address challenges related to climate change by the year 2030. In order to track progress, they created a number of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), each having a specific target to be realized in the next 15 years. One of the set targets is to end epidemics of neglected tropical diseases and malaria by 2030. A set of indicators to track success on malaria eradication is, the number of malaria incidence experienced in a population and the number of people affected by neglected tropical diseases and are seeking interventions against these diseases (<a href="#ref-1">“SDG Indicators,” 2018</a>)</p><p class="" id=d29353e214>The inclusion of universal health coverage (UHC) reaffirms the position of the SDGs on global health priorities (<a href="#ref-5">Barasa <i>et al.</i>, 2018</a>). The purpose of UHC is to make sure that all citizens of a state are able to access curative, rehabilitative and preventive health services at minimum costs, thereby eliminating disparities in access to health care. This also includes free consultation, diagnosis services for normal ailments and getting drugs for free. The Kenyan UHC model of dispensation by the current government calls for the enhancement of HIV, tuberculosis and malaria treatment in the country, with the aim of eradication of these diseases.</p><p class="" id=d29353e224>More than 70% of the entire population in Kenya is at risk of malaria which is the major cause of ill health (<a href="#ref-50">KNBS, 2015</a>). In 2017, confirmed malaria incidences were 2,783,846 as reported by the public health facilities. The diagnosed cases contribute correspondingly to the high number of malaria deaths in the Kenyan population, which increased from 2016 to 2017 as a result of stalled progress in malaria prevention.</p><p class="" id=d29353e230>With the aim of achieving the largest reduction rate in morbidity and mortality, the President’s Malaria Initiative (PMI) has always considered the regions of Kenya experiencing the high incidences of malaria since 2013. The counties of Kisumu, Vihiga, Migori, Bungoma, Homa Bay, Kakamega, Busia and Siaya all together have a projected population of about 9.6 million in 2018 and bear the highest incidence of malaria in Kenya (<a href="#ref-31">President’s Malaria Initiative, 2018a</a>). The quarterly surveillance bulletin released in December 2016 revealed that, 73% of all confirmed malaria cases were reported from these counties (<a href="#ref-32">President’s Malaria Initiative, 2018b</a>). Execution of malaria control interventions focuses on endemic areas and are usually guided by the epidemiological zones. They include community managing the cases as they occur and intermittent preventive treatment in pregnancy (<a href="#ref-27">Musuva <i>et al.</i>, 2017</a>)</p><p class="" id=d29353e245>It is in the light of this discourse that the Kenyan government and other developing partners in the health sector have remained dedicated in improving the delivery of health service in various parts of the country, with high priority being placed on prevention and control measures of malaria in endemic regions with eventual elimination. This being one of the objectives that were to be realized by 2018, together they aimed at reducing malaria burden by two-thirds (<a href="#ref-11">US President’s Malaria Initiative, 2019</a>).</p><p class="" id=d29353e251>Malaria situation with regard to facility reported cases and distribution of malaria remains unclear within the recent past in the study area, despite the above-mentioned studies in various parts of the country. Therefore, this study aimed at mapping the corresponding factors contributing to the incidence of malaria with the trend data on malaria cases across the region.</p></div><div id=article1-body class=generated-article-body><h2 class=main-title id=d29353e257>Methods</h2><div class=section><a name=d29353e260 class=n-a></a><h3 class=section-title>Study design and setting</h3><p class="" id=d29353e265>A cross-sectional survey using routinely reported national Programme data on malaria cases in the DHIS2 platform, as reported by health facilities in Kisumu County was conducted from January 2014 to December 2017.</p><p class="" id=d29353e268>Kisumu County is located in the former Nyanza Province and its headquarters are in Kisumu City, which is situated approximately 370 km west of the Kenyan capital, Nairobi.

A trend analysis was applied to the weekly malaria reported cases and the appropriate ARIMA model fitted. The yearly cases have exhibited a continuous increasing trend except in 2017, where there was a decrease. The recorded yearly malaria cases for this study were also cyclical, for instance, the year 2016 represent an increase in cases over the years 2014 and 2015, whilst the year 2017 exhibited a decline compared with all other years.</p><p class="" id=d29353e1813>This increase may be due to improvements in the reporting system by health facilities over time, non-usage of mosquito nets by the residents and low socioeconomic status of the population (<a href="#ref-2">Adenomon, 2014</a>). This fluctuating incidence recorded yearly could also be attached to the people not being careful about the illness or inconsistencies by the health care authorities in the management of the illness. The decreasing trend in 2017 could be due to an increase in the use of mosquito nets, general improvement in the malaria awareness by the population of Kisumu owed to the intensive campaigns in malaria education by several organizations. Climatic changes could have also attributed to this(<a href="#ref-4">Anokye <i>et al.</i>, 2018</a>).</p><p class="" id=d29353e1825>The overall pattern of the reported malaria cases as reported by this study had seasonal variations. Weekly cases towards midyear recorded the highest number of cases, whereas the first weeks of the year recorded the lowest number of cases. This could be as a result of heavy rainfall experienced in the months of April, May, June and July, which is usually the rainfall season in Kisumu, and the temperature associated with rainfall seasons.</p><p class="" id=d29353e1828>This confirms the findings of <a href="#ref-8">Craig <i>et al</i>. (1999)</a> and <a href="#ref-36">Zhou <i>et al</i>. (2004)</a> who revealed that that climate is a major factor in explaining the incidence of malaria. According to <a href="#ref-36">Zhou <i>et al.</i> (2004)</a>, the incidence of malaria is influenced by rainfall since mosquitoes need stagnant water for a complete life cycle. At the same time, <a href="#ref-22">Mabaso <i>et al</i>. (2007)</a> also discovered that rainfall seasonality as well as minimum temperature are related to the number of <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i>-infective bites got by an individual annually or during a season.</p><p class="" id=d29353e1859>The best fitted time series model developed for predicting the number of weekly reported cases of malaria was ARIMA (2, 0, 1). This suggests that ARIMA (2, 0, 1) can be utilized as a forecasting model to predict the future values of a series. ARIMA works best when data exhibits a constant pattern over time with a minimum amount of outliers (<a href="#ref-20">Labys, 2006</a>). Researchers can use this model to forecast malaria reported cases (<a href="#ref-22">Mabaso <i>et al.,</i> 2001</a>). Nonetheless, it should be updated from time to time with the incorporation of current data.</p></div><div class=section><a name=d29353e1872 class=n-a></a><h3 class=section-title>Significance of predictor variables on malaria incidences</h3><p class="" id=d29353e1877>Accordingly, the study investigated the association between time in years, locality and total number of patients tested for malaria in Kisumu using weekly malaria data from 2014 to 2017.</p><p class="" id=d29353e1880>The study results revealed that residing in Kisumu East, Seme, Nyando and Kisumu Central sub-counties were statistically associated to the incidence of malaria as compared to residing in Kisumu West sub-county. Residing in Muhoroni and Nyakach sub-counties were not statistically associated with the incidence of malaria as compared to residing in Kisumu West sub-county. The different localities have demonstrated inequalities in malaria incidence mainly due to variations in access to health services, urbanization and wealth distribution. This is similar to findings by <a href="#ref-9">Galactionova <i>et al</i>. (2017)</a>, who identified regional inequalities in the coverage of malaria interventions because of the inequality of the wealth distribution within and across many countries.</p><p class="" id=d29353e1889>Many studies have also established that there is less access to services in the rural areas compared to the urban areas, leading to less reported malaria cases from the rural sub-counties. This makes this variable a useful determinant of malaria incidence since some localities are more urban than rural and vice versa.</p><p class="" id=d29353e1892>Generally, there was fluctuation in malaria incidences during the last four years. The year 2017 was statistically associated to the incidence of malaria as compared to the year 2014. Whereas 2015 and 2016 were not statistically associated with the incidence of malaria as compared to the year 2014. Several factors may be responsible for seasonal changes, for example climatic changes, ecologic and environmental factors, social and economic determinants such as change in health care infrastructure. Availability of health facilities and drug resistance also have an impact on incidence of malaria. Although there were different malaria control activities in each year, such as activities to decrease incidence of malaria, insecticide indoor spraying, distribution of ITNs, massive malaria control campaigns and distribution of ITNs the prevalence is still constant. This is similar to findings by <a href="#ref-3">Alemu <i>et al</i>. (2012)</a>.</p><p class="" id=d29353e1902>There was a significant association between the total number of patients tested for malaria and the incidence of malaria. Though urban areas have normally been at lower risk of malaria, unpredictable and unplanned population growth has been a key factor in making urban or peri-urban transmission an increasing problem .This could explain the high malaria incidence in 2016.This finding is consistent to a study carried out by (<a href="#ref-19">Knudsen &amp; Slooff, 1992</a>).</p></div></div><div id=article1-body class=generated-article-body><h2 class=main-title id=d29353e1912>Conclusions</h2><div class=section><a name=d29353e1915 class=n-a></a><h3 class=section-title>Trends analysis</h3><p class="" id=d29353e1920>The objective of this research was to determine the factors associated with the incidence of malaria in Kisumu County over time, given the locality where the patients sought health facility intervention, time in years and the total number of patients who were tested for malaria. The study utilized weekly malaria reported cases data from IDSR Disease Surveillance registry, for the period January 2014 to December 2017 in Kisumu County. Reported malaria cases confirmed by laboratory test was used in the analysis and modeling.</p><p class="" id=d29353e1923>A seasonal pattern was observed in the malaria incidences in Kisumu County. ARIMA (2, 0, 1) model was found to be the best fit statistical model to predict malaria incidences in Kisumu County. The results found from this study offer useful information for policy makers to be able to effectively implement timely and effective malaria preventive and control measures.</p></div><div class=section><a name=d29353e1927 class=n-a></a><h3 class=section-title>Significance of predictor variables on malaria incidences</h3><p class="" id=d29353e1932>Goodness of fit model assessment criteria were used in selecting which model will fit the malaria reported cases better by exhausting both Poisson and negative binomial regression models. The negative binomial regression model was found to fit the data better than the Poisson regression model, based on the results. In modeling the incidence of malaria, the quality of the Poisson model was estimated using the AIC. The AIC value produced was 29,318, the deviance was 26,219 and a dispersion parameter of 70.29 showing an over-dispersion in the data leading to a violation of one of its main assumption of the equality of mean and variance parameters. It became a necessary to validate the Poisson regression models using negative binomial because of over-dispersion.</p><p class="" id=d29353e1935>The results obtained suggested that Kisumu East, Seme, Nyando, Kisumu Central localities, the year 2017 and the total number of patients who underwent a laboratory confirmation test for malaria were significant factors for incidence of malaria in Kisumu County over time. Whereas, Nyakach, Muhoroni localities, the years 2015 and 2016 were not significant factors for malaria incidences. The findings provide better insight of environmental and socio-economic effects on malaria and provide important information for malaria prediction. Nonetheless, there is need for additional studies to consider which other factors influence the incidence of malaria notwithstanding environmental and socio-economic factors. Likewise, health professionals practicing in Kisumu County should be encouraged to regularly review and report cases of malaria in their facilities. This is because, reporting rates, completeness and the consistency of malaria reported cases remain extremely low and importantly was poorer in localities where malaria is endemic.</p></div></div><div id=article1-body class=generated-article-body><h2 class=main-title id=d29353e1943>Data availability</h2><div class=section><a name=d29353e1946 class=n-a></a><h3 class=section-title>Source data</h3><p class="" id=d29353e1951>The data can be obtained from the Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response (IDSR) registry through the DHIS2 platform, using the standard application programming interface provided <a target=xrefwindow href="https://hiskenya.org/dhis-web-commons/security/login.action" id=d29353e1953>https://hiskenya.org/dhis-web-commons/security/login.action</a>.
