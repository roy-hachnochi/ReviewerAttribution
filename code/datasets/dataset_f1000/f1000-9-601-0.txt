The authors present a web tool for exploratory analysis of iHMP data, based on their existing metaviz software. The figures from the manuscript were easy to reproduce using the links and code provided. It seems like a useful new way to view, explore, and download iHMP data. I have only a couple minor comments: The figures are low-resolution and text is a bit blurry. The lightest yellow text in Figure 2 isn't readable. From http://metaviz.cbcb.umd.edu/ it's not immediately obvious how to find the iHMP (HMP2) data. IBD and T2D do appear a ways down a list of available datasets, but this list takes a very long time to load for me ("loading datasets and sample annotations..."). I didn't find MOMS-PI but I may not have waited long enough. It would be worth providing direct links in the manuscript to workspaces for each dataset, like is already done for Figure 3. Perhaps explain the feature variables like c__Betaproteobacteria, o__Burkholderiales, f__Ruminococcaceae, g__Lachnospira, g__[Ruminococcus], g__Faecalibacterium, s__:589277, s__:333166, s__:564806, s__:369227, s__:358104, s__:369486, s__gnavus:360015, s__prausnitzii:851865 for readers who are familiar with scientific taxonomy names but not this format.
