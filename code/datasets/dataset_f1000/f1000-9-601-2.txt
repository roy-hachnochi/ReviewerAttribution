Manuscript “Interactive exploratory data analysis of Integrative Human Microbiome Project data using Metaviz” by Wagner et al. provides a novel interactive tool for visualization of interactive Human Microbiome Project (iHMP) Data. This tool encompasses both the HMP Data coordination center (DAC) portal as well as the Bioconductor HMP2Data package. Given the size and complexity of HMP data, this visualization tool allows users to explore major data summaries and patterns. As such, this work is very timely and is highly recommended for publication. Major comments: How does the tool handle HMP DAC and HMP2Data package data updates? There is discussion that user can upload additional data manifest from HMP DAC portal, but what if the data already available thought Metaviz tool is updated on the DAC or Bioconductor? Is there an option to download data summaries? Such as demographics table, number of samples by body site, etc. MOMS-PI and T2D studies have protected meta data available through dbGap. If users apply for dbGap and get access, id there an option to merge meta data by sample ids and visualize using this tool? It would be helpful to provide instructions how to create diversity boxplots by disease status (as in Figure 3). I tried creating these but could not produce them on the same plot. I recommend making alpha diversity plots by disease status a default plot when the data is selected using visualization tool.
