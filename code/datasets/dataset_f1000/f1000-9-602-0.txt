The manuscript reports a novel approach to deal with dynamics and heterogeneity in biological systems. This new approach is called “Poikilosis” and it is defined by the author as “inherent pervasive variation, heterogeneity and fluctuation in living organisms, populations, ecosystems, biosphere and in their components and in processes within them”. Major comment: Throughout the manuscript “molecules” and “matter” are considered to be different entities. The same is about “atoms” and “matter”. However, “atoms” and “molecules” are the building block of the matter. Minor comments: Figure 1 is not informative. Perhaps it can be reconsidered and the effect of disease/curative treatment shown in some cartoonish presentation. Another note, the reproduction (presumably an offspring) is shown with smaller tori, which can be wrongly interpret as lower complexity than in the parent. p. 2: “Every system and process can be thought to represent its own level.” What level? P.3. The paragraph starting with “Information, energy and matter flow…”. Epigenetic information, and information in signalling pathways, regulatory networks, immune system are encoded in DNA. Why they are considered to be independent source of information?
