I read this article and below are my comments for the journal: Based on documentations included in the article some points should be reconsidered by the authors. Diagnosis of ameloblastic fibrodentinoma does not seem to be correct, dentinoid material is not evident. Possibly from the beginning the lesion is an ameloblastic fibrosarcoma, therefore the microscopical aspects should be carefully reviewed including a Ki-67 staining. Diagnosis of carcinosarcoma should be reconsidered and most immune reactions repeated and reanalysed, including Ki-67. Interpretation of some reactions does not seem to be appropriate.
