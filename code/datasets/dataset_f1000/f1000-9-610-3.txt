This is a very nice case review on alterations in homeostatic mechanism in HIV. I tend to agree that there are inflammatory changes in HIV patients that deranges the the coagulation equilbrium and there are limitations in available literature on what exactly drives the prothrombotic features in such patients. Having said that in this case, the patient seems to have dilated cardiomyopathy which largely seems to have driven the thrombosis and the case has been very well elaborated with description, pictures, and lab assay. However, the low protein C, S, and Antithrombin evidenced here rather depicts the state of thrombus consuming the factors. It would have been nice if they had follow up lab assay follow on these protein C, S, and Antithrombin and if the numbers continue to remain low after 3-6 months from the time of thrombosis then one could make a strong argument that the coagulation factor deficiencies could have accentuanted the thrombosis but it is unclear at this time based on the available labs. The authors should be commended for ensuring the APAS etiology has been ruled out which would be an important etiology in HIV patients. However, I do suggest trimming the case report content especially in the first paragraph where there is redundancy in non-pertinent information. Overall, I feel this contributes some knowledge to existing data of HIV and hypercoagulability.
