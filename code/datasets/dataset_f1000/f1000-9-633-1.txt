It is a review with a well-structured meta-analysis, following Cochrane principles. Compared to other previous meta-analyzes, the present review differs in that it performed the analysis in the elderly population. Although it has been noticed that this manuscript has already been revised, I still see some small issues that can be improved, especially to ensure the replicability of the methodology. This and other questions are presented below. Introduction: Second paragraph: I suggest the authors to present the biological rationale of hypovitaminosis D with arterial hypertension (before presenting the results of some meta-analyzes). Methods: The authors presented the PubMed search strategy only. I suggest presenting the other strategies, so that the methodology is replicable. One of the exclusion criteria was: "assessment of the full text of the study not possible". This actually happened? I suggest that the authors identify these studies and present the difficulties to access this study (s). Important for the replication of the methodology. Discussion: I missed the clinical implications of this study. Do data provide evidence for the use of vitamin D for hypertensive elderly people? Although significant, does the observed reduction in blood pressure really have clinical relevance compared to other interventions?
