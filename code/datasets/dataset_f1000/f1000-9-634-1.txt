Thank you the authors for thoughtful responses. The revised article which states 30% or more pain relief as "clinical significant "makes the results more appropriate. Additionally, the authors have added two fluoroscopic imagings which help to determine the deposition of injectate. I appreciate the version 2 of this manuscript, making it more comprehensive and useful.
