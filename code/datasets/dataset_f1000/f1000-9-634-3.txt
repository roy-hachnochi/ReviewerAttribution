 General Comments: This study is very relevant to today's practice and important for patients' wellbeing and continuous healthcare for low back pain with radiculopathy. Overall coverages and discussion are appropriate. The main limitation for this study is the imaging that showing the flow of contrast which determine of the deposition of steroid as well as the outcome. Introduction: Adequate and covering the area of research. Methodology: The selection of participants are adequate. I am totally agreed with the selection of a common cause of low back pain in this study. Results: The table and the analysis of the result are adequate. Discussion: The coverage of the discussion and suggestion are adequate. However, my concern with the selection of participants who is inexperienced without comparing the senior student may affect this study's strength. References: Adequate Others: This is a good and practical study and should be encouraged to do it multicenter. This is a very interesting study and can give us options if we may encounter partial or temporary relief with one approach. The limitation of this study is that we can confirm that limited outcome is it due to mechanical that reduces the flow of injected since no contrast was viewed prior to injection.
