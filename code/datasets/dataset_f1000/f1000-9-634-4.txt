 The primary outcome of this study was an effective response to treatment, predefined by at least a reduced verbal numerical rating scale from baseline. If the cut-off point for the percentage of pain intensity difference was 33%, the primary outcomes may be changed. A 33% pain intensity difference is a standard of the clinically important difference in pain outcome measures. 1 Figure 2 and figure 3 were alternated figure legends.
