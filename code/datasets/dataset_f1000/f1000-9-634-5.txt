The authors conducted an interesting randomized study comparing transforaminal epidural steroid injection (TFESI) to TFESI combined with caudal ESI. The methodology and flow of the study were organized. The analysis was properly done and results were clear. However, figures 2 and 3 are wrongly placed. The legends of figures state they are average verbal numerical rating scale (VNRS) and average Oswestry Low Back Pain Disability Index (ODI) respectively, while the Y-axes show ODI and VNRS, respectively. The discussion is well written. Nevertheless, I think it would be fair if the two groups received the same total dosage of steroid, although many studies did show that two different doses of steroids did not make any differences. Another limitation of such a study, is that the patients were not blinded from their study groups would be a higher placebo effect in the group that received combined injections. Additionally, it would be beneficial if the author had studied comparing cost-effectiveness between these two study groups.
