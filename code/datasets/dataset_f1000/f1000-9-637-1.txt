The Authors presented a case report on the use of benralizumab administration during an acute attack of severe refractory eosinophilic asthma, without the concomitant use of systemic steroids. Benralizumab is an anti-receptor monoclonal anti-IL-5 antibody, which has been shown to be particularly effective in reducing exacerbations, used as regular therapy in severe eosinophilic asthma. Some questions: How was the patient's adherence to inhalation therapy? Did the patient have a previous accurate diagnosis of severe asthma? Was the patient then regularly treated with benralizumab? Were eosinophils measured in the following weeks?
