This is a case report of a patient who received a dose of benralizumab for acute asthma. The patient had been on omalizumab as an add on therapy with ICS, LABA, LAMA, montelukast and theophylline. She refused per oral glucocorticoids. She had moderate to severe obstruction in spirometry and bronchodilator response. She received a dose of benralizumab when having an asthma exacerbation. Two days later her asthma symptoms had decreased and lung function increased. What was adherence of the patient with her asthma medication (ICS, LABA, LAMA, montelukast and theophylline)? Did the patient smoke regularly or had she ever smoked regularly? Did the patient have pets at home? How many exacerbations or severe exacerbations the patient had had a year before she started omalizumab? How many exacerbations or severe exacerbations the patient had had a year before she started benralizumab? In previous studies, benralizumab has been shown to reduce number of eosinophils in 24 hours and to increase FEV1 in 4 weeks. In this case report, benralizumab seemed to increase FEV1 in two days? Could you discuss the unexpected rapid changes? Did the patient receive some other asthma drugs or were the other asthma drugs changed on the same visit when benralizumab was started? Please consider these two reports on use of biologicals in acute asthma: Renner A, Marth K, Schffl-Doweik L, Pohl W.
