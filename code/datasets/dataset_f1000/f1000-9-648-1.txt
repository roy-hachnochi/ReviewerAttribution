This brief report outlines a description of the sequence and structure of ice-binding protein in Leymus mollis from the Beaufort Coast in Arctic Alaska, and compares the findings to IBPs of other more temperate grass species. The paper seems pretty straightforward, however, I do not have the expertise to comment on the amino acid sequence, protein modeling, and comparative approach to other species. The paper was well-written, the figures were informative, and I believe it warrants indexing. While this is a brief note, I do think that additional interpretation of results and providing some brief explanations related to mechanisms of freeze tolerance in light of their findings would make the manuscript substantially more valuable. I was not able to gauge if the similarities and differences between Leymus and Lolium/Festuca are likely to have physiological/ecological bearing on their respective environmental contexts. (As an aside, since Leymus grows all down the Pacific Coast to San Diego it would be interesting to know if the IBP structure or concentrations/ability to upregulate are different along that substantial environmental gradient.). I provide additional comments and edits embedded as notes in a PDF - please see the file here . I appreciate the opportunity to read this paper and I sincerely hope that my comments are useful in generating a more robust paper.
