I think 4-ASRAT will be a useful and powerful tool for assessing whether acne scars occur in patients with acne lesions. As we all know, the treatment of these scars is still full of challenges. Therefore, if there is a simple and easy way to assess the risk of scar formation in acne patients and take early prevention measures, it may help to reduce the incidence of acne scars. The current 4-ASRAT questionnaire is relatively suitable for rapid assessment of acne scar formation risk in a short period of time. Although it has good predictive sensitivity and specificity, I think the questionnaire still needs to add more specific indicators. It is better to be able to evaluate under the guidance of dermatologists. If the assessment items can include risk tools to predict the formation of acne atrophic scar, hypertrophic scar and keloid respectively, it will help doctors to deal with the corresponding problems. In addition, because in this study, according to the patient's facial lesions photos, in some cases, both dermatology experts and local dermatologists did not reach a high degree of consistency, which indicates that the definition of acne scar is still vague. Although it is very difficult to reach 100% consensus, it is important to make a more appropriate definition of acne scar before the assessment and to train the assessors for a certain period of time.
