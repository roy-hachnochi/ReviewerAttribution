Regarding the 4 ASRAT tool, I believe it can be good for screening the risk of developing scars, as tools with good sensitivity and moderate specificity are. It could be helpful as early intervention to prevent the detriment of their self esteem and mental health. The extended questionnaire, if applied to patients who already have acne, it could be helpful to intervene as soon as possible, under the premise that they are prone to develop acne scars or if they already have a few, so they do not develop any more scarring. This tool could translate into better adherence to treatment and less scarring, as well as knowing they are prone to develop them, for their future offspring. Regarding patients who already have acne scars, I think this tool will only show that if left untreated they will develop more scars. I believe the 4 ASRAT tool could incorporate questions from the extended questionnaire, but those specifically regarding risk factors for developing inflammatory acne, and the questionnaire should be applied by either a physician or a healthcare personnel, in order to standardize and reassure the questions are adequately interpreted by the patient. This could perhaps be done at the primary care physician office, with a referral to dermatology if the patient has a high risk of developing scars. Also, the full questionnaire would take around 20 minutes, so perhaps the most relevant questions should be kept to make it a 5-7 minute questionnaire or if most questions should remain the questionnaire should be made by trained personnel to make it objective and quicker.
