            <meta name="dc.description" content=" Background: Central venous catheters (CVC&rsquo;s) are useful tools for the treatment of critically ill patients, especially in the emergency room, and are recognized for decreasing rates of failure and mechanical complications. Certain parameters can act as predictors to determine the likelihood of this type of complication. The aim of this study is to determine the incidence and predictors of mechanical complications using internal jugular venous (IJV) cannulation, especially when considering planned versus emergency cannulation. 
 Methods: A prospective, observational study was performed at Hospital de los Valles, Quito, Ecuador, during a three-year period. All patients who presented to the emergency room with an indication for IJV cannulation and with no potential contraindications were included. Demographic, safety and procedure related data were collected. Variables were analyzed using STATA, and p-values &amp;lt;0.05 were considered significant. 
 Results: A total of 142 patients were included. The majority of procedures (64%) were planned. The main indication for CVC placement via IJV cannulation was chronic renal failure (54%), all of which were planned procedures, followed by sepsis (15%), where most procedures (91%) were emergencies. The IJV was anatomically located lateral to the carotid artery in 38.73% of cases. Mechanical/technical complications were reported in 13 patients. Cannulation time greater than two minutes was found to be the only factor independently associated with a higher probability (12.4 times) of developing mechanical/technical complications. The vessel location did not affect the incidence of complications either in emergency or planned procedures when using ultrasound. 
 Conclusion s: Ultrasound-guided IJV cannulation is a safe technique&amp;nbsp;that can be performed as an emergency or planned procedure without increased complication rates in the emergency room. Additionally, a puncture time of less than two minutes is associated with the safest profile in this patient population.">

  "description": "Background: Central venous catheters (CVC&rsquo;s) are useful tools for the treatment of critically ill patients, especially in the emergency room, and are recognized for decreasing rates of failure and mechanical complications. Certain parameters can act as predictors to determine the likelihood of this type of complication. The aim of this study is to determine the incidence and predictors of mechanical complications using internal jugular venous (IJV) cannulation, especially when considering planned versus emergency cannulation.
Methods: A prospective, observational study was performed at Hospital de los Valles, Quito, Ecuador, during a three-year period. All patients who presented to the emergency room with an indication for IJV cannulation and with no potential contraindications were included. Demographic, safety and procedure related data were collected. Variables were analyzed using STATA, and p-values &amp;lt;0.05 were considered significant.
Results: A total of 142 patients were included. The majority of procedures (64%) were planned. The main indication for CVC placement via IJV cannulation was chronic renal failure (54%), all of which were planned procedures, followed by sepsis (15%), where most procedures (91%) were emergencies. The IJV was anatomically located lateral to the carotid artery in 38.73% of cases. Mechanical/technical complications were reported in 13 patients. Cannulation time greater than two minutes was found to be the only factor independently associated with a higher probability (12.4 times) of developing mechanical/technical complications. The vessel location did not affect the incidence of complications either in emergency or planned procedures when using ultrasound.
Conclusions: Ultrasound-guided IJV cannulation is a safe technique that can be performed as an emergency or planned procedure without increased complication rates in the emergency room. Additionally, a puncture time of less than two minutes is associated with the safest profile in this patient population."

Certain parameters can act as predictors to determine the likelihood of this type of complication. The aim of this study is to determine the incidence and predictors of mechanical complications using internal jugular venous (IJV) cannulation, especially when considering planned versus emergency cannulation.<br/> <b>Methods:</b> A prospective, observational study was performed at Hospital de los Valles, Quito, Ecuador, during a three-year period. All patients who presented to the emergency room with an indication for IJV cannulation and with no potential contraindications were included. Demographic, safety and procedure related data were collected. Variables were analyzed using STATA, and p-values &lt;0.05 were considered significant.<br/> <b>Results:</b> A total of 142 patients were included. The majority of procedures (64%) were planned. The main indication for CVC placement via IJV cannulation was chronic renal failure (54%), all of which were planned procedures, followed by sepsis (15%), where most procedures (91%) were emergencies. The IJV was anatomically located lateral to the carotid artery in 38.73% of cases. Mechanical/technical complications were reported in 13 patients. Cannulation time greater than two minutes was found to be the only factor independently associated with a higher probability (12.4 times) of developing mechanical/technical complications. The vessel location did not affect the incidence of complications either in emergency or planned procedures when using ultrasound.<br/> <b>Conclusion</b>s: Ultrasound-guided IJV cannulation is a safe technique&nbsp;that can be performed as an emergency or planned procedure without increased complication rates in the emergency room. Additionally, a puncture time of less than two minutes is associated with the safest profile in this patient population. </div> <div class=abstract-for-mobile> <div class="margin-top-30 padding-bottom-30 research-layout is-centered"> <button class="primary orange-text white-bg bigger-text abstract-expand-button-mobile with-border show" style="display: none;"> READ ALL <span class="f1r-icon icon-14_more_small orange vmiddle big"></span> </button> <button class="primary orange-text white-bg bigger-text abstract-expand-button-mobile with-border hide"> READ LESS <span class="f1r-icon icon-10_less_small orange vmiddle big"></span> </button> </div> </div> </div> <div class=clearfix></div> <div class="article-context no-divider"> <div class="article-abstract article-page-general-text-mobile research-layout generated-article-body"> <h2 class=main-title>Keywords</h2> <p class="u-mb--0 u-pb--2"> Ultrasound, Central Venous Access, Internal Jugular Vein Cannulation, Mechanical complications, Puncture time </p> </div> </div> <div class=article-information> <span class="info-separation padding-bottom"> <div id=corresponding-author-icon class="email-icon float-left"> <span class="f1r-icon icon-6_email orange"></span> <div id=corresponding-author-window class="margin-top-20 popup-window-wrapper is-hidden"> <div class="popup-window corresponding-authors-popup"> <div class=corresponding-author-container> <div class="popup-window-title small">Corresponding Author(s)</div> <div class=authors> Jorge Estrella Porter (<a href="mailto:jestrellaporter@gmail.com">jestrellaporter@gmail.com</a>) </div> </div> <div class="margin-top margin-bottom float-left"> <button id=close-popup-window class=general-white-orange-button>Close</button> </div> </div> </div> </div> <span class="icon-text float-left" data-test-id=box-corresponding-author> <b>Corresponding author:</b> Jorge Estrella Porter </span> <div class=clearfix></div> </span> <span class="info-separation padding-bottom competing-interests-display"> <span class=competing-interests-title>Competing interests:</span> No competing interests were disclosed. </span> <div class="info-separation padding-bottom grant-information-display"> <span class=grant-information-title>Grant information:</span> The author(s) declared that no grants were involved in supporting this work. </div> <span class="f1r-article-desk info-separation padding-bottom"> <span class="copywrite-icon float-left"> <span class="f1r-icon icon-100_open_access"></span> </span> <span class="icon-text float-left" data-test-id=box-copyright-text> <b>Copyright:</b>&nbsp; © 2020 Maldonado A <em>et al</em>.

They are used for the delivery of vasoactive agents, parenteral nutrition, long-term antibiotics, blood sampling, hemodynamic monitoring, and/or venous access for haemodialysis patients<sup><a href="#ref-2">2</a></sup>. Historically, vein cannulation has been a procedure performed with a blind approach, following only anatomical landmarks for cannulation, thus the incidence of complications has been estimated to be as high as 40%<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a></sup>. Consequently, the use of ultrasound-guided techniques for vein cannulation has helped to reduce the rate of complications<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a></sup>, and its use has been standardized in many emergency rooms around the world<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a></sup>.</p><p class="" id=d12580e231>Ultrasound-guided techniques in the emergency room have long been documented as beneficial. In fact, in 2001, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality Evidence Report recognized bedside-ultrasonography for central venous access as one of the eleven practices with “strength of evidence for supporting more widespread implementation”<sup><a href="#ref-2">2</a></sup>. The American College of Emergency Physicians recommends in its Ultrasound Guidelines Policy Statement (last approved in 2016) that emergency room physicians should be trained and proficient in these techniques<sup><a href="#ref-6">6</a></sup>. However, there is evidence that even with the recommendations to use ultrasound-guided techniques for central venous access, up to 67% of physicians do not routinely use ultrasound to guide the procedure<sup><a href="#ref-7">7</a></sup>.</p><p class="" id=d12580e246>Insertion of ultrasound-guided CVCs with the conventional technique and with experienced personnel has allowed positive results with reduced costs<sup><a href="#ref-8">8</a></sup>; nonetheless, it requires a thorough knowledge of the vascular anatomy and it is operator-dependent<sup><a href="#ref-9">9</a></sup>. The technique is also limited in certain settings, like the emergency room, where elements such as previous vascular access, mechanical/ventilation and tracheostomy cannulas can affect access. Other factors affecting the success of the procedure are the presence of thrombosed veins, hematomas and anatomical variations<sup><a href="#ref-10">10</a></sup>. These factors are associated with increased mechanical complications and failure rates<sup><a href="#ref-11">11</a></sup>. This justifies the use of ultrasound to detect these possible anatomical variations before starting the procedure<sup><a href="#ref-12">12</a></sup>.</p><p class="" id=d12580e269>Ultrasound-guided internal jugular venous (IJV) cannulation, one of the preferred methods for central venous access, is recognized for decreasing rates of failure and mechanical complications<sup><a href="#ref-13">13</a></sup>. Main disadvantages of ultrasound-guided IJV cannulation access include the limited availability of the technology in low resource countries, a longer procedural time when the Doppler mode is used, and limited training from medical personnel regarding the ultrasound technique<sup><a href="#ref-14">14</a></sup>.</p><p class="" id=d12580e281>The aim of this study is to determine the incidence of complications from ultrasound-guided jugular vein cannulation and compare the adverse outcomes in emergency versus planned cannulation, as well as to determine the factors that are associated with complications.</p></div><div id=article1-body class=generated-article-body><h2 class=main-title id=d12580e287>Methods</h2><div class=section><a name=d12580e290 class=n-a></a><h3 class=section-title>Ethical statement</h3><p class="" id=d12580e295>Patients’ written informed consent was obtained for the standard clinical procedure; patients were also notified through this document about the inclusion of their data in this study.

The CVC is placed with a high frequency 5–15 MHz electronic linear array. After this is done, the distance between skin to the centre of the vessel is measured using a measuring tape and it is corrected for the angulation factor that is going to be used. We mark the skin at the point of insertion. Using the Seldinger technique under sterile conditions and local anaesthesia (lidocaine 1% without epinephrine), the procedure starts with needle puncture (18–20 gauge) and visual guidance of the tip, direction and depth while advancing with continuous ultrasound monitoring. Venous blood is obtained, and the wire is introduced with visual confirmation of an intraluminal location. The dilator is positioned and the catheter is introduced. Finally, and to verify the position of the tip of the catheter, we use the saline flush test using the ultrasound subxiphoid window, to determine if the catheter is too close to the right atrium<sup><a href="#ref-15">15</a></sup>.</p></div><div class=section><a name=d12580e386 class=n-a></a><h3 class=section-title>Indications used for emergency versus planned CVC via internal jugular vein placement</h3><p class="" id=d12580e391>Emergency CVC via IJV placement was considered in any patient that fulfilled at least one the following criteria:</p><div class=list><a name=d12580e394 class=n-a></a><ul style="list-style-type: none"><li><p id=d12580e401><span class=label>1. </span> Acute disease, with potential risk of death.</p></li><li><p id=d12580e410><span class=label>2. </span> Hemodynamic instability.</p></li><li><p id=d12580e419><span class=label>3. </span> Need for use of vasoactive drugs.</p></li><li><p id=d12580e428><span class=label>4. </span> Acute decompensation from a chronic illness that puts life at risk.</p></li><li><p id=d12580e437><span class=label>5. </span> Indication for emergent haemodialysis.</p></li></ul></div><p class="" id=d12580e442>Planned CVC via IJV placement was considered in any of the following cases:</p><div class=list><a name=d12580e445 class=n-a></a><ul style="list-style-type: none"><li><p id=d12580e452><span class=label>1. </span> Stable patients with diseases that require a planned procedure for:</p><div class=list><a name=d12580e455 class=n-a></a><ul style="list-style-type: none"><li><p id=d12580e462><span class=label>a. </span> Parenteral nutrition.</p></li><li><p id=d12580e471><span class=label>b. </span> Haemodialysis.</p></li><li><p id=d12580e480><span class=label>c. </span> Monitoring fluid administration.</p></li></ul></div></li><li><p id=d12580e491><span class=label>2. </span> Chemotherapy.</p></li><li><p id=d12580e500><span class=label>3. </span> Inability to place a peripheral line.</p></li></ul></div><p class="" id=d12580e506>The evaluation of which patients fulfilled emergency vs planned CVC criteria was done by the emergency physicians in charge of placing the IJV central line, with help from doctors from different specialties who were also evaluating each patient for baseline medical conditions.</p></div><div class=section><a name=d12580e510 class=n-a></a><h3 class=section-title>Definition of complications</h3><p class="" id=d12580e515>CVC complications are usually divided into two types: mechanical-technical and infectious.

To investigate risk factors associated with complications, a univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed in those with all the data available (N=133), and the odds ratios (ORs) with confidence intervals (CIs) and p-values were calculated. Those variables that were significant in the univariate analysis were included in the multivariate analysis. Patients who developed mechanical and technical complications were compared with those who did not present complications. STATA version 13 software was used for analysis and p-values &lt;0.05 were considered statistically significant.</p></div></div><div id=article1-body class=generated-article-body><h2 class=main-title id=d12580e548>Results</h2><div class=section><a name=d12580e551 class=n-a></a><h3 class=section-title>General characteristics of study sample</h3><p class="" id=d12580e556>There was a total of 142 patients included in the study, among whom 55% were male and the mean age was 59 years<sup><a href="#ref-18">18</a></sup>. Emergency procedures were performed in 36% of the cases. The main indication for CVC placement via IJV cannulation was chronic renal failure (54%), all of which were planned procedures, followed by sepsis (15%), where most procedures (91%) were done as emergencies. Approximately one third of the studied sample (35.2%) had an anatomical orientation of the internal jugular vein above the carotid artery. The median puncture time was two minutes. In most of the patients (66.2%), the time from needle puncture to the vein cannulation was less than two minutes (<a href="#T1">Table 1</a>).</p><a name=T1 class=n-a></a><div class="table-wrap panel clearfix"><div class=caption><h3>Table 1.

for central venous catheterization when using the landmark technique versus the ultrasound-guided technique have been clearly established in the literature, favoring the ultrasound-guided procedure<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a></sup>; nevertheless, there is no clear comparative analysis in the literature about complications during ultrasound-guided procedures in emergency versus planned situations and this is what this study tries to determine.</p><p class="" id=d12580e2294>When the puncture time exceeded two minutes, the chance of having a mechanical complication was 12.4 times higher compared to a puncture time of less than two minutes. All other variables such as the type of procedure (emergency versus planned) and vessel location did not show any statistical differences. This finding is important for clinical practice because it advices the operator that once the two minutes puncture time interval has been surpassed, the risk of complications has increased considerably, allowing them to be primed to look for and manage the possible associated mechanical complications. Additionally, it was demonstrated that clinicians can confidently perform a CVC insertion with ultrasound, either in emergency or planned situations, since there is no significant difference in the development of complications.</p><p class="" id=d12580e2297>The rate of mechanical complications with ultrasound-guided central venous catheterization varies widely among literature. For example, a recent study published by Björkander <i>et al.</i> evaluated a total of 10,949 CVC insertions and found a mechanical complication rate of 1.1%<sup><a href="#ref-16">16</a></sup>. On the other hand, the study published by Eisen <i>et al.</i>, showed a mechanical complication rate of 14% during ultrasound-guided central venous catheterization<sup><a href="#ref-19">19</a></sup>. Bleedings, pneumothorax, transient nerve injuries, and self-limiting arrhythmias are described as the most common mechanical complications<sup><a href="#ref-16">16</a></sup>. The reason for a low rate of mechanical complications in our study (4%) is thought to be related to the level of confidence and expertise of the doctors performing the procedure while using ultrasound. Other complications such as pneumothorax, hematomas and incorrect positioning reported by our study are comparable to those of others<sup><a href="#ref-20">20</a></sup>.</p><p class="" id=d12580e2323>Risk factors associated with mechanical complications have been described by literature: the need for help<sup><a href="#ref-19">19</a></sup>, more than two failed punctures<sup><a href="#ref-19">19</a></sup>, expertise of the operator<sup><a href="#ref-21">21</a></sup>, history of previous catheterizations<sup><a href="#ref-22">22</a></sup>, preprocedural coagulopathy and route of catheterization<sup><a href="#ref-16">16</a></sup>. In our study, the most significant variable associated with complications was the time puncture. The need for help was not identified as a variable, and the rate of failed punctures was minimal.</p><p class="" id=d12580e2347>The results of this study might be affected by the small number of patients chosen. However, the analysis provided was able to detect statistically significant differences between groups by complications. More patients should be recruited in future studies to confirm these findings and to guide future protocols focusing on puncture time as a predictor for mechanical complications during emergency or planned ultrasound-guided IJV cannulation.</p></div><div id=article1-body class=generated-article-body><h2 class=main-title id=d12580e2353>Conclusions</h2><p class="" id=d12580e2356>Training in vascular access with ultrasound guidance has an enormous impact in patient safety and in the reduction of complications related to CVC. Some relevant findings were determined during the present study regarding the ultrasound-guided technique for IJV placement of a catheter. First, it was confirmed that ultrasound-guided jugular vein access is a safe strategy to perform in the emergency room. Second, it was demonstrated that the type of situation, emergency versus planned, has no influence on the outcome and complications related to the IJV access of the patient. Third, it was shown that puncture time (time from the skin puncture to the vessel cannulation) was the most predictive variable for the development of complications. The only and most important factor to predict procedural success, in this study, was a time of less than two minutes from skin puncture to IJV cannulation. A greater sample size might be necessary to confirm these findings.</p></div><div id=article1-body class=generated-article-body><h2 class=main-title id=d12580e2363>Data availability</h2><div class=section><a name=d12580e2366 class=n-a></a><h3 class=section-title>Underlying data</h3><p class="" id=d12580e2371>Harvard Dataverse: Comparative analysis of mechanical complications of emergent versus planned ultrasound-guided internal jugular venous cannulation (IJV): data from the Emergency Room of a third-level hospital in Quito-Ecuador - RAW DATA SET ENGLISH VERSION. <a target=xrefwindow href="https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/YAZQVA" id=d12580e2373>https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/YAZQVA</a><sup><a href="#ref-18">18</a></sup></p><p class="" id=d12580e2379>Data are available under the terms of the <a target=xrefwindow href="https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/" id=d12580e2381>Creative Commons Zero "No rights reserved" data waiver</a> (CC0 1.0 Public domain dedication).</p></div></div><div id=article1-back class=generated-article-footer><div class=back-section><a name=d12580e2390 class=n-a></a><span class="research-layout prime-recommended-wrapper reference-heading is-hidden"><span class="f1r-icon icon-79_faculty_recommended_badge red vmiddle default-cursor"></span><span class="prime-red big">F1000 recommended</span></span><h2 class=main-title id=d12778>References</h2><div class="section ref-list"><a name=d12580e2390 class=n-a></a><ul><li><a name=ref-1 class=n-a></a><span class=label>1. </span>&nbsp;<span class=citation><a name=d12580e2397 class=n-a></a>Bose N, Patel H, Kamat H: Evaluation of ultrasound for central venous access in ICU by an in experienced trainee. <i>Indian J Crit Care Med.</i> 2014;
