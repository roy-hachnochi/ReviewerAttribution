This paper gave a report on a novel bacterium that share morphological and many biochemical traits with Acidovorax sp. I find the paper interesting and worthy of publishing. The isolation of this bacteria was highly interesting as the work in this article stemmed from a side research project of young investigators. There were four undergraduates and, one high school student. The bacterium being reported is a promising candidate for further investigation for its use in bioremediation. The bacterium produces pyomelanin. This finding opens another avenue for investigation - - to probe pyomelanin’s role in oxidative stress protection in LMJ. Sufficient and scientifically sound methods have been done in order to characterize this novel bacterial strain. Results presented were adequate to give detailed characterization of the novel isolate. In addition, I appreciate that the authors provided sufficient and clear details of methods and analysis to allow replication by others. This paper reported an interesting finding that has a potential for useful application in the future. I hope that the authors can continue to further characterize this novel strain, LMJ. I just have few and minor comments: The optical density of 0.08–13 which matches the 0.5 McFarland standard seem to be a very wide range and 13 is too high. I think this is a typographical error. Is there a need to present the data from each replication? Consider presenting just the means and SDs and mentioned in the methods and/or underneath the table the number of replications done.
