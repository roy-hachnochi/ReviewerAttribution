First, I would like to commend the authors for the good work. I find the work very interesting and comprehensive in several aspects. Second, I find every pursuit of identifying candidates that could be used in bioremediation of great importance. Third, I commend the authors for exploring to the dot a variety of methods in this work. I hope that the authors can sequence the bacterial strain and continue to pursue this work to further understand its role in bioremediation.
