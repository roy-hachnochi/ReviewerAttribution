The authors present a well-observed, useful and much needed case and comment on an important renal complication of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a co-morbid patient. My main concern is that the possibility of this being a primary metabolic alkalosis (with secondary hypokalaemia) has not been adequately refuted. The blood gas data show a metabolic alkalosis with respiratory compensation, and simultaneously a relatively modest hypokalaemia for this degree of alkalosis. Contraction alkalosis (due to pyrexia causing volume depletion/hypotension) or hypercapnoeic metabolic alkalosis (hypoxic on admission with COPD) might be explanations for this 1 . Results for chloride and CK, if available, may be helpful. I agree that the results do not support aldosterone-mediated hypokalaemia. In fig 1, Hartmann's and sando K on day 3 should be mentioned together for clarity. I am not clear about when TTKG was measured. Presumably this was before potassium replacement on day 3 to avoid confounding, but this should be mentioned.
