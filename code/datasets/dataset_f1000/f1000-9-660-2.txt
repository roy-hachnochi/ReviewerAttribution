It is an interesting manuscript that shows that research groups can improve the quality of their experimental work without spending lots of money. It is great that researchers feel the need to improve their own practice, even if that does not immediately lead to more publications or more funding, but because it will improve the reproducibility of their work and contribute to the quality of the whole research field they are working in. Some suggestions for improvement: The level of details in this paper vary a lot, on the one hand it is very detailed (the amount of DNA and volume for the reaction to check cell line stability), but the level of information on the bio bank is very limited. It seems that the authors try to write a ‘case report’ about their own lab and at the same time try to give recommendations for other labs. It might be more valuable to make a clear distinction between those two goals. Maybe write it as a case report and then provide recommendations in the discussion part. Maybe distinguish the recommendations too, material wise recommendations (check cell lines, buy a pipet pump of ~1000 USD), (data ) storages recommendations and attitude recommendations (have regular lab meetings about quality, make sure all lab members use the same digital notebook and SOPs).
