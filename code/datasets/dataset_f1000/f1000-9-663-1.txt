In the present study authors have made an effort to repurpose the known drugs against SARS-CoV-2. Although the study is well organized and presented, a few minor changes are suggested for betterment. The name of the molecules should begin with Uppercase. In an abstract, authors have mentioned about the anti-viral activity of streptomycin, ciprofloxacin, and glycyrrhizic acid. But, it requires the literature support. Authors can cite the references for the anti-viral/ ant-microbial activity in Methods section. In Results and Discussions, authors could claim the better affinity of glycyrrhizic acid towards SARS-CoV-2-S in comparison with other two molecules. Change suggested: Additionally, the ketone group of GA formed a hydrogen bond, with the backbone atoms of Phe499 receiving the electrons and possess the better affinity towards SARS-CoV-2-S when compared to Streptomycin and Ciprofloxicine. In conclusion section, authors have mentioned that, ACE2 is likely to be targeted by viruses like SARS-CoV. Since, authors have tabulated the methods and references for ACE2 and SARS-CoV spike protein interaction in table 1, it is better to rewrite as "ACE2 is known to be targeted by viruses like SARS-CoV".
