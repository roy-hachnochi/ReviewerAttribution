The authors demonstrated a case of chilblain-like lesions in a 48-year old woman. This case report is interesting, however, I have several comments, which can possibly be of relevance. Recently, "A COVID toe" has been described as a manifestation of COVID-19 infection. However, most reports are focused on single patients or demonstrate only a case series. Today, it is a matter of debate, whether indeed this is a specific cutaneous manifestation of COVID-19 infection or whether it may also result from other viral infections. In a recent study by Hubiche et al. (Hubiche T et al. Negative SARS-CoV-2 PCR in patients with chilblain-like lesions [published online ahead of print, 2020 Jun 18]. Lancet Infect Dis . 2020;S1473-3099(20)30518-1 1 ) in only 30% of patients, COVID-19 infection (current or past) could be proofed. It is also important to exclude other causes of chilblains, mainly lupus erythematosus, which is not documented in current report. The authors also propose a new acronym for chilblains-like lesions with an additional word cutaneous (CCLL) to distinguish it from CLL - chronic lymphocytic leukemia. However, I disagree with such a proposal as adding a word "cutaneous" implicates that there are also extracutaneous manifestations of chilblains-like lesions, which is not the case in the current situation. Some minor comments: The authors should avoid to use the term "unique" in the abstract It is unclear, what the authors meant under the term "blister-like lesions"
