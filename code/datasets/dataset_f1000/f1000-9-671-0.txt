Yates et al. vividly discuss utility and inherent limitations of current PCR testing of SARS-CoV-2 in institutions caring for the elderly and vulnerable adults. They begin by summarizing the SARS-CoV-2 epidemiology in this key population. The laboratory testing practical considerations and implications they highlight are very useful for both their specific target audience and the general scientific community to keep vulnerable populations safe. The messages of importance of quick sample-to-answer turnaround time, frequent testing to identify asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic infections, that PCR is not 100% accurate and that testing resources can be conserved by pooled testing are very important in these times. They provide suggestions on optimizing staff testing in care homes to monitor any SARS-CoV-2 infection introduction using available resources sparingly. I have three minor suggestions for the authors to consider. Comment on if PCR cycle threshold (Ct) value is a useful indicator in evaluating the infectiousness of both staff and those under care and how this can be incorporated in making decisions in a care facility and in recognizing potential false positives? Comment on whether sensitivity and specificity differ between PCR assays and how this can impact SARS-CoV-2 results in care homes. Any recommendations here? There are hundreds of commercial PCR assays available for SARS-CoV-2 testing. Some of the available PCR test check for multiple SARS-CoV-2 genes concurrently and include an internal control. Comment on how/whether PCR tests can be used to identify contamination in care homes e.g. environmental swabbing, wastewater/sewage monitoring. Is this a viable strategy to monitor introduction or ongoing shedding/transmission?
