The article is scientifically-well-written. No major issues related to methods or data analysis need to be highlighted. The authors have indicated the problem statement in the introduction on why they conduct the study. However, comments were given to improve the flow and content of the section. The method is well-describe. The analysis performed is matched with the study design as recommended by others. The outcome measure of dental service utilization is following a well-versed definition by other researchers. However, there are some categorisations of independent variables that do not match the results. For example the age and dental status. The author stated that they are using ≤25, 25-50, and ≥50 years old. However, in the results it was mentioned differently (less than 25, 25-50, and ≥50. The age categorisation should not overlap thus I would like to suggest new categorisation 25, 25-50, and 50. Whereas, the dental status was informed in methods was “dentate vs edentulous” but in the results it mentioned, “not edentulous vs edentulous”. Although it seems to give similar meaning but consistency in reporting is essential. The rest including abstract, discussion, and conclusion is well-written. The citation provided is also updated evidence. I also have given some papers for citations to enrich the discussion part. Other related information such as data sources is also stated in the identification of originality of the data. Please see this annotated pdf .
