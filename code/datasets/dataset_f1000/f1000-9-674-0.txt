This study describes novel data on the efficacy of a copper iodine complex for inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 in liquid suspension. The results demonstrate that the undiluted copper iodine complex causes a significant decrease in viral infectivity in a cell-based microtitration assay after 10 minutes, with greater than a 5-log reduction in 30 minutes. The methodologies and conclusions are generally appropriate. However, there are several limitations to the study: The study only investigates the ability of the copper iodine complex to inactivate the virus in a liquid suspension. Thus, while the present study provides useful preliminary data, additional testing with virus deposited as droplets or aerosol particles on relevant surfaces needs to be conducted. As a justification for the use of copper iodine complex, the authors discuss the incompatibility of certain disinfectants for N95 masks, as well as the difficulty of using other decontamination methods while PPE is being worn. However, while the authors cite some evidence that copper iodine complex is safe on skin, the present study does not perform testing to demonstrate the benefit of copper iodine complex in this regard, specifically its compatibility with N95 masks or ability to be used while PPE is being worn. The manuscript would benefit from additional discussion/comparison of the results obtained in the study to those published for other decontamination methods for SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1, and MERS. The methods state that a t-test was used for statistical comparisons. However, it is unclear from the text what comparisons were made. In looking at the data, it appears that either a one- or two-way ANOVA with a multiple comparisons post-test would be more appropriate. Regarding data presentation, while Table 1 provides mean values, the standard deviation would also be helpful.
