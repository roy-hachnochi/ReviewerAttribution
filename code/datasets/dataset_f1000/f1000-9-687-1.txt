I think that this is an interesting report that claims for attention to rare infections in patients under immunotherapy and other novel therapies, especially when they are more difficult to diagnose (due to the location and the infectious agent). This report provides a concise and informative history of the case, mainly focus on the difficulties of the process. I consider that it would be important to provide information about the previous therapeutics that the patient had received, including the transplantation conditioning regimen, as well as the development of graft versus host disease (GvHD) and GvHD therapeutics, because it can help to explain the subjacent immunosuppression state. Another helpful information is to understand if Hodgkin lymphoma was under control at the time of CNS infection presentation.
