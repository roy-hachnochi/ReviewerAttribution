The COVID-19 pandemic has hindered access to hearing healthcare. The present study highlights the impact of the same on children with CI. The survey is the need of the hour to find out the challenges and the ways in which this can be adopted to overcome these challenges. I appreciate the authors for undertaking this relevant topic, the study is well written and will definitely be beneficial to the readers scientific community. There are a few minor changes I suggest: Title can be modified to include the location of the study as "Sharjah". Also, add the limitation and clinical implication of the study.
