R.R. Dourmashkin and colleagues provide additional TEM images from their work on Parkinson’s Disease (PD). Earlier this group detected enterovirus antigen in PD brainstem tissue. Dourmashkin et al. show additional TEM of virus-like particles 30 nm diameter (VLPs) associated with endoplasmic reticulum membranes from PD cases. In nuclei of neurons from PD cases VLPs of 40-50 nm diameter were found. Similar particles were also found in polio cases. Lewy bodies were also found. Cytoplasmic ribosomes of 17 nm were observed in control neurons. It is valuable to the scientific community and PD researchers to have access to this supplemental material. Overall, need to improve labelling of figure legends by use of arrows pointing to key features. PD Brain: Fig. 1-4 Fig. 5 use arrow to i.d. VLPs assoc. with cytoplasmic inclusion body. Fig. 7., Fig. 8, Fig. 9—need arrows. Fig. 13—need arrow. Fig. 14 –NM not labelled. Fig. 16—VLP no arrows. Fig. 31, 32 –need arrows. Fig. 37-- same area as Fig. 36. Fig. 51—need arrows. Fig. 63—need arrows. Fig. 66, Fig. 67. Fig. 68—difficult to see cytoplasmic membrane—need arrows. Fig. 72, 73—need arrows. Fig. 77—need arrows. Fig. 79, 80, 81—need arrows. Fig. 84—need arrows. Poliomyelitis Spinal Cord: —figures are out of order…. Fig. 1, Fig. 2—need arrows. Fig. 6, 7, 8—need arrows. Fig. 11—need arrows. Control Brain (Ribosomes, etc.): Fig. 1—need arrows.
