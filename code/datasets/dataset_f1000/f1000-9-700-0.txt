Thank you for the opportunity to review this important study. I appreciate the authors concisely laid out manuscript and the rationale for the need for this work. I fully appreciate the novel nature of this study and for that reason alone, it is an important component of understanding the effects of neighborhoods on individuals and their health outcomes. I confess that I do not have expertise in studies involving large data sets and the types of statistical analysis required to examine the findings from the variable relationships in those data sets, as I am predominately a qualitative researcher. I hope that other reviewers will be able to speak to the methodology chosen. As a mental health researcher, my interest is in the types of reported mental health disorders and community responses, especially during the pandemic. I wonder if there is more specificity in the data set about types of disorders and also the comorbidity with physical health disorders. The source data and conclusions seem very adequate to support the article. Minor edits may still be needed but may also be a result of formatting to the journal's submission portal.
