The aim of the preliminary study is to examine the results of core decompression in avascular necrosis as part of a systematic review. The authors have presented a complete study protocol for this. In principle, study design and methods are suitable to achieve the goal. Because of the heterogeneity of the present work, they want to evaluate the results in different categories, which are based on the respective classification system and differ in terms of radiological progression and the improvement of the clinical findings. The authors must be aware that the number of patients described is relatively small. I took the liberty to list the literature I know. In fact, the papers available differ with regard to the primary endpoint. But the classification systems are also different. Last but not least, the surgical techniques used are different, and sometimes not exactly specified. These are the potential limitations of this work. Ultimately, however, it is of great interest for all those who deal with this clinical picture to obtain such results. Therefore, I would like to support this work and advocate the indexing of the project.
