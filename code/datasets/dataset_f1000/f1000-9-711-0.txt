The authors conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate evidence on the impact of prenatal, intrapartum, and early childhood antibiotic exposure and the association with the risk of overweight and obesity later in childhood. They concluded that very low-quality evidence suggests that exposure to antibiotics early in life may be associated with an increased risk of overweight and obesity in later childhood. This manuscript is well-written and the reporting quality is good. However, few edits should be made before indexing. The authors should report any change/differences between the registered PROSPERO protocol and published manuscript. For example, different review question, different databases searched, different inclusion criteria and so on. Please keep the inclusion criteria consistency about study design in the abstract section and those in the manuscript (‘We conducted a comprehensive search of Embase, MEDLINE, and Web of Science for observational studies’ vs Inclusion criteria ‘Observational and experimental study designs were eligible’). The initial records (12091+25) in the flow diagram did not match with the in the 12091 in the results section. Please modify.
