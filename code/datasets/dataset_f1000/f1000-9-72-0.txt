A very sensible opinion article based on information well known to the coronavirus field but perhaps not well appreciated by others who might want to address this potential pandemic. I found no factual or interpretive errors. Were the issue not so pressing, I might have somewhat discounted the article based on 'obviousness' but this is obviousness to the field and not to the wider group of readers.
