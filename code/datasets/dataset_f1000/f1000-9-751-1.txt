The authors sequenced and assembled the genome of Sweetleaf by Illumina short-reads and annotated the genes using de novo prediction. The data could be useful to the filed, but some points need to be clarified: ​​​​​​Commonly, the first step of genome assembly is to estimate the genome size using k-mer frequency distribution. The authors should add such analysis in the revision. Based on the results in (1), the genome size of Stevia rebaudiana is ca. 1.3Gb. I don't think SPAdes is a good choice as it only works well on the small geneomes. Gene prediction is too simple and may loose considerable genes. The prediction should include multifaceted information, such as de novo prediction, Homology-based genes prediction et al. Add a citation for "standard process" of DNA extraction and the model of sequencing platform, e.g. Hi-Seq 2500. It is better to include a table to show the statistics, such as N50, genome size, the number of genes. Both of the assemblies from short-reads and short-reads+RagTag should be provided, becasue RagTag may introduce certain bias.
