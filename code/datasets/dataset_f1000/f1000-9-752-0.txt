The idea of the research article titled: “Effects of aflatoxin B1 on the submandibular salivary gland of albino rats and possible therapeutic potential of Rosmarinus officinalis: a light and electron microscopic study” is very interesting and valuable as the researcher illustrated the effect of AFB1 on the submandibular salivary glands of albino rats. Besides, the authors investigated the possible therapeutic effect of Rosmarinus officinalis extract which could be a base for clinical application. The article is clear and easy to comprehend as it is well constructed. Significant results were noted in the results of this study, all the photomicrographs are very clear. But still, there are suggested minor comments the authors could deal with, or at least discuss for additional impact. In the methodology: The letters used to identify different groups can be changed into numbers to be easily identified. It is an idea to perform an additional assessment method. Example: RT-PCR analysis of α-amylase gene expression to confirm the obtained results.
