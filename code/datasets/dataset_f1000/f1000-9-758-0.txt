The authors suggested genomic tools to assess fungal infection by manipulating DNA extracted from paraffin-embedded tissue blocks. There is a growing importance of using FFPE tissues further in clinical assessment, therefore, the study continues to contribute to this field. The paper fits within the scope of the journal The paper is well-written in good English. The authors need to show the concentrations of the recovered DNA and how they quantify it. How the authors controlled for damaged DNA in sequences negative for fungal DNA. The study lack proper positive and negative control (can use FFPE known to be free of fungal infection). Maybe showing a photo of the 1% non-denaturing agarose gel is useful to assess the quality of the isolated DNA.
