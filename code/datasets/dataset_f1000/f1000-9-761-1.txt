 The study is combing the available data on a diagnostic test to detect TB as a cause in this case for pericarditis. From the various studies it becomes clear that the specificity is excellent. Sensitivity is however disappointing, maybe due to a low bacterial load. So there is a place for the test in making a fast diagnosis to start early treatment. Yet a negative result does not exclude TB as the possible aetiology. Study is well designed well performed and not overstating the technique can be used for rule in. Well done work, well written. Only 1 typo on page 8: we might excluded No other corrections are needed at this point in time
