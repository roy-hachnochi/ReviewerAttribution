The purpose of the manuscript is not entirely clear: Exactly what land-use type the samples come from (what do control and greenhouse mean? I don't see the comparison in the results section.) What do you mean by "pollutant nitrogen" (= nitrite?)? On the basis of the soluble N-forms measured once in the upper 20 cm layer, how can it be concluded that the test soil is suitable for use? Soluble N-forms change very rapidly in soil. N-test methods are up-to-date, but it is not clear what soil-liquid ratio was used for CaCl 2 and KCl extracts? Nor is it clear how many soil samples were tested? The detailed determination of soluble N-forms is very important. It would have been interesting to see this in the deeper layers of the soil as well. Furthermore, based on the total (Kjeldahl) N content of the soil, a picture of the source of soluble components could be obtained. Did the total soluble N content not correlate with SOM? "Soil organic matter (SOM)" is proposed instead of "Humus" and "soil organic carbon (SOC)" is proposed instead of "C%". In the description of the SOM method, K2SO4 is erroneously used instead of K-dichromate. When giving the averages, the number of items and the standard deviation must also be included (Table 1).
