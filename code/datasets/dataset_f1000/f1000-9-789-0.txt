The case is well described, with good quality photos and image exam. A well documented pathology analysis was made. It is a rare pathology and this article brings more substance for future diagnosis alert. The treatment is correctly described and clear. All case history is acceptable. I think there is a reason for the article to be indexed without necessity for revision.
