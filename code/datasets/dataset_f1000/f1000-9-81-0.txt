This paper describes a iCRF generator that is able to generate codebooks that can be used in three EDCs, namely CASTOR, OpenClinica and REDCap. This is a very important and useful tool for the clinical research community in promoting and achieving semantic interoperability and the authors should be commended on their effort. While the tool offers the ability to map the fields and values to the NCI thesaurus and SNOMED CT terminology, what is not clear to me is whether the user is able to select a particular terminology server to use. This is particularly important for local variants of the SNOMED CT terminology that may contain terms not present in the global SNOMED CT terminology. Furthermore, by providing the functionality to connect to a particular terminology server opens up the possibility for terms from other standardised terminologies and ontologies to be included within the codebooks. The authors state that “internationally established codebooks, such as CDISC’s CDASH can also be made available”. It would be useful to explicitly state how they propose for this to happen. Will it be posted on a website? Will it be part of the codebook libraries, as is the case with REDCap? What is also not clear is whether a codebook created for, say, Castor, can be used for another EDC, say OpenClinica. If so, it would be useful to state how the iCRF generator deals with the different implementations (For a start, REDCap implements a slight variation of CDISC ODM, which is not compatible, out-of-the-box, with OpenClinica, which offers a more consistent implementation of CDISC ODM).
