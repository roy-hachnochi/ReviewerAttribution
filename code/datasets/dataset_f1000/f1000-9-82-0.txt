I have a few suggestions which may be helpful to the authors: When discussing research methods, it may be worth just mentioning the efficacy/effectiveness issue. I think that this "To obtain an efficient search with adequate sensitivity, performing searches in MEDLINE and EMBASE is sufficient, as they are the two most frequently used bibliographic databases 39 , and they are enough to identify most relevant studies for a specific SR 40 " might be a bit of a sweeping statement - are the two databases always sufficient? I think it would be helpful to mention some others as well - unless the authors really do believe that these are enough. "involving a medical librarian can be convenient to improve the search quality 47 â€“ 49 ". I am not sure that convenient is quite the right word. Be clear to differentiate risk of bias at the study level from RoB at the review level. For example RoB2 is study-level, ROBIS is review level. "For instance, in the SR by Ellis et al. (2017), the authors established a 70% heterogeneity limit for I 2 , beyond which a meta-analysis combining the results would not be performed 13 " - why 70%? This does not sound like a sensible decision making process anyway. Either the authors thought it was worth doing a MA in which case the heterogeneity form parts of the results, or it is not worth doing in which case this would not be a consideration. Also not doing a MA may have the effect of hiding this heterogeneity. There are also ways of investigating heterogeneity that can be illuminating. Mention ROBIS and AMSAR2 as review-level tools.
