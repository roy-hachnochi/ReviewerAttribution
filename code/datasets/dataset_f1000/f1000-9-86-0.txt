Thank you for requesting that I review this interesting and timely article, I found it very informative. Interventions that enhance recruitment to non-randomised research studies are an important and under reported area, this systematic review highlights the lack of clear, reliable evidence presented to date. This is an important article because it highlights methodological and reporting problems, whilst at the same time bringing together evidence from interventions used in non-randomised studies that do show ‘promise’ in terms of improving recruitment. In addition the article discusses and highlights the way in which future non-randomised studies might improve reporting (and conduct) of similar recruitment interventions, enabling researchers to investigate and utilise effective recruitment strategies during the planning and implementation stages of research studies. In my view this systematic review has been conducted with methodological rigour, however, I am a qualitative researcher/trialist and trust that this article will also be reviewed by a statistician/ systematic reviewer who routinely uses the ROBINS-I tool to assess for risk of bias. The authors have provided clear and explicit detail in relation to the studies and intervention categorisation used for the narrative synthesis of data. I believe this is a very strong piece of work in its current format and would recommend indexing.
