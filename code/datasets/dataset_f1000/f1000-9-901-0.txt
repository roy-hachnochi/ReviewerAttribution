This is a well-designed study protocol aimed to investigate the relationships between lifestyle factors, reproductive health, and risk of ovarian cancer in Pakistan. The aims, objectives and study design including sample size and data collection methods are appropriate and sufficiently described. The authors have cited the current and relevant literature. However, considering the sensitive nature of the topic under study, I would suggest the investigators need to provide more details on the recruitment of the potential study participants and the ethical considerations. For instance, the authorsâ€™ need to identify and name the relevant academic ethics review committee that will approve the project.
