            <meta name="dc.description" content=" Background: Despite the public health importance of documenting the burden of physical inactivity and weight gain, there is a paucity of such data in Kuwait during the lockdown for Covid-19 pandemic. Therefore, this survey was designed to estimate: the burden of poor eating habits particularly binge eating habits, fluctuations in weight and its predictors among the Kuwaiti public. 
 Methods: This cross-sectional survey was conducted from 2 nd to 12 th April 2020 among the general public in Kuwait. All data were collected through a social media platform (WhatsApp groups), through convenience and snowball sampling methods. The survey comprised three sections: a) demographic characteristics of respondents, b) eating habits particularly binge eating, consumption of snacks and beverages c) subjective feelings of anxiety and d) weight before and during the pandemic. All data were analyzed using SPSS (v.25). 
 Results: There was a total of 522 valid respondents, with a mean age of 41.78 (11.75) years. There was a significant increase in weight of respondents during the quarantine (mean difference= -1.13, SD 5.39, t= -4.52, p &amp;lt; 0.001). Those with reporting unhealthy diets were 4.5 times more likely to report an increase in weight. Those reporting having anxiety throughout the day were 2.45 times more likely and those consuming snacks excessively were associated with 3.27 times higher odds of increase in weight than those not consuming it. 
 Conclusions: We recommend that authorities develop a strategic plan to counter harmful effects of this pandemic on health that are originating from sedentary lifestyle, unhealthy eating patterns and psychological issues.">

  "description": "Background: Despite the public health importance of documenting the burden of physical inactivity and weight gain, there is a paucity of such data in Kuwait during the lockdown for Covid-19 pandemic. Therefore, this survey was designed to estimate: the burden of poor eating habits particularly binge eating habits, fluctuations in weight and its predictors among the Kuwaiti public.
Methods: This cross-sectional survey was conducted from 2nd to 12th April 2020 among the general public in Kuwait. All data were collected through a social media platform (WhatsApp groups), through convenience and snowball sampling methods. The survey comprised three sections: a) demographic characteristics of respondents, b) eating habits particularly binge eating, consumption of snacks and beverages c) subjective feelings of anxiety and d) weight before and during the pandemic. All data were analyzed using SPSS (v.25).
Results: There was a total of 522 valid respondents, with a mean age of 41.78 (11.75) years. There was a significant increase in weight of respondents during the quarantine (mean difference= -1.13, SD 5.39, t= -4.52, p &amp;lt; 0.001). Those with reporting unhealthy diets were 4.5 times more likely to report an increase in weight. Those reporting having anxiety throughout the day were 2.45 times more likely and those consuming snacks excessively were associated with 3.27 times higher odds of increase in weight than those not consuming it.
Conclusions: We recommend that authorities develop a strategic plan to counter harmful effects of this pandemic on health that are originating from sedentary lifestyle, unhealthy eating patterns and psychological issues."

The concept of quarantine is practically new for the general public, and has influenced social, economic and psychological threads of our life<sup><a href="#ref-1">1</a>,<a href="#ref-2">2</a></sup>. Due to changes in our habits including socializing, physical work, eating and entertainment, it is natural that level of anxiety and depression is on the rise among people in quarantine<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a></sup>. The psychological impact of quarantine has also been associated with post-traumatic stress, confusion and aggression<sup><a href="#ref-1">1</a></sup>.</p><p class="" id=d10e132>Among the general public, poor information pertaining to the COVID-19 and the rationale for lockdown has given birth to fear toward infection, frustration, boredom, financial loss and stigma<sup><a href="#ref-1">1</a></sup>. These stressors may lead to people being homebound and lead a sedentary lifestyle and develop poor eating habits. This poor lifestyle can be detrimental to the health structure of Middle Eastern countries, especially Kuwait, where obesity has a high prevalence and a large proportion of Kuwaiti national meet the World Health Organization’s definition of ‘obesity’<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a></sup>. According to Al-Nohair, the prevalence of obesity among Kuwaiti males is 36% and in females is 48%<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-5">5</a></sup>. This high rate of obesity in Kuwait has been attributed to a plethora of biopsychosocial risk factors and a polygenic etiology<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a></sup>. The current pandemic and associated quarantine may further exacerbate the situation<sup><a href="#ref-1">1</a></sup>.</p><p class="" id=d10e158>Due to the disrupted daily routine of adults and children, less social contact and rising psychological distress, the health of Kuwaiti residents can further deteriorate both physically and mentally<sup><a href="#ref-1">1</a></sup>. All of these factors have been documented to particularly affect healthy eating habits<sup><a href="#ref-6">6</a></sup>. Over-eating and the resulting weight gain during the COVID-19 quarantine, may result in an increase in incidence of chronic diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and psychiatric illnesses. Epidemiological and public health studies focusing on nutrition and weight gain among the general masses are needed to develop strategies and devise interventions countering these.</p><p class="" id=d10e169>Despite the public health importance of documenting the burden of physical inactivity and weight gain, there is a paucity of such data in Kuwait. Therefore, this survey was designed to estimate the burden of poor eating habits particularly binge eating habits, fluctuations in weight and its predictors among the Kuwaiti public.</p></div><div id=article1-body class=generated-article-body><h2 class=main-title id=d10e175>Methods</h2><div class=section><a name=d10e178 class=n-a></a><h3 class=section-title>Study background</h3><p class="" id=d10e183>This cross-sectional survey was conducted from 2<sup>nd</sup> to 12<sup>th</sup> April 2020 among the general public in Kuwait City, Kuwait. The country reported its first case on 24<sup>th</sup> February 2020, and the country went into partial lockdown since 22<sup>nd</sup> March, and on 10<sup>th</sup> May, the country was placed in full curfew based on Ministry of Health’s assessment<sup><a href="#ref-7">7</a></sup> (at the time of writing, on 4<sup>th </sup>August 2020 Kuwait will remain under curfew 9pm-3am). All data were collected through a social media platform (WhatsApp groups), where first participants were chosen through convenience sampling and the rest through snowball sampling methods. Attempts were made to exclude non-Kuwaiti nationals by distributing the questionnaire to Kuwaiti nationals and screening the datasets after collection of data. Inclusion criteria included participants being Kuwaiti nationals residing in Kuwait. There were no specific exclusion criteria pertaining to age, language, gender or occupation of the respondents. After providing written informed consent, the respondents were briefed about the objectives of the survey, ensured anonymity and that the group findings will be reported. Respondents could leave the study at any time if they felt uncomfortable. Approval for this study was provided by the Ethical Review Board of Ministry of Health of Kuwait, Kuwait (Approval #2020/1477).</p></div><div class=section><a name=d10e210 class=n-a></a><h3 class=section-title>Survey</h3><p class="" id=d10e215>The minimum sample size required for this survey was calculated to answer out primary research objective of documenting prevalence of poor eating habits among Kuwaitis. Based on a statistical power of 80%, confidence level 95%, margin of error 5% and a population size of 1.3 million Kuwaitis, a minimum sample size of 385 was required. All data were collected using an electronic version of a bilingual questionnaire in Arabic and English languages. The questionnaire was pre-piloted among a few participants before distribution; however, no factor validity or reliability testing was done due to categorical and open-ended nature of the responses. Participants were encouraged to provide their responses in either of the languages. The questionnaire comprised of three sections<sup><a href="#ref-20">20</a></sup>: a) demographic characteristics of respondents, b) eating habits particularly binge eating, consumption of snacks and beverages c) subjective feelings of anxiety and d) weight before and during the pandemic. Demographic characteristics included gender, age, nationality, marital status, parity and housing of the respondents. Several questions were asked regarding binge eating habits documenting change in nutrition habits, time of increased food consumption, number and type of snack foods consumed during the day, water and coffee intake. Physical activity during the day was inquired using two questions: a) a trichotomous question documenting change in physical activity when compared with normal routine before the quarantine and number of hours spent in a sedentary manner per day in the last week. Symptoms of anxiety were measured subjectively using a three-point Likert scale. Participants were asked the extent to which they experienced anxiety every day in last 7 days. Responses were given on a three point scale ranging from never to always. Participants were instructed to respond with their weights measured using a weight scale (digital or analogue) if they had measured it. Similarly, they were instructed to input their current weight status using a digital or analogue weighing scale, if available. The question regarding weight of the respondents before and during the lockdown, yielded 462 (88.50%) valid responses. The remaining participants could not input their weights due to unavailability of weighing scales.</p></div><div class=section><a name=d10e223 class=n-a></a><h3 class=section-title>Statistical analysis</h3><p class="" id=d10e228>All data were analyzed using SPSS (v25). Descriptive statistics were calculated for all variables where quantitative variables were presented as mean (SD) and categorical ones as frequency and percentage. Statistical significance for difference between weight of respondents during the COVID-19 pandemic and before it was assessed using t-test for dependent samples. To delineate predictors of weight gain, it was planned a priori to run multiple regression; however, due to the non-normalized nature of the data, logistic regression analysis was performed.</p><p class="" id=d10e231>Thereafter, the respondents were categorized in to two groups: participants with weight gain and participants with negative or no change in weight. To identify the predictors of experience in weight gain among the Kuwaitis, binary logistic regression (stepwise method) was employed. Theoretically sound factors showing relationship with weight gain in previous literature were added as predictors in the logistic regression model<sup><a href="#ref-8">8</a></sup>. These predictors included demographic characteristics of respondents, eating habits c) subjective feelings of anxiety and d) questions pertaining to physical inactivity. The final model reported significant predictors of weight, with statistical significance set at ≤0.05 and the variance in the model was assessed using the Negelkerke R<sup>2</sup>.</p></div></div><div id=article1-body class=generated-article-body><h2 class=main-title id=d10e245>Results</h2><div class=section><a name=d10e248 class=n-a></a><h3 class=section-title>Characteristics of respondents</h3><p class="" id=d10e253>There was a total of 522 valid respondents, with a mean age of 41.78 (11.75) years.

Mean weight of respondents before the pandemic was 75.03 (16.85) kg and 75.74 (17.54) kg during the pandemic (<a href="#f1">Figure 1</a>). There was a significant increase in weight of respondents during the quarantine (mean difference= -1.13, SD 5.39, t= -4.52, p &lt; 0.001). A higher proportion of respondents reported that their weight will stabilize after the pandemic (n=305, 58.4%) while 217 (41.6%) reported that it would increase. A total of 333 (63.8%) of the respondents reported feeling anxious sometimes during the day, 133 (25.5%) always and 56 (10.7%) never.

class=section-title>Predictors of weight increase among the Kuwaitis</h3><p class="" id=d10e774>Logistic regression (stepwise method) was used to analyze statistically significant predictors of increase in weight among the Kuwaitis during the COVID-19 quarantine. It yielded a significant model (X<sup>2</sup>= 90.43, df= 8, p&lt; 0.001). The model explained 24.9% of variance in weight changes among Kuwaitis (Nagelkerke R<sup>2</sup>) and correctly classified 71.6% of the cases, whereas the sensitivity of this particular model was 65.8% and specificity 78% in predicting the increase in weight among Kuwaiti respondents. According to this model, when compared with respondents who changed their diet pattern to healthier, those with reporting unhealthy diets were 4.5 times (95% CI= 2.45 to 8.23) more likely to report an increase in weight. Those reporting having anxiety throughout the day were 2.45 times more likely to have an increase in weight than those never experiencing it. Consuming snacks excessively</p><p class="" id=d10e783>(&gt;3 times a day) was associated with 3.27 times higher odds of increase in weight than those not consuming it. Those that consumed moderate amounts of snacks (1–3 times a day) did not differ to their counterparts who never consumed snacks throughout the day (<a href="#T2">Table 2</a>).</p><a name=T2 class=n-a></a><div class="table-wrap panel clearfix"><div class=caption><h3>Table 2.

id=d10e1154>Discussion</h2><p class="" id=d10e1157>The present study documents change in dietary patterns among Kuwait residents during the COVID-19 pandemic. According to our results, a high proportion of Kuwaitis reported binge eating habits, a sedentary lifestyle and an increase in their weight during the quarantine. Significant predictors of weight gain among the Kuwaitis included unhealthy diet pattern, excessive consumption of snacks and subjective feelings of anxiety.</p><p class="" id=d10e1160>Our study reports a high prevalence of unhealthy eating habits and sedentary lifestyle during the pandemic, which contributed to a significant weight increase among the Kuwaitis. Although in the past, several studies have reported high rates of unhealthy habits and obesity among the Kuwaiti public, this situation may have worsened during the lockdown. This time of pandemic and quarantine has affected almost all aspects of life and the pattern of unhealthy eating habits have become more prevalent including excessive consumption of snacks, predicting an increase in weight of the studied population. Our study also showed that a higher proportion of respondents assume that their eating pattern has become healthier but at the same time the frequency of snacks binge eating, and night-time consumption of food showed statistical significance, leading to unhealthy patterns of food consumption. An increase in weight gain and development of unhealthy eating habits will present as a challenge in the post-COVID<i></i> era, and policies must be devised to strengthen health systems to tackle this.</p><p class="" id=d10e1165>Another important predictor of weight included subjective feelings of anxiety during this era, which not only carry negative physical and mental health implication but also contribute to ‘stress-eating’ and ‘food cravings’<sup><a href="#ref-9">9</a>–<a href="#ref-14">14</a></sup>. Feeling anxious during this era of pandemic is natural and eating more carbohydrates and binge eating likely improves mood in the short term, but leads to gain of weight and chronic diseases incidence also contribute to poorer body image<sup><a href="#ref-9">9</a>–<a href="#ref-14">14</a></sup>. This double burden of poor mental health and obesity thus presents a great challenge to the public health professionals and interventions must be devised to ensure good mental health during these trying times. Several interventions, especially psychoeducation related to this pandemic and meditation interventions, can be provided to ease off worry and stress and reduce anxiety levels among the general public.</p><p class="" id=d10e1182>The results from this study can serve as a guiding tool for shaping health strategy during this pandemic by health authorities. As Gulf countries grew enormously in wealth, living standards were raised, albeit at a cost of more sedentary and comfortable life routine<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-15">15</a>,<a href="#ref-16">16</a></sup>. Kuwait had previously developed a ‘Kuwait National Programme for Healthy Living (2013-2017)’<sup><a href="#ref-17">17</a></sup>; authorities can develop a strategic plan to counter harmful effects of this pandemic on health that are originating from sedentary lifestyle, unhealthy eating patterns and psychological issues.</p><div class=section><a name=d10e1200 class=n-a></a><h3 class=section-title>Limitations</h3><p class="" id=d10e1205>Despite its large sample size, this study has several limitations which need to be considered for careful interpretation of its results. Most important limitations include a convenience and snowballing approach for collection of data as opposed to random sampling. Cross-sectional nature of this study limits inferences related to causality and temporality and use of a subjective question for estimating anxiety levels limit validity of these results and also introduce recall bias. Future studies should consider a prospective study design and use of valid and reliable questionnaires like the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale<sup><a href="#ref-18">18</a></sup>.</p></div></div><div id=article1-body class=generated-article-body><h2 class=main-title id=d10e1216>Data availability</h2><div class=section><a name=d10e1219 class=n-a></a><h3 class=section-title>Underlying data</h3><p class="" id=d10e1224>Figshare: Diet Kuwait.csv, <a target=xrefwindow href="https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.12706223.v1" id=d10e1226>https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.12706223.v1</a><sup><a href="#ref-19">19</a></sup>.</p><p class="" id=d10e1233>Data are available under the terms of the <a target=xrefwindow href="http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/" id=d10e1235>Creative Commons Zero "No rights reserved" data waiver</a> (CC0 1.0 Public domain dedication).</p></div><div class=section><a name=d10e1240 class=n-a></a><h3 class=section-title>Extended data</h3><p class="" id=d10e1245>Figshare: CovidKuwaitWt-Survey.pdf, <a target=xrefwindow href="https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.12709631.v1" id=d10e1247>https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.12709631.v1</a><sup><a href="#ref-20">20</a></sup>.</p><p class="" id=d10e1254>Data are available under the terms of the <a target=xrefwindow href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode" id=d10e1256>Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license</a> (CC-BY 4.0).</p></div></div><div id=article1-back class=generated-article-footer><div class=back-section><a name=d10e1265 class=n-a></a><h2 class=main-title id=d10e1267>Acknowledgements</h2><p class="" id=d10e1270>The authors thank Dr. Ahmed Waqas, doctoral fellow at the University of Liverpool, Liverpool, UK, for providing assistance in data analysis.</p></div><div class=back-section><a name=d10e1274 class=n-a></a><span class="research-layout prime-recommended-wrapper reference-heading is-hidden"><span class=faculty-opinion-icon></span><span class="prime-red big">Faculty Opinions recommended</span></span><h2 class=main-title id=d156>References</h2><div class="section ref-list"><a name=d10e1274 class=n-a></a><ul><li><a name=ref-1 class=n-a></a><span class=label>1. </span>&nbsp;<span class=citation><a name=d10e1281 class=n-a></a>Brooks SK, Webster RK, Smith LE, <i> et al.</i>: The psychological impact of quarantine and how to reduce it: rapid review of the evidence. <i>Lancet.</i> 2020;
