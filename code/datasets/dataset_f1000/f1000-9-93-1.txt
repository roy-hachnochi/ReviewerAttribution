The rapid spread of COVID-2019 around the world has caused more than 5 million infections and over 300,000 deaths, which undoubtedly has a huge impact on the global economy and people's health. It is necessary to explore the potential treatment of the disease. The two authors described the effects of different concentrations of lithium on coronavirus infections and discussed potential mechanisms based on existing literature. Although the current reports are mostly cell studies, it seems that lithium plays a role in inhibiting coronavirus infection. In the revised version of the paper, the authors state that lithium appears as a possible candidate for therapy of COVID-19. And they also made attempt to investigate the influence of lithium (0.5–1 mM) – alone and with chloroquine or other drugs – on the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Besides, they emphasized the need to monitor blood lithium concentrations, which made their conclusions more rigorous. In summary, the prediction of the potential role of lithium in the treatment or prevention of COVID-2019 in this paper is reasonable to some extent. However, so far, there have been no in vivo studies and other relevant conclusive evidence to confirm this hypothesis. It may still be necessary to carry out research on related aspects in the future. Although lithium may not soon be used in the epidemic of COVID-19, it may have a certain role in the next similar outbreak. Overall a well-revised manuscript with interesting results. I recommend indexing.
