The case report is well written and presents an interesting case of ectopic meningioma. Some amendment is needed however. Radiological findings should be included. The authors merely mention that the lesion was not seen by radiology. Please clarify the technique used and relevant findings. The grade of meningioma was not given The differential diagnosis of meningioma from mimics was not sufficiently addressed. Different entities in the differential diagnosis were mentioned at different parts of the article without discussing the differentiating points. And the performed stains would not help in differentiating meningioma from perineurioma, both are positive for EMA and vimentin. Grammatical and spelling mistakes are noted here .
