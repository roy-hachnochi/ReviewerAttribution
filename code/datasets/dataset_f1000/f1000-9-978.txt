            <meta name="dc.description" content=" Background: Reading acquisition varies between languages, as languages differ in terms of phonology and orthography. Orthographic knowledge is demonstrated to be crucial in literacy acquisition in most orthographies. The literature on acquisition of orthographic knowledge has focused more on alphabetic orthographies and less is understood in alphasyllabary Kannada language. The present study aimed to understand the akshara knowledge acquisition by measuring akshara identification accuracy and reaction time in typically developing Kannada medium primary school children. 
 Methods: The study consisted of 315 typically developing children, 45 each from Grade I through Grade VII between the age range of 5 years 6 months to 12 years 6 months. The children were assessed for akshara identification accuracy and reaction time using a representative sample of 67 akshara selected at four different levels of complexity: vowels in primary form, consonant with inherent vowels, consonant with vowel diacritics, and consonant clusters. The mean performance was compared between the groups using one-way ANOVA with post-hoc Bonferroni test. 
 Results: One-way ANOVA revealed significant main effect (p&le;0.05) of Grade on akshara identification accuracy and reaction time. The post-hoc Bonferroni test revealed that the mean akshara identification accuracy improved significantly (p&le;0.05) from Grade I to Grade V and reached a plateau at Grade VI. The reaction time significantly reduced from Grade I to Grade IV and there was no significant change beyond Grade V.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; 
 Conclusion: The children learning to read alphasyllabary Kannada gain mastery over the majority of aksharas during the initial years of formal schooling, which develops completely by Grade VI. The automaticity in naming akshara develops gradually and reaches a plateau by Grade IV. The present findings indicate that children acquire automaticity in naming akshara early, while the akshara knowledge continues to develop.">

  "description": "Background: Reading acquisition varies between languages, as languages differ in terms of phonology and orthography. Orthographic knowledge is demonstrated to be crucial in literacy acquisition in most orthographies. The literature on acquisition of orthographic knowledge has focused more on alphabetic orthographies and less is understood in alphasyllabary Kannada language. The present study aimed to understand the akshara knowledge acquisition by measuring akshara identification accuracy and reaction time in typically developing Kannada medium primary school children.
Methods: The study consisted of 315 typically developing children, 45 each from Grade I through Grade VII between the age range of 5 years 6 months to 12 years 6 months. The children were assessed for akshara identification accuracy and reaction time using a representative sample of 67 akshara selected at four different levels of complexity: vowels in primary form, consonant with inherent vowels, consonant with vowel diacritics, and consonant clusters. The mean performance was compared between the groups using one-way ANOVA with post-hoc Bonferroni test.
Results: One-way ANOVA revealed significant main effect (p&le;0.05) of Grade on akshara identification accuracy and reaction time. The post-hoc Bonferroni test revealed that the mean akshara identification accuracy improved significantly (p&le;0.05) from Grade I to Grade V and reached a plateau at Grade VI. The reaction time significantly reduced from Grade I to Grade IV and there was no significant change beyond Grade V.   
Conclusion: The children learning to read alphasyllabary Kannada gain mastery over the majority of aksharas during the initial years of formal schooling, which develops completely by Grade VI. The automaticity in naming akshara develops gradually and reaches a plateau by Grade IV. The present findings indicate that children acquire automaticity in naming akshara early, while the akshara knowledge continues to develop."

Orthographic knowledge is demonstrated to be crucial in literacy acquisition in most orthographies. The literature on acquisition of orthographic knowledge has focused more on alphabetic orthographies and less is understood in alphasyllabary Kannada language. The present study aimed to understand the akshara knowledge acquisition by measuring akshara identification accuracy and reaction time in typically developing Kannada medium primary school children.<br/> <b>Methods:</b> The study consisted of 315 typically developing children, 45 each from Grade I through Grade VII between the age range of 5 years 6 months to 12 years 6 months. The children were assessed for akshara identification accuracy and reaction time using a representative sample of 67 akshara selected at four different levels of complexity: vowels in primary form, consonant with inherent vowels, consonant with vowel diacritics, and consonant clusters. The mean performance was compared between the groups using one-way ANOVA with post-hoc Bonferroni test.<br/> <b>Results:</b> One-way ANOVA revealed significant main effect (p≤0.05) of Grade on akshara identification accuracy and reaction time. The post-hoc Bonferroni test revealed that the mean akshara identification accuracy improved significantly (p≤0.05) from Grade I to Grade V and reached a plateau at Grade VI. The reaction time significantly reduced from Grade I to Grade IV and there was no significant change beyond Grade V.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br/> <b>Conclusion:</b> The children learning to read alphasyllabary Kannada gain mastery over the majority of aksharas during the initial years of formal schooling, which develops completely by Grade VI. The automaticity in naming akshara develops gradually and reaches a plateau by Grade IV. The present findings indicate that children acquire automaticity in naming akshara early, while the akshara knowledge continues to develop. </div> <div class=abstract-for-mobile> <div class="margin-top-30 padding-bottom-30 research-layout is-centered"> <button class="primary orange-text white-bg bigger-text abstract-expand-button-mobile with-border show" style="display: none;"> READ ALL <span class="f1r-icon icon-14_more_small orange vmiddle big"></span> </button> <button class="primary orange-text white-bg bigger-text abstract-expand-button-mobile with-border hide"> READ LESS <span class="f1r-icon icon-10_less_small orange vmiddle big"></span> </button> </div> </div> </div> <div class=clearfix></div> <div class="article-context no-divider"> <div class="article-abstract article-page-general-text-mobile research-layout generated-article-body"> <h2 class=main-title>Keywords</h2> <p class="u-mb--0 u-pb--2"> Akshara knowledge, Alphasyllabary, Akshara identification accuracy, Reaction Time </p> </div> </div> <div class=article-information> <span class="info-separation padding-bottom"> <div id=corresponding-author-icon class="email-icon float-left"> <span class="f1r-icon icon-6_email orange"></span> <div id=corresponding-author-window class="margin-top-20 popup-window-wrapper is-hidden"> <div class="popup-window corresponding-authors-popup"> <div class=corresponding-author-container> <div class="popup-window-title small">Corresponding Author(s)</div> <div class=authors> Somashekara Haralakatta Shivananjappa (<a href="mailto:som.shekar@manipal.edu">som.shekar@manipal.edu</a>) </div> </div> <div class="margin-top margin-bottom float-left"> <button id=close-popup-window class=general-white-orange-button>Close</button> </div> </div> </div> </div> <span class="icon-text float-left" data-test-id=box-corresponding-author> <b>Corresponding author:</b> Somashekara Haralakatta Shivananjappa </span> <div class=clearfix></div> </span> <span class="info-separation padding-bottom competing-interests-display"> <span class=competing-interests-title>Competing interests:</span> No competing interests were disclosed. </span> <div class="info-separation padding-bottom grant-information-display"> <span class=grant-information-title>Grant information:</span> The author(s) declared that no grants were involved in supporting this work. </div> <span class="f1r-article-desk info-separation padding-bottom"> <span class="copywrite-icon float-left"> <span class="f1r-icon icon-100_open_access"></span> </span> <span class="icon-text float-left" data-test-id=box-copyright-text> <b>Copyright:</b>&nbsp; © 2020 Usha MNK <em>et al</em>.

Language-specific phonological and orthographic knowledge is crucial for successful word decoding. Orthographic knowledge is the information that is stored in memory, which dictates the rules to represent the spoken language in the written form (<a href="#ref-1">Apel, 2011</a>). The role of orthographic knowledge is crucial in literacy acquisition (e.g., <a href="#ref-2">Apel <i>et al.</i>, 2006</a>; <a href="#ref-6">Castles &amp; Coltheart, 2004</a>). The studies conducted in alphabetical languages have reported that orthographic knowledge acts as the strongest predictor of reading success in children (<a href="#ref-3">Bowey, 2005</a>; <a href="#ref-5">Caravolas <i>et al.</i>, 2013</a>; <a href="#ref-7">Hulme <i>et al.</i>, 2012</a>; <a href="#ref-18">Seymour, 2005</a>). However, there are prevailing arguments about the generalization of theoretical models explaining the reading process and other research findings from alphabetic writing systems to children learning to read in other writing systems (<a href="#ref-11">Karanth, 2003</a>; <a href="#ref-13">Nag, 2007</a>). Studies in alphasyllabaries have shown that the developmental pathway of reading is different from children acquiring an alphabetic writing system (<a href="#ref-13">Nag, 2007</a>; <a href="#ref-15">Nag &amp; Snowling, 2011</a>; <a href="#ref-16">Nag &amp; Snowling, 2012</a>). Alphasyllabaries are phonologically and orthographically different from alphabetic writing systems and share features of both alphabetic and syllabic writing systems. Previous studies have illustrated clear differences between alphabetic and alphasyllabaries languages (e.g., <a href="#ref-13">Nag, 2007</a>; <a href="#ref-14">Nag, 2014</a>; <a href="#ref-23">Tiwari <i>et al.</i>, 2011</a>). Alphasyllabaries represent sounds at the level of the syllable called akshara, but have distinct features to indicate sub-syllabic information (<a href="#ref-4">Bright, 1999</a>). These differences explain the variability in the acquisition of orthographic knowledge across orthographies. For example, <a href="#ref-17">Seymour <i>et al.</i> (2003)</a> reported that children acquired orthographic knowledge by the end of Grade I in alphabetical language such as English, whereas <a href="#ref-20">Shu (2003)</a> reported it to be beyond Grade VI in Chinese.</p><p class="" id=d5071e268>Previous attempts have examined akshara knowledge in alphasyllabary languages, such as Kannada and Malayalam. <a href="#ref-13">Nag (2007)</a> investigated children’s acquisition of orthographic knowledge in Kannada, a south Indian alphasyllabary language. The study included a group of 374 primary school children between the age range of 5 to 10 years, studying in regular schools with Kannada language as the medium of instruction. The children were assessed for akshara knowledge twice. The first assessment was done when they were Grade I, II, and III. The follow-up assessment was done after 15 months when the children moved to subsequent Grades. A Syllabograph Recognition Test (<a href="#ref-36">LAB, 2003</a>) was conducted, which consists of 20 Kannada akshara, in which one akshara was a primary vowel, eight aksharas of consonants with inherent vowels, five aksharas of consonants with vowel diacritics, and six aksharas of consonant clusters. The results revealed a significant main effect of time of testing and Grade level with a significant interaction between these variables on akshara knowledge. Akshara mastery was found to continue into elementary school with an accuracy of around 80% during the second assessment. The study noted the differential trend for individual akshara types; consonants with inherent vowels were mastered by the end of Grade I, consonants with vowels diacritics with ligatures and consonant clusters were only partially mastered by Grade II, and this extended beyond Grade IV with a substantial number of children showing less than 50% accuracy even at Grade IV. These findings indicated that orthographic knowledge in Kannada was determined by the orthographic features of akshara.</p><p class="" id=d5071e277>Another study was conducted by <a href="#ref-23">Tiwari <i>et al.</i> (2011)</a> in Malayalam, which is another alphasyllabary language. This study investigated akshara knowledge in Grade III children learning to read alphasyllabary. The study included 80 children between the age range of 7–8 years from two Malayalam medium schools in Kerala. The stimuli were similar to the <a href="#ref-13">Nag (2007)</a> study, which included 17 Malayalam aksharas, such as a primary form of vowels, consonants with inherent vowels, consonants with vowels diacritics, and consonant clusters. The aksharas was presented in the flashcards one at a time, and the children were asked to name them. The results showed a differential pace of mastery of various akshara types in Malayalam alphasyllabary. Grade III children mastered vowels in primary form and consonants with inherent vowels. Consonants with vowel diacritics showed partial dispersion, whereas the consonant cluster showed extreme dispersion. They also reported that consonant with vowel diacritics was mastered much better than consonant clusters.</p><p class="" id=d5071e289><a href="#ref-13">Nag (2007)</a> and <a href="#ref-23">Tiwari <i>et al.</i> (2011)</a> have indicated that the acquisition of akshara knowledge continues beyond Grade III in Malayalam and Grade IV in Kannada. However, there is a paucity of data beyond Grade IV in alphasyllabary languages, specifically in Kannada. Additionally, the studies in alphasyllabary have used a limited sample of aksharas out of a large registry, thus limiting the generalization of the findings. More importantly, the studies in alphasyllabaries have determined mastery by assessing the accuracy of akshara identification. However, fluent reading requires the speed with which the individual aksharas are retrieved from long-term memory. Hence, the speed with which akshara naming can be determined by measuring reaction time for individual aksharas. The speed along with accuracy in recognizing aksharas enables children to decode the words faster, thereby enhancing fluency in reading, resulting in improved comprehension. Hence the present study aimed to develop a comprehensive understanding of akshara knowledge acquisition by measuring both accuracy and reaction time in typically developing Kannada medium primary school children from Grade I to Grade VII within the age range of 5 years 6 months to 12 years 6 months.</p></div><div id=article1-body class=generated-article-body><h2 class=main-title id=d5071e303>Methods</h2><div class=section><a name=d5071e306 class=n-a></a><h3 class=section-title>Study design and setting</h3><p class="" id=d5071e311>The present research incorporated cross sectional study design with non-random convenient sampling method to recruit the participants.

The Paradigm Experiment software was programmed to present the individual aksharas randomly but in a fixed order for every participant with 3000ms onscreen stimulus duration and 2500ms inter-stimuli interval. The system was connected to a microphone, which recorded the participant’s vocal responses and provided the reaction time automatically in an Excel document. The reaction time was measured in milliseconds, and is defined as the total time elapsed between the presentation of akshara and the onset of the correct naming. Once the responses were recorded, the accuracy of the correct identification of aksharas was checked manually by listening to the response offline and noting down the corresponding reaction time for further statistical analysis. During the analysis, every accurate naming of aksharas was scored ‘1’ and ‘0’ for inaccurate naming. The reaction time was considered only for the correct responses. The calculated accuracy of the response and the corresponding reaction time were tabulated and subjected to statistical analysis.</p><p class="" id=d5071e684>The participants were made to sit comfortably in front of the laptop in a classroom with relatively low ambient noise with adequate illumination.

On post-hoc pair-wise multiple group comparison, it was observed that the mean performance of children in identifying Kannada aksharas improved significantly from Grade I through to Grade V and reached a plateau at Grade VI, indicating a steady improvement in children’s akshara identification scores. The results showed a developmental trajectory, where children mastered every level of representative aksharas gradually in each Grade, and completely acquired all levels of representative aksharas by Grade VI. These findings are in agreement with results obtained by <a href="#ref-13">Nag (2007)</a>, who reported that the acquisition of akshara knowledge goes beyond ten years of age (Grade IV). In alphabetical languages, like English, children are reported to master letter knowledge by Grade I (<a href="#ref-17">Seymour <i>et al.</i>, 2003</a>) due to the lower number of graphemes compared to alphasyllabary languages, which consists of an extensive number of graphemes and also requires the mastery of a large group of orthographic register and their ligaturing rules (<a href="#ref-13">Nag, 2007</a>). In alphabetic knowledge, the acquisition of letters of the alphabet takes place in a gradual manner, i.e. children learn the letters of the alphabet on the letter by letter basis, rather than learning the entire set at once. Therefore, young children are introduced initially to consonants followed by vowels, as consonants are more consistent in their sounds and hence can be quickly learned compared to vowels (<a href="#ref-22">Strickland, 1998</a>). The gradual, steady improvement in the identification of akshara can be attributed to the manner in which aksharas are taught in schools. Generally, aksharas are taught to children in a hierarchical manner where they are introduced to the aksharas based on the level of complexity, i.e. initially, children are introduced to primary vowels and consonant with inherent vowels, followed by consonants with vowel diacritics, and consonant clusters (<a href="#ref-12">Karanth &amp; Prakash, 1996</a>).</p><p class="" id=d5071e773>The findings of reaction time measurement from the present study revealed that the children from Grade I to IV took a significantly greater time to identify aksharas compared to Grades V, VI and VII, who took significantly less time. This implies that younger children took a significantly longer time in identifying aksharas compared to older groups. The reduction in reaction time can be described as developmental changes in the speed of information processing (<a href="#ref-8">Kail &amp; Salthouse, 1994</a>; <a href="#ref-10">Kail, 2008</a>). Studies report that increases in the speed of processing are correlated with age-related improvements in performance on a variety of cognitive tasks, including reading, memory, solving arithmetic problems, finding their way, and reasoning (<a href="#ref-9">Kail, 2004</a>; <a href="#ref-10">Kail, 2008</a>). Even though there was an increase with Grades, the performance of reaction time reached a plateau at Grade IV, and there was no significant difference noted in time taken to name aksharas above Grade IV. The occurrence of plateau in reaction time can be attributed to familiarity of the curricular material to which children are exposed frequently during primary school years. For example, most of the text introduced to Grade I children included words which are formed by primary vowels and consonant with inherent vowels, while in older grades, children are introduced with the words with diacritic markers and clusters, thus making them more familiar to those levels of complexity. As a result, children are more familiar with the aksharas which makes naming speech reach a constant level, but exploring and learning new aksharas continues across grades. Thus, automaticity in naming aksharas develops prior to akshara identification accuracy, which continues to develop above Grade IV and is mastered by Grade VI.</p></div><div id=article1-body class=generated-article-body><h2 class=main-title id=d5071e791>Conclusion</h2><p class="" id=d5071e794>Children learning to read alphasyllabary Kannada language gain mastery over majority of the aksharas during the first five years of formal schooling and this develops completely by Grade VI. The automaticity in naming akshara develops gradually and reaches a plateau by Grade IV itself. The present findings indicate that children acquire automaticity in naming akshara early, whereas the akshara knowledge continues to develop.</p></div><div id=article1-body class=generated-article-body><h2 class=main-title id=d5071e801>Data availability</h2><div class=section><a name=d5071e804 class=n-a></a><h3 class=section-title>Underlying data</h3><p class="" id=d5071e809>Harvard Dataverse: Akshara knowledge in Kannada language, <a target=xrefwindow href="https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/7TJIMS" id=d5071e811>https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/7TJIMS</a> (<a href="#ref-19">Shivananjappa, 2020</a>).</p><p class="" id=d5071e818>Data are available under the terms of the <a target=xrefwindow href="https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/" id=d5071e820>Creative Commons Zero "No rights reserved" data waiver</a> (CC0 1.0 Public domain dedication).</p></div></div><div id=article1-back class=generated-article-footer><div class=back-section><a name=d5071e829 class=n-a></a><span class="research-layout prime-recommended-wrapper reference-heading is-hidden"><span class=faculty-opinion-icon></span><span class="prime-red big">Faculty Opinions recommended</span></span><h2 class=main-title id=d5193>References</h2><div class="section ref-list"><a name=d5071e829 class=n-a></a><ul><li><a name=ref-1 class=n-a></a>&nbsp;<span class=citation><a name=d5071e833 class=n-a></a>Apel K: What is orthographic knowledge?
