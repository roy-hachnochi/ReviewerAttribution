This paper presents a new type of neural network where the transformation of each layer is conditioned on its input and its “depth” (computation path), generated from a very compact set of parameters. The network also can be viewed as a continuous generalization of neural decision graphs.  In my opinion, this is a novel and creative work. The B-spline embedding trick is clever and efficient. The model sizes and runtime operations compared to those of CNNs of similar accuracies are truly impressive. Overall, this is an accept. My suggestions for the authors to improve their (already good) paper are as follows. 1) Test on more recent CNN architectures (e.g. VGG, if ResNet is not feasible). 2) Include SOTA results (accuracies and model sizes) under all datasets (it’s okay for a novel work to be not always better). 3) Consider using more datasets (e.g. CIFAR100 & SVHN, if ImageNet is not feasible). 4) Consider using existing methods to regularize the utilization of the splines (e.g. normalization), instead of adding an extra technique (differentiable quantization) to the already dense manuscript.  (After rebuttal) I appreciate the authors’ feedback and have updated my score accordingly.
