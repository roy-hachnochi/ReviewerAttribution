This paper proposes a novel neural network module called a horizontal gated-recurrent unit. The authors motivate it via a nicely explained and referenced appeal to the neuroscience of visual cortex and the psychophysics of contour detection.  The proposed model is an extension of a convolutional GRU model to add long-range horizontal excitatory and inhibitory connections. One notable property is that it has fewer free parameters than other comparable models, this is nicely shown in Fig. 3C, a type of plot comparing approaches by their number of free parameters that I would be happy to see more frequently in NIPS papers.   I found this paper nicely constructed and convincing. I think this model could be useful in computational neuroscience as well as machine learning. I'm happy to recommend its publication at NIPS.  I have one question, it was mentioned in the human data section at the top of page 8 that humans, unlike the model, were sensitive to the length of the path. Do you think this indicates the model is doing something different from the way the humans are solving it? What about human reaction time, I suppose that it scales with the length of the path. This model has a notion of time, so it seems like such effects could be addressed with it. Do you think it would work, i.e. that you could model reaction time effects this way?   Minor: what is meant by "digitally extracted" in line 283 (near top of page 8)?
