The manuscript proposes a method for one-shot unsupervised cross domain translation by using a two-step process. The first step is to train a VAE for domain B, and the second step is to create a VAE for domain A using a sample in domain A. The experiments show that the proposed OST method perform similar with existing method with a lot of training samples in domain A. The problem itself is very interesting. Although the main idea is different from the existing methods UNIT and cycleGAN, the framework with VAE and GAN somehow follows UNIT and cycleGAN. The manuscript is overall well written, and the experimental results seems promising.  My major concerns are as follows. 1. The framework shown in figure 1 is not clearly demonstrated, and the model is not clear enough, either. The manuscript seems only give a very rough idea and many details are unknown. For example, how the shared and unshared layers are defined? In the first stepï¼ŒE_B, G_B,and D_B can be trained. How the trained E_B, G_B and D_B are used in the second stage? How the G^S,E^S, E_B^U, E_A^U,G_B^U,G_A^U are trained in the second stage?  2. In the experiments, how is the accuracy in figure 2 and table 1 defined? The accuracy values seem very low. Is there any explanation? 3. Intuitively, why does the proposed OST method outperform UNIT or cycleGAN? Where does the advantage come from?
