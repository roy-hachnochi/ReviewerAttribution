Summary: The authors propose and analyze an algorithm based on 1-class svm  for solving the mixed membership clustering problem. Both theoretical and empirical results are presented.  1. The paper is easy to read and technically sound. The presentation of the main idea is clear and convincing.  2. It would be helpful if the authors could provide some remarks on how to best interpret the results such as Theorem 3.1 and 3.2. For instance, which property dominates the error bound?  3. Since the recovery guarantee relies on row-wise error (in the non-ideal case), I wonder how outliers affect the performance.  4. I wonder how the algorithm performs when most members are almost pure, as in the non-overlapping case.  5. Some of the terms are not defined when they first appear in the paper. For example, kappa and lambda, also DCMMSB and OCCAM. Fixing these would improve the readability.
