The paper addresses the problem of fitting a subspace to data in cases where the underlying subspace is high-dimensional with respect to the ambient dimension, e.g., a 10-dimensional subspace in 11-dimensional ambient space, in the presence of outliers in data. The problem is also referred to as Dual Principal Component Pursuit (DPCP) in the literature. Recently, [17] has studied the problem, formulating it as finding a hyperplane normal vector $b$ so that for a dataset $X$, the vector $b^T X$ would be sparse, with nonzero elements indicating the outliers. The novelty of the paper is in the presentation of new and stronger theoretical results for the existing algorithm in [17] and a more efficient projected sub-gradient descent method (DPCP-PSGD) to solve the optimization in [17]. The paper demonstrates experiments for road plane detection from 3D data, showing improvement with respect to RANSAC.  + The paper is well-written and well-motivated. The review of the existing work in the area is comprehensive. The paper is well-structured and the technical results are explained well.  + The theoretical derivations and results in the paper are sound and provide stronger conditions for the success of DPCP, showing that the algorithm can tolerate up to $O(N^2)$ outliers, where $N$ indicates the number of inliers. This improves the existing results that guarantee success with $O(N)$ outliers.  + The proposed DPCP-PSGD, while quite standard, for the studied problem achieves improved computational time with respect to existing solvers. The paper also proves linear convergence for the proposed algorithm.  - Given that the setting of the experiment in the paper is to find 2D planes in 3D, to understand the effectiveness of the proposed method with respect to the state of the art, it is necessary that the paper provides comparison with more compelling baselines and state of the art other than RANSAC. In particular, the reviewer suggests comparing with "Robust PCA via Outlier Pursuit, H. Xu, C. Caramanis, S. Sanghavi" as well as [13] and [17], which all address the problem of handling outliers when fitting a subspace to data.
