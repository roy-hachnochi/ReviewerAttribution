I am not an expert on submodular optimization, I therefore only focussed on the convex optimization problem and the coordinate descent algorithm part.  Algorithm 1 is a way how to implement the standard coordinate descent algorithm when probabilities of choosing coordinates are coming from given distribution P.  the description of the algorithm is following the standard in the literature
