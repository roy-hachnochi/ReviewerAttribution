This paper investigates distributed K-means clustering with outlier detection, following a simultaneous communication setting in which data are partitioned across multiple sites. The method follows a standard two-level clustering. The first-level performs a summary of the local data set of each site. At the second level,  a coordinator performs clustering using all the summaries. The main contribution of this work is in constructing simple summaries at the sites, which runs in time O(max{k; log n} n), with n the size of the data set and k the maximum number of cluster prototypes. The authors report experiments on both real and synthetic data, showing competitive performances of the proposed algorithm.  The paper is clear and very well written. The experiments are comprehensive. The approach is simple, which is good. It is, therefore, fast. Several of the existing algorithms, which provide approximation guarantee in the same setting, require high-order polynomial time (quadratic or higher in n). This makes the proposed algorithm quite practical for large-scale data set. Having said that, I am not very familiar with the literature in these distributed and simultaneous communication settings. So, in summary, if there is no competing method in the literature with similar or lower complexity, then this is a nice work that tackles an important problem (definitely worth publication). Apart from this, I do not have any serious concern about the submission.   Opinion after rebuttal: The author response is convincing to me and there is consensus among the reviewers that the paper is interesting. I am keeping my initial score.
