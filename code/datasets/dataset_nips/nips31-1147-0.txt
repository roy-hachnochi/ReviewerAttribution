I have read the author response. Thank you.    This paper improves upon existing works by showing global optimality of approx second order stationary points under mild assumptions.  This is important in theory and practice both, since finite precision allows only approximate solutions. A study for the special case of phase cut is also presented.  The paper is very notation heavy but clearly written and easy to follow. I have gone through the main proofs. The empirical section is insignificant but this is mainly a theory paper, so I'll vote for acceptance.
