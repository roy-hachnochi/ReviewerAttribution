This paper studies the connection between an SDP and its nonconvex QP equivalent based on Burer-Monteiro low-rank factorization. The authors analyzed how an approximate SOSP of the QP reformulation approximates the optimal solution of the original SDP. The results are important for our understanding of the Burer-Monteiro approach.   In general, I found this is a good paper. One possible drawback is that the authors didn't discuss how to find an approximate SOSP for the QP. Moreover, in the numerical tests, it is better to show how the approximate SOSP is obtained and whether it is close to the optimal solution to the SDP or not.
