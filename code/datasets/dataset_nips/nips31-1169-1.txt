This paper focuses on short and sparse blind deconvolution problems. A nonconvex optimization approach is proposed to solve blind deconvolution, and its landscape is analyzed in details. Some experiments are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach, and to support the theoretical analysis.  Strength:  1. The paper is well organized with detailed derivations and explanations on key ideas (e.g., derivation of nonconvex optimization problem and local geometry analysis); 2. Such a nonconvex optimization approach and its landscape analysis are novel and interesting. Moreover, the technical content of the paper appears to be correct albeit some small mistakes.  Weakness:  The paper appears to be technically sound, but the experiments are limited without much explanation. Since the paper is partially inspired by [16], a comparison may be included to further illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

The letter $m$ stands for two quantities simultaneously: the dimension of the observed signal y and the number of samples; 2. The words font does not follow the standard NIPS template; 3. Figures may be enlarged, since some content and axes are hardly readable.
