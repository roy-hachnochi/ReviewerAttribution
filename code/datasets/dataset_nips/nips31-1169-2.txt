This paper considered short and sparse blind deconvolution problem and proposed to maximize the ||x||_4^4 norm that kind of promotes sparsity and at the same time, is differentiable. The main result is to analyze the geometry of the resultant nonconvex optimization problem and show that every local optimum is close to some shift truncation of the ground truth.  This paper has many overloading notations which make the paper not easy to follow, but overall it is well written. Compared to the main reference [16], this paper utilized a somewhat novel objective function, and the main results for geometrical analysis have less assumptions compared to that in [16].
