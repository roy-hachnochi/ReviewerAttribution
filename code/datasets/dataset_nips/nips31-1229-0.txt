This work proposes a new way to learn modular networks, i.e., multiple networks for different tasks, and a controller that assigns tasks to networks. The authors propose a Viterbi-EM algorithm to learn the model parameters. The presentation is clear and the technical part seems to be correct. One consideration I has is the experiments. While modular networks should work best on very large datasets, this paper only presents experiments on small datasets (language modeling only has 0.9 million words, and image classification is just cifar10). There is no evidence on how the proposed model work on very large datasets.
