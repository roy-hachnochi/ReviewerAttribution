Summary:   This paper considers a Bayesian private learning problem, where the learner tries to estimate a point in an interval via a sequence of queries (with binary response) while protecting the information about the actual point from an adversary who could observe the queries (not the responses). The main contribution of the paper is deriving a lower bound on the query complexity. They observe that the sample complexity grows linearly with the privacy parameter L (as eps ->0). They also show that the lower bound is, in fact, tight by formally proving an upper bound for an existing algorithm for this problem. For the proof, they use the standard tools in (information theoretic) minimax lower bound analysis, along with a specialized discrete approximation of the original continuous problem.   Comments:  The paper provides a concrete theoretical statement on Bayesian private learning.   The paper is well organized with a clear introduction, motivation, and problem statement. The proofs seem to be technically correct as well. Authors have given clear insights into the capacity of the problem.
