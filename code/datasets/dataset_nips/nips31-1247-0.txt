Post rebuttal  Thank the authors for the clarification. One minor point I realised is the equation between line 144 and 145. Is this constraint really a disjunction over partitions? If there is at least one partition the given state doesn't belong to, it would be always true because at least one of inner propositions will be true, wouldn't it?  ------------------------------------------------ This paper proposed a policy extraction algorithm, Viper, which learns a decision tree policy imitating the given oracle (e.g. DNN policy). The trained decision tree policy allows for its verification in terms of, more specifically, correctness, stability and robustness.  Viper imitates the given oracle policy using its internal sub-algorithm, Q-Dagger, which extends Dagger (Ross et al., 2011). Q-Dagger addresses two limitations of Dagger, such as 1) its tendency to output too large decision tree than necessary and 2) its lack of consideration of actions’ long-term effects (e.g. via Q-value). The first point is empirically proven in the cart-pole benchmark (Figure 4(c)) showing Viper results in much smaller decision trees than Dagger at the same level of reward. The second is achieved by a new loss function based on negative advantage w.r.t. the given policy (\tilde l_t(s,\pi)), and resampling dataset in proportion to its extreme (\tilde l_t(s)) if this reviewer is not mistaken.  The benefits of decision tree policy are explained in Section 3, and demonstrated in the experiment section, on Pong and Cart-Pole environments.  Quality  The paper is well written and appears technically sound, but some technical details are not clear (see Clarity section)  Clarity  One issue with Q-Dagger is that the proof for Theorem 2.2 doesn’t look clear enough as it simply relies on the proof of Theorem 4.2 in (Ross et al. 2011). Although Q-Dagger is a variant of Dagger with the new loss function and a fixed $\beta$, the readers who are not very familiar with this might get confused easily. What’s the benefit of the hinge loss in regret? Also, it would be great to discuss how the heuristics introduced to Viper impact this theoretical result.  Minor concerns - Is this theoretical result applicable to continuous state space? - Line 353: In the second line of the equation, $V^{(\pi)}_{t+1}$ -> $V^{(\pi*)}_{t+1}$. - Citation for Reluplex is missing.  Originality and significance  Overall it looks a nice contribution. A new algorithm for extracting decision tree policies is proposed with tighter bound, and its effectiveness in verification is demonstrated.
