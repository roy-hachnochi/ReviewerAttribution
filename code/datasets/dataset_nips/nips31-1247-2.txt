This paper uses policy extraction/distillation to describe a complex policy in terms of a decision tree. Given the tree, the paper then can prove properties w.r.t. correctness (given a model of the environment), stability, and robustness.  The idea of providing provably correct policies is very appealing for reasons that the paper describes well. However, it's not clear to me that this paper takes a critical step in this direction. In particular, the correctness property is most compelling, and it requires a full model of the environment (which typically will not be available in real-world domains).   It's not clear to me w.r.t. the correctness counterexample found for the toy pong controller  1) If it was "obvious" that changing the paddle length fixed the counter example, 2) Why changing the paddle length was preferable to changing the policy, and 3) If it was possible that additional counterexamples existed.  -----  Typos I found: Verifying correcntess which are a very good near the origin  ---------------- Post-Rebuttal  After reading the other reviews and the authors' rebuttal I have moved my score slightly up. I am still hesitant to recommend acceptance because I had trouble understanding some parts of the paper (section 3 was pretty far out of my area) and because it's not clear to me how well this will apply to real-world problems. If the other reviewers are confident in their understanding of the validation section, I would not be opposed to accepting, particularly since I believe this work is reasonably novel.
