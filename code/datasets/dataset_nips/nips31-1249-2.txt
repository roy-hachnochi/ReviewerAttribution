This paper continues a last year NIPS paper regarding volume sampling for the regression problem. It improved and somewhat completes the last result by showing the the original method may get sup-optimal results and then establishing a variant of the volume sampling so it’s will not suffer from this kind of pitfalls while maintaining the benefits of volume sampling (especially the unbiased). Along the way the paper uses a new “Determinantal rejection sampling” method and a few mathematical results which may be of independent interest. Overall the paper is well written
