This paper deals with the problem of active learning using random trees for the case of regression. The approach proposes a technique for selecting candidate points for updating the trees, which can be a standard random tree or a Mondrian tree. The approach is tested on the simulation and real data.  In general, I enjoyed reading this paper. It is nicely written, with very clear statements and thorough analysis. The structure of the paper is clear making it quite easy to read and follow. The contribution of this paper is mainly on the  theoretical side, while providing very nice insights. On the practical side, it is not clear how useful this proposed approach would be.  First, learning a regression function using trees might not be the best thing to do. Due to the tree properties, generalization on unknown data points might be difficult. Especially, when doing prediction, jumping between different leaves might result into non-smooth behavior, limiting the usage of this kind of approach. Secondly, it might scale badly with dimensions. Furthermore, it is not clear to me how robust this kind of approach towards noise is. These might explain the sub-optimal results when going for real-world data, as shown by the evaluation, where the proposed active learning does not performed better than the random selection scheme.
