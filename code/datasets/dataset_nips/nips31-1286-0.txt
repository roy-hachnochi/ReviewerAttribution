The authors formulated a multiarmed bandit problem over a given causal structure. The arms of the bandits are interventions of the observed variables (excl. reward) to certain specific values. The causal structure is assumed to be known, but parameters are not. The authors show that only arms corresponding to possibly optimal minimal intervention set are worth considering. Such sets can be efficiently enumerated by their algorithm. When previous algorithms use these sets, they make optimal decision earlier in different MAB scenarious.   The paper is written very clearly, I did not check the details of the proofs but the theory seems valid. The presented problem seems a sensible one, although I am not sure how realistic knowing the causal structure in this scenario is. It certainly builds on previous (causal) MABs. The restriction to POMIS seems valid theoretical contribution. On the whole the paper presents an interesting and worthwhile contribution, further research along these lines is to be expected.  The important example on l 46 seems to require as specific parametrization: please add a reference to it to the main text.
