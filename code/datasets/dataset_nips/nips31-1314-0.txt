In this paper, the authors provide an algorithm for learning a fair contextual bandit model while learning the distance function inherent in individual fairness.  This paper is primarily interesting in that specifying the distance metric is a core difficulty in making use of individual fairness.  By enabling the distance metric to be learned through feedback as the model learns presents a way forward for individual fairness.  However, in order to do this, the paper needs to make strong assumptions for the theory to work: the distance metric is a Mahalanobis metric (a possibly reasonable assumption) and a linear model (a much more restrictive assumption).  Because of these assumptions, I doubt that this work will be useful in practice in the near future.  However, the theoretical results I believe are valuable as a step in the right direction for making individual fairness practical.
