The authors study the problem of correcting for individual fairness in an adversarial online learning problem when the fairness constraints depend on an unknown similarity metric between the items. This captures the setting in which a quantitative fairness metric over individuals cannot be pre-specified, but is clear a posteriori. The problem is crucial as it the setting of unknown similarities is extremely natural, and keeping the objective separate from the optimization goal seems often appropriate. They show that optimal fair decisions can be efficiently learned, even in this setting that does not have the direct knowledge of the fairness metric. The setting and approach seem appropriate, and the paper opens up many interesting directions for future work.   The discussion of the related work in the supplementary material was great and I think crucial to situate this work -- I hope room can be made in the final version for it in the main body. To this I would just add two additional papers which also deal with different notions of fairness in online learning settings (https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.01875 and https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.08674).
