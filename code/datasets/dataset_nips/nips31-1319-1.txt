The paper investigate a decomposition of the ELBO for the training of variational autoencoder that exposes a Total Correlation term, a term that penalizes statistical dependences between latent variables. The authors argue that this term is the important one for achieve disentangled latent variables for instance in the beta-VAE. To support their proposal they develop a minibatch-weighted sampling scheme that allows them to easily modify the weight of the Total Correlation term, resulting in what they call beta-TCVAE. In addition, in order to compare their model to previous models in the literature such as the beta-VAE and InfoGAN, they introduce a new metric to quantify the amount of disentanglement of latent variables, a general quantity that can be efficiently estimated that they call Mutual Information Gap (MIG). Both the the new minibatch estimator to train the objective based on the Total Correlation penalty, and the new disentanglement metric seem novel and significant advancements in the field. Besides explaining the way the beta-VAE works, the new beta-TCVAE model consistently outperforms it in terms of the trade-off between density estimation and disentanglement on several benchmarks, such as dSprites, and 3d Faces.
