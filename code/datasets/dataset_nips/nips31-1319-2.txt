The paper continues the line of work that aims to decompose the variational lower bound of VAEs and try to isolate the component that can be tuned to improve disentanglement in the latent space. Here the authors argue for a particular decomposition that leads to a total correlation term and shows better disentanglement by tuning this term.  Strengths: 1. As the authors note, a similar formulation appeared in FactorVAE, but stochastic approximation could be much easier to train than the additional discriminator network used in the later.  2. The approach is better in terms of the tradeoff between reconstruction and disentanglement.  3. The paper is well written and does a good job of covering related work.   Weakness/Questions: 1. The authors should comment on the limitations of the Mutual Information Gap metric. Could there be any stability issues in estimating this?  2. Is the metric reliable in cases where ground truth factors are correlated?  3. Are there more compelling reasons to use this approach compared to FactorVAE?  Post Rebuttal Comments: I thank the authors for the discussion on the MI metric and providing other clarifications. I hope these are included in the main body of the paper.
