This submission may contain some important results, but I did not see clear motivation to consider these losses (only the second paragraph in the Introduction, which is not very convincing). And, it is not clear why new algorithms are needed. I understand that this submission is theoretical, but it would be good to mention some potential applications or when and where we should use these new losses and the new algorithms.
