This paper proposes a novel method to find local minima of smooth non-convex functions. Specifically, the proposed method utilizes the Hessian information to help avoid saddle points.  Overall, the idea is novel and it is presented very clearly.   My only question is how to set the parameter \sigma in Algorithm 1 and L_2 in Algorithm 2 in practical  applications.  For feedback: In the feedback, the author has given a method to select these two parameters. So, I will keep my rating. At last, it is recommended that the author can discuss how to select these parameters in the final version.
