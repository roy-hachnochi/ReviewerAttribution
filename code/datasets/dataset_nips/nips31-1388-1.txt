The authors present an algorithm for approximate inference in exponential family models over the bases of a given matroid.  In particular, the authors show how to leverage standard variational methods to yield a provable approximation to the log partition function of certain restricted families.  This is of interest as 1) these families can be difficult to handle using standard probabilisitic modeling approaches and 2) previous bounds derived from variational methods do not necessarily come with performance guarantees.  General comments:  Although the approach herein would be considered variational approximation methods, the term variational inference is more commonly used for a related but different optimization problem.  There are lots of other variational approaches that yield provable upper/lower bounds on the partition function.  Some effort should be made to cite these.
