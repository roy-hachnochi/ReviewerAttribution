Quality: This paper shows a reasonable technical framework. The main idea of this approach is well supported by benchmarks and some comparisons with other methods. Both tests and results are conclusive in the experiments. Extra information and an interactive demo are also presented for visualization results.  Clarity: Overall, the document is properly written, however it has some inconclusive paragraphs. Such as in section 2 - “Related Work”, where three groups of previous works are introduced, but the authors do not show conclusive ideas about the direct link between the related methods and the proposed one. Furthermore, cross-references in some figures can be improved with a more explicit reference. (line 221: “As shown in the table ...”; line 257: “In this demo ...”.)    Originality: The proposed method is a novel combination of well-known techniques. Some differences are presented between the proposed approach and some similar methods, Pix2PixHD and Context Encoder.  Significance:  The presented method shows plausible results in both extra provided information and an interactive demo, nevertheless the current results show a slight improvement.
