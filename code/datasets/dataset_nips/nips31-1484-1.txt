The authors introduce a strategy for continuous-time value function approximation based on RKHS.  Thus, an operator is proposed to relate two different RKHSs aiming to find a one-to-one correspondence between unobservable and observable output spaces. As seen in the theoretical analysis,  unobservable vectors can be estimated as a convex combination of kernels. Also, barrier-certified policy updates are coupled through quadratic programming. Practical validation includes the inclusion of GPs and kernel adaptive filters to model the observable outputs, testing them on an inverted pendulum and a planer point-mass simulations.  The theoretical derivations are complemented in the supplementary material (derivations in the paper are difficult to follow and/or incomplete in different sections), especially, those related to the practical implementation using a Gaussian kernel.  The experimental results could be enhanced to make clear the virtues of the paper. So, a suitable comparison with state-of-art approaches could be included.
