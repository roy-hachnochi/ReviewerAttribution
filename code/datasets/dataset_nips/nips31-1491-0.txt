This paper proposes a bandit model where the actions can be decomposed into the Cartesian product of atomic actions. It generalizes rank-1 bandits, relates their framework to combinatorial and contextual bandits and results in better bounds in the dueling bandit setting. Simple synthetic experiments show this framework indeed leads to better regret in practice. The theoretical bounds are reasonable, although some intuition explaining the bounds would be helpful.  1. Please consider moving the experiments to the main paper.  2. Please compare the performance of your algorithm (with possibly higher rank since you can incorporate it) to rank-1 bandits in real-world experiments proposed in that paper. This will make the paper much stronger.  3. Please formally characterize and compare the computational complexity of your algorithm to the elimination based algorithms.  4. Lines 127 - 130: Please explain this better.  *** After Rebuttal  *** I have gone through the other reviews and the author response. And my opinion remains unchanged.
