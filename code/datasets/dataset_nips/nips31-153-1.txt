The paper proposes a new approach to drawing a sequence of samples for Monte Carlo estimation. The method is motivated from optimal transport theory and the authors develop theoretical properties of the sampling algorithm in great detail. An interesting results are established in relation to quasi Monte Carlo samples as well as for evolution strategies gradient estimator.   Frankly, I am not very familiar with optimal transport theory so I approached the paper as a student would in order to make sense of section 2. It took me some time to parse it all but at the end of the day, I think the theory is presented in a logical fashion. However, I have not yet fully understood the implication of theorem 2.10. I think this theorem is the one that gave rise to algorithm 2, which aims to generate orthogonal to samples (from $\eta$). However, it does not seem like the samples generated according to Algorithm 2 are guaranteed to be generated from $\mu^*$ (where $\mu^*$ is a solution to $K$-optimal coupling) because Theorem 2.10 states that if you have samples from $\mu^*$, then it satisfies the orthogonality. It would be helpful to provide a bit on the connection between Algorithm 2 and Theorem 2.10.  Section 3 establishes result for discrepancy of the samples generated. Seciont 4 establishes concentration inequalities for the evolution strategy gradient estimator, which has practical implications in reinforcement learning problems. The experiments are carried are interesting.  Minor comments:  Line 131: Definition 3 -> Definition 2.2 or Equation (3)?  More explanation behind the video library experiments in the Appendix would be helpful. It was not obvious what I should be looking for in these videos.
