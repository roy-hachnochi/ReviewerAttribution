Paper presents an algorithm, TUCRL for efficient exploration-exploitation balance in weakly communicating MDPs. It is claimed that for weakly communicating MDPs no algorithm can achieve logarithm regret without first encountering linear regret for a time that is exponential in the parameters of the MDP.  Authors also point out a mistake in the proof of REGAL [3].   The results of this paper are exciting, however, it is a difficult paper to parse.  There are many symbols and they are not centrally defined which makes reading this paper an unpleasant experience. I would suggest the authors include a table/chart that the reader can refer to know what different symbols stand for.   Some other comments: (a) The abstract starts off by saying it is not possible to achieve some states in Mountain car -- it will be good to a give a few examples of it in the text/supplementary materials.   (b) Line 302-303: a proof of Lemma 6 is provided in supp. materials, the use of language such as "seems straightforward to adapt", "SCAL probably satisfies 2" is unwarranted. Either SCAL satisfies or it doesnot -- not sure why authors use the langauge that makes the reader belief that SCAL maynot satisfy 2 etc. Please revise the language and be precise.   (c) It would be good to see the results of the proposed method on more tasks such as mountain car, that the authors allude to.   I am not an expert in finding bounds for RL algorithms, but the results look exciting and proofs appear to be correct (I did not verify all lines of all proofs). The reason I have given this paper is a lower rating is because it is not easy to read the paper.
