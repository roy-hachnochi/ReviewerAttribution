Clarity - the paper is very well written and clear Originality - the paper is original; the results of paper extend the ongoing (and exciting) work of statistically testing differences between networks. Quality - strong theoretical paper.  The underlying assumption of the IER model is a bit simplistic as all edges are assumed conditionally independent. That being the case, the tests arguably do not capture differences in say the number of triangles or the clustering present in two networks. I believe the work is useful, but certainly more needs to be done in the context of more realistic graph structures.    Significance - the problem of testing differences in networks is an important and challenging problem. I agree with the authors that this is particularly apparent in the applications like EEG and fMRI when one wants to decide whether the network models of the brain of two individuals are statistically different. I think that this work is useful and provides some intuition as to how to test differences between more sophisticated graph models; however, overall I think that the analysis of the IER model is a bit simplistic.
