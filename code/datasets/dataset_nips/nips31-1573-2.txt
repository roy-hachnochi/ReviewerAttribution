This article studies the general problem of minimizing a loss functional on the space of measures. Specifically, the article provides sufficient conditions for the convergence of the Wasserstein gradient flow to converge to the global optimum. The results are derived under fairly general conditions which include specific applications of significant interest to the community. The paper is very well written--- the problem is motivated carefully, and the results are presented in a compelling fashion. The mathematical ideas used in the proofs are quite challenging, and might be useful in other related areas of research. I sincerely believe that the problem studied in the paper is of significant interest to this community. The authors support their results with numerical simulations.  The statements of Theorem 3.3 and 3.5 assume convergence of the Wasserstein flows. The authors remark on the sufficient conditions for the aforementioned convergence in the supplementary material--- I suggest the authors move some/ all of this remark to the main article. It would be extremely insightful if the authors could at least provide guarantees for convergence of the Wasserstein flow in any specific application.
