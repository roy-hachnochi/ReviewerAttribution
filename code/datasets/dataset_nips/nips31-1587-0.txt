This paper tackles the task of event captioning in videos. Traditional event captioning methods follow “localization and captioning” schema, while this paper proposes to nest them together and optimized in an iterative fashion. While the former needs segment-wise caption annotation, the later only needs video-wise sentences annotation, thus, a weakly supervised learning is achieved. Based on proposed a novel fixed-point iteration algorithm, the experimental results on ActivityNet Captions dataset achieves somewhat comparable results as supervised alternatives. This paper is clearly written, with minor typos exist. In general, it is easy to follow.  Strengths: The idea solving dense event captioning as a weakly supervise problem by intertwist sentence localization and captioning is novel. This potentially helps to reduce annotation cost.  Weaknesses:  1) The implementation of l_θ1 and g_θ2 are stacked by multiple neural layers, which not naturally satisfy the local-Lipschitz-continuity in Proposition 1 (As it mentioned in line 136-137). The author proposed to smooth the mapping by add Gaussian noise to training data. But I don’t see how this trick can guarantee the satisfaction. Thus, there’s risk of non-converging iteration.   2) Why l_θ1 and g_θ2 satisfy Lipschitz constant L<1? The sentence “if the initial start S(0) surrounds … sufficiently” in Proposition 1 is a little bit vague.  3) The proposed method stands on an important assumption that there’s a one-to-one correspondence of caption sentence and temporal segment in video. This mainly relates to what data is used during experiments. Thus, it would be worthwhile to show some evidence why this assumption is valid.  4) During test time, a random initial point is needed.
