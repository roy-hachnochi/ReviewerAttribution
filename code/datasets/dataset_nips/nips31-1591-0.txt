 The paper revisits the SOGBOFA heuristic planning algorithm. It shows that SOGBOFA can be viewed as running belief propagation conditions on the actions. Based on this, a novel Marginal MAP (MMAP) solver is presented. The idea is to reduce the MMAP problem to maximum expected utility such that SOGBOFA can be employed for solving the problem.   Overall, the direction of using algebraic expressions in planning is of great interest. Moreover, the present paper is the first, to my knowledge, that tackles MMAP using algebraic computations, at least the way presented. However, the paper is missing some related approaches. For instance,   Martin Mladenov, Vaishak Belle, Kristian Kersting: The Symbolic Interior Point Method.  AAAI 2017: 1199-1205  also makes use of algebraic computations for planning problem. Moreover, interior point solvers have been used (within) MMAP approaches. While not quite there, it is very much related and should be discussed. Also, the authors should clarify the connection to   H. Cui and R. Khardon, Lifted Stochastic Planning, Belief Propagation and Marginal MAP, The AAAI-18 Workshop on Planning and Inference, held with the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI), 2018   While indeed the NIPS 2018 policy allows resubmissions of workshop papers, this only holds for non-archival workshops. AAAI workshops often have proceedings hosted by AAAI Press. As far as I see it, the present paper goes significantly beyond that paper.   In any case, the main contribution, namely the reduction to MMAP to MEU in combination with SOGBOFA is interesting. It is triggered by a known reduction. However, the known reduction had to be modified in a non-trivial way in order to apply to SOGBOFA. This variant of the reduction is interesting, and the empirical results show that the resulting AGS is a valid alternative to SOTA, in particular on hard summation problems. I really enjoyed reading the paper and expect that it will receive a lot of attention.
