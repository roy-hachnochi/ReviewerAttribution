 This paper proposed to train deep networks for image denoising based on Monte-Carlo Stein's unbiased risk estimator (MC-SURE). The advantage is that the proposed MC-SURE based method enables training deep denoising networks without noiseless ground truth data. Experiments show that the proposed MC-SURE based method achieves comparable denoising performance for Gaussian noise to the same denoisers that are trained with noiseless ground truth data. Although the idea is very attractive, there are some problems to be clarified in the paper. 1) A curly brace is missing in the equation (14). 2) There is an error in Fig. 1, which is not clear and confusing. 3) The proposed method only works for Gaussian noise case with known standard variance, which is a very strong limitation. How about other types of noise? To make the whole method more practical, how about dealing with the noisy image data with unknown standard variance?  4) From Eq. (14), it is obvious that the proposed MC-SURE based method is dependent on the standard variance of Gaussian noise, i.e. sigma. In the experiments, each sigma needs training one network. Is it possible to train one network for several noise levels based MC-SURE? 5) For natural images, the author just sets epsilon to be a fixed. I suggest plotting the sensitivity figure of epsilon for different noise levels, so that the authors can understand the effect of epsilon. 6) In addition to 25, 50, 75, the results of other noise levels should be provided, such as 5, 10, 15.
