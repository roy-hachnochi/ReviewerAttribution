This paper discusses alg evaluation, mostly in the context of adversarial learning. I have done a bit of work in the former area, but am no an expert in the latter.  The main contribution is the anti-symmetric decomposition that allows using Nash equilibria. The authors use this method to improve the ELO rating, I liked the trick in using the logit-space transformation. The authors do  a nice analysis of paper-rock. They give a good argument why ELO does not work.    The discussion on intransitiv abilities: two players is ok, but can you call something intransitive a ranking?  4.1 should be the highlight of the paper, but I found it very vague, a bit like trying to understand quicksort from its type. Prop 4 deserves more. I really missed some info on computing NE at this point.  Yes, it's great to have detail in the extra sections, but they should be an appendix  Last, its important to have lofty goals, but the paper starts by claiming to address Q1-Q3. I would suggest either focusing the Intro on the task, or connecting back to the qs.  In general, very nice work, but do consider discussing more your contribution and avoid sidetracks at the speed of light.
