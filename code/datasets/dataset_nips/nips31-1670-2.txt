The authors present a complex valued deep convolutional network to invert the distortion effects induced by optical fibres when transmitting images. A potentially interesting dataset of images distorted by optical fibre transmission is presented for future benchmarking of algorithms trained on this task. An orthogonality regularizer for the complex convnet is presented that is shown to outperform simple l2 weight regularization. While I am not familiar with the field of application (optic fibre transmission of images), I think this paper presents a well presented and executed solution, demonstrating significant benefits of complex parameterization.  My only concerns with this work are the lack of ablations. Since the real valued network appears to fail catastrophically, a small search over architectures with different forms of regularization besides L2 would make the point about complex parameterization stronger. Also, it was unclear to me from reading the introduction and related work if solutions to this problem have been presented by signal processing community in the past and how the methods presented compare to them.
