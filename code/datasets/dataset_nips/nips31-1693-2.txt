This paper presents a method to perform hyperparameter tunning and model selection for autoML based on Bayesian optimization. The novelty relies in the use of collaborative filtering within the surrogate model to transfer knowledge between different datasets and pipelines. The idea is simple, but really interesting for practical applications. I can see how this method is used in practice, with the only limitation being the vast cost of running such large number of ML pipelines with different datasets.       The paper is clearly written and easy to follow, although the title can be misleading. The rest of the paper seems to focus on the multi-task component of the contribution -which I personally find more interesting- that on the high dimensionality of the input. Besides, this is not a paper about general high-dimensional BO, because the collaborative filtering part, at least in the form it is presented in the paper, is limited to autoML applications. Although the idea could be extended to other applications, the transference (ironically) would not be trivial and depending on the application.       The experiments justify the proposed method. The figures are sometimes hard to read, even zooming the PDF. It seems that the authors are using bitmaps instead of vectorial images. ---- I agree with other reviewers that the paper is a combination of existing methodologies. However, it is new and sound within the context of Bayesian optimization and the application seems very strong for the autoML community. Thus, I believe this paper is interesting for the NIPS community.
