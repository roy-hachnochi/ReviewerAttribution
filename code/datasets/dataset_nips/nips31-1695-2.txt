The goal of this paper is to introduce a new acceleration strategy for randomized coordinate descent (RCD) methods. This is achieved by taking the standard coordinate directions and `enriching' them with a few spectral or conjugate directions. The authors specifically consider the problem stated in (1), which is the minimization of a quadratic function involving a symmetric and positive definite matrix (so the optimal solution is unique). RCD applied to (1) is described in Algorithm 3, Stochastic Spectral Descent (SSD) is described in Algorithm 2, and complexity results for both algorithms are given. The main point that the authors stress is that for RCD, the complexity result depends upon the problem conditioning, whereas for SSD the complexity result is independent of conditioning and depends only on the problem dimension.     The SSD algorithm, is theoretically interesting, but is impractical. With this in mind, the authors describe a practical algorithm called Spectral Stochastic Coordinate Descent (SSCD) that uses just a few spectral directions in addition to the standard coordinate directions, and provides a complexity result for SSCD, stating that the algorithm converges linearly. Numerical results are also given to show the practical performance of the algorithm.  The paper is clear, well organized, and while it only focuses on a specific problem (quadratic minimization) the treatment is thorough. (And the authors explain that they have restricted their attention to this case because they already have enough to say on this topic, but that extensions to other cases have been considered and that work is ongoing.) I believe that this paper will be of  interest to the NIPS community.
