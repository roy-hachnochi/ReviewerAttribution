The work proposed a new boosting variational inference algorithm, which removes the restrictions of the bounded support and avoid returning the degenerated distributions. In this way, the proposed framework allows users to design any variational family and to use the existing black-box VI software. The algorithm is examined by both simulations and practical applications.    This is a piece of solid work. It significantly advances boosting variational inference framework, including relaxing the sufficient conditions of convergence, giving convergence rate, proposing residual ELBO, stopping criterion using duality gap, etc. Can the code be shared?
