This is a very well-written paper on density estimation, measured in the L1 - or total variation - sense. It addresses a surprising gap in the litterature, and shows the subtle differences between density learning for this problem and other versions such as nonparametric density learning for smooth densities, or learning the parameters of a mixture of Gaussians.  The approach is, to my knowledge, original and correct. This is significant for the theoretical understanding of this problem, and this is a very sophisticated approach to do so.
