This paper presents an algorithm for efficient pruning in robust isotonic regression. The authors present the method and some theoretical results about the complexity of the algorithms .  The algorithm is based on combining ideas from branch-and-bound and the scaling algorithm with the dynamic programming approach.   The paper is well written and methods are sufficiently detailed.  Although more examples and justifications of the decision could help an inexpert reader to follow the paper.   The authors expose that their algorithm is able to obtain good results with lower complexity with respect to related methods. Are there any disadvantage associated to this improvement in resources?  A discussion about this could be useful.  Section 4 (empirical observations) should be improved. It could be interesting to see the performance of similar algorithms as well as other settings in the experiments .
