This paper develops algorithms for isotonic regression with non-convex objectives, generalising the usual Euclidean distance. The main idea is to approximate the optimal solution through the use of a set of grid points, and then successively pruning those.   I think the work is solid and sound but perhaps of interest to a fairly limited audience only.   A few typos:   Last sentence of Section 1: "the works by Bach Bach ... applies"  Caption of Fig.2: the second "convex" should be "concave".
