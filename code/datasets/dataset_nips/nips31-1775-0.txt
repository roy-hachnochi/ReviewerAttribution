This paper analyzes a (noisy) zero-order version of the conditional gradient algorithm for both convex and non-convex optimization, and provides bounds on the number of function queries and linear optimization calls that are needed to provide an epsilon-optimal solution, showing that these match the rates of conventional gradient-type algorithms. The algorithm itself is a variant of Nesterov’s smoothing technique (a variant of which dates back to Nemirovsky and Yudin ‘83) used within an outer loop that implements CG with linear optimization calls. They also analyze the “high-dimensional” case where the function only depends on a few of its coordinates, and show improved rates under milder assumptions, showing that there exists come implicit regularization of using conditional gradient updates in this setting.  Overall, I liked the paper, and think that the interaction between zero-order optimization and CG updates deserves more attention. The main contribution in terms of algorithm performance seems to be in the high-dimensional regime, and the implicit regularization phenomenon is interesting. The proofs seem more or less correct, but could use some polishing. Given that this is the case, I think the paper meets the quality standard of the conference, and merits publication.  A couple of comments: 1. The result of [30] should be added to the table in the introduction. 2. While the table serves most of this purpose, it would be good to have a more detailed comparison with related work, especially in the high-dimensional setting.
