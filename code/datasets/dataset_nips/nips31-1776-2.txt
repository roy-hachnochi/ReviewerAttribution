The authors consider the audio source separation problem in a scenario, where they have access to multiple pairs of omni-directional microphones. They assume that the environment is anechoic, and develop an algorithm that can detect the position of the sources in the environment. A generative model is proposed where a random variable is assigned to each time-frequency-source-space point (the space is partitioned into a grid). The separation is performed by finding source-dependent masks in the STFT domain.   I think the anechoic environment assumption is not realistic (outdoors recordings are not affected by reverberation, but they usually contain wind noise), and this  significantly reduces the relevance of the proposed formulation/algorithm. In addition, I think the model is rather delicate (assigning a variable for each position in the spatial grid, for instance), which may possibly lead to robustness issues. (The authors also note that the model is fairly sensitive to initialization.)  Overall, I think the paper is interesting for its abstract model/algorithm, however, I don't think the considered scenario would be very useful in practice.
