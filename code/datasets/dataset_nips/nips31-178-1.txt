I have two main concerns with this paper: - the first is on the significance of the result itself. Namely, I agree that provided the definition of what the authors want to capture, then the quantity introduced (adversarial VC dimension) is natural; while the proofs are relatively straightforward, mimicking the non-adversarial VC counterpart, this is not necessarily a bad thing. (Technical or hard is not synonymous of quality.) My issue is rather with the premise itself, as exemplified in Definition 1: after this definition, it is said "Then, learning is possible if [...] L_P(\hat{h})- L_P(h*)-> 0."  My feeling is that this sentence is misleading. Learning, in a non-trivial way, is possible when L_P(\hat{h})- L_P(h*)-> 0 AND L_P(h*) is small. Otherwise, without the latter condition (say, if it is 1), then this is essentially saying that there is no hope to learn anything, and characterizes the right number of samples required to learn this nothing.  In other terms, I feel the current work seems to address a valid question, but misses a crucial part: that part being "under which assumptions on R, H, and \ell is learning non-trivially in presence of evasion adversaries possible?"  - the second issue I have is with the writing. It really feels the authors went out of their way to appear "mathy", sacrificing readability and with no advantage. For instance, the footnotes about measurability: mentioning in passing at the beginning that, as standard,, one assumes measurability of all relevant quantities would be fine; instead, there are two footnotes. to say this, at two occasions. Another one: p.145, writing  \kappa_R(h) = x \mapsto [...] instead of \kappa_R(h)(x) = [...] to define the function just makes it harder to parse; the notation is valid, but uncommon enough to keep the reader uneasy. Or, the cllearest example, on p.191: instead of writing "eps >= 0", the authors write "eps \in \mathhbb{R}_{\geq 0}"! More symbols, less clear, no advantage whatsoever. (I could go on: for example, in Theorem 2: "a bounded \ell_p ball" is just "a \ell_p ball" -- why the redundant "bounded"?)  Finally, one last comment: in Theorem 1, don't add a footnote saying "This can be improved." Either you prove it, and state it; or you don't, and don't claim it. This is a theorem in your paper, not a remark in passing.
