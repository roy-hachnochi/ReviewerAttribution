This contribution concerns stochastic learning of covariance from time correlated samples. As such an important issues and the dependent sample issue is complex. The approach essentially is to subsample to avoid correlation and assume enough eigenvalue separation that the problem becomes "easy".   Would have been more interesting to actually estimate both the time dependence and covariance in my view.     Comment on author feedback:  I have noted your promise to consider the issue in the next version and look forward to your future work addressing this obvious issue.  Theory seems technically sound
