[Summary of the paper]  This paper considers the problem of streaming PCA for stationary time series. The primary contributions of the paper are two-fold: first, the paper proposes to use down sampling to generate an estimator of the covariance matrix with small bias, addressing the problem of data dependency in time series setting; second, the paper provide a detailed characterization of the behavior of SGD on the streaming PCA problem, by approximate the dynamics of SDG using ODE and SDE. Numerical experiments that corroborate the theoretical analysis are also provided.  [Quality]  The paper appears to be technically correct (but I have not read through the appendix carefully).   [Clarity]  The paper is very well-written, and does a good job introducing relevant background.   Some statements of the lemmas and theorems can be made more precise and complete. For example:  -- in Lemma 2.2, the covariance matrix $\Sigma$ here is the covariance matrix of $z$ under the stationary distribution, which should be made clear.   -- in Proposition 3.7, $T_2$ did not appear in the later statement.   In the numerical experiment section, it would be nice if the paper can be more specific on how the step size is chosen.    [Originality]  Since I am not familiar with this field of study, I cannot accurately evaluate the originality of the paper.  [Significance]  In my opinion, the paper has made a valuable contribution, especially in the theoretical characterizations of SDG on streaming PCA problem using diffusion approximation, corroborated by numerical experiments. The analysis is challenging in that the problem itself is non-convex (although without any bad local minimas), and has degeneracy, which is also the case for many other problems in machine learning, and the way these challenges are tackled in this paper might shed some light on similar analysis of these problems.
