The paper looks into the problem of detecing segments of interest in a time series. A novel network architecture for the detection is proposed, trained with a loss function based on the Earth Mover's Distance. The model is evaluated on videos for action proposal generation and video summarization.  The goal of the research is very clear and the paper is well-written. It would be good to make the code available to be able to reproduce the results, since the actual implementation details and values are kept quite vague in the text.  The proposed network architecture and loss function are interesting. The adventage of the new loss function over cross-entropy is demonstrated in the experiments. The choice of GRU, however, is not explicitly motivated.  Testing the network on action proposal generation shows the flexibility of the method: it could be useful in multiple applications. The method is also tested for video summarization. In this case, only six segments are given as output per video. This sounds like manual tuning is needed to make sure the network outputs the desired results in a new application; simply retraining might not be sufficient. The results for both problems exceed state of the art. The strategy is only tested on video sequences (action proposals, summarization and supplemental material), while it is written in a very general way: 'time series'. It would therefore be good if some results could be presented for other applications, for instance speech recognition or EEG.
