1. In line 113, what is R_{\theta}?  2. In line 117, it should be triangle inequality not triangular. 3. In line 126, addictive--> additive. 4. Inverse retraction map is called lifting. Also, please mention the radius of the regular geodesic ball inside which retraction map is a bijection. 5. In line 169, please bold x_is and bold S in hypersphere. 6. Eq. (2) is FM iff \rho is geodesic distance. 7. In line 177, what is 'big circle distance', should be arc length. 8. The fastest state-of-the-art FM estimator algorithm on hypersphere is by Chakraborty et al. in MFCA 2015. Please comment on performance improvement compare to this online algorithm.  Overall, though the idea is nice, I believe it mostly depends on the previous theorem (Thm. 1). Experimental section lacks comparison with the state-of-the-art. Needs proof reading and significant corrections with notations, technical content.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- POST REBUTTAL COMMENTS: The authors did a decent job with the rebuttal. My comments are successfully addresses (more-or-less). I was though concern about the motivation after reading R4's reviews, my opinion is authors did a good job there as well. I agree that minimizing the exact loss function is not feasible, hence the solution proposed is well motivated after reading the rebuttal.   So, in summary, I vote for acceptance and am going to increase my vote to a 7 assuming that authors will do a check for correctness of the technical content, notations etc..
