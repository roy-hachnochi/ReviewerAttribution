 This paper studies adversarial attacks on stochastic bandits. Though adversarial learning has been studied in deep learning, this is the first study of attacks on stochastic bandit algorithms to the best of my knowledge. They propose the attacks against two popular bandit algorithms, epsilon-greedy and UCB, without knowing the  ground truth. Their attacks can make the bandit algorithm to treat a certain suboptimal action as the optimal action with only O(log T) cost.  The paper is well written and the idea is quite novel. This work may be a seminal work that can inspire a line of research in attacks on bandits and robust bandit algorithms. However, they do not propose any defense for these attacks. It would be more interesting to design robust algorithms.  ====== after rebuttal ====== I read the rebuttal.
