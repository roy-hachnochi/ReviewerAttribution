[post rebuttal] The author is able to give constructive comments based on the feedback of reviewers.  [A summary of the paper (motivation, methods, results) written in your own words of about a paragraph.]  The authors developed a novel influence-function (IF) based sampling method that is asymptotically optimal and can be applied to a wide range of parameters (tasks), namely asymptotically linear estimators, which fills the gap between efficient empirical process theory and computational statistics. The authors presented the canonical formulation of IF based sampling as well as approximated methods for computation efficiency, and illustrated their method in three examples (OLS, GLM, quantile regression), and for each example presented influence functions for the \theta parameter and the conditional mean E(Y|X) parameter. In the examples, the authors established connection between (1) leverage score based sampling and (2) the IF based sampling for prediction \hat y_i. Connections between `local case-control sampling` and `IF based sampling for GLM prediction` is also presented. The authors proved asymptotic optimality of their proposed method.  The authors conducted simulation study to evaluate the performance of the new method compared to current state-of-the-art sampling methods. On three datasets, the authors run OLS and 90% quantile regression, and evaluate based on two metrics. And shows that IF-based sampling reduces MSE for both prediction and parameter estimation.  [A list of major issues] - in section 6 (experiments), the authors implemented the method for `90% quantile regression` rather than `median regression`, which is the most widely applied method. It would make the paper much more applicable and useful for practitioners if the `median regression` method is also evaluated in simulation   [A list of minor issues] NA
