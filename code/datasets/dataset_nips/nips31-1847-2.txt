The paper studies an adaptive measurement allocation problem. The goal is to detect a large number of treatments with positive effect as quick as possible subject to the constraint that number of false discoveries remain small over all time. Two notions of false alarm control are considered: FDR that controls the ratio of false discoveries to all discoveries, and FWER that controls any false discoveries. Also two notions of true discoveries are considered: TPR that requires detecting a large proportion of treatments with positive effect, and FWPD that requires detecting all such treatments.   The paper shows sample complexity results for all four combinations of false alarm control and true discoveries. Previous works show such results in the “fixed budget” setting, while this current paper shows guarantees in the “fixed confidence” setting. The paper is well-written and the results seem quite strong.   My main comments are as follows:  1) Algorithms designed for the “fixed confidence” setting typically have a stopping condition. As discussed in Remark 1, it is impossible to have a stopping time in your setting. Then how is your algorithm used in practice? When do you decide to terminate the test?   2) The paper needs a more clear explanation of Algorithm 1.  3) A conclusions or future work section is missing.
