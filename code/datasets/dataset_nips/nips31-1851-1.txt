The aim of the paper is to decompose the quantitative measure of discrimination called the equalized odds (EO). The EO measures the extent to which gender, race or other protected characteristics are used in classification. The EO is decomposed into a direct effect, indirect effect and spurious effect. The paper also provides an algorithm for training classifiers with penalization to ensure that these effects are small.  The aim is clear and useful since it is important to minimize the impact of unfairness, with individual measures of the various mechanisms.  The significance of the paper is not clear since it appears to just extend the results of Zhang and Barenboim (2018) by defining causal effects which condition on Y. Clearly there are technical details that are addressed which describe estimation under the graph which conditions on Y. However the level of novelty does not obviously meet the required criteria.  Additionally, the causal explanation formula is not particularly intuitive. The EO is decomposed as EO=DE-IE-SE, with some reversal of the effects. While this seems technically correct, its usefulness is unclear since it is not intuitive. Without some sort of additive decomposition, as with the decomposition of a causal effect into a direct and indirect effect, it may not be helpful in practice.  A difference in effects is useful to decompose but, more generally, it may be a ratio or other contrasts that are of interest. This is a future concern as it may not be as straightforward and solving the difference case would be sufficiently interesting.  The naming of the EO as odds is a bit misleading since it is not a ratio. However I understand that it is already in the literature.
