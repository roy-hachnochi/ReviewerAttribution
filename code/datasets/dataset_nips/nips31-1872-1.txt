The authors investigate the problem of graph reconstruction via random walks when partial information about node similarities is observed. The problem is very interesting from a data privacy perspective. The paper is well-written, clearly organized, and interesting. Having said that, I am not very well versed in the graph reconstruction or privacy literature, and feel that I cannot comment on the significance or originality of the work.
