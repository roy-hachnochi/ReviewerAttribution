The paper proposes adaptations of the existing NC (Negative Curvature) search algorithm called "Neon2". Neon2 follows an iterative  process and uses stochastic updates to solve the NC (Negative Curvature) search problem. The authors provide  a discussion of their Neon2 variants for each of these cases and discuss improved theoretical bounds for them.  I like the fact that Neon2 can be used as a black-box in applications where NC is applicable. Such applications fall into two broad settings - online and offline, and the authors have provided algorithms and discussion in detail for both these cases. This is useful in understanding the context where Neon2 is relevant. The authors have delved deeper into the theoretical guarantees and that is a plus of this work.  However, I feel the organization of the paper could be improved. Readability of the paper is poor. There are several versions of the methods introduced in a haphazard fashion and I feel it doesn't flow well. For eg, in line 127 the authors suddenly mention Neon2_online_weak, at which point I am lost as to that "weak" means.  line: 63-64: "In the end, the vector xT âˆ’ x0 gives us enough information about the negative curvature." >> needs to be explained more clearly why. was not clear to me why this is the case.  - Even though this work is a theoretical contribution, I am also curious about how the NC adaptation as Neon2 works empirically. Fig 1 is reference from the proofs, the placement of the Figure on  second page is confusing. Also, it the figure needs to be explained better. line 32: Figure 1  >> legends confusing, needs to be made more clear.  The authors acknowledge that a parallel work on similar lines as their appeared few days before them called "Neon". Although they claim "Neon2" is different from "Neon" and has better theoretical properties, this should be discussed in more detail in the related work section. Empirical comparison would help too.
