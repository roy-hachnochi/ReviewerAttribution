############# The authors have addressed my previous comments.   ############# In this paper, the authors provided a comprehensive study on the convergence rate of CR under KL condition. Existing work restricted CR to convergence analysis conditioned on special types of geometrical properties of the objective function. Thus, this work is novel and contains significant theoretical contributions.   Strengths:  1) This work provided a comprehensive study on the convergence rate of CR under four different optimally measures. 2) Table 1-3 clearly showed the differences with the existing work, and could motivate further work in the field.   Weakness: It lacks numerical results to verify the theoretical results proposed in this paper.   Comment:  1) Please highlight the technical difficulty of convergence analysis under KL compared to the existing work. 2) $\phi^\prime$ was not defined in Eq. (2)?
