1. A tautology in line 96 "The model space may be finite or infinite dimensional when the model spaces are finite or infinite dimensional, respectively." 2. The wrong definition of Riemannian manifold, it should be smoothly varying inner product, not just any metric. Furthermore, if f_p is not assumed to be smooth (at least differentiable), one can't define metric! Rewrite the definitions. In general, I understood the overall idea presented in this paper, I verified the proof of Thm. 3.1, but not sure about the other proofs, though the statement of the theorems looks correct. A nice paper overall.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ POST REBUTTAL COMMENTS: I am overall satisfied with this work and the rebuttal, hence I vote for an acceptance of this paper.
