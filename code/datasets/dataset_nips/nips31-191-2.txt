In this paper the authors propose the use of generalized low rank approximations for approximating the psuedo inverse kernels for non-blind deconvolution. The authors compare their methods with a number of other methods. The method is illustrated on a few sample images and shows quantitatively and qualitatively better results.   The proposed work provides evaluation only on a few (10-12) sample images in the main paper and supplementary. One way for evaluating it on a large scale is by considering a standard benchmark dataset such as BSD or some such and yevaluating the method on a few hundred images and providing statistically significant improvement results. This would make the method to be more acceptable and to do this with a number of varying kernel sizes  The current method is suited for non-blind deconvolution. One question therefore is  whether it would be tolerant to errors in estimation of the kernel. It would be great if some analysis to that extent could be provided.
