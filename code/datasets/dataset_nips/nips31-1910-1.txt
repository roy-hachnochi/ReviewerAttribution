This paper is of big significance in studying the clustering with tiny clusters. It states the conditions under which the proposed algorithm succeeds, and provides sufficient theoretical proofs to these statements.  Strengths: -This paper is well organized and presented. The expression are clear making the reader easily follow this paper.  -The originality of this paper is good, which gives the definition of “tiny cluster” and points out the importance of clustering these tiny clusters. -The techniques and derivations in the paper is reasonable and convince me.  Weaknesses: -There is still several typos, such as “of” in line 127 is needless, “iff” in line 136 is a spelling mistake. -Some notations in the paper are unclear, such asΟ(.), Ω(.)and Θ(.). -In your experiment, how to understand the definition of “planted cluster”? Is it a typo in the expression “70 left-side clusters of size 70”? Since you have said 8 planted cluster,it is confused that you mean the number of clusters is 70 or each size of data in any cluster is 70. -How to understand the significance of experimental results in Figure 1 (d)(e)(f)? In the paper, the parameter delta is defined as “the smallest difference between any two right-side clusters” instead of “the size of right cluster”. So, why you study the ability of the proposed method in recovering tiny clusters under varying delta, rather than l (which is defined as the smallest cluster on left side)?
