summary: 7/10 This paper proposes a tempered geodesic MCMC approach for bayesian pose graph optimization (PGO). One tempered sampling algorithm is proposed which bridges the optimization and sampling, with its sampling error bound analyzed. Two set of experiments (synthetic and real) are conducted, showing that the accuracy is comparable or better than baselines. One thing noted is, the motivation of the work is PGO post processing takes are time consuming for online /soft-realtime operations. But this question was not answered in the work, i.e., the computation cost was not addressed for the proposed algorithm.   quality: 6/10 One concern is mentioned in summary: the motivation is to enable PGO to be realtime/online but the computation is not analyzed/addressed in the work. When descretizing the continuous SDE to sampling steps, there are a few parameters like step sizes and ordering as mentioned. Are those mostly decided by trial-and-error? That much degrades the practical impact of the proposed algorithm.  clarity: 8/10 The work is overall clearly presented.  originality: 8/10 A decent geodesic MCMC algorithm is provided, not novel in itself, but first time applied to the problem considered.   significance: 7/10 PGO is an important problem itself. And one Bayesian algorithm is designed with some tools integrated/constructed. This work is interesting to a wide group of researchers.  Updated: As responded in author feedback, the computation is reasonable compared to alternatives. It is suggest to add the table/exp to the supplement as it is tightly related to the motivation.
