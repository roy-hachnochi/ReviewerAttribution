In nonparametric inference, selecting regularization parameter via cross validation is usually suboptimal for testing. This paper studies the problem of applying an early stopping regularization method to facilitate nonparametric testing based on gradient descent algorithm in reproducing kernel Hilbert space.  The authors develop a Wald-type test statistic based on the iterated estimator and derive the sharp stopping rule to guarantee minimax optimal testing for both polynomial decay kernel and exponential-polynomial decay kernel.  The authors show the effectiveness of this approach by theoretical results and numerical experiments. Overall the result is novel and very interesting. The paper is well written and easy to understand.
