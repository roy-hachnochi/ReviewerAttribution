This paper proposes an algorithm that achieves a better than the current-known convergence rate for a particular class of convex optimization problems by using a homotopy-smoothing approach.  I find this paper somewhat interesting, but I have some concerns. Primarily 'Convergence time' is used far too loosely. What does it mean? Is it the number of oracle accesses to grad f? It doesn't seem so since the PDS inner algorithm requires full maximization. This looseness really lets the entire paper down because I can't understand how to parse the rate. The plots only include 'number of iterations' which is totally useless if your algorithm iteration-time is 100x that of another. These plots should at least also include wall-clock time, but ideally the rate and the results would be in terms of accesses to forward or backwards access to A and some oracle accesses to grad f (or prox f).  Secondly the algorithm is quite intricate to implement, assumption 2.1 is quite restrictive, and the algorithm requires knowledge of D. I suppose the improved convergence rate could justify all these, but I wonder would practitioners ever use this technique over a competing one?  Minor: The refs font is too small.  ============================================================ I have increased my assessment to 7 based on the rebuttal.
