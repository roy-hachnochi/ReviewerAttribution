The paper develops a primal-dual homotopy smoothing method for convex programs where neither the primal nor the dual has to be smooth or strongly convex. The authors show that their method can achive convegence faster than O(1/epsilon) if certain local error bounds are fulfilled.  - Maximization in (4) should be over Omega_1 instead of Omega _2, right? - In the contributions paragraph in Section 1.2, one could add that the convergence time given there is the one from the previous convergence time in the special case beta = 1/2. - Introduction in Section 4: It would be beneficial to mention that e_ij = e_ji (if that is really the case). (Probably that is clear from the word "undirected" but I least I have been unsure.) - The matrix A on page 6 can be written as Kronecker product A = I_{nd] - W\otimes I_d (or, in MATLAB notation, A = eye(nd) - kron(W,eye(d)).  The paper adapts, extends and improves a previously know method and applies the method to a specific and relevant problem.
