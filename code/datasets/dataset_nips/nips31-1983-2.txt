The authors propose a primal dual homotopy smoothing algorithm for the minimization of a convex function over a convex compact set with additional equality constraints. Being based on the primal dual algorithm, the method requires an accuracy level which needs to be carefully tuned in practice and is critical for the convergence of the algorithm. It is difficult to parse Theorem 3.1. I would like to see an explicit convergence rate in terms of feasibility and suboptimality. In particular, the algorithm does not converge to the optimum, but only to an epsilon accurate solution (as in the universal primal-dual). This should be carefully discussed. In particular, the whole method should be put in perspective with “Frank-Wolfe Splitting via Augmented Lagrangian Method” for the problem in equation 16-17 and “A conditional Gradient Framework for Composite Convex Minimization with Applications to Semidefinite Programming”. In particular, the latter seem to propose the same smoothing technique. While they obtain a slower rate, their subproblem is easier to solve and they prove convergence to the optimal value and feasibility. Therefore, a discussion on the differences of the two approaches and an empirical comparison would be important. -------------------------------------------------------------------- After the rebuttal I decided to increase my score to 6 as the approach can deal with non smooth f as well.
