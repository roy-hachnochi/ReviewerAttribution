The paper presents a heterogeneous binarization technique that allows every parameter in a neural network to have a different bitwidth. The authors show that the proposed method is comparable or outperforms baseline methods with fewer average bits on ImageNet with AlexNet and MobileNet models.  I am not very familiar with the area, but I think this is an interesting paper that could become useful for practical applications of neural network models. While the proposed method is a small modification of previous work, the experiments are thorough and the results are quite convincing.
