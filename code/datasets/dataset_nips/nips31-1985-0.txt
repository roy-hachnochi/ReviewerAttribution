Summary: This paper proposes a method for conditional image generation by jointly learning "structure" points such as face and body landmarks. The authors propose to use a convolutional neural network with a modified loss to capture the image transformation and landmarks. They evaluate their approach on a set of datasets including CelebA, VoxCeleb, and Human 3.6M.  Positive:  -The problem addressed is an important problem and the authors attempt to solve it using a well engineered approach. -The results seem to be competitive to some state of the art approaches.  Negatives: -The pre-processing using heat maps, normalizing them into probabilities, then using a gaussian kernel to produce the features is a bit heuristic.  -The claim in P4 L132-135 saying this is usually done using GANs, it would have been good to show some results and comparison against GAN based methods. Comparison against [37] for image generation using landmark/control/structure points would have helped. -The use of two networks, landmark network and image generation network, rather than training a joint network seems inefficient.  Landmarks and image generation are two complimentary that could be modeled in a joint network.
