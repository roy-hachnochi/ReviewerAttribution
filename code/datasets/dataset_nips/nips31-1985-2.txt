This paper develops an unsupervised approach to learning image landmarks. The key of the proposed model is a representation bottleneck that only allows landmark information of an image to flow through and be fed to the conditional image generator to recover the image. Experiments show the generality of the method on different types of images.  The idea looks clean and quite reasonable. The representation bottleneck ensures only the landmark information is distilled from the image, and other irrelevant information is filtered out.   Presentation is clear. Fig.1 is informative and helpful.  The quality of the example images (e.g., Fig.3 and 4) should be improved. In particular, the landmarks are hard to see.
