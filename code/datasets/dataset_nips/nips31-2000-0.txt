About my confidence: I'm barely familiar with graph theory and unfamiliar graphical propagation using tableaus etc.  I found your arguments to be quite clear and well stated. I'm particularly interested in the concept of response time.  (PS: There is a typo on 288-289.)  =========================== edit after rebuttal:  I agree with Reviewer 3 that simple examples to illustrate each concept would take this paper to the next level. I want to see this work as a longer paper so that the authors do not have to hold back with examples and explanation, analogies etc. In particular it would be useful to link this to some popular rollout papers, like LISTA (this is what I view as the original rollout, which turns iterative algorithm ISTA into an RNN) (Learning Fast Approximationg of Sparse Coding - Yann LeCun et al).  However, most rollout papers do not even touch the world outside of numerical results (i.e., "our rollout is better than whatever inspired our rollout", or "look at our rollout, it outperforms popular methods"). This work is a solid generalization of popular rollout papers, at least the ones I'm familiar with. Thus I think that this paper is a strong contribution to the field, although its accessibility could be improved (with intuition, examples, etc.). The potential software library as well as theoretical framework provides a basis for further exploration in terms of both DNNs, and "traditional" iterative algorithms, which can be viewed as infinitely long rollouts. I would look forward to seeing this paper presented.
