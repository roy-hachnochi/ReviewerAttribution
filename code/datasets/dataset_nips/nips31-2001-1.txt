The paper presents a new graph kernel for the setting where the edges incident to a node have associated order. The paper combines the WL-type approaches with sketching of node feature vectors, and provides an efficient update algorithm for label k-gram distributions of the nodes through dynamic programming. The authors further provide theoretical analysis of the complexity of the sketching approach. The experimental results are convincing especially for the graphs with the ordered neighbourhood.
