Well written paper about VAEs with RBM priors. The main innovations are straight forward, seem easy to implement and prove to outperform previous methods. I only have a few comments:  - I think there are some minor problems with the proof of Thm 1 (which I think   holds nevertheless): In Eq 1 of the proof on the appendix the decomposition   is wrong. It should state that $\forall i \exists g, f   E=z_ig_i(z_{\backslash i})+f_i(z_{\backslash i})$. Also just argueing that the   trace of the Hessian is 0 is not imidiately clear to be sufficient. One can   prob argue that for any critical point (unless the function is constant), we   can find a directions i such that $g_i(z_{\backslash i})$ is non-zero, and   therefore there's a ascend and descend direction in $i$.  - Would it also be possible to esitmate $\tilde Z_\theta$ by doing Gibbs   sampling with truncated Gaussians instead of replacing it with $Z_\theta$?   This should be a tighter bound as far as I understand.  - I would replace the term 'indifferentiable' with the more comment   'non-differentiable'  - l139: There's smth missing in the first sentence.  - I'm not entirely sure I understand the model layout in the experimental   section for two stochastic layers. Are those the two componenents in the   bipartite graph of an RBM or are there in fact 2 RBMs? This could be explained   in a more transparent way.  - The labelling of figure 2b should be explained better.
