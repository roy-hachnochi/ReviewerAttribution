The work presents a method to train a VAE with binary latent variables and an RBM prior distribution. Starting from the idea of concrete relaxation, the work presents the GumBolt proxy, where the energy function is computed using continuous values while the normalizer is computed using the discrete (binary) values. This allows both the efficient approximation of the normalizer for training the prior and pathway gradient for training the concrete relaxed encoder. Based on the GumBolt proxy, a lower bound of the IWAE objective is proposed to train the VAE, with a further tweak to resolve the discrepancy between pdf and pmf in the limiting case. Empirically, the VAE with an RBM prior significantly outperforms both the DVAE (DVAE++) and the VAE with a factorized Bernoulli prior.  Strength:  - The proposed method is clean and effective. - A reasonable analysis is provided to justify why the relaxed GumBolt proxy well tracks the discrete RBM prior.   Weakness: - The main concern I have is that whether an RBM prior is necessary or the best choice given its complication. To this end, it would be more informative to compare with an auto-regressive prior where each conditional could be relaxed into a concrete distribution (e.g. parameterized by an RNN or (dilated) CNN with comparable parameter size). Since the auto-regressive prior can yield the exact probability, training can be directly performed with the IWAE objective. In terms of the sampling, an auto-regressive prior and an RBM prior could be similarly slow.  Overall, I think this is an interesting paper with positive empirical results. However, whether the RBM prior is a necessary or the best choice is not clear yet.
