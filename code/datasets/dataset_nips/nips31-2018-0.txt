Summary of the submission ===================== The authors present their theory of "typicality", to explain why the effect known as Beauty in Averagesness is distorted in some cases, for example, where the viewers previously know the people being judged. The authors introduce a very interesting hypothesis on why complex objects are disliked, in general, when they deviate from individual categorical prototypes of specific objects. The results of the simulations show agreement with the findings in social psychology, suggesting the typicality hypothesis may hold true.   Quality ===== The study, hypothesis, methodology and evaluations excel in quality, in my opinion. The work is very interesting and very well framed in the state of the art of attractiveness perception.  My critic here is about the brevity of section 6. It seems to be a key point in your theory to be able to prove that disfluency and typicality do not concur, or else, the effect can be as well explained simply as the result of disfluency. The simulation results are interesting. Could you run a perceptual study to validate this claim? The other two cases (familiar faces or race) included blending in the test. It is not clear to me from the text if you are also blending image per age here.  Clarity ===== The paper is very well written and easy to follow. And mentioned in my previous point, it would help improve the clarity and quality if the authors would elaborate further on the section 6.  Line 123 is confusing.  In line 182, the term AAM appears for the first time without explanation.    Originality and Significance ====================== The work presented in the paper is original and aims to answer some open questions arising from famous findings in research on attractiveness. Indeed, as the authors motivate early in the paper, perception of attractiveness is crucial in social outcomes and it is highly relevant to investigate why and how it is perceived. The findings of the authors help shed light on the fluidity of attractiveness and its context dependance.  Comments after the rebuttal  ************************************  As I said before, I like the paper and work a lot. However, as I mentioned before, the key point of your hypothesis is on the differentiation between disfluency and typicality. From your reply, it is not clear to me if this experiment will be actually carried out and included in your results, and just yet it is not convincing enough that this will work. I therefore lower my score.
