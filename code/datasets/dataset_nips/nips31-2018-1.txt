The authors provide a principled statistical account that explains conflicting results in the human perception of faces, and use the AAM technique to translate their approach to a tangible model. They evaluate the account against  data from extant experiments.   Bridging conflicting existing experimental results with concise and elegant statistical account is definitely a worthy endeavor. Building such a model could lead to a substantial contribution. My impression, however, was that the computational level of the model (section 3 and 4.1), the algorithmic (implementation using AAM)  and the interpretation of simulation results in section 4.1.2 are not seamlessly connected. The authors make implicitly strong assumptions to build thee connections,  which hinder the overall scope and potential of the advanced approach.   Such discrepancies between abstract theories and ways to analyze empirical/simulation data are not uncommon in the social sciences (e.g models in economics tend to be very abstract are often translated to linear equations when tested against empirical data) but are quite uncommon in cognitive science and neuroscience, where typically the computational and the algorithmic level of theories are much better integrated.  Minor remarks: 1.The references need to be homogenized. At the moment there are several different styles used.  2. The quality of the graphs could be further improved. Figures 2.b.c They appear to be blurry in my print out. The error bars are quite small. Same for Figure 3.  3. In section 6 the authors propose an experiment and present predictions of two competing accounts. The disfluency account is only mentioned briefly in the introduction before and the details are skipped. I would allocate some supporting material explaining the competing account better, possibly in an appendix. It would have been great to see actual results here, rather than just predictions.
