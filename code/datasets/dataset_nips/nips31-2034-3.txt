This is a nice mixed programming problem to a topical problem of inferring the most plausible perfect phylogeny in the setting of noisy data, that is the input matrix contains fractions of the population with mutations at the respected position. The authors propose a 2-stage procedure in which in the first stage, they find good candidate matrices U's from the space of valid trees, and in the second stage they find the exact goodness of that matrix/tree. The  space of these matrices is exponential in the dimension of the matrix U (although these matrices are over 1/0 only) and therefore the emphasis is over this stage. The authors claim they achieve reasonable results for q=11 and they compared it to other implementations. I cannot see a real practical use for such magnitude, but I trust the authors they obtained good results.
