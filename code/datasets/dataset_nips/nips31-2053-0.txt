Using a simple rate-distortion argument, authors devise an information-theoretic analysis of Thompson sampling on arbitrarily large action spaces. they establish regret bound for Thompson sampling on both linear and generalized linear bandit problems.   The proofs are clear and easy to follow however, this analysis relies on a conjecture about the information ratio of Thompson sampling for the logistic bandit, which is only supported through computational results. Since the paper is only about theory it makes this missing part important to conclude the proof.  I have the following comment Problem of notation line 95 line. Could you please clarify the following, in the proof of theorem 2 (appendix ) line 78, how you could take \epsilon=d/sqrt(sT), and we know that \epsilon is constant ?
