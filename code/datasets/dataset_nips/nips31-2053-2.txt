The paper devises a new technique for information theoretic analysis of Thompson Sampling. The main result is to recover the existing bounds for linear bandits, and provide new results for logistic bandits.   The new technique is conceptually interesting. I have two main concerns. First, in terms of a general technique,  Theorem 1 does not seem any more easy to use than the results in Russo and Van Roy relating regret to entropy. Also, the regret bounds for linear and generalized bandits are not a significant improvement over existing results. The results for logistic bandits are an improvement but depend on a conjecture.   Overall, the paper is conceptually interesting and well written, but seems incremental over Russo and Van Roy.   Post author-feedback: I thank the authors for the clarifying discussion. I went through it carefully, but am still not convinced with the significance of the new techniques. My score remains unchanged.
