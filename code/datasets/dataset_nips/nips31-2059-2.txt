This is a thorough study on differentially private (DP) low-rank factorisation under almost all possible design decisions such as in which order the matrices are updated or whether the output is produced at the end of all updates or not. The authors propose two new definitions of adjacent matrices which are stricter than the ones used in the literature. Using these, the DP arbitrary update algorithm has comparable time and space complexity to the non-private algorithm.  The paper has a clear contribution, but it is too exhaustive and long. It can be organised much better and it would be better if the main text is made more self-contained. The message is not very clear.
