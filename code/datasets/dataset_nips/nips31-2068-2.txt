This paper proposes a bilevel distance metric learning method for robust image recognition task. A set of experiments validate that the proposed method is competitive with the state-of-art algorithms on the robust image recognition task.  The main idea of this paper is novel. Based on my knowledge, this is the first work on bilevel metric learning.  In the proposed bilevel model, the lower level characterizes the intrinsic data structure using graph regularized sparse coefficients, while the upper level forces the data samples from the same class to be close to each other and simultaneously pushes those from different classes far away. Thus, the proposed model combines the advantages of metric learning and dictionary learning. The proposed bilevel model is optimized via ADMM method. During the optimization step, the authors converted the lower level constraint in Eq. (3) into an equivalent one in Eq. (5) using KKT conditions. This is a good and interesting idea.  This paper is well-organized. The motivations of the proposed model and algorithm are articulated clearly. Meanwhile, the derivations and analysis of the proposed algorithm are correct. The experiments on image classification with occlusion/noise are interesting, because few existing papers on metric learning can effectively address these difficult cases. I think the main reason is that the proposed method unites the advantages of dictionary learning models. The experimental results show that the proposed model is better than the other existing methods.   A few additional comments on this paper:  1.The experimental settings should be further clarified.   2.There are some parameters in the proposed model, so the authors need to discuss the influences of individual parameters on the model’s performance.  I have read the authors’ rebuttal and other reviews. I think this work is solid, so will keep my score and vote for acceptance.
