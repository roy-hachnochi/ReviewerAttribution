This paper provides a way for detection methods to get rid of the classic fixed set of predefined anchors which are always hard to choose. Implementing detection boxes as a function of continuous parameters representing the prior/anchors (instead of finite set of fixed prior) allows users to choose at inference time which prior/anchor they want to use. In addition they provide a system to predict the prior from the image so that the user's a priori is removed from the detection process by jointly optimizing both prior (which are outputs of a neural net) and the more classic  part regression and scoring, which act on continuous inputs.  Strengths: the approach is original, gives improvements over strong baselines. In addition, the approach is of  general interest for the object detection community  Weaknesses: The mathematical notations employed for the anchors and boxes are misleading, and the article would benefit from a user-friendly rewrite. Publishing at NIPS does not require to use overly complicated formalism. Under its current form, the paper is barely readable.  I think the approach would be even more interesting on use cases where modalities are very different between train and test. For instance, training on large objects and testing on very small objects. Or even synthetic to real settings as proposed by the authors. Fixed anchors should fail in this setting. Generating data dependant anchors should provide big improvements it would be interesting to see.
