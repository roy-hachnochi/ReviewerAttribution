The paper presents an anchor generation algorithm that learns anchor functions dynamically from arbitrary customized prior boxes rather than making them pre-defined. Results show improvements over a pre-defined anchor scheme on COCO detection task.  Pros: + A simple algorithm and well motivated. Pre-defining anchor scales and aspect ratios is a tricky problem in object detection, making it learnable inside the deep network is a clear contribution.   + The anchor generator is flexible and can theoretically be integrated into many object detection networks.  +  Reasonable improvements over the baseline.  Cons: - The paper is only compared with [21] which uses a very simple strategy to design the anchor config. It's unclear how does the method compare with more carefully designed anchor strategies, e.g. via clustering (YOLO v2).  - I think one clear advantage of the learned anchor configuration is through domain adaptation (i.e. train and test on different datasets). The experiments on cross evaluation between datasets is a bit trivial. It will be interesting to see experiments on actually different datasets such as Pascal and COCO.  - It will be interesting to see how well does the proposed method work in another type of architecture, e.g. two-stage network.
