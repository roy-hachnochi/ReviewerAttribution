In this paper, the authors studied hypothesis testing under differentially private (DP) constraints. They showed the necessary and sufficient conditions for a hypothesis testing procedure to be DP are (2) - (5), based on which they developed tests that were DP-UMP. Their tests depended on the Tulap distribution for the randomness in DP. They also presented procedures to calculate p-values, and showed applications to distribution-free inference.  Although I found the paper interesting, I also felt the presentation was not very clear. This is probably due to the strict space limit of NIPS. Within 7 pages, the authors presented more than a dozen highly technical theorems and lemmas, without going too much detail in their implications and significance. Therefore, I feel this paper is more suitable as a journal publication, such as on AOS, EJS or Bernoulli, in which the authors could go in more depth in establishing the backgrounds and the intuitions of their proposal.  In addition, I suggest the authors to discuss more regarding the relationship between DP in hypothesis tests and the power of local alternatives. It seems to me that for a hypothesis testing procedure to be DP, its power in testing local alternatives could not be too high. This limits the power of the DP hypothesis testing procedures. Therefore, it is interesting to gain some intuition regarding UMP under DP setting, i.e., how does the statistical power of a DP-UMP procedure behave if the power of testing local alternatives is upper bounded.
