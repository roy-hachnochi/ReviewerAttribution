Motivation: My main concern is the motivation of the method. To recover the missing rates in the binary matrix, the authors propose several strict assumptions, which call for reconsideration on whether it is practical: only two clusters exist with the same size and users in the same cluster share the same ratings over items. Finally, the partially observed matrix could be a noisy rank-1 matrix.   Formulation:  --> I am confused about the connections between the worst-case probability of error and the optimal sample complexity.  If lim_{n->infty}inf max Pr(phi(N,G\)neq R’)=0, it is still questionable to conclude that the recovery can be guaranteed. It might needs more analytical investigation but I suggest the authors consider defining the probability of error as max_{R’:||u_{R’}-v_{R’}||_0 \leq \gamma m }  Pr(\phi(N,G)\neq R’). --> In Theorem 1, It seems unclear on the parameter p . How do the assumptions work in Th1? In terms of the main contribution of the paper, it would be better to discuss more on the theoretical bound in the Th1, especially on every parameter associated with the bound. Experiment: More related side information matrix recovery methods should be compared. Writing: 1. What do u_R and v_R exactly mean? 2. On page 3, line 130, what does the nmp^* mean? -------------------------------------------------------------- Update:   This paper has several strong points, especially on the theoretical recovery sampling rate with graph side information. However, as a real-world problem-driven method for the recommendation system, but not a pure theoretical toy-problem, I feel not that confident to fully recommend this paper. First, there are many existing matrix completion with side info methods that need discussion in depth in this paper. E.g., the paper named "Chiang, Kai-Yang, Cho-Jui Hsieh, and Inderjit S. Dhillon. "Matrix completion with noisy side information." Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems. 2015" has a more relaxed assumption on the target matrix and their optimal and worst theoretical sampling rates are given in their paper. Plus, to be more fair comparison, the experiment is suggested to include more matrix completion with side info methods, at least several regularization based methods cited by the authors. I appreciate the efforts on the theoretical aspect in this paper, but in my view, the proposed theory seems still far away from the nature of a practical recommendation system. Rather than the theory with a strong assumption, I would be more convinced to see the comprehensive experiments showing the effectiveness and efficiency of the method first.  Overall, I would recommend this paper if the paper targets more at discussing a pure math toy-problem. But my rating is still marginally below the acceptance threshold.
