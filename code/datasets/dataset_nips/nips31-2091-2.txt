This paper introduces a problem where both a stochastic block model graph and a partial ratings matrix (with the same community structure) are observed, and the goal is to fill in the missing ratings.  Sharp information-theoretic thresholds are derived, and a practical algorithm is shown to suffice for the upper bound.  Overall, my impression of the paper is positive.  The main limitation is that the model is very simple (e.g., two equal-size communities, identical ratings within a community).   However, such a model is still interesting from a theoretical viewpoint, and I view it as being analogous to the role of the (also very simple) stochastic block model that sparked a lot of interesting research for community detection.  Basically, I think it is quite suitable for an initial primarily-theoretical work to adopt such a simple model, whose assumptions can potentially be relaxed in future works.  Because of the length of the supplementary material, I am unable to be confident about the correctness of all results.  But I found myself fairly convinced regarding the information-theoretic limits, and I did not notice any obvious problems in the analysis of the practical algorithm.  The writing is quite dense.  It feels like a lot is packed into the main body, with lots of long inline equations and so on.  This is not a major problem, but it makes it a bit harder to read.  A technical comment: The first chain of display equations of the full proof of the converse (bottom of supplementary p4) needs revising.  Most importantly, equations (a), (b), and (c) need a \sum_{R'} Pr[R'] out front.  (I guess this was the intended meaning anyway, but the notation is not good) Despite this, I am confident of the claim itself on the ML estimator.  Here are a number of more specific comments (all fairly minor): - First of the abstract sounds a bit vague, and is perhaps not the best start - p1: "Since then" -- it's unclear what this is referring to - p2: The comparison to [42] makes it sound like your models are the same, which I guess they might not be. - p2: Shortly after "Observation model.", remove "the" - p2: after "exact recovery is the most difficult", perhaps there should be a "subject to...".  Letting all entries be 0 would be most difficult! - Theorem 1: Perhaps factor (1+epsilon) and (1-epsilon) outside the max{.} - Sometimes confusion between "notion" and "notation" - p4: Perhaps avoid notation like (1)= and (2)= - p5: Please cite the power method runtime - p6: I definitely suggest explicitly defining the ML estimator at this early stage, since at this stage its definition is not completely clear (e.g., do you limit to matrices consistent with the gamma*n constraint?) - Footnote 2: Perhaps expand this sentence to say that the two sets of assumptions still overlap considerably.  Otherwise it might sound like the two theorems are not comparable. - p6: Please state the the full proofs are in the supplementary material - p6: Perhaps instead of just "WLOG" mention symmetry?  And again on p7. - p7: "for the time being" sounds strange - p7: Why are there |.| around S(z) ? - p8: Typos "showing [the] practicality" and "state of the arts" (the latter is also in the abstract) - Supplementary p2: Typo "We will proof" - Supplementary Theorem 1: The converse should say for ANY \psi (not "for some") - Supplementary p7: It is misleading to say that |F| = \eta * n.  The = should be <= (e.g., maybe we get lucky and have perfect recovery) - Supplementary p9: The hats are misplaced on c_s and c_r  =====  POST-REBUTTAL:  I am satisfied with the author responses.  I still suggest using more explicit notation for averaging around the R' part, like \sum_{r'} Pr[R' = r']
