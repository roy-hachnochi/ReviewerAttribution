This paper studies the problem of knowledge graph completion. A simple approach called SimplE is proposed. SimplE is an extension of CP. The difference lies in that CP only models a given triple (h,r,t) while SimplE models both (h,r,t) and its inverse triple (t, r^{-1}, h).  Strengths: 1. A simple approach with surprisingly good performance. It is surprising that just by introducing inverse triples, the link prediction performance can be improved that much (CP vs. SimplE).  2. This paper provides a thorough analysis about the newly proposed and previous emedding models (expressiveness, complexity, interpretability, and redundancy), which will help the authors to better understand these models.  Weaknesses: 1. The only difference between SimplE and CP seems to be that SimplE further uses inverse triples. The technical contributions of this paper are quite limited.   2. Introducing inverse triples might also be used in other embedding models besides CP. But the authors did not test such cases in their experiments.  3. It would be better if the authors could further explain why such a simple step (introducing inverse triples) can improve the CP model that much.
