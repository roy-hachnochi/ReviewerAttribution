This submission introduces Submodular Field Grammars (SFGs), including its representation and inference algorithms, which is mainly an extension of those previous works, such as [6, 7].  - The novelty/contribution and the practical value of this submission are less than NIPS criteria.  - The two conditions stated in line 137~146 significantly limit the extent of applications of the method.  - The quantitative evaluation only considers DeepLab and DeepLab+MRF as competitors, which is not convincing.  - In line 70~71, it is stated that SFGs are a general and flexible model class that is applicable anywhere grammars or MRFs are used, including social network modeling and probabilistic knowledge bases. Obviously this statement is wrong. How this SFGs can be used for the cases where more general grammars and/or MRFs are involved?  - It is stated that a key benefit of the grammar-based formulation is that it enables sub-parse reuse, which enables exponential reductions in inference complexity and better sample complexity. It needs to be validated via experiments to be convincing.  - There are various issues in the statements/formulations. For instance, the statement in line 122~124 is inappropriate and y = (y0, . . . , yn) in line 79 is wrong.â€¨
