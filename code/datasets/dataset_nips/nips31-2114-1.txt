This paper proposes a method to include domain knowledge within the Predictive State Representation framework for learning dynamics model. Essentially, the PRS is augmented with a user defined history->state function. The paper shows how to shows how this user defined partial state reduces the model size. The paper seems technically sound, is well written and makes a modest but clear contribution to the field. For comments (in no particular order), see below.  ================= QUALITY ========================  - The explanation of the aircraft experiment does not contain what space the distances comes from. This would be helpful to understand the size of the paper. - The explanation of the increased state dimensionality for the Algorithm in section 4.1 is strange, as the result in Theorem 3 does not depend on ||f(h)||. While the extreme case is a useful thought experiment, and probably helpful, the text as written is misleading. - The interpretation of the results should more clearly state which results are shown in Figure 1, and which must be looked up in the appendix. Particularly for the low-data-regime statements. - A discussion of the limitations and suggestions for further research is missing. There is some discussion in Appendix F, but this is a) incomplete in terms of presentation, i.e., omission of details and not as well written b) not referred to in the text. Given  the importance of what was found, both these issues should be adressed, preferably with a small discussion added in the main body. - The different choices for f(h) in the experiments do not inspire confidence that the approach can use easy-to construct f(h) in many settings. While it is shown that the approach learns to neglect useless parts of f(h), further discussion/references about useful f(h) would be beneficial.  ================= CLARITY ======================== - Compliments for the readability of this rather technical paper. The order of presentation, and the discussion/interpretation of the theorems are very helpful. - The use of a numerical footnote-symbol in definition 2 and 3 is better avoided. - Appendix B1 can be incorporated in the text. - The sentence "smoothly converges to match PSR" seems backwards (PSR approaches the PSR-f performance as sample size increases) .  ================= ORIGINALITY/SIGNIFICANCE======== - The contribution of this paper is clear: extending the PSR-approach to include prior information in the form of a partial state.  - The authors do not make clear to whom the original idea for their PSR-formulation (Section 3) belongs. Some further references to proofs mentioned in that section would also be helpful.   == ERRATA== page 8: componens
