The current advances in neural networks have amazing experimental results but they lack good theoretical understanding. This paper is another attempt in linking some neural networks to methods of statistical physics (see e.g. also “The Loss Surfaces of Multilayer Networks”, Choromanska et al., AISTATS 2015).  The paper has several very interesting ideas, derivations, and insights, even though the final results are not overwhelming.
