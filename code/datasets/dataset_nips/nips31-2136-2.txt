Summary: This paper contributes to a growing body of work that links optimization algorithms and associated gradient flows to certain continuous time ODEs. In particular, this paper reformulates vanilla and accelerated gradient descent, Newton's method and other popular methods in terms of damped oscillator systems with different masses and damping coefficients. The potential energy of the system serves as a Lyapunov function whose decrease rate can then be related to convergence rates of different iteration schemes.  Evaluation: Damped oscillator systems are very well studied;  the notion of potential energy is clearly related to Lyapunov methods which have been previously used for analyzing optimization algorithms. Despite the fact that closely related analyses have appeared recently, the paper is overall well presented and the unifying link to the dynamics of a natural system is insightful.   - The paper is a bit dense and hard to read at places.  - The connection to "A Lyapunov Analysis of Momentum Methods in Optimization" is not fully explained.  - The role of ODE integrator that connects the continuous time dynamics to the actual algorithm is not made clear.
