Strongly Rayleigh measure is distribution over the subsets of a ground set that balances quality and diversity. This paper introduces exponentiated strongly Rayleigh (ESR) that controls balance of diversity and quality. The main contributions of this work are to provide efficient ESR sampling algorithm using fast-mixing MCMC chains, which have been studied for SR measure in prior. The sampling algorithms requires either sampling from SR or swap a single element with proper probability. They analyze the algorithms with bound of mixing time of Markov chain, which is also upper-bounded by closeness between target ESR and a given SR.  As a practical application, they study popular DPPs and dual volume sampling which have applied in numerous machine learning applications. Finally, authors evaluate their algorithms by reporting efficient mixing time. Furthermore, they apply ESR measure for outlier detection and kernel reconstruction tasks with comparable results.  This paper proposes important works as authors first introduce exponentiated SR (ESR) measures, which resolves balancing diversity and quality of sampled subsets. And they first apply E-DPPs (popular classes of ESR) to outlier detection tasks and show reasonable results.  In addition, this paper is very well written and easy to follow up. Overall I believe that this work is enough to accept to NIPS.  Minor typos: The condition in Proposition 2 seems unnatural, i.e., mu \propto mu^p.    ***** I have read the author feedback. I appreciate authors for providing the details about my questions. *****
