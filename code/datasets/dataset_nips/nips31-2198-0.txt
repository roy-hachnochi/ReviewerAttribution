 This work offers a clearly defined extension to TTS systems allowing to build good quality voices (even unseen ones during training of either component) from a few adaptation data-points. Authors do not seem to offer any truly new theoretical extension to "building blocks" of their system, which is based on known components proposed elsewhere (speaker encoder, synthesizer and vocoder are based on previously published models). However, their mutual combination is clever, well-engineered and allows building blocks to by independently estimated in either unsupervised (speaker encoder, where audio transcripts are not needed) or supervised (speech synthesizer) ways, on different corpora. This allows for greater flexibility, reducing at the same time requirements for large amounts of transcribed data for each of the components (i.e. speaker embedding nnet can be more robustly trained on larger amounts of real data to produce good quality speaker embeddings which are later used to condition speech synthesizer for target TTS log-mel spectrograms for the given target voice).   Good points:  - clear, fair and convincing experiments - trained and evaluated on public corpora, which greatly increases reproducibility (portion of the experiments is carried on proprietary data, but all have equivalent experiments constrained to publicly available data)   Weak points:  - it would probably make sense to investigate the additional adaptability in case one gets more data per speaker, it seems your system cannot easily leverage more than 10s of reference speech data   Summary: this is a very good study on generating multi-speaker TTS systems from small amounts of target speaker data. Authors also decouple different models from each other, allowing for greater flexibility on how to estimate each of the working blocks.   My score is somewhere between 8 and 7, I gave 8 because this one is clearly the best paper in my batch, but I understand such specific application study may be of limited interest to the community as a whole. At the same time, it's not my role to decide and leave it to area chair(s).  =====================================================  Post-rebuttal update: thanks for addressing my suggestions. I keep my score.
