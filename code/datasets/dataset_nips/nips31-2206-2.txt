This study considers the role  of  third-order smoothness of nonconvex objective functions in the context of stochastic stochastic optimization.  The results show how this can help in escaping saddlepoints. The core result consist in a novel descent algorithm based on negative curvature estimates.  The  algorithm has decrement guarantees which improve state of the art. The author also design  an efficient  practical algorithm for escaping saddles.  A solid paper which I would accept.
