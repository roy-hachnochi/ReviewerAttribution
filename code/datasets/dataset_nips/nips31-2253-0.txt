The paper presents Polya Gamma augmentation of Thompson Sampling for contextual bandits providing an alternative to Laplace approximation, an as existing Bayesian solution. The paper presents extensive experimental results considering both synthetic and real data to demonstrate PG-TS's superiority over Laplace-TS.   Quality: The paper is of high quality.   Clarity: The paper is well-written with a good coverage of relevant literature, motivation of the problem, clear algorithm description, reproducible experimental setup.   Originality: The paper addresses an important problem and provides a novel solution.   Significance: The paper addresses a relevant problem and presents a novel approach that works well in practice.   Question: Under what condition (if any) Laplace-TS can possibly outperform PG-TS?
