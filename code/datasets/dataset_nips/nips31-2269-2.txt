This paper derives a novel algorithm for learning intrinsic rewards for policy-gradient based learning agents. The intrinsic reward definition is based on the Optimal Rewards Framework of Singh et al. The learning is developed into two phases. In the first phase, the algorithm updates the policy parameter to maximize the sum of intrinsic reward and the extrinsic reward. In the second phase, the algorithm updates the intrinsic reward parameters to maximize only the extrinsic reward. The overall effect is to find the intrinsic reward that helps us to maximize the extrinsic reward faster. The authors did an extensive experiment on Atari games and Mujoco domains, and showed improved performance on most of the tasks.  The paper is well written and easy to follow. The experiment is extensive and solid. The idea is simple and interesting. I have only several minor comments.   Sec 3.1. It is nice to mention the REINFOCE algorithm in the related work. Sec 3.2. It is more clear to mention that lambda is a hyper parameter to be tuned. I spent some time wondering if lambda is a parameter to be learned by the algorithm. Equ 4. Do you need to sum t from 1 to T? Equ 5. The notation need to be improved. Here, you are actually taking derivative over J^ex(thetaâ€™) but not J^ex ( J^ex is defined on line 152) Equ 11. Will the gradient becomes too large due to importance sampling?
