The paper studies group-based majority voting.  There is a binary issue with a "correct" answer.  Each voter has some probability of voting the right way.  In the proposed set up, voters are organized into groups of K, and the final decision is a majority vote among the highest-probability voter in each group.  (This is the "max" aggregation function; the authors also study some other options.)  The main finding are that with constant voting cost the optimal group size is constant, while with polynomial voting costs it is near-linear.  The model is reasonably natural and topical.  On a technical level, the arguments are elementary probability calculations --- not trivial, but not particularly illuminating, either.
