This paper addresses the Maximum Inner Product Search (MIPS) problem by using the popular Approximate  Nearest Neighbor Search (ANN Search) technique: Navigable Small World (NSW) graphs. The solution is just replacing the metric distance functions, such as Cosine and L2, by the non-metric function Inner Product. And they claim that this method, ip-NSW, is better than NSW+reduction, which is one of popular solutions for MIPS. They provide theoretical analysis for that. Experimental results show that ip-NSW works very well on MIPS.   Weak points or concerns: (1) It was claimed that this paper is the first to expand similarity graphs on MIPS. But as far as I know there are at least two open source ANN search platforms which implemented Inner Product Search by Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) graphs (links as below). So I think the novelty of this paper is limited. - https://github.com/nmslib/nmslib - https://github.com/nmslib/hnsw (2) The theoretical analysis sounds interesting because the theory analysis for searching in non-metric space is lack in the area. But I should say that the NSW method just builds approximate Delaunay graphs. There is no guarantee, in which level, the property of Delaunay graph holds on the built NSW graph, especially for non-metric distances. The theoretical analysis is only for exact Delaunay graphs but not for approximate ones. So this part is weak also.
