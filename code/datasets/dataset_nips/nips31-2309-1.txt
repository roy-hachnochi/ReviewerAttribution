The paper establishes an upper-confidence bound for the policy evaluation task using a least-squares TD approach. The bound is then used for optimistic exploration to solve the control problem.  The proposed approach is definitely interesting and novel to my knowledge. The derived upper-confidence bounds are only valid for policy evaluation, but they are used to solve the control problem. Therefore there's a gap between theory and practice, which is acknowledged by the authors, but the whole discussion about how to address with heuristics the gap between the validity of the derived upper-confidence bounds (for a fixed policy) and its use in a policy iteration scheme appears in appendix C.  I think the paper would be clearer if it were reorganized. The discussion in appendix C is important in my opinion, and should therefore appear in the main paper. Besides, the description of UCLS should also be in the main part, as this is the algorithm evaluated in the experimental section. The proofs of Th.1 and Cor.1 could be in the appendix.  Minor remarks and typos: l.94: directlty l.129: When make (2): should r_{t+1} be R_{t+1}? (4): it would be clearer to specify that it is whp l.178: upper -> lower? l.203: are constitute p.6: it's -> its l.230, 235: the names of the authors of [44] shouldn't appear l.248: why are the averages computed on different number of runs?
