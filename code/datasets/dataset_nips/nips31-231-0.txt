Summary The authors study the problem of cascade containment. The main idea is that if we have "bad" cascades, we can start "good" cascades to "inoculate" individuals against the bad ones. This results here (1) the problem is worst-case hard, 2) approximate algorithms exist) are related to classical results in influence maximization but differ in that now we aren't just trying to maximize the size of a cascade.  Review I'm not really sure how to review this paper.  I am not an expert in the IM/graph cascade area, so I cannot judge the novelty/correctness of the theorems/algorithms presented here.  However, as someone who has studied this phenomenon empirically, I'm unconvinced that the mathematical model corresponds to the real-world problem of misinformation cascades in social networks.   1) I'm not sure the "innoculation" model is actually a model of how people process misinformation. That is, just revealing that a particular fact (that happens to be aligned with my current beliefs) isn't true is unlikely to make me not believe the fact.   2) I'm not sure I understand who this mechanism is designed for. Is the idea that social networks should find the right people to seed to create these positive cascades? Is that a realistic policy for social networks to actually start doing?
