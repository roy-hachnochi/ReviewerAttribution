In this paper, the task of learning the hierarchical representation of graphs is achieved by stacking GNNs and Pooling layers. The authors first specify the difficulty in stacking GNNs and Pooling layers then propose a differentiable pooling approach called DIFFPOOL to deal with this problem.   The paper is well-written and easily to follow. Besides providing the theoretical formalization and analysis, the authors conducting sufficient experiments to proved that the proposed method outperformed state-of-the-art baselines in five popular tasks. While the number of classes increases to 11 in the dataset named by REDDIT-MULTI-12K, the accuracy (in percent) is quite low, at under 50%. The effects of DIFFPOOL are visualized clearly in Figure 2.   A wide range of references are given. Although the intuition of using hierarchical representation in classification was appeared in previous research such as “Convolutional neural networks on graphs with fast localized spectral filtering” [8], it is worth noting that the proposed model in this paper are able to learn the hierarchical representation end-to-end.  Overall, the contribution to the literature of neural graph nets is clear and significant.
