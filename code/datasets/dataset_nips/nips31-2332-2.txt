This paper presents a hierarchical graph representation learning algorithm with the novel differentiable pooling layers.  Such differentiable pooling layers learn node assignments through standard GNNs, and then based on such node assignments pool and update node representations using such assignments.  Experiments on a few benchmark graph classification tasks show consistent improvement over non-hierarchical baselines.  The differentiable pooling idea proposed in this paper is a nice contribution, and I can see ideas based on this be very useful for learning hierarchical and more and more abstract representations for graphs by pooling on them.  The empirical results presented in the paper also seems convincing.  One question I had about the proposed approach is that, the current approach would assign nodes with similar representations to similar higher level nodes.  This is quite different from the pooling in convnets, which groups pixels that are nearby, rather than grouping pixels that are similar.  Do you ever see non-local nodes be grouped together in DiffPool?  Is this type of pooling by similarity better or worse than pooling by locality?  Overall I quite liked this paper, the presentation is clear and the contribution is sound.  I would recommend to accept this paper.
