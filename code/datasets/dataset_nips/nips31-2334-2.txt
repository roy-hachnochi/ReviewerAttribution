This paper is basically a traditional optimization paper, which introduces a new method (similar, but not equivalent, to admm) for a class of problems (convex with linear constraints). Convergence is provided for the base case, plus a parallel and two strong convexity. variants. The convergence rates are not too surprising (1/k for general convex, 1/k2) if either f or g are strongly convex) The experiments are moderately large data. (not trivial, not surprisingly large).  A weakness of this paper is that it is not all that well motivated, in that we can think of many methods that can accomplish similar tasks with similar per iteration costs (method of multipliers, douglas rachford, pock chambolle). I believe this method has some advantages over each of these, and it would benefit the paper if these were discussed in the introduction. In particular, it seems the observed performance is much better than chambolle pock, so it would be good to have some discussion as to why that might be (is it problem specific? commonly observed? Theoretically verified?)  Also the proofs are pretty involved and rather hard to verify. It might be nice for clarification purposes to have a table of variables, or some other way of easily checking the steps.
