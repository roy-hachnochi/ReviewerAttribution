The manuscript presents an adaptive stimulus selection strategy for P300 BCI. The novelty of the approach is the tractable analytical solution that allows sampling the stimulus space during online BCI use. Preliminary results with 8 study participants suggest the feasibility of the proposed approach.  The strength of the manuscript is idea to use data driven approaches for stimulus presentation and that an analytical solution can be computed online. The method is original and clearly outlined.   The weakness is that with decreasing stimulation time, also the performance decreases. This limits the quality and usefulness of the proposed method. This also raises the question on which method allows more reliable communication. Faster communication with higher errors or slower but more reliable classification. Would be interesting to learn about this relationship. This would allow reader to put the results in proper perspective and may also allow to judge the validity of the authors claims.   Response to the author's rebuttal: I thank the authors for their detailed response. The reviewer, However, still remains comfortable with the initial overall score.
