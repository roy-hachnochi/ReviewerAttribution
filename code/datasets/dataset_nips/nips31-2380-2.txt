 This paper studies the problem of minimizing the population risk by the proposed ZPSGD algorithm.  The main contribution of this work is the new algorithm that can find an \epsilon approximate local minima of this nonconvex optimization problem. The paper is well-written but lacks the numerical results which can show the superiority of the proposed methods compared with the existing works.
