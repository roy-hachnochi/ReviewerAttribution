The paper proposes a framework (CROWN) to efficiently compute for the minimum distortion for a given neural network using linear (and quadratic) upper bounds for the activation functions (that might not be piece-wise linear), generalizing some earlier approaches such as Fast-Lin. The experimental results demonstrate quality comparable with the earlier algorithms.  The paper is well-written, interesting and about a very relevant topic, but the results might be to incremental for NIPS.  Minor comments: 97: It would be helpful to elaborate/highlight further what fast means (such as computational complexity). 97: What does "certified" mean in this context? Does the process result in some verifiable certificate?
