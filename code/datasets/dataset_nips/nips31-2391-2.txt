Summary:  This paper consists of two parts. The first part claims that using gradient descent to train deep network with larger batch size, the parameter \theta converges to areas which have larger Hessian spectrum. The second part claims that with larger batch size, the network model is less robust. It also provides a side result that finding a perturbation direction is essentially a saddle-free problem, which makes this problem easier. Although there exists work which proposed methods to make good use of big batch [1] [2], this paper still concludes that big batch size have negative impact on training, based on several experiments.  Strengths:  This work designs several experiments, including visualizing the landscape of the loss,  comparing the spectrum between robust model and original model, to backup its main claims. The experiment results seem reliable. These experiments almost cover every aspects that people need to show about the effect of batch size and the relationship between the batch size and the robustness. Meanwhile, the way the authors interpret the experimental results seems reasonable.  The results delivered in this paper will have great impact on both the theory and practice of the deep learning.  Weaknesses:  The major weakness of this work is that it only runs experiments on two small datasets MNIST and CIFAR10. Since modern deep learning training task is much more complex, and the behavior of the network model heavily depends on the sample size $n$, the conclusion the authors draw will be more convincing if the authors can run experiments on datasets with at least moderate size, where $10^5 < n < 10^8$.
