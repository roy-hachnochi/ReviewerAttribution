*** POST-REBUTTAL *** I acknowledge authors response and increase the score as mentioned.  *** PRE-REBUTTAL *** This paper presents a new practical algorithm for finding exact solution to trembling-hand equilibrium of zero-sum extensive form games  The idea of the paper is nice, while the high-level picture is relatively easy to explain (and authors do a good job in doing so). It boils to having an efficient way of checking whether the basis of LP for a given epsilon is stable - in other words, whether it does not change if we were to decrease the epsilon. Using this oracle, one simply keeps decreasing the epsilon until the epsilon is small enough for the corresponding LP to have a stable basis.  Quality  + Results and methods well supported by the provided theorems.  + Experiments evaluated on nice set of games  + Strong empirical results  - My main issue is that the authors apparently made an error during the submission process. The supplementary PDF is the same as the submission PDF. This is very unfortunate since the supplementary PDF was supposed to contain proofs to the very key theorems of the paper (e.g. Theorem 5, 6).  I am forced to at this point give a reject score for the submission. If authors upload the correct supplementary material with the key proofs, I will happily increase the score to 9 (“excellent submission”) since it is a very nice paper.  Clarity + Authors do a good at explaining the idea  + Logical flow of the paper is well structured  - In the abstract, you should state that the result is about two-player zero-sum games, not just zero-sum games.  Originality:   + The method is original, and the key idea behind the stable basis for trembling equilibrium seem to be novel  + Authors do a good job of separating previous work and how it relates here  Significance  + Practically increasing the game size for which the computation of the mentioned solution concept is feasible is a significant contribution
