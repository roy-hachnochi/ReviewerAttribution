This paper proposes a type of matrix factorization by replacing nuclear norm with it's equivalent Frobius norm and considered seeveral nonconvex loss functions. It then derive a computationing method to solve the system. The proposed method is run on several data sets to show it's validity.  Strengths.  It consider a set of loss functions such as Gemem, Laplace, etc.   It derive several theoretical results.  Extensive experients on several data sets.  Weakness.  The proposed method is  a slight variant of the widely studied  nuclear norm regularized formulation such a RPCA. Since nuclear norm || Z||_* = min {UV=Z}  (||U||^2 + ||V||^2)/2 [Straingely, this well-known formula is not explained in this highly math paper!!!] Thus the paper has very little novalty.   The weighting W has also appeared in many research papers.  Although experiment show some results, the paper did not compare with many similar formulations using nuclear norm, and also the reasons of the differences.
