This work is regarding multi-armed bandits problem where the controller is able to set compensation in order to guide greedy players out of seemingly optimal alternatives. The paper itself is well written with sound structure and clear demonstration. In particular, this paper proposed a "known-compensation MAB" setting, which is interesting in a theoretical point of view as well as for application scenario. In addition to some bounds proved for the newly proposed setting, the authors also demonstrate the counterparts of the existing MAB policies for the proposed KCMAB scenario including epsilon-greedy, Thompson sampling, and UCB. I think this work is innovative and good enough to be considered publication in NIPS.
