In this paper, the authors have proposed a new vector quantization technique for CNN gradient compression. GradiVeQ enables direct aggregation of compressed gradients. I have the following concerns about this paper. (1) The authors claim that existing techniques could perform poorly when used together with decentralized aggregation protocols. But they did not justify this in their paper. (2) The authors did not analyze the computational complexity of the proposed method. This should be included in the rebuttal. (3) The experiments are not convincing. The authors only employ CIFAR 100, which is not enough for this conference.
