To cope with symmetric nonnegative matrix factorization with fast optimization algorithms, this paper transfer the traditional formulation into a simple framework with a splitting property, which makes efficient alternating-type algorithms feasible for solving the symmetric NMF problem. Based on ANLS and HALS for NMF, this paper proposes two optimization algorithms to solve the transfered problem in an alternating manner, and theoretically guarantees that critical points can be found by these algorithms with at least a sublinear convergence rate. This is an interesting and well-written paper, and the proposed algorithms are original and technically sound. Practical results on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate the efficiency of proposed algorithms in terms of convergence analysis and clustering accuracy, compared with popular algorithms for symmetric NMF. I have some minor concerns on this manuscript, and I would expect the author(s) to reconsider the following specific points before publication. 1. The norms used in the paper should be clearly defined. For example, what does the matrix L2-norm used in Theorem 2 mean? 2. As Corollary 1 and 2 shown, the algorithms converge to the critical point only if $\lambda$ is sufficiently large. Thus, it would be helpful for readers to better understand the behaviors of the algorithms by providing a sensitivity analysis of $\lambda$, rather than simply setting $\lambda=1$ in experiments. 3. Details of text and presentation can be improved. For example, Line 150. 'enable' -> 'enables'. Line 195. 'there do exist' -> 'there does exist'. Line 205. '+' -> '-'. There is a similar problem in Step 3 of Algorithm 2. Algorithm 2. In Steps 4 and 5, the squared L2-norm, rather than Frobenius norm, should be applied on the term $\mathbf{u}_i-\mathbf{v}_i$. Line 253. 'converge' -> 'converges'. Line 282. 'dataset' -> 'datasets'. Table 1. The result in the 2nd row of item TDT2 should be boldface.
