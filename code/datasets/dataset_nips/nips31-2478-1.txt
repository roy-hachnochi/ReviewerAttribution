[Edit: the authors have nicely addressed my comments so I have upgraded my score] The problem of link prediction is a major graph mining problem. Recently, Zhang and Chen (KDD 2017) proposed a new framework for link prediction that leverages the subgraph of small diameter around the  link to be predicted. This is achieved using graph neural networks, that get trained on various such subgraphs. In this work the authors extend the KDD paper in the following ways: first they provide a generic theorem (theorem 2) that essentially shows that for a general form of link prediction scores (equation 1), few hops around the link-to-be-predicted suffice.  The authors proceed to show that several important existing link prediction methods fall under this general form, including Katz, PR, and SimRank.  Then the authors propose the SEAL algorithm. While it uses neural networks, the way the data is fed to the NN is really neat. They provide an encoding of the subgraph network, as well as using any additional attribute information. The experimental results look nice, but as the authors discuss in the appendix, scaling to larger network is an issue for which they already propose certain heuristics.   I enjoyed reading this paper, it is well written, and makes several clean contributions. On the negative side, it is incremental over the KDD 17 paper in my opinion, both conceptually and with respect to the experimental gains. Scalability is another issue too.
