This paper studies the problem of link prediction, where instead of defining heuristic measures for such purpose, the authors propose a new framework to learn “heuristics” from local subgraphs. They justify their approach both theoretically and experimentally. I am reasonably familiar with the literature due to my own research in this area.  Overall this is a very good paper. I particularly like the elegant theory that unifies a number of heuristic measures used for link prediction, which not only solidifies previous understanding but also inspires new thoughts. The SEAL framework proposed on top of the theory is a nice way of learning heuristics by combining both classic node-level features and a recent graph convolutional network approach. The experiments involve extensive comparisons with state-of-the-art and look convincing. Finally, the way the paper is presented, which uses concise language to convey meaningful insights, is much appreciated and makes the paper a joy to read. I therefore strongly recommend the paper to be accepted.  Below are a few detailed comments that may further improve the quality of the paper: - lines 166 and 173. It is better to choose using either $|Gamma(j)$ or $|Gamma(v_j)$, but consistently; - line 254: it is not very clear how $X$ is constructed from what encoding vectors; - line 265: this trick is interesting and perhaps deserves further investigation. My intuition is that although it partially resolve the problem, it also renders the embedding features less meaningful; - in the experiments it would have been nice to see some “real world” link prediction task, where we aim for predicting links added in future snapshots of the network; - it would also be interesting to extend the current framework to the problem of predicting link removals, which together with predicting link additions may constitute a nice framework for predicting network evolution in general.
