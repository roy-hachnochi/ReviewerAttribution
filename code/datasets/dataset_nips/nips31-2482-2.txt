Interesting concept but not sure how relatively valuable the contribution is. Quality of the writing is good and creativity of the idea. No issues with novelty and clarity, and the authors have addressed data concerns with comparable experiments within the similar category. Some concerns with the data have already been outlined by the authors. It would have been nice to read further suggestions or solutions to address those concerns.
