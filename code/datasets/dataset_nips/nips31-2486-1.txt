Summary: -------------  This paper considers sample complexity bounds for discounted MDPs given a generative model. An algorithm is provided for which an optimal sample complexity bound is proven. This bound is the same as the bound given by Azar, Munos & Kappen (2013), but also holds for epsilon bigger than 1/sqrt{S}, where S is the number of states. The algorithm has a run-time bound that equals the bound on the sample complexity.    Assessment: ----------------  The paper combines techniques from the papers [AMK13] and [SWWY18] to close a small gap in the PAC bounds of [AMK13] for larger epsilon. This is basically done by an algorithm that given an input policy, after taking \tilde{O}(SA/(1-gamma)^3) samples returns a policy with half the error of the input policy.   The paper is sufficiently well-written to be able to follow, although a few things could be made clearer (cf. comments below) and some proof-reading, streamlining and polishing would be needed. In particular, I found the discussion of the run-time complexity a bit confusing. I didn't have a closer look at the proofs in the Appendix, the main part at least contains the most important steps and the main ideas.  Overall, this is an ok paper. It makes a bit of progress, even if it fills just a small (and in my opinion not that significant) gap in a research direction that I personally do not consider that important. Given that the submitted version is not quite ready for publication, in my view this is a borderline paper.    Comments: ---------------  - I'd skip the reference to the finite-horizon case from Abstract and refer in the Introduction directly to the Appendix, if there is not enough space to say anything about this setting in the main part of the paper.  - The discussion of related work is sometimes a bit unclear. (I'd suggest to merge the respective parts of Sections 1 and 5. This would also give space to include more of the technical material or details about the work on the finite horizon case in the main part.) For example, in l.51 it is claimed that if one uses the methods of [AMK13] the sample complexity bound one obtains scales with (1-gamma)^{-5}. I did not understand this, as the bounds in the latter paper have a different dependence on gamma. In lines 284-294 it is said that the run-time complexity of [AMK13] "is dominated by the time needed to construct the empirical model". Does this refer to computing the estimated transition probabilities and rewards? That the run-time for epsilon = O(1/sqrt{S}) is "not sublinear in the size of the MDP model" (l.288) applies not only to [AMK13] but also to the bounds in the paper, right?  - In l.4 of Alg.2, I guess v^(i-1) and pi^(i-1) are supposed to be the input parameters for the HALFERR routine. (I'd suggest to apply VR-QVI right away instead of introducing another algorithm HALFERR.)   - The ALT 2012 paper of Hutter&Lattimore is missing in the references.  - Are references [Ber13a] and [Ber13b] the same?   Post-Rebuttal: ------------------ Thanks for the clarifications. Overall, I stick to my assessment for the moment. The used techniques are mainly present already in the references [AMK13] and [SWWY18], while the right gamma-dependence has already been shown in [AMK13]. I definitely think that the results should be published, I'm not so convinced that the paper has to be at NIPS.
