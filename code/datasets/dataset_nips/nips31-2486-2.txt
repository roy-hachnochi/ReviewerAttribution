This paper gives a new algorithm that can obtain the already known complexity lower bound whose dependency on (1-\gamma) is (1-\gamma)^{-3}. Previous work [SWWY18] can obtain (1-\gamma)^{-4} result by means of the monotonicity technique and the variance reduction technique. The Bernstein technique can remove the last factor (1-\gamma) by lowering the error accumulation. This is a very good work.  However, there are a lot of typos, hindering the correct understanding of it. Especially, these typos make it very hard to check the proof. As a result, I think this paper is not ready to be published until its incorrectness can be corrected and modified. I list severe typos here. 1. What’s the purpose of your using \tilde{\pi}^{(i)} in line 25 of Algorithm 1? It seems that you don’t aim to update it. I think it is an intermediate quantity to update \pi^{(i)}(s) just like the way \tilde{v}^{(i)}(s) helping compute v^{(i)}(s). Additionally, what if the condition in line 26 in Algorithm 1 fails to be satisfied? From the proof of Lemma 4.4, I guess you will assign \tilde{v} to v and \tilde{\pi} to \pi, please complete it. 2. I wonder what \mu in the phrase“(1-\gamma)\mu”in line 162 means. Maybe it is a clerical error and should be u. The power of (1-\gamma) in line 226 should be -3.  3. The RHS of the first inequality of line 564 is wrong, since gamma will not appear in the denominator of the second term, if you plug line 562 into it. What’s more. In line 563, the constant upper bound for the first inequality is not 2 but one larger than 2, which is not harmful to the main result but less rigorous. The second equality of line 565 is incorrect, but it is fine to ignore this mistake and then focus on the inequality, which determines the order of m_1.
