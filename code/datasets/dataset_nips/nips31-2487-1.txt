Authors are interested in the problem of reducing the computational cost of large-scale neural networks trained for image recognition. It is a fundamental deep learning problem as the state-of-the-art in image recognition relies on computationally heavy models that require compression to run on resource-limited devices. Based on previously proposed MobileNets, which rely on depth-wise separable convolution, authors propose to replace the fully connected operation used to map the input channels to the outputs channels after depth-wise convolution by a 1-D convolution which drastically reduce the number of parameters. Moreover, they extend this operation to group convolutions and use their model to replace the fully connected classification layer by a convolutional one. Experiments on ImageNet show that the model provides a very good trade-off between accuracy and computational cost (both in terms of parameters and FLOPs), compared to MobileNets and other baselines. Moreover they show that by using width multipliers they can further reduce the number of parameters with a loss in performance which is inferior to comparable baselines. The paper is overall well written but as the vocabulary is heavy (e.g. "depth-wise separable channel-wise convolution) and differences between different types of convolutions can be subtle, the paper could really benefit of making Section 3 easier to follow (more figures). The experiments are convincing and the simplicity of the proposed modifications make this contribution particularly interesting as it could easily be reused in the future.
