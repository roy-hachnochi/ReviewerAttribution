The authors propose an improved version of depth-wise separable convolutions by replacing the fully-connected 1x1 convolutional part with a more sparsely connected layer, which still keeps most of the representational power. In addition, they propose to replace the average pooling layer followed by a fully-connected classifier layer at the end of the network with a single convolutional layer that only uses a small subset of features in the last layer, further reducing the number of parameters. The proposed approach achieves a 10-20% reduction in the number of parameters and FLOPS compared to MobileNet on ImageNet, without a significant decrease in accuracy.  The paper is very wordy and convoluted. Although the idea seems relatively simple I did not manage to parse all the details. One thing that seems especially odd to me in how the number of parameters in the classification layer is computed. The authors propose to assign m - n parameters to this layer, where m is the feature dimension of the penultimate layer of the network and n is the number of classes. According to this, a 2-way classifier will require a lot more parameter than a 1000-way, which is counterintuitive. Moreover, if n > m the number of parameters becomes negative. Is there any meaning behind this equation that I'm missing or is it simply incorrect?  Overall, the paper seems to contain a non-trivial contribution, but I can't asses it properly due to the unclear presentation and a lack of expertise in the field.  After reading the other reviews I'm going to increase my score. I still find the reasoning for selecting the number of parameters in the classification layer provided by the authors in the rebuttal to be speculative, and doubt that the presentation will improve significantly in the camera-ready version, but think the paper can be accepted nevertheless.
