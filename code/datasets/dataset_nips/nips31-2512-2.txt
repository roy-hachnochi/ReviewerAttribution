This paper provides a convex duality framework for analyzing GANs, many previous works are just special cases under this framework. All the proofs are based on the function space for both the discriminator and the generator which are constrained to a convex set, but in reality, it should be based on parametric space and the optimization is not convex. To use the theorems proposed in this paper, the authors use a linear combination of neural network functions instead. In the experiments, they get good results when using a linear combination of the same already trained neural net. The authors should emphasize the theoretical results are valid on the functional space, but not in the parameter space. The experiments are rather weak, they should provide results of using various combinations of neural net functions and see how the results behave.   line 106 framework typo
