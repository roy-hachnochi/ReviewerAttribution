Taking into account discussion after author's response, I agree that questions about discussion and relationship to prior work are relatively minor. The most critical issue for this reviewer was that local recurrence was not modeled and across layers useful recurrent patterns were not summarized in a way that can inform the development of either experiments or theoretical (analytical) studies.  This submission addresses the question of how recurrent interactions can improve object classification performance of deep convolutional networks. Authors find that certain long-range recurrent interactions that skip layers improve performance on an object classification task. The weaknesses of this work is that it strongly overstates its claims and does not provide error-bars on performance from different initialization states. Another weakness is that the type of recurrence that is reported to be beneficial -- recurrent interactions across layers -- does not resemble local recurrence for which cortical circuits are known for. Finally, the introduction and discussion of the results are based on a large number of unpublished studies from the arxiv and ignores results from peer-reviewed literature on simpler and more closely related to neural circutry models than convolutional deep networks. Examples of these papers by Nishimoto and Gallant J Neurosci 2011 who systematically tested the contribution of different types of nonlinearities and ultimately determined a non-convolutional model to be the optimal one within the tested family of models. Similarly, a non-convolutional models was selected by Liu et al PNAS 2016 as the one achieving best predictive power in V2.
