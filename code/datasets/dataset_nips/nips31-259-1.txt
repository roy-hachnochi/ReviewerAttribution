In this paper, the authors study the problem of maximization of approximately submodular functions. They offer good guarantees for both cardinality and general matroid constraints. Here are a few detailed comments, 1. For the three motivations (revealed preference theory etc.) the author mentioned in introduction, the approximated surrogate function is the sum of a submodular function and some error but the problem they study is the product. Can the author give more explanation on the relation between both settings? Or can the author give some example of applications that directly involve the product form? 2. It is very interesting that the guarantee the author showed in the paper, i.e. 1-1/e and 1/(P+1), looks like the classical guarantees of naive greedy on submodular max. Can the algorithms be applied to simple submodular max? 3. Whatâ€™s is running time of the proposed algorithms? It is better to, at least, have some synthetic dataset experiments and compare with some traditional algorithms (e.g. greedy) for both performance and running time.
