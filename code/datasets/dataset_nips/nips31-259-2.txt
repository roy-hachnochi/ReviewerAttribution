This is a very theoretically intensive paper on approximating submodular function optimization problems. The authors investigate improved accuracy for solving the submodular function optimization problems through information theoretical approaches. The contributions sound interesting and the problem of study is quite interesting to IJCAI audience.   While improving accuracy is one hand of approximating submodular function optimization problems, efficiency is another important aspect of such approximation algorithms. It seems that the authors do not really look into the improved efficiency. In addition, the paper has developed a set of theoretical results; however, it seems that no empirical studies have been conducted to demonstrate the perforation of the approximation algorithms, which may be also important for the approximation.   There is no conclusion and future work sections in this paper. Did the authors wrap up this work?   Overall an interesting paper may require more polished work.
