This paper studies k-means clustering in Euclidean spaces under differential privacy constraints. In the classical DP setup, the result improves all existing works in this field, obtaining constant multiplicative factor and $poly(k,d,\log n,1/eps)$ additive error. This resolves an important open question in this field and closes a long line of research in pursuit of private clustering algorithm. The paper also establishes results for the local DP setup, and gets $O(n^{2/3})$ additive error with $O(1)$ rounds of communication.  I think this is a very interesting paper with solid contribution in this field. The algorithm follows the strategy by Balcan et al.,(2017): a candidate set of centers is first constructed in a private way, on which they can run private clustering algorithm in discrete space by Gupta et al. The previous approach gives $O(\log^3 n)$ approximation ratio due to the mismatch between hierarchical partition and Euclidean norm. The approach proposed in this paper overcomes this difficulty by exploring the data points at different scales using non-hierarchical partitions by locality sensitive hashing. I would like to see this paper published on NIPS advancing the frontiers in this area. The claimed contribution for the core-set part is not well-justified, however. It is known that cluster centers with appropriate weights themselves serve as constant-factor core-set, so it's not some new contribution in addition to the clustering part. Actually, the open problem proposed by Feldman et al., (2009) is about (1+a) approximation for arbitrarily small a>0.
