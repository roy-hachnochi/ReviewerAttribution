 The paper introduces the community exploration problem, which can be seen as a resource allocation problem whose goal is to divide resources among several disjoint sub-communities such that the number of distinct community members encountered is maximized.  The paper contributes with algorithms (and an extensive theoretical analysis thereof) for the offline setting of the community exploration problem when the sizes of communities are known, as well as for an online setting, when the sizes of the communities need to be learned.     The paper is well written, I enjoyed reading it. The problem is interesting and the results are significant and sound (as far as I could check).  Just one comment: there are no empirical tests to allow to observe the behavior of the algorithm on a real-world data problem. For instance, in what application are communities really disjoint?  Even for a more simulated setting, what is the difference in empirical performance between adaptive and non-adaptive strategies?        Despite the lack of experiments, I vote for accepting the submission for the nice, clear explanations (of the problem and of the proposed algorithms) and for the in-depth theoretical study.
