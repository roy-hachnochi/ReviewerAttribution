This paper considered incentive mechanism design in crowdsourcing. Compared to the existing works that focused on one-shot static solutions, this paper proposed a novel inference aided reinforcement mechanism that can learn to incentivize high quality-data sequentially without any prior assumptions.  The problem itself is quite interesting and the solutions are promising. Some minor concerns are listed as follows (a) A Bayesian inference model is considered in this paper.  However, Bayesian model is impractical in many applications due to memory and computation constraints in the system. Do this issues exist in this work? What is the complexity of this inference model? Also is it possible to consider a non-Bayesian model here?  (b) There are some assumptions in Section 2. First, for the assumptions on the \mathbb{P}_{i, H}, \mathbb{P}_{i, L} and c_{i, H}, c_{i, L}, are the values are commonly used in the literature? Do the choices of these values have an impact on the results or not? Second, for equation (2), workers are assumed to be risk-neutral, hence, is risk- neutral an underlying assumption for all workers and data requester in this paper?  (c) Dominant strategy incentive compatible (IC) and individually rational (IR) are two properties people usually have to take care of in mechanism design especially with self-interested users.  From the Reinforcement Incentive Learning (RIL) algorithm, it is clear that IC has been well addressed. How the algorithm guarantee IR? Is something I missed here?
