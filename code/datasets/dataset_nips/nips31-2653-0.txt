The paper proposes hessian-vector product free first-order stochastic algorithms that also have second-order convergence guarantee (converge to second order stationary points). The key advantage of the methods being that the complexity is linear in terms of the dimensionality of the problem.  Related work has been discussed in detail and I particularly like the idea of putting Table1 at the very beginning to put the proposed method in perspective alongside other existing work. I also appreciated the fact that the authors acknowledged another very similar work that has appeared online. The authors have delved deeper into the theoretical guarantees and that is a plus of this work.  I like the fact that Neon or Neon+ can be used as a black-box to replace the second-order methods for computing NC. This extends its applicability to variety of  use-cases.  The readability of the paper could be improved and it might help with some reorganization of content. It reads very verbosely to me at this point. The intuition and key  results in certain theorems can be summarized in words to make it useful to the reader (for e.g. Theorem 2). Adding a Conclusion section with future directions of work would be helpful.
