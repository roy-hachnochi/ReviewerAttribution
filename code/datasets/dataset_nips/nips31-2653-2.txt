This paper proposes a new algorithm for finding second order stationary points for stochastic, second-order smooth and nonconvex problems, using only first order informations. One of the key building blocks of this paper is the so-called NEON method to escape the strict saddle point. Overall, the big picture of this paper is clearly presented. However, many details and technical proofs are badly written, making overall the paper hard to evaluate.   Below are some problems that I am interested in.   (1) The authors of this paper are pretty careful in analyzing the dependence of their method with respect to the dimensionality $d$. However, I do think that the constants G and V in the Assumptions 1 (iii) and 1 (iv) are linearly dependent on $d$ in a bunch of applications. Please elaborate more onto this point in the rebuttal.   (2) This paper seems to suggest that they are considering the problem under stochastic setting. However, the main contribution of this paper, to me, seems to lie within analyzing how to quickly escape saddle points fast under \emph{deterministic} setting. It seems to me the analysis here in Theorem 1 and Theorem 2 are new (while understanding that a large part of the proofs are adapted from Nesterov's acceleration paper and reference [11] and [12]), and the analysis here in Theorem 3 is basically a trivial combination of existing analysis for deterministic setting and some concentration bounds. Hence, I am a little bit confused about what the actual contribution of this paper is when reading this paper.   (3) I really hope the author clarify more clearly about their contribution of this paper. Moreover, the writing of this paper needs to be strengthened. It took me a long time to figure out that the constants \mathcal{F, P, J, U, r} etc. on the negative curvature $\eta$ is changed from Theorem 1 to Theorem 2.   Overall, I give a weak acceptance for this paper.
