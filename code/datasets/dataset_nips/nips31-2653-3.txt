This paper considers first-order (FO) stochastic non-convex optimization problems. Authors propose FO procedures to extract negative curvature directions  from the Hessian which are referred to as NEON. Next, they combine these with FO stochastic algorithms to find critical points. Time complexities, and dependence on the problem dimension is established for approximate second-order stationary points.  The results of this paper are good, but the paper is not written carefully. I find the statements of the theorems not clear,  and several important remarks are hard to parse. The paper requires significant additional work.  Assumption 1-ii: Isn't this always true for any reasonable function? Assumption 1-iii: Please explicitly state the sub-gaussianity. I think it is OK to assume that the constant G does not depend on the dimension d due to  rotation invariance of sub-gaussian random variables; however, I am not sure about the constant V in Assmp. 1-iv. In general, V (the variance) should be of order d as it is the trace of dxd matrix.  I would be happy to see a discussion about these constants and their dependence on the dimension. When is this assumption used?  How does the dependence of V to dimension d affect the  claimed linear dependence result? Which constants are affected?   Can you provide an argument why |\hat{x}_\tau| is expected to be small? Steps leading up to that point is clear, and this would improve readability.  In Thm. 1, does c_max only depend on \hat{c}?  NEON requires the knowledge of \mathcal{F}, hence the parametes L_1, L_2, \gamma, \delta.  Please include a discussion on this: how would you estimate those in practice?  Thm. 1,2,&3 operates under Asmp.1 (at least partially?),  but this is not stated explicitly. The statements of the Thm.'s and the underlying assumptions are not transparent. For example in Thm.3, the reader cannot figure out the required mini-batch size to make the constants sufficiently small,  whether these assumptions are reasonable or not. This is a very important conclusion of that theorem as it operates under mini batches.   Line 170 would be a good place to explain why you are trying to match the complexity of Lanczos.  A brief discussion after each thm would improve the presentation significantly.  Statement in line 220 is very important but hard to parse.  It would be great to see a detailed comparison with [2] in the updated version.  - line 48: extract - line 87: Is [t] ever used? - line 88: sphere of an Euclidean ball, also perhaps use S_r^{d-1} - line 117: maximum eigen-vector - line 175: smaller than - ..
