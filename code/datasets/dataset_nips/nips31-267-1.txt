In this paper, the authors analize the graph matching problem, with special focus on concave relaxations.  The paper is very well organized. I really liked the introduction, which is like an extended abstract. It is well written in general, it's didactical and it's easy to follow. Good work.  The main contributions are in the study of conditional concave energies (when restriced to the linear subspace resulting from the convex hull of the matching set), where they prove that certain family of graphs fall in this categoty, and then the stochastic version, where they study these properties in probability.  The math seems to be ok, and it's somehow elegant.  I would have liked some experimets with "traditional" graphs, i.e., undirected unweighted graphs (with binary symmetric adjacency matrix), since the fact that the matrices are binary, may break some hipothesis (I'm thinking in the Hessian drawn from some probability space), and it would be interesting to see the results in practice.  I really liked the paper in general.  Regarding the bibliography: The ds++ paper is published in ACM Transactions on Graphics (the paper refers to the arxiv version).  Also, there are three other papers that may have some common points with this work.  The classical Umeyama work: An eigendecomposition approach to weighted graph matching problems. PAMI 1988  And two works regarding the convex hull relaxation:   - A linear programming approach for the weighted graph matching problem, HA Almohamad, SO Duffuaa, PAMI, 1993.   - On spectral properties for graph matching and graph isomorphism problems.
