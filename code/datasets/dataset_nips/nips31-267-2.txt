This paper deals with the in general NP-hard graph matching problem, which has been intensively studied over years, whereby many ad-hoc empirical methods are devised. While this paper gives a fresh and important anlysis to some special cases (but often common in practice)  and lead to effective graph matching algorithms.  This paper is well written and the information is very intensive, whereby closely related works are well covered.  Pros: 1) prove there is a large class of affinity matrices resulting in conditionally concave 2) generalize the notion of conditionally concave energies to probably conditionally concave energies, the authors further show the fact that probably conditionally concave energies  are very common in many affinity matrix. This suggests the usefulness of the proposed method derived from these findings. 3) for the case of not probably conditionally concave, the authors devise a variation of the Frank-Wolfe algorithm using a concave search procedure wherenby concave search is used to replace the standard line search 4) the experimental results on multiple datasets are very impressive, and the improvement is notable and consistent  Minor comments: Reference [Vestner et al., 2017] does not contain the venue information, it is a CVPR 2017 paper. In the final version, it would be nice to add a conclusion section in the end whereby possible future work can also be discussed. I suggest Table 2 caption shall contain more information about the performance measurement i.e. average and standard deviation of energy differences, not only stated in the main text. Also the algorithm name in table 2 shall be explicitly mentioned in the main text.
