Summary: A manifold valued regression is formulated based on a framework of structured data prediction. The author extends theoretical framework proposed for the discrete structured prediction to a continuous scenario of the manifold valued output.   Overall evaluation: The analysis for the manifold prediction is interesting, which seemingly has not been widely studied. The experimental verification is slightly weak.   Other comments: - The experimental comparison is mainly with kernel regularized least squares (KRLS), but KRLS is a quite general regression method, and thus it is not clear if KRLS is appropriate baseline for each specific task.  - Section 4.2 is not convincing for me. The baseline method should use the same loss function. As the author pointed out, KRLS does not optimize (15) and thus it is trivial that the proposed method show better accuracy in terms of (15). Since the loss function (15) itself would not be author's novelty, I don't think the results in Table 2 is meaningful comparison. A possible comparison would be comparing with some other model optimized by the same loss function (15).
