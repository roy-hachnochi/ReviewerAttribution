This paper proposes to incorporate unsupervised object segmentation networks into deep reinforcement learning. The segmentation network is based on SfM-Net and can be jointly trained with the policy. I think this is an interesting idea and seems to be working well on standard setups. Because of this, I recommend acceptance for this paper.  My main concern is the comparison to attention-based RL. The idea of using object mask seems to be very similar to using attention, which is not discussed enough and compared in the experiment. The main difference is that the object mask in this paper uses the strong prior that "objects" are useful, while attention can be fully data-driven. I'm wondering how does attention-based RL compare to this work, and particularly with some form of object mask pretraining/fine-tuning.
