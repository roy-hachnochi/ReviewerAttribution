This paper proposes a novel moving object oriented deep RL method. The new method first performs unsupervised segmentation to the moving objects in a video, and then learns better policy and value based on the obtained moving object segmentation mask and optical flow. During the actor-critic model learning, the segmentation network is also further updated to better segment the moving objects when the training data changes in distribution.  Pros: 1. The motivation of object oriented RL is reasonable and should be promising. 2. The proposed method is based on unsupervised learning which utilizes flow information and reconstruction constraint, and does not require labeled data. This is useful in the practical usage. 3. Experimental results show the superiority of the method over previous ones.  Cons: The experiment section is somewhat weak. First, the method is only evaluated on Atari game. More virtual gyms can be used to run the proposed method but not been tried. Second, more ablation studies are desired, e.g. the effects of flow regularization, the use of curriculum by linearly increasing reg coefficients.
