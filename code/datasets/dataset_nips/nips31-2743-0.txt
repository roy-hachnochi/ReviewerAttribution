 This paper gives an algorithm for learning convex polytopes with a given margin.  A convex polytope is an intersection of some number of halfspaces.  The margin is defined as a notion of distance between the boundary of the polytope and the datapoints (the paper points out there are multiple definitions for this quality).  The main result of this paper is to give a polynomial dependence on t, the number of halfspaces comprising the polytope in the runtime of the algorithm, which gives a super polynomial improvement over past work.  These results are nearly tight, as a polynomial dependence on the margin is not possible if P \neq NP.  This result is a nice improvement, and hence I am positive about it.  The main downside of this paper is uses a lot of previously known results in a rather straightforward manner to achieve this.  The resulting algorithm is quite simple, as is the analysis.  The lower bound also follows fairly straightforwardly from previous work.  However, my resulting impression remains positive.  The paper is well-written and makes progress on a basic problem, so I vote to accept.  comments:  A key argument seems to be in line 250, where the exponential improvement on the dependence on t appears to come from.  This is minor, but it appears in the title.  I think you are missing an article before the word “margin”.    The enumeration in line 249 takes time exponential in t.  The greedy algorithm improves this — so, first, this should be emphasized and not be presented as “alternatively”.  Re Lemma 4: it is a standard exercise to write dot products as a function of distances.  It’s not clear this needs to be a lemma.  minor:  l.115 In Lemma 2, why is the second argument of the max 2(v+1)t\log(3t) and not just 2vt\log(3t)?
