NIPS review: Learning convex polytopes with margin  Overview: This paper studies the problem of learning an unknown polytope P in the realizable PAC setting.  The main results are upper and lower bounds on the sample and computational complexities that depend on (i) “t”, the complexity of representing P as an intersection of half-spaces and (ii) “gamma”, the margin of the input examples (an extension of the classical notion of margin w.r.t half-spaces).  More specifically: 1. Upper bound [Theorem 10]: the main result is a learning algorithm whose running time (and sample complexity) exhibits polynomial dependence on t and an exponential dependence on (1/gamma) 2. Lower bound [Theorem 7]: the exponential dependence on 1/gamma is unavoidable (assuming NP\neq P).  Along the way the authors also establish results in geometry.   The paper is well written (for the most part).  I think this paper makes a significant progress on an interesting problem and provides substantial improvements over previous works (Arriaga and Vempala [2006], and Klivans and Servedio [2008]).   Comments to the authors:  I did not undersatand Theorem 7: 1.  Is “\tilde H” a collection of *half-spaces*? 2. Do you require that “\tilde H” partitions S the same way like “H^*” does?
