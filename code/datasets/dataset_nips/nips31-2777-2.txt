The authors ask how approximate inference could be implemented through some form of sampling scheme in humans. For complex domains it is required to entertain a large number of hypothesis in high dimensional spaces, in which regions of high probability may be separated by large regions of comparatively low probability. The main point of the manuscript is that previously proposed sampling algorithms do not result in 1/f autocorrelations between samples and do not result in distances between samples following a Lévy flight distribution. Here the authors propose to use the previously published MC^3 sampling algorithm, which couples several chains through the Metropolis acceptance rule but only uses the samples from one chain to estimate posteriors. Through simulations in part modeled after previous empirical experiments on human reasoning the authors show that MC^3 shows both the above properties, established empirically.   Overall, the topic is relevant for the computational cognition/neuroscience audience at nips. I am quite surprised that the work by Orbán G, Berkes P, Fiser J, Lengyel M. or Laurence Aitchison, Máté Lengyel is neither mentioned nor discussed. There are no theorems here and no new deep network architectures, but I find the study relevant and interesting.  Looking at figure 1 for the RwM algorithm, the authors should comment on how they chose parameters of the proposal distribution, e.g. the step size, in the chain because this looks as if a particularly disadvantageous choice was selected. The discussion lines 197-206 is helpful but limited. Similarly, how were the temperatures for MC^3 selected or was a parameter search carried out? How many free parameters are there in the different sampling schemes?  [After Author Feedback] Thank you for the clarifications. I still think that this is a relevant and interesting contribution to NIPS.
