This paper proposes a new learning framework to identify effective multitask model for a given multitask problem. This is done by computing task embeddings, using a graph neural network. These embeddings are used to train a function that estimate the relative test error, based on historical multitask experience.  Quality: The technical content of the paper is well explained. The experiment section is very dense (probably due to lack of space) and could be better organized with some subsections.  Clarity: The paper is generally well-written and structured clearly. The Figures 2 and 3 are way to small and can not be read on a printed version (again, probably due to lack of space).  Originality: The main idea of this paper is very interesting and the empirical results look encouraging.   I am not convinced by the argumentation given between line 320 and 325. Even if this experiment is interesting, showing that other functions lead to worse performance do not really "demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed functions"...   Significance: The model is evaluated on standard multi-task evaluation benchmarks and compared with many baseline systems. The paper clearly demonstrate the interest of this model for identifying good multitask model for a new multitask problem.
