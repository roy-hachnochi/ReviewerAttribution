This work proposed an implicit reparametrization trick for gradient estimation for stochastic random variables in latent variable models. The main contribution of this paper is Eq (6), which only requires the differentiation of standardization function, no any (approximation) inverting. Compared with other generalized reparametrization methods (e.g., RSVI), the proposed approach is more efficient. From the perspective of reproducible work, TensorFlow has already been enable this feature in the nightly version. In general, this is a simple but practical idea.
