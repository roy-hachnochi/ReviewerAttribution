Summary: The paper proposed a way to estimate noise transition probabilities for classification using data with label noise. Specifically, the paper introduces a way to instill human cognition prior that specifies the valid and invalid transition between classes via variational learning formulation. The final algorithm involves a discriminator that takes the proposed (by proposal distribution Q) and pre-defined noise transition matrices and train Q to reduce dis-similarity between two transition matrices.  Strength: - The paper proposes a technically sound way to incorporate human cognition prior on the noise transition matrix. - The proposed algorithm learns a correct noise transition matrices for three artificially generated noise transition matrix structures.  Weakness: - Although authors try to explain the STABLE model in a Bayesian framework using variational lower bound, as we see in the final form of the algorithm, it doesn't seem different from a simple regularization method illustrated in Section 3.2.1 when discriminator in Figure 3 corresponds to L2 distance.  - The experimental protocol seems favorable to the proposed method and unfair to previous methods such as loss correction or S-adaptation. For example, one may inject noise transition prior on S-adaptation by setting corresponding \theta values to zero and renormalize after each update.  - In addition, as illustrated in 3.2.1, one can easily include regularization to train noise transition matrix to follow the prior. It doesn't seem like a valid excuse to exclude regularization method from comparison due to the difficulty of experimentation when the proposed method may also involve some hyperparameters that balances training between reconstructor, generator and discriminator. - Experimental validation is not satisfactory as it is only evaluated with artificially generated noise transition constraints.
