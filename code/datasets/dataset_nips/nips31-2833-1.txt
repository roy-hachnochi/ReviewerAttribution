The paper proposes a new deep learning-based stereo algorithm that achieves high accuracy, is memory and compute efficient, and allows their network to be applied to be adapted to different disparity ranges without re-training. The latter two properties are aimed towards increasing the ease of practical use in real-world stereo systems.  The main contributions of the paper are in the architecture design (the structure of the matching modules, and how their outputs are then fed to a regularization network) that seeks to minimize memory usage while still allowing the expression of computational steps typically known to be useful for stereo---indeed, the paper discusses how the different components of their network relate to a traditional taxonomy of stereo processing steps. The second contribution is in treating the final output as a 'classification' (where a regression would fix the disparity range), with a modified averaging scheme around the mode of the output to achieve sub-pixel accuracy. The paper credits this with endowing their method to succeed at different disparity ranges without retraining.  The paper is well written and motivated, and achieves good experimental performance. I believe that since [2] and [18] were officially published after the NIPS submission deadline, they should be considered as concurrent submissions (even though I appreciate the authors including these works in the final table). Given this, the paper achieves state of the art performance while being computationally efficient and maintaining a relatively low footprint.  Post Rebuttal  After reading the other reviews and rebuttal, I do believe this paper to be above the accept threshold. I believe there is sufficient value in the authors' contribution of coming up with a computationally efficient yet accurate architecture for stereo / correspondence problems, and goes a long way in making deep-learning based stereo more useful in practical settings.
