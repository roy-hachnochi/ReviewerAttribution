The proposes a novel approximation for (possibly high dimensional) integrals. As in Bayesian quadrature, the value of the integral is estimated by integrating over a Gaussian process trained on the currently known function values. The main contribution of this paper is the combination of Bayesian integration (e.g., integrate over a nonparametric GP) with parametric methods (e.g. integrate over a polynomial as classical quadrature does). With this approach, the benefits of classical numerical integration can be combined with the merits of a fully Bayesian approach. The paper also includes convergence analysis and derives several well known classical rules as a special case of the proposed method.  In my opinion, this is a great paper. The problem addressed is one of the core problems in machine learning to date -- approximate intractable posteriors, which is synonymous to approximate intractable integrals. The paper is well written, technically sound and gives a nice insight on Bayesian quadrature and it's relation to classical quadrature methods.  The proposed method is evaluated on a one dimensional toy example and one high dimensional example, where a closed form solution is available.  minor comments: -in the zero coupon bonds experiment , the relative error does not decrease monotonically with increasing n, as opposed to BC and MC. Please explain this effect. -It would be nice to see BSC applied to some machine learning quadrature problem (e.g. approximate a posterior) and conduct a comparison to othe approximation methods, e.g., variational approaches.
