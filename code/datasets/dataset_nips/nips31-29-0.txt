This paper studies continuous submodular minimization under ordering constraints. The main motivation is to extend the settings in which efficient algorithms for isotonic regression exist. In particular, they extend such settings from convex objectives to submodular objectives. First, the authors show that this problem can be reformulated as a convex optimization problem with isotonic constraints. Since this convex problem is in a space of measures, it cannot be optimized exactly. Instead, the authors propose a discretization approach as in Bach18. The discretization approach is improved from the naive 1/eps^3 evaluations to 1/eps^2.33. Finally, the authors experimentally consider robustness to outliers with their approach.  Examples of continuous submodular functions are listed, as well as a separate motivation for isotonic constraints, but it would have been nice if a concrete application of the problem studied was explained in detail. On the theoretical side,  I donâ€™t find the improvement from a naive 1/eps^3 number of evaluations to 1/eps^2.33 to be of major significance. I also found the paper to be very dense and often hard to follow sometimes. An example is that it is not clear how the noise and corruptions fit in the model. It would have been nice to have additional discussions about what corrupted data corresponds to in this setting.
