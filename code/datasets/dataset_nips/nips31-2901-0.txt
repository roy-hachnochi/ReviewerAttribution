This paper studies catastrophic forgetting problem of GAN generator under the continual learning setting, the old training data is stored in the generator of GAN, it is retrieved and replayed to the generator when training new categories.  Quality and Clarity, Section 2 reviews the previous work in this problem, which is very clearly organized and easy to follow. The idea is straight forward and easy to understand. I like the fact that rehearsal of previous data can be converted into a regression problem (replay alignment).   Originality and Significance: This work is original in the sense that no previous work has tackled the this specific problem using replay generated from GAN. However, the novelty is limited in that using GAN generator to store rehearsal examples is not new.   Having a category input (input to the generator is both c and z) makes this a easier problem because it is aware of the category during training and generation. One may as well just use an individual network for each category if the category is known. In many realistic cases the task boundary is unknown.
