The paper proposes a theoretical study of a heuristic method for distributed SGD, using the sparsification gradients techniques.  The technique is not new, but this theoretical study is, in particular authors claim that their analysis does not require a bound on the maximum delay, which departs from already known analysis for asynchronous variants of SGD. I am however not confortable with the main assumption of the paper (Assumption 1), which is not discussed enough in my opinion, or numerically checked in experiments. It is I believe a strong assumption, that provides an ad-hoc control of the TopK operator. A comparison with the bounded delay assumption for asynchronous SGD is not fair, since this assumption is usually satisfied / numerically checked in experiments, while it is hardly the case of Assumption 1 for the TopK SGD. I think that the numerical experiments are weak : the comparison with asynchronous SGD is on a convex problem only (while the paper markets the use of TopK SGD for deep nets) and only illustrate marginal improvements. As a conclusion, I find the paper interesting, and won't oppose its acceptance, but I think that it is only marginally above the acceptance threshold for the NIPS venue.
