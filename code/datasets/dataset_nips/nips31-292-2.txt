Quality  This manuscript proposes a soft-gated Warping-GAN for image translation conditioned on human pose. The approach has two stages, first use encoder-decoder to reconstruct target human parsing, second use GEO to estimation affine and tps transformation between source and target human parsing map, and then apply transformation on source feature map.   The method is plausible, and results quite good compared with recent papers. The experimenting is quite sufficient.   My major concern is about the method novelty, the idea that apply two stages or multiple stages and utilize human parsing is not completely new (e.g., VITON); the idea of Warping-GAN is also not completely new (e.g., “LR-GAN: Layered Recursive Generative Adversarial Networks for Image Generation”, “Deformable GAN”, “Semi-parametric Image Synthesis”, etc all learn or estimate warping parameters in encoder-decoder setting); the idea of pose-guided parsing is already implemented in LIP paper in a sense. All these individual modules seem to be utilized in various papers, but the combination, to my knowledge, is new.   Minor questions: 1. If the two human pose has totally different view, like Fig 3, for example, one with full body and the other with lower body, how the GEO matcher will work? Have you considered any body part level transformation (like Deformable GAN)? 2. Is there comparison with Variational U-Net for this task?  Clarity  The paper is well-written and easy to understand, the experiments and ablation study is good.  Significance  In general, this manuscript has merit and contribution to the community, the paper is complete and experiments convincing, the novelty is somehow incremental but I think it’s still a good submission.
