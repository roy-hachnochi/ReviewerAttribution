The authors establish that the second-order leapfrog unadjusted HMC algorithm runs in d^{1/4} steps. This result had been conjectured but had never been established. It is a long and theoretical paper, it is strictly impossible to verify all the technical details of a difficult proof of more than 20 pages.  I have only superficially checked the supplementary materials. The few fragments of  proofs I read were convincing and correct. This is a very theoretical result but it explains the superiority of HMC methods and the feasibility of Bayesian methods (at least for convex potentials) for high-dimensional problem.
