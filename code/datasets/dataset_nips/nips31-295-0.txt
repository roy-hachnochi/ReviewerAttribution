The authors propose a loss function for training a neural network such that it can jointly analyze 3D shapes and the associated probe functions in a correspondence free manner. The neural network takes as input pairs of shapes, represented as point clouds, and functions and learns a dictionary for each shape that linearly spans all plausible semantic functions on the shape. The devised loss function penalizes the projection error from the input function to learned space, while at the same time imposing structured sparsity on the learned dictionary. The proposed approach was tested in three tasks: key point correspondence, part segmentation, and smooth function approximation. This was possible by appropriately adapting the imposed constraints in the objective function. In the tested tasks, the proposed approach performed favorably when compared to baseline approaches.  The paper is well-organized and written. The proposed technique is interesting and well motivated, albeit it is not fully clear how to implement it. The proposed methodology is fairly evaluated across a number of different tasks. However, the comparison with state of the art methods is scarce. Supplementary results suggest that the method is robust and can also take into consideration provided correspondences to improve the performance.
