This paper provided some theoretical analysis for the nonlocal neural network model, by studying the spectral distribution of the weight matrices. Furthermore, the authors proposed a new form of nonlocal formulation, and connected it to standard stochastic processes such as nonlocal diffusion processes and Markov jump processes, to demonstrate the advantage of the new formulation.  However, I am not fully convinced of the advantage of the proposed new formulation, for the following reasons: 1) The connection between the proposed nonlocal formulation and the standard stochastic processes are not very strong. For example, equation (14) is a simplified version of the proposed model in equation (8), hence the conclusions about stableness can not be readily applied to equation (8).  2) Although the authors commented in Section 4.4 that "the stability holds as long as the weight parameters are small enough ...", this statement is not rigorous enough to support the stableness claim. 3) Improvement is obtained with the new formulation on CIFAR-10, but relatively small. It would be better to test the proposed model on more datasets, which may give stronger support for the proposed model.  Note: I have read the authors' response and agree that "the new one is more robust in stacking multiple nonlocal blocks". In addition, the authors provided more experimental results with CIFAR-100, although the improvement compared to the baseline is still not big. Based on the above information, I changed my score from 5 to 6.
