The authors approach the problem of fairness in clustering through stochastic bounds on how far each individual data point can be from its associated cluster center. Section 2 defines the problem of chance k-coverage, which mandates that the k-lottery much satify probabilistics bounds for each point. The primary method of solving the probabilistic chance k-coverage uses a LP relaxation approximation framework with iterative rounding. In Section 3, the authors outline the deterministic case and derive constant c such that the expected distance from cluster center is at most c times r_y using a similar rounding algorithm. Lastly the homogenous SCC setting (all upper bounds are equal) leads to a partial cluster algorithm.    I enjoyed this paper and its approach to fairness in clustering. Although not my direct area of research, the bounds and reasoning are explained well and thoroughly.    I had hoped for a more extensive related works section instead of the more general "fairness is important" introduction. The relevance of clustering to fairness is obvious in the sense that clustering is a common ML and data science technique, but more grounding would help understand which problems in clustering might be more important. The constants derived in the paper for algorithms seem quite large; do we anticipate this will be practically helpful for fairness applications?   Modifying the structure of the paper to include a more detailed intro and a brief conclusion would help with better explaining the motivation of the paper as well.
