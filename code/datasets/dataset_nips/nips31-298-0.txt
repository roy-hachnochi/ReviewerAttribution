I enjoyed reading the main paper. I tried going over the supplement but couldn't get through the entire document. My score is low because the supplement is not written very well. In particular, lines 455-458 which is a crucial observation, should be explained more or calculations shown even though it is "well known". I do not see any reason why the authors cannot provide a short summary.  My second main concern is regarding the usefulness of the result. The generalization bound shown has the standard dependencies on T but in practice the lipschitz constant l is often huge making the bound trivial.   I also liked reading section 4. I am not sure why hard constraints are also bad. Can the authors explain lines 261-264 in more detail?  Edit: I read the rebuttal from the authors and increased my score. To make the paper more accessible for practitioners, I highly encourage authors to include experiments based on the suggestion provided by R3.
