This paper proposed a flexible generative modeling framework named Graphical Generative Adversarial Networks(Graphical-GAN). The difference between this work with previous ones is they provide a general solution to utilize the underlying structural information of the data. In general, this paper presented an interesting problem setting and a corresponding solution to learn interpretable representations and generating structured samples. Here are detailed reviews:  Strengths: 1. The problem addressed in this paper aims to introduce a structured recognition model to infer the posterior distribution of latent variables given observations.  2. The novelty and technical contributions are significant. The proposed learning algorithms are generally applicable to arbitrary Graphical-GAN.   Weaknesses: 1. Algorithms in this paper seem very brief, which is hard to reproduce the results. 2. Since the proposed method focuses on using Gaussian mixture prior to help the model to learn a more spread latent space with less ambiguous areas, the authors may want to carefully define what is the ambiguous area, and also provide more solid numerical experiments instead of only case studies.
