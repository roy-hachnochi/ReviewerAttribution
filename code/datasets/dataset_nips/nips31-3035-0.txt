The authors proved the universal approximation theorem for the ResNet architecture. It turned out that thanks to the special architecture ResNets are universal approximators opposed to fully connected networks for which universal approximation fails with width d or less.  Conclusion: 1) the topic of the paper is very important  2) the paper is well written. It almost does not contain misprints except - line 230. “networks may be a patrial explanation…”  3) the results close the existing gap in the theory: it follows that fully connected networks with width (d+1) are universal approximators while width d fully connected networks are not; the previous construction required at least d+4 units per layer.  4) There is nothing to add to the review, at least from my side.
