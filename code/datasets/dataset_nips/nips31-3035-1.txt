Universal approximation theoresm have been of interest in Mathematics and, more recently, in Neural Networks. There are different classes of approximators: polynomials, wide neural neworks, deep neural networks, etc. The paper is the first to show that width-limited ResNets are universal approximators. This has been an open problem.
