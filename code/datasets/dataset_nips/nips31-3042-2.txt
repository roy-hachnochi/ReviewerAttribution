The paper introduces a particular type of post-clustering problem, where one needs to tag each cluster under instance-level constraints (in particular, co-clustering is not possible in their framework). While the paper seems to be technically rigorous and interesting, my main concern is how general (re-usable) this problem formulation is (the paper is mainly motivated by the twitter tagging problem; in the introduction it also mentions potential usage for satellite imagery and medical data, but without a detailed explanation or a reference to either the dataset or the problem, it is hard to judge how realistic these problems are.
