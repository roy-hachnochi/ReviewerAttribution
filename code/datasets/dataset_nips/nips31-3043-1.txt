The authors consider the problem of generalized uniformity testing. This problem -- which is a natural extension to the standard uniformity testing problem -- was recently been proposed and studied by Batu and Canonne (2017). In standard uniformity testing problem, the task is to distinguish the case where the samples are coming from (the given) uniform density, or are being generated from a probability measure that is epsilon-far from the mentioned uniform density (in terms of total variation distance). In generalized uniformity testing, however, the tester should still accept if the distribution is uniform over a "subset" of the domain.   As observed and proved by Batu and Canonne (2017), the sample-complexity bounds for generalized uniformity testing exhibit a somewhat surprising divergence from those of uniformity testing. In this submission, the authors extend the results of Batu and Canonne (2017) by improving both the lower bound and the upper bound (for the sample complexity), essentially characterizing the sample complexity of generalized uniformity testing. Furthermore, the provided algorithm is computationally efficient.   The improvement in the lower bound is achieved using the standard lower bound for uniformity testing, as well as the use of the poissonization technique which is known for proving lower bounds (still, using the poissonization technique requires a non-trivial construction).  The improvement in the upper bound is achieved using multiple delicate improvements over the work of Batu and Canonne (2017), which is on a high level based on comparing the second and the third moments.   Overall, I think this a solid theoretical result about an interesting and important problem. The ideas are also well described. I think for this conference, it would make sense to add some more motivations about why generalized uniformity testing is important (e.g., use cases)
