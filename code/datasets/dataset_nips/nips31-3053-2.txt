This paper focuses on the network regularization, and proposes a minimum hyperspherical energy objective with a few variants, which aims to vary the orientations of the neuron weights by minimizing the energy function. I think the idea is reasonable, but I have some concerns of this paper as follows: 1. The novelty of this paper should be clarified. As indicated in Eq.(3), the proposed objective seems to minimize the distance between every two neurons, which is similar with the existing works like [31] to minimize the cosine distance between any pair of feature vectors. Authors should give more explanation on the global, top-down manner of the proposed approach, comparing with the existing works. 2. Authors should consider more comprehensive comparison with existing works, where some state-of-the-art network regularization methods, including orthogonality/angle-promoting regularization should be compared to verify its effectiveness.
