The paper studies causal discovery in linear systems given a set of purely observational data D^{(1)}, D^{(2)}, … in multiple domains such that all of the datasets D^{(i)} are generated from the same causal structure but the causal parameters may vary. The proposed approach is based on the principle that “P(cause) and P(effect |cause), as well as their included parameters, change independently across domains”. Therefore in a linear causal model C->E given by C= N_C, E=aC+N_E, variance \sigma^2_C changes independently from (a, \sigma^2_E). If we assume these causal parameters are random variables and the causal parameter values across domains are i.i.d. samples, then we could identify the causal direction by testing the independence between \sigma^2_C and  (a, \sigma^2_E) if enough number of domains are available. The paper first presents two test methods for determining the causal direction between two (unconfounded) variables and then extends the methods to causal network structure learning algorithms.   The proposed causal discovery method is novel as far as I know. The paper contains valuable contributions to the field that merit publication. The main weakness of the work is the strong perhaps not practical assumptions that data from many domains are available and that the causal parameters across domains are random samples. The experimental evaluations are done by simulating data under these assumptions. It is not clear how the proposed methods would perform under real world situations. It would be desirable the paper could motivate the work with possible applications and evaluate the methods in more realistic settings.  The paper is mostly clearly written. One key idea I couldn’t understand is the test statistic described in line 162-167. What is the meaning of this test statistic and how exactly is the expression computed?   The paper mentioned the motivation for the proposed IB and MC methods is that “a general non-parametric independence test may not be efficient.” Should you actually try a general independence test and compare with the proposed IB and MC methods as a baseline?  -Line 95, “form” should be “from”.  After author feedback: - I don’t think the assumption that the causal parameters across domains are random samples is a consequence of not having latent confounders in the system.  -It looks to me the performance of the proposed method and the relative performances of MC, IB, and HSIC test would strongly depend on how the parameters are actually changing (or not changing) across domains. In reality, if we don't know how parameters are changing, how much can we trust the output or the output by which test methods should we trust more?
