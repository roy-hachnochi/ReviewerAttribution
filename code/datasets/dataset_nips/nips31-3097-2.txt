The manuscript is a contribution to the analysis of one of most popular tools for differential privacy, namely subsampling. Although many of the results for upper bounds of subsampling schemes already exist in the literature, a general framework that not only recovers them but also can asses their tightness is still valuable.  -Page 7, line 298: "Note that this setting cannot be implemented using sampling without replacement since under the remove/add relation we cannot a priori guarantee that the input dataset will have at least size m because the size of the dataset must be kept private." This sentence should be rephrased and the discussion should be elaborated. Also, it is not clear why the size of the dataset must be kept private and why this implies that  we cannot a priori guarantee that the input dataset will have at least size m. - Page 3, line 98: There may be a notational  issue in the build-up of M^S: In M(S(x)), S(x) is viewed as a subset although S is defined a function that maps a database to a probability distribution. - Below Thm1, line 144 , propoerty (ii): Should it be “monotonically decreasing”? - Page 4, line 156: typo: change v_1 to \pi_1. - Page 7, line 257: change "results" to "result".
