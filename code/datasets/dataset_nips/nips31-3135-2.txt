1. Quality:   The proofs clearly demonstrate that pick-one HSM methods are not ideal for XMLC. However, the primary reasoning for using pick-one HSM is for speed. This paper presents a theoretical argument for using PLT for XMLC which performs better than FastXML with about a 3x speedup at test time. However, the results aren’t very significant over the Parabel model or XML-CNN.  The experimental results section is incomplete. There should be an explanation of the differences between the datasets (e.g. distribution of positive labels), and an explanation of why XT works better on some datasets.  2. Clarity  The formal background was insufficient. Background work wasn’t explained well (especially FastXML, and PLT). F1, Hamming, P@k weren’t explained why they are important for XMLC. P@k is just one measure for XMLC, but many more metrics are important. Minimizing the regret for P@k shouldn’t be the only metric for a good model.   It’s somewhat hard to understand the technical contributions of this work. The contributions aren’t clearly outlined, and it is not very informative.   3. Originality The originality of this work is essentially just from proving PLTs are better than pick-one HSMs. The theorems and proofs are new for XMLC, which is important since pick-one HSMs are frequently used in practice. However, there is a very little technical contribution in terms of the method. It is a small improvement over the FastXML model, albeit the results are better than FastXML. In addition, the method is not explained very well - it is limited to one paragraph.  4. Significance XMLC is a very important task, and the proofs in this paper seem to be significant. However, I’m not sure the experimental results and presentation of the work are significant enough.
