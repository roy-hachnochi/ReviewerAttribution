The paper presents a principled approach for formal verification of neural network properties by symbolic interval analysis of the network. The approach is made scalable through linear relaxation of the ReLU non linearity in the neural network. The upper and lower bounds for linear relaxation are computed using directed constraint refinement (where overestimated nodes are located and prioritized based on gradient magnitude, next they are split instead of relaxation to get tighter approximations and are solved with the safety constraints using an underlying linear solver) instead of naive interval propagation to make the approach scale to larger networks. Various safety properties such as robustness to adversarial inputs with L1, L2 and Linf norm and robustness to adversarial images with varying contrast and brightness are checked on ACAS Xu neural network, Drebin malware detection models, MNIST classifiers and NVIDIA self driving car model.  The paper is clear and well written. The only problem I see with the submission is the novelty. The paper has combined methods from past literature but the experimental studies performed are strong.  Update: The authors did a good job in their response and I would vote to accept it.
