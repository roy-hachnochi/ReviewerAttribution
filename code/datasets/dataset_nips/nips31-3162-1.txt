This paper proposed a graph generation algorithm based on reinforcement learning. A graph convolutional neural network is used to encode the node representations, which are further used to perform action prediction. Policy gradient algorithm is used to learn the optimal policy function. Experimental results on the task of molecule generation prove the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm over several existing state-of-the-art algorithms including JT-VAE and ORGAN.   Strength: - the paper is well written and easy to follow - the proposed algorithm is simple and elegant  Weakness:  - some details are missing. For example, how to design the rewards is not fully understandable.  - some model settings are arbitrarily set and are not well tested. For example, what is the sensitivity of the model performance w.r.t. the number of layers used in GCN for both the generator and discriminator?
