 This paper introduces a model for “fairly” pricing (statistical) queries to a database in a model where there are two types of users (adaptive and non-adaptive) and the database can purchase new data at a price.  This price is charged differently to the two types of users, leading to a price per-query of (1/sqrt(M)) or (log M/ M).  My feeling about this paper is that it sets up a rather complicated database access and pricing model, which then is shown to be feasible via known differential privacy / adaptivity, validity, and simple pricing results by adding the right amount of noice, checking answers, etc.  I do not see much of an advance in any fundamental problem, but rather a rather complicated model and results to fit it.  The theorems are quite believable, though I did not check the appendix.  The paper is well written.  Unfortunately, I am simply not convinced by the results themselves and therefore think this paper is below the bar for acceptance.  One note: if the authors pointed to the need for such systems, or better yet to current attempts to build them, in practice, I would be more optimistic about this line of work.  minor comments Fairness is mentioned in the title, but nowhere else in the paper.  I don’t think that fairness is the best descriptor of what you’re doing.
