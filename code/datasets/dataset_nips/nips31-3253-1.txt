The paper studies the problem of “adaptive data analysis” and proposed a new model where the data base can gather new data at a price, and also users of this data base need to pay to use it. The proposed model is appealing in that it does not model users at all, yet it can achieve the desired behavior w.r.t. each user regardless of whether the user is adaptive or not.  The main contribution of this paper is the above new setting and an analysis of the proposed algorithm.   Pros: - The problem is important. The setting is practically relevant.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            - The results seem technically correct. - The discussions and future work are well-thought out. I particularly would love to see the “typical charges” in practice.   Cons: - The technical novelty is on the low end. The authors are pretty frank about this too, so it is perhaps not fair to press on this matter too much. - For NIPS (rather than COLT), I feel that the authors should have a careful simulation study to illustrate the behaviors of different kind of users. - The model is still rather idealized for practical use. The pricing is a bit extreme. People are penalized for providing something that produces inconsistent results on the two sets, which could be due to pure noise especially when \tau is small.
