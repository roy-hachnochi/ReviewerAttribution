This paper proposes a computationally efficient calculation technique that lower-bounds the size of adversarial perturbations that can deceive networks, and an effective training procedure, which robustifies networks and significantly improves the provably guarded areas around data points. The contribution of this paper is proposing an intuitive way to measure the slope to calculate the upper-bounds of gradient and provide a widely available and highly scalable method that ensures large guarded areas for a wide range of network structures. There are certain contribution and originality in the literature.  Here I am concerned with the following two questions: 1.    This paper defines a guarded area for a network F and a data point X as a hypersphere with a radius c. This definition is so strong that may conflict with many real world applications. 2.    The authors transfer the problem into solving the Lipschitz constant and prove bounds in diffident functions and do some experiments to evaluate the performance of their method. But lack of the comparative experiments with some existing methods that make the experiment unconvincing.
