In this paper the authors propose a proximal version of SCOPE, that can be used for distributed sparse learning.  The paper is well-organized in general, but I suggest to have your submission proof-read for English style and grammar issues.  Also, the definition 1, of Lipschitz functions, could be left out, as well as the conjugate function. Just add some reference, or put it in the appendix, so you get more space to explain better some points.  The figures are also quite small, and it's difficult to see. In the printed version, Figure 3 is impossible to read.  The lemmas and theorems seem to be ok, and this is an important adaptation of SCOPE.  The algorithm is presented for general regularizations, in terms of the proximal operator. I would have liked another experiment with a different penalty. Maybe the group lasso is more challenging for distributed learning?  That being said, the experimental results are very good (but please improve the plots).
