This paper proposes a good idea to explicitly utilize the input data structures in CNN (such as non-Euclidean or graph structures), and the proposed model shows the superior performance for different tasks including vision and text.  The idea is intuitive and reasonable, and learning functional filters and the representations is sound. The presentation of this paper is clear and detailed. Moreover, the conducted experiments contain several tasks, and the proposed model achieve better results consistently. The analysis and discussion are informative and can serve the guidance for future research work. The code will be released so that the model can be easily reproduced to benefit following work.  After seeing author responses, I kept my positive comments but made a small change of the final score.
