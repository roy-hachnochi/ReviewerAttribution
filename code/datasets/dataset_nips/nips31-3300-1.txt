This paper provides the first negative/positive results for constructing coresets in logistic regression. There are numerous results on coresets for regression problems but nothing was known for logistic regression. The authors first provide a negative result, meaning they show that it is not possible to construct a linear coreset for logistic regression in the general case. Then, under certain assumptions, they provide the first provably accurate coreset construction algorithm for linear regression. They support the strong theoretical results with experiments. Finally, i would recommend to the authors that they provide a detailed comparison of their results with this work https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.08571.
