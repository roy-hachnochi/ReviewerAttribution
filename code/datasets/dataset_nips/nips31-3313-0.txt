This paper proposes a methods for unsupervised learning of artistic styles and stylistic transfer via “Archetypal” style analysis. Specifically, the authors apply a well-known dimensionality reduction technique known as "archetypal analysis" to deep image feature representations, to extract a dictionary of artistic style archetypes.  They then decompose each image as a convex combination of relevant archetypes, which allows them to manipulate images by tuning coefficient of decomposition.   This is an interesting, well-written paper on an interesting subject. The authors conduct extensive experiments, and observe certain (albeit qualitative - see below) improvements over existing style transfer approach.   My main concern is the limited novelty of the proposed method, which is essentially an application of a well-known approach (archetype learning) to the stylistic modeling problem.  Another concern, not limited to this paper only but applicable for this line of work in general,  is lack of objective evaluation measures. Namely, the evidence presented in the experiments are all qualitative and thus not amenable to quantitative and objective assessment. For instance, it would be nice to see some experiments showing that the archetypal composition of images are similar if they belong to the same artistic style and/or “school”, e.g., post-renaissance, cubism, etc. At the very least, the authors could have conducted a user study evaluation,  similar to one p[resented in Ref.[11].   Other questions/comments: - For the stylistic modeling/transfer problem, what’s so special about archetype modeling vs other dimensionality reduction techniques (PCA, Factor analysis, etc). For instance, FA is the tool of choice when doing personality trait analysis, which seems a related problem in some sense.
