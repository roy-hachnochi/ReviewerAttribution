This paper proposes a self-handicapping network based on a new adversarial erasing strategy for object attention.  The motivation of the proposal is clear and the method is well introduced. The contribution is clear and sufficient.  The experimental results properly validates the improvement achieved with the proposed technique in the image segmentation task. Moreover, a comparison with weakly-supervised semantic segmentation methods of the state of the art is included.  In my opinion, the paper can be accepted as it is.
