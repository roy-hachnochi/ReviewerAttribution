This paper proposes a new approach to analyzing alternating minimization algorithms. The main idea is to obtain uniform control the error of one set of iterates in terms of the error of the complementary set of iterates. The benefit of uniform control is the analysis applies to non-resampled alternating minimization algorithms.  It's hard to make recommendations beyond presentation of the results without reading the proofs carefully, but the results are certainly first rate. Regarding the presentation of the results, it would be ideal if the authors can state a version of Lemma 2 (or refer to the analogous result in the appendix) in the discussion at the end of Section 3.2. Is the improvement in Theorem 2 from Theorem 1 a result of an improved Lemma 2 if we only restrict to well-initialized $\Sigma(\theta)$'s?
