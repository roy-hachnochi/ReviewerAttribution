I view this work as a very interesting extension of two recent exciting papers: Huth et al. (2016) and Baldassano et al. (2017).  Essentially, the authors have developed a theory-based method for mapping out how context-dependent semantic information  is distributed across the cortex.  This is a big methods advance: whereas prior work aimed at constructing neural semantic maps has (for the most part) considered each moment's semantic content in isolation, this work provides a means of incorporating prior semantic content at different timescales.  The authors clearly show that different brain areas "care" about semantic information at different timescales, and I like the overall LSTM-based approach.  What dampens my enthusiasm slightly is that the ultimate conclusions seem to confirm (rather than specifically go beyond) similar to prior work from Uri Hasson's group, including the above-mentioned Baldassano et al. paper.  I think there may be some way to interpret this set of results in a way that provides some key theoretical advance over that prior related work, and that's something I'd recommend that the authors focus on in their revision.  Even if the theoretical impact does not quite live up to its potential, however, I still see this paper as providing an important methodological tool for creating context-dependent semantic brain maps from naturalistic experimental data.  ** Update after reading author response and other reviews I stand by my assessment that this paper should be accepted.  The authors have done a nice job addressing my (and the other reviewers') concerns.
