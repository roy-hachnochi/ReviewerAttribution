This paper consider the classical problem of matrix completion in collaborative filtering when the data is MNAR -- i.e. with observational data. This problem has already been study (see [1] for instance) and a key problem to handle the bias is to infer the underlying probability of examinations (propensities). Where the previous studies try to predict one static propensity for each user-item pair, this paper proposes to condition these propensities on the sequence of ratings done by the user when such information is available. So they try to model the dynamics of the probability of examination in opposition to other sequential methods such as RNN for reco which aim at modelling the dynamics of the user preferences (when assumed non-stationary).  I find the idea of the paper interesting as I feel it answers to a real problem. The proposed approach using a HMM (+MF for scalability) is credible and proposes a good first solution. The experiments are done on popular datasets and prove good performance against the baselines. I especially appreciated the second part of the experimental section where the authors inspect the robustness of their model w.r.t. several parameters (nb of user intent, weight of the constraints).  Then, some improvements on the methods would still be required for it to scale to industry-size recommender systems, but the datasets used in experiments are still reasonable.  There are still several things that could be improved: - Due to the large amount of notation, the papers is sometimes a bit hard to follow, - The section 4 about constraints on items could benefit from being more developed as it is the part that makes the difference in the experiments - I would be interesting to have more insights on the link with causality from observational data.
