In this paper, the authors propose a method for gradient-based regularization of the critic of MMD GAN-like models. Gradient constrained maximum mean discrepancy has been proposed in the paper. The presentation of the paper is clear however the results present in the section 3 are trivial and does not provide any new insights on understanding GAN.  I would also assume that the original proposed approach would take a long time to train and the authors also mention this in the paper. Hence they propose to optimize the lower bound of the Gradient-Constrained MMD instead which essentially turns out to be the scaled version of MMD. But it is not very clear why the scaled MMD is performing better over vanilla MMD. Ideally one should expect similar behaviour for both of them.
