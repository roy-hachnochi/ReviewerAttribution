This paper concerns the problem of finding the k-NN graph of a point set, i.e. a directed graph where there is an edge from a to b if b is among the k points nearest (according to some metric) to a, important in various data analysis tasks. The contribution consists in a randomized algorithm that given a graph G in sublinear time (square root n times k squared times 1/epsilon squared) will check if G is close to being a k-NN graph, i.e. what is called a property tester for k-NN graphs. A lower bound on the runtime of such an algorithm is also included (square root of n), that shows the given algorithm not far from optimal, and finally an experimental evaluation is performed that shows positive results.  The given algorithm is quite simple, however the analysis is quite technical. The experimental evaluation shows that the time spent for the property testing is about 1/10 th of the time spent to find G, which seems like a good trade-off. This paper may indeed be of interest to parts of the NIPS audience.
