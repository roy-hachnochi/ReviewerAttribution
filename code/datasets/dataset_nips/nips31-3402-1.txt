======update===== While I do agree with reviewer 1 that this paper address the important problem of using alternative metrics other than L2 in WGAN-GP, I still believe the author(s) need to conduct more comprehensive set of experiments (not necessarily SOTA results as also mentioned by Reviewer #1).  I have no doubt that this will be a very nice work, but not in its current form. It still feels bit of light to be presented at top notch conference venues such as NIPS, especially when compared to the gravity of its predecessors such as the original WGAN paper and the WGAN-GP paper. Their theories are synthesized from existing literature, and should have done a much better job clarifying the details to the generative modeling community. I particularly do not want to encourage publications with light experiments, which will set bad precedence. I would encourage the author(s) to further polish their work before resubmitting. It's a good one, but not ready yet.   More specifically,  1) the only experiment used Inception Score can be very misleading (I am glad the author(s) include FID score in the rebuttal, but still not enough). The author(s) will also need more tractable toy examples to show the correctness of their heuristic automatic parameter setting procedure and the convergence of their algorithm to the ground truth distributions.  2) The stability of the algorithm and its computational efficiency is also aspects of practical concern, since forward and inverse FFT have been used which involve complex arithmetic. And how does the finite discretization estimator of the norm compare with the FFT estimator? 3) The image spaces X, the (image) function f and the coordinate system (also denoted as x in the paper) are heavily overloaded and it is very confusing.  ================= This paper introduces Banach Wasserstein GAN which is a improved version of WGAN. The whole paper is easy to understand. Although this paper claim to reach the almost state-of-the-art inception score on CIFAR-10, the authors fail to compare their model using recent FID score. The authors also only test their model on just one dataset CIFAR-10, at least three different dataset need to be tested, i.e., MNIST, CelebA, Imagenet, LSUN. I also checked the supplementary, there is no other experiments. The authors also did not discuss the implementation details in both paper and supplementary material.  Therefore, the whole paper is not convincing enough to me.
