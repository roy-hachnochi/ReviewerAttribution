This submission deals extending the WGAN formulation with gradient penalty from Euclidean spaces to general bench spaces. To this end, the Sobolev norm and its dual are adopted into the earth mover distance, and the resulting cost function is shown to be the classic WGAN loss with a gradient penalty using the dual norm.   The dual norm is argued to be computationally tractable for range of Banach norms, and experiments are provided with CIFAR data that show high inception score for some norms chosen from the Banach norms compared with the classic l2 norm.   This is an interesting extension. The computational tractability and complexity of the gradient penalty calculation however is not very clear. More elaborations are needed on that side for various values of s. In addition, the inception score is not necessarily a reasonable metric to adopt, and readers rating are more reasonable to evaluate the quality of the resulting images. Thus, the experiment parts need more depth.     Reviewer's opinion about the author response:   My original concern was about relying on the inception score as the evaluation metric, where the rebuttal provides FID scores as well. This is appreciated and acceptable even though it still doesnâ€™t truly reflect the readers subjective opinion score that is very common for instance in assessing the quality of outcomes for image superresolution algorithms.   However, I still think the experiment section is not deep enough to prove the merits and usefulness of this new class of GANs. I think, to be coherent with the tone of this submission as a generalized class of WGANs, more extensive evaluations need to be reported for a few diverse and standard datasets such as ImageNet. Alternatively, the submission needs to be toned down which then does not merit publication at NIPS. Thus, I would recommend the authors to deepen the experimental results, and then this paper is of sufficient evidence to prove its merits.
