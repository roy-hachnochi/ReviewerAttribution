The primary contributions of this paper seem to be applying the convex relaxation technique and nonconvex low rank factorization approach to the exponential family model. The earlier sections appear to be review and background. Section 4 appears to be mostly standard applications of existing theory to this specific problem. I don't think it is quite novel enough. Although the authors start out with discussion general exponential family embeddings, their theorems only apply to the Gaussian setting. I would probably remove the Poisson example, since it's not analyzed. I think this paper is borderline for NIPS.
