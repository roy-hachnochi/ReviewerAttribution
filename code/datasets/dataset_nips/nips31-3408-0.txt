The paper proposed a bidirectional RNN model for imputing missing values in multivariate time series. The proposed model is evaluated on three types of datasets and compared to a range of baseline methods. The experiments show that the proposed model outperforms all baseline methods in terms of both imputation quality and the performance of supervised learning tasks.  Overall the paper is quite easy to follow. The second paragraph of the introduction section and the related work section provide a comprehensive list of existing frameworks for missing value imputation in general or methods that are specific to time series, which motivates the development of the proposed work.   The paper would be more readable if it is more explicit on the dimensionality of the model parameters such as W_x, W_\gamma, W_h and so on. Although those can be inferred given that the hidden states are 64-dimensional (line 228) and each x_t is D-dimensional, explicitly specifying that, for example, W_x is D by 64, W_h is 64 by 64 and gamma_t is 64-dimensional might emphasize the fact that the correlations between \hat{x}_t are implicitly captured by the shared 64-dimensional hidden states. When D >> 64, we can even view the construction of \hat{x}_t as a (low dimensional) nonlinear factorization according to equations 1 to 4.  “Intuitively, if \delta_t is large, we expect a small \gamma_t to decay the hidden state.” (between line 132 and 133): If smaller \gamma is expected for larger \delta, should we put certain constraint over W_\gamma such as positivity? This also leads to the question of whether we should always “decay” the hidden state as the gap delta gets larger. From equation 4, since h_t is quite convolved with h_{t-1} and x_t^c when step t is missing, especially as x_t^c is also a function of h_t, it’s not clear how to justify the decaying of the term associated with h_{t-1} but leaving the x_t^c term intact. Is it possible that the actual dynamic favors focusing more on h_{t-1} when \delta is large? Also, is it necessary to restrict the values of \gamma_t to between zero and one by equation 3? It’d be a great addition to justify the design choice regarding these concerns, either in theory or through some ablative experiments. Moreover, regardless of missing entries, Definition 1 mentioned that the time gap between different timestamps may not be the same. Considering the case that all D features are simultaneously sampled but in a very non-uniform rate (\delta_t varies a lot for different t), how to justify the choice of equation 3 and 4 under this setting? A related work addressing this issue is “Phased LSTM: Accelerating Recurrent Network Training for Long or Event-based Sequences” by Daniel Neil, et al.  Two choices of \alpha_i are mentioned in line 134-135. Which one is used in the experiments?  Equation 7 explicitly assumes that features are linearly correlated. However, in some real-world applications, this might not be the case. For example, sometimes in the multivariate time series data, one feature might be strongly correlated with the other but with a small time delay. This is commonly seen in the healthcare data especially when it comes to physiological signals. I wonder how would BRITS compare with architectures such as multi-layer RNN with vector outputs, which could potentially capture nonlinear correlation across features but with less ad-hoc components.   “The supervision of classification/regression makes the estimation of missing values more accurate.” (line 51-52) It’d be more convincing if showing some results of, for example, comparing BRITS with and without supervision signals.  It’s not clear if the mean relative error (MRE) described in line 235-236 is a sensible metric as |pred_i - label_i| is not some normalized quantity such as accuracy and representing it in percentage seems unnecessary, although we can see that it is strongly correlated with MAE in Table 1.   I really like the experiments in the paper that compare with a wide range of related methods. It would make the experiments more reproducible if the paper reports (perhaps in the appendix) the hyperparameters used by each of the baseline methods and their architecture in detail. Moreover, reporting something like the number of parameters used in each of the models especially for GRU-D, M-RNN and the proposed models would be quite helpful for interpreting the experimental results. For example, if BRITS has significantly more parameters than BRITS-I due to the extra \hat{z}_t terms (section 4.3), then it is not clear if the advantage of BRITS shown in Table 1 comes from having more parameters, which we expect the model to be more expressive, or comes from the extra “feature-based estimation”. The similar question also applies to the comparison with GRU-D and M-RNN.  Minor: Example 1 might be a bit misleading by referring that x_5, x_6, and x_7 are missing, as it somewhat suggests that all D features are missing at those timestamps, but Definition 1 allows different missingness across features. Therefore, L_e(\hat{x}_t, x_t) should be able to handle the case with partial observations.  Minor: Figure 3 compares the imputation results by ImputeTS and BRITS-I, and in the text followed claims that BRITS-I demonstrates better performance than ImupteTS. However, it seems that ImputeTS better captures local patterns especially in the case in the middle column. ImputeTS performs poorly mostly at the beginning of the time series. What if a “bidirectional-version” of the ImputeTS is used and how would that compare with BRITS-I?   Post-rebuttal comments:  I appreciate that the authors have addressed most of my concerns and make things more clear in their response.  For the discussion regarding the decay factor, I still have doubt about the fundamental modeling choice here. According to equations 3 and 4, the “decay factor” \gamma_t only applies to h_{t-1} but not the term associated with U_t. In the state space model, we usually assume that the hidden states h capture the actual transition of the dynamics, while the observation x could be noisy due to either sensory error or missingness. This implies that h should be more reliable than x. However, here in equation 4, h is decayed by gamma but not for x. I feel an alternative idea is to decay the U_h term instead but applying some transition function over h_{t-1} accounting for \delta_t. Empirically, it’d be helpful to compare different decaying schemes: decaying the W_h term, decaying the U_h term, or both to justify the modeling choice.   A minor extra question I have is about the KNN imputation in Section 5.2.2: how is the similarity defined in the presence of missing data?
