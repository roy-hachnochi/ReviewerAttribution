In this paper, authors develop a Reinforcement Learning agent - M-Walk - that, given a query, learns to walk over a graph towards a desired target (answer) node. The proposed architecture maps the state into a vector representation, and maps it into a Q-network (for the policy) and a value network. The proposed RL algorithm alternates between MCTS trajectory generation steps, and policy improvement steps, for iteratively refining the policy.   Question - other than WN18RR, FB15k-237 is also a great link prediction benchmark. Why didn't you consider it in your experiments? Is it because the number of relation types in FB15k-237 is much larger compared to WN18RR, causing a significant increase in the size of the action space? It would be great to have a brief discussion on this aspect in the paper, rather than omitting it completely.
