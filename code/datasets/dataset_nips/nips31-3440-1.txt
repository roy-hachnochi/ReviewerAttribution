This paper presents upper and lower bounds on the sample complexities of private versions of the identity and closeness testing problems. The upper and lower bounds for identity testing match for all parameter ranges. However, for the closeness testing problem, there's a gap of between the upper and lower bounds when the number of samples is larger than "k" (size of the support of the distributions).   The results of this paper are interesting and fundamental. The authors privatize recent test statistics: DGPP17 (for identity testing) and CDVV14 (for closeness testing) to get their upper bounds. The lower bound for identity testing is based on Le Cam's method and the same lower bound is used for closeness testing. The paper is well written and organized.  Comments:   1. In lines 129 and 130: "Both [CDK17], and [ADR17] consider only pure-differential privacy, which are a special case of our results." But isn't that okay since you argue that pure-DP is enough?   2. It would be nice if the test statistics (and their private versions) are discussed in the main writeup. Perhaps you can move the proof of Theorem 1 (which seems very basic) to the appendix to make some space?    3. It would be nice if you can end with a concluding section that not only recaps the main results but also discusses some interesting extensions and future research directions.   Overall, I think this is a good paper and recommend it for publication.    #After author rfeedback Thanks for your detailed response. I am glad to see that you have addressed my points.
