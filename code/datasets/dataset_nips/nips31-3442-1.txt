This paper focusses on adversarial learning, that is learning of deep models that is robust to adversarial data, in a Bayesian framework. The usual approaches to adversarial learning consist is "point estimates", while the proposed approach averages, in a Bayesian sense, over a specified distribution on adversarial data-generating distribution.  I find the idea of Bayesian averaging over the adversarial data-generating distribution interesting. However, the Practical Instantiation of Bayesian Adversarial Learning does not seem practical to me, and reproducing the obtained results not possible. Unless I am wrong, some parameters of Algorithm 1 are not specified, including \eta_1, \eta_2, \gamma, or C.
