Two tensors are considered to be coupled when they share a common mode. This paper studies the convex coupled norms for coupled tensor completion. Several coupled tensor completion models have been proposed but many of them are nonconvex which leads to local optimal solutions. This work instead focused the study the convex norms. The main contribution is to propose a set of coupled norms extending the tensor nuclear norm that are convex, leading to global optimal solutions. The authors then present the theoretical analysis for tensor completion based on the proposed tensor nuclear norm.   Generally, this work is novel. Looking for the convex relaxation of tensor ranks is always important. Giving the theoretical bound for tensor completion is important. The experiments verify the theoretical bound.  I have a question about the achieved bound in Section 4. Is the obtained bound optimal? Does there exist the optimal bound?  In the experiments, the authors compared the proposed tensor completion model with some existing ones. The authors may miss some other related work about tensor completion based on different tensor ranks and tensor nuclear norm, e.g., Ji Liu, Przemyslaw Musialski, Peter Wonka, and Jieping Ye.
