This paper focuses on the problem of causal inference in the presence of confounders. Particularly, the authors propose to use matrix factorization to infer the confounders from noisy covariates. Then the recovered confounders are used in the causal effect estimation. With this correction, the authors show that the asymptotic bias diminishes to 0 when ||V|| approaches to infinity.  Quality: This paper tries to solve an important problem in causal inference: to reduce estimation bias in the presence of noisy covariates. The overall presentation is ok and the proposed method is reasonable. Clarity: Overall, the presentation is ok. In Assumption 2, the authors take the low rank assumption for granted. It is better to give some intuitions for the specific scenario in the paper. Originality: The proposed method relies on low rank matrix factorization, which has been well studied. But from my knowledge, its application in causal inference is novel. A related paper is cited in [9], which makes use of variational autoencoders. Significance: Reducing the estimation bias of causal effect is an interesting problem to explore. The proposed method is reasonable. However, the authors did not compare it with the state-of-the-art method, which is proposed in [9]. If the comparison was made, the efficacy of the proposed method could be better demonstrated.
