This paper deals with the problem of learning a distribution over segmentations given an input image. For that authors propose a generative segmentation model based on a combination of a U-Net with a conditional variational autoencoder that is capable of efficiently producing an unlimited number of plausible segmentation hypotheses.  The problem is challenging, well-motivated and well presented. The related work is properly presented and the novelty of the proposed method is clear. The proposed method is original and means a sufficient contribution.  The validation of the proposal and comparison with baseline methods is correct and the experimental results are quite convincing.   In my opinion, the paper can be accepted as it is.
