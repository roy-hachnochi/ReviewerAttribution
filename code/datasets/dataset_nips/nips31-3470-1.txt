In this manuscript, the authors propose a fully nonparametric method called KCDC to discover causal relationships from observational data. The method is motivated by the observation that  there should be an asymmetry between cause and effect in terms of the variability. An applicable measure using the framework of RKHS space is derived. The good performance is verified in both synthetic and real-world datasets.  Strengths: 1. Overall, I didn’t find any obvious weakness or error in the paper. I think the contribution is solid, and the writing and logic are quite clear. 2. The framework does not postulate a priori assumption on the functional structure, overcoming some problems in the literature. 3. Using the RKHS framework makes the approach widely applicable in many data situations.  Minor comments: 1. I think the most relevant literature is [11]. It’s better to compare with the work more  in the method part, or compare with the work in more details. 2. As the most relevant work, it’s better to put [11] in the benchmarks. 3. The detailed description of Figure 1 is lacking, making it confused at first view.
