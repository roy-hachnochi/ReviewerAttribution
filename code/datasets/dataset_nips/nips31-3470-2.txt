This paper provides a tractable method for identifying causality in bivariate data. In particular, they posit that the Kolmogorov complexity of the effect's generating mechanism is independent of the value of cause, whereas the opposite does not hold. The authors appeal to heuristics and do not provide any theory regarding identifiability, but the method works very well across a wide variety of simulation settings and on a standard benchmark data set.  Comments: 1) The authors state that they variety of kernels for the input and response "yielded fairly consistent performance" and they report the results for one specific setting. Is there an intuition as to which kernels would work better in different situations? Or should you be using the same kernel for cause and effect? In the paper, they use 2 different kernels.  2) Roughly what is the computational cost of determining a single causal relationship? The authors mention in section 5 that this could be extended to multivariate data, but would taht be computationally feasible?  3) It might be interesting to also look at the "level" of the test. For instance, in the case where we know the graph is unidentifiable (linear gaussian for example), what does the distribution of  T^{KCDC} look like?
