This paper addresses a problem of obtaining a principal generalized eigenvector in stochastic setting. The algorithm is considered as an extension of Oja algorithm to the stochastic setting, and its convergence proof is provided with its rate of convergence. The paper is well organized and reads well. The simulation done is this paper looks fair enough, and reveals the sensitivity of the parameter choice.   Though it may not be the scope of this paper, it would be nice if one could provide an example machine learning case where the result of the proposed algorithm is used for feature extraction. It is unclear to me how small the error (e.g., Figure 1) should be to obtain a reasonable results, let's say, classification error. I understand that it will be different task-by-task, and should depend on the dimension (meaning of the error changes), so it may be difficult to provide the meaning of the error, but an example use case will be helpful.   (Rebuttal) I believe that adding a paragraph for connecting the proposed approach to ML tasks will increase readers who will be interested in this topic. The author's rebuttal is satisfactory in this point. On the other hand, the second point was not clarified by the rebuttal. I will keep the score as it was.
