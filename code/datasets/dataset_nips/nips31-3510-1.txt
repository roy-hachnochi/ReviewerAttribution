This paper studies a concept called dual policy iteration, a bunch of extensions from a theoretical perspective is provided. Albeit that several examples are provided to show the superiority of the proposed method, the evaluations are still not convincing. I would like to see if other two-policy strategy approaches (such as those mentioned in the second paragraph in ‘introduction’) can perform well, without that I can not judge the practical contribution of the presented work.
