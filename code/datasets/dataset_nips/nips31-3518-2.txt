The authors tackle an important problem in systems neuroscience, namely whether and how neural activity can be interpreted as implementing probabilistic inference. In particular, two theories have been put forward in the past, probabilistic inference and sampling-based approaches. The authors claim to be able to unify the two approaches, thus providing an integrated account of probabilistic inference with neural populations. To this end, the authors study a relatively simple Gaussian image model, where an image is represented in a neural population with independent Gaussian noise. From this, they compute the posterior and show that the mean of samples from the posterior corresponds to a linear PPC. The interpretation of this PPC makes several interesting prediction, e.g. that adding noise to an image does not necessarily imply more variance in the spike counts, as  the uncertainty of the representation is related to the mean, not the variance of the samples.  While the paper touches on an important topic, and the calculations seem largely correct, the relationship of the model to neural data could have been worked out more, e.g. with more concrete examples. As it is, the model does not seem particularly biologically plausible, as common ingredients such as Poisson noise are missing. Even illustrating a few of the main ingredients and how they work together would have been helpful. The analysis of the model presented in Fig. 3/4 seems  to be more illustrative than actual results, here a more in depth interpretation would be helpful.  106: extra Dr Fig 2: asymptotive -> asymptotic 125: left column -> bottom row?
