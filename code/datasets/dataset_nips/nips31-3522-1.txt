This work proposes that biologically plausible representation of manifolds can be learned by optimizing objective functions that approximately preserve similarity of activities of upstream and downstream neurons. It analyzes the proposed objective function (NSM-1) and proposes an offline algorithm to optimize it. The paper then proceeds to propose an online algorithm that optimizes NSM-1 via a "biologically plausible" neural network. The simulations performed seemed to validate the underlying theory.   Post rebuttal: I have read the rebuttal and other reviews. I will stay with my evaluation.
