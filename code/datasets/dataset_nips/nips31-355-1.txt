The author propose threshold ternary and Bernoulli ternary quantization methods for weights and activations, respectively.   The paper sounds clear and the topic is quite significant. However, the originality (or contribution) sounds not enough, since they propose a ternary quantization which is in the middle of binary quantization and other quantizations, although they use hybrid and a sloping factor in addition to the ternary quantization.   And, there are a few questions.  - How about increasing the number of states rather than just 3 states? Can we find the best number of states in the trade-off between efficiency and accuracy?  - For quantization of the weights, Wx and Wh are quantized. Then, how about activations. Actually, the gate computation includes 3 gates and 1 cell state, and the cell state might have a very different distribution than gates like the output gate in Figure 2. In addition, to be more detail, where are the quantizations applied in Eq. (1)? - In Eq. (7). during training, \theata and \alpha would change (be updated), which means activation functions are different for every iteration. Would it be ok, theoretically?
