This paper focuses on designing neural architectures for problems which exhibit the structured output's invariance to permutations of the sub-structures scores and show empirical results on a synthetic task and scene graph labeling task. The proposed architecture is fairly simple and imposes minor restrictions on the kind of parametrization required to achieve this invariance. The empirical results suggest that their approach makes use of the inductive bias regarding permutation. A concern is that the technique proposed in the paper seems fairly limited to the problems where the desired invariance properties are known and easily expressible in terms of input nodes and factors. In many cases, the invariance is either not exactly known (and should be learned) or is hard to express simply in terms of the individual input factors. For example, even rotational invariance in images might be tricky to characterize with the proposed approach. Overall, the motivation behind the problem is clear and the approach is desirable for an important class of problems in which the output subparts are correlated but not necessarily ordered or sensitive to permutation (eg set prediction). Presentation: The proof for sufficiency (any GPI can be represented by eq1) was difficult to follow. Please make it clearer, possibly by using illustrations. Also, the note on line 185 about interaction of RNNs and the proposed approach seems out of place and I'm not sure if any experiments were done regarding the comment on this note.
