The paper is clearly explaining the problem they are solving and makes good connections with OneVersusRest and LTLS, such as how they cast the previous LTLS work as an instance of loss based decoding with squared loss. Wide-LTLS is an interesting way to extend LTLS.  I was hoping the authors could address increasing the Hamming distance. I am not sure the Hamming distance is 4 as claimed because there are eventually one path per class so I would expect the Hamming distance to be 1.  The experiments are extensive but I am surprised timings are not very competitve. I would expect this method to be much faster than the baselines.
