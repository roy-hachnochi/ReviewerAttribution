 At least in the purposes and goals, the proposed method or better this work seems similar to   Ö. D. Akyıldız, I. P. Marino, J. Miguez. Adaptive noisy importance sampling for stochastic optimization, IEEE CAMSAP 2017.  However, the point is that, in my opinion, the paper is very confused. The presentation must be improved. It is even difficult to see where the importance sampling in Section 3.2. Secondly, several recent references of importance sampling are missed. Therefore, this paper is not ready for publication.
