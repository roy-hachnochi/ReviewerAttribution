The paper introduce ECBandit, a new algorithm for the bandit problem where the feedback is biased by the display bias. The method is based on variational bayesian inference and relies on some latent variables that account for the 'attention' given by the user (feedback provider) to the action played by the bandit. Experiments on synthetic and proprietary datasets are provided.  - At high level, it would be useful to clarify why a variant of the position-based models often employed in ranking algorithms cannot be adapted to this case. - While the problem is of practical interest, the main experiment reported in the paper does not seem to be reproducible. Regarding the same experiment, the number of baselines tested is extremely small and it is really hard to understand. - While the algorithm samples several parameters (step4), the experiments do not do have plot with error bars
