The authors proposed a language model based discriminator in style transfer. First, the language model has the ability to judge the style of a sentence. Also, the continuous approximation makes the training stable by token-level supervision. Experiment results show that this model outperforms the baseline models.  Strong points 1). The motivation of every component is well explained, and it is helpful in understanding the paper.  2). The continuous approximation is useful and interesting in supervising the generator by token-level.  3). The experiments are relatively sufficient, including the three tasks and the evaluation metrics.  Weak points 1). The continuous approximation is one of your contributions. You should give more detailed analysis or visualization in this respect. For example, an ablation test without continuous approximation is needed (with Reinforce Algorithm).  Typo:  it is possible to “forgoe” adversarial  As described in the conclusion, you plan to explore the semi-supervised learning, did you mean the semi-supervised style transfer?  Summary This paper treats the GAN style transfer in a novel view: language model as the discriminator. And the proposed model provides token-level supervision signal to the generator, which makes the training stable. This paper not only promotes the style transfer task but also explores how to make the GAN training stable.
