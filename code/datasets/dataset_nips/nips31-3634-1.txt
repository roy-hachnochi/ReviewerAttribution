In this work, the authors introduce a Relational Memory Cell (RMC) which could be injected to LSTM to solve the relational reasoning task. Results on supervised learning tasks and reinforcement learning tasks show that the model outperforms standard LSTM and several baseline sequential models.  Despite the motivation is attractive and the name of the model is fancy, I think this work actually just applies the self-attention to the LSTM memory cell, which I believe is very trivial and gives limited inspirations to the readers of this article.
