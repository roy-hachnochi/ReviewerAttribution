The paper presents a memory-based neural network architecture for reasoning tasks. The authors focus on a variety of tasks of relational reasoning in the context of video-games (pacman), natural language, and algorithmics. As the paper is well written, the improvement looks marginal compared to SoA. However, my main concern is the absence of the MAC cell (Manning et al 2018) which have demonstrated already strong results in such relation reasoning task even if the modification of the LSTM cell in section 3.3 looks related. Finally, the multi-head interactive attention mechanism proposed in the paper is a marginal innovation regarding SoA of this domain that seems related to self attention mechanism which has been heavily used in the context of machine reading recently.
