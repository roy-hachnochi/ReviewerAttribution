Streaming Kernel PCA with Ã•( n) Random Features  comments: - there is a very related paper NIPS 3489  - the theory seems to be ok but is also widely following concepts   provided already by the cited papers (mainly along work of Oja, Mahoney,Blanchard and others) -  I am very unhappy with the experimental part - very small - From the paper it is unclear how the Nystroem method works in this   context and how this fits in. The Nystroem method is defined for static   (non-streaming) data distributions and used to approximate a psd similarity matrix   I do not see how this fits in your scenario - nor how you could have applied the    approach in a realistic comparison (no ! details are given)  Comments to author feedback: - thanks for clarifying some issues - I am still a bit unhappy with some underlying assumptions and the link   to Nystroem - I think the paper would be much better if the theoretical   findings are supported by some results which would also show that numerical   issues do not negatively effect the theoretical claims.
