     The authors describe an RL architecture comprised of reward shaping plus representation learning that is used to solve an active classification problem, framed as "diagnosis." In this setting, an agent can measure the value of "symptoms" at some cost, and eventually makes a prediction of what disease is present. The architecture is intended to take advantage of the property that symptoms are sparse but correlated. Reward shaping is used to help the agent learn to quickly find symptoms that are present, while the correlations are used to avoid having the agent measure symptoms that are already "known" based on already-measured ones with high certainty. Experimental results demonstrate a substantial improvement over prior work.          Quality:          I think the paper addresses an interesting problem and I don't see any technical flaws. I am a bit unsure of the significance of the results because I am not sure how other non-RL methods would perform in this setting. When the authors discuss related tree-based methods, they state that "Although they design sophisticated impurity function, it is hard to obtain good results with small budgets." I think the authors either make the argument in their experimental results section that the tree-based methods are not worth competitors, or provide results for comparison. A discussion of computational burden relative to previous methods would improve the paper as well.      25 with small budgets.          Clarity:          I found the paper clearly presented. Suggestion: In mental health especially, the terms "positive" and "negative" w.r.t. symptoms already has a technical meaning. It may be better to go with "present" and "absent" rather than "positive" and "negative."          Originality:          The authors clearly identify the previous work they want to build on; however as mentioned above under "quality" it's not clear whether the experimental results signify a new advance or not.          Significance:          I could classify this paper as a useful and thoughtful combination of existing ideas. I think the methods presented would useful for many kinds of diagnosis problems besides the one presented.            As a future work possibility, the authors may want to consider the concept of "symptoms" versus "signs" in medicine; creating more nuanced models that distinguish between these could be interesting future work. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_sign          Specific comments:       26: "can prevent making a query in local view" - unclear what this means
