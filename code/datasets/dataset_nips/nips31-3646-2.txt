This is a clear well-written paper on improving interactive diagnosis systems using reinforcement learning. The two main contributions are proposing a specific form of reward shaping for interactive self-diagnosis systems, and adding a reconstruction loss in order to better deal with sparse feature spaces. Their method is evaluated on a synthetic benchmark problem used in [2] (AAAI 2018 paper) and shows significantly improved diagnosis accuracy compared to [2], as well as compared to vanilla REINFORCE.  From what I can tell the paper is novel but I am not very familiar with work on diagnosis systems. It is not necessarily groundbreaking but a fine contribution that is sufficient for NIPS presentation. Some notes / suggestions for improvement: Discuss how to deal with the situation when a patient is uncertain whether he / she has a symptom or not, or where the symptoms are categorical or real-valued. Discuss sensitivity to the beta parameter, and how it could be determined given limited interaction time. Make the choice of encoding consistent - for x_j a value of zero means no symptom, whereas in the state space it means that the symptom is unknown.
