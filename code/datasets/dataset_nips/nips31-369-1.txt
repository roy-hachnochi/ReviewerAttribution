The paper is very clear, provides a good mathematical description, is pleasant to read and expresses in clear terms the problem it is trying to solve, namely improving fine-tuning performances for fine-grained classification using maximum entropy training.  MET is relatively easy to implement and does improve performance. However, on some examples the gain is very small. This is an incremental contribution but one of good quality.
