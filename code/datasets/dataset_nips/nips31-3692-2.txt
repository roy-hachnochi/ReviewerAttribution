This paper introduces a general template, based on convex relaxation, for post-clustering validation that has theoretical guarantee, without assuming clusterability on the dataset. The authors provides an example of how in the context of k-means clustering, this can be done via SDP formulation. Although there are some parts where I feel the paper can be improved, in general I think this is an interesting theoretical contribution to an area that is important for practical concern (validation for clustering).   Here are some detailed comments for the authors to consider: - Some definitions are confusing: For example, the way the authors define an optimization problem is a bit confusing; in (5) and (6), it took me a while to understand that epsilons are not pre-defined constraints but the optimal values achieved. Also, what exactly is the matrix norm used here to gauge the difference X-X'?  - Is (6) ever tractable? Isn't X* the optimal value unknown to the algorithm? Also, it doesn't seem to appear in the subsequent text (why not removing it?) - How is (12) a special case of (5)? (again, what exactly is the matrix norm used in (5))? - Similarly, in Theorem 3, inner product is used to measure the distance (similarity) between matrices. How is it related to (5)?  - Section 4 is rather unclear. Can the authors spend a few words discussing what exactly are the clustering paradigms (losses) used in the referred papers? - If the method can be indeed extended easily to clustering objectives other than k-means (as claimed in Sec 4), then perhaps the authors should strengthen this statement by showing empirical results.
