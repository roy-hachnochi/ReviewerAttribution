The paper proposes an improvement over the bias bounds of asynchronous Gibbs sampling over those in the recent paper by C. De Sa et al (2016); the authors show that the Hamming distance between samples from Hogwild and synchronous Gibbs chains are O(log n) under certain coupling constructions. They also analyze the bias for polynomial function expectations on Ising models using recent results on concentration of measure. Empirical results on a couple of synthetic Ising models provide evidence in favor of tight coupling of these expectations between Hogwild and synchronous Gibbs runs.  Quality ===== Overall quality of work is pretty good. The coupling construction in Definition 5 is simple and elegant, and the theoretical results are solid. The treatment of the Hamming distance bounds for the polynomial Ising functions in \S 3 is very comprehensive. I did not verify the proofs in the supplementary in detail, but the theorem statements seem intuitively correct.  Clarity ===== I found the paper to be well written, albeit somewhat dense. Minor issues: - In Definition 5, given the setup on lines 156--157,perhaps it would be clearer if X_{t,v} and Y_{t,v} were set to different values in lines 151--152 to avoid confusion. - line 50: whenver -> whenever  Originality ======== Moderate. The main contributions of the paper are the coupling construction for the sampling chains and the ensuing bounds on the Hamming distances and biases. While the theoretical analysis is very thorough, it is basically an improvement of the bounds in C. De Sa et al's work, and thus not very novel in my opinion.  Significance ========== - The theoretical contribution of the paper is its main strength; the bounds on the polynomial functions should be useful for further work in analyzing mixing rates, as it appears they can be combined with Taylor approximations to derive bounds for more general functions. - While the coupling construction is elegant, the assumption of the a Hogwild run runs updating the same variables at every time step as a standard synchronous sampler seems very strong to me. - A more detailed experimental section would have made the paper stronger; in particular, error bounds for the Hogwild runs in Figure 2 would be informative.  Overall I think the paper makes a solid contribution to mixing rate analyses of asynchronous Gibbs samplers, and will be of interest to the community.
