This work proves that the distribution of the intermediate variables within Vector Approximate Message Passing (VAMP) can be predicted by a state-evolution framework, even with non-seperable denoisers.  This task is accomplished by showing that a variety of interesting denoisers are uniformly Lipschitz continuous (Def 1) and convergent under gaussian noise (Def 2).  Under these conditions, the authors show that the covariance of the terms p and q defined in equation (18) can be predicted using equations (19a-d) (p is known as the effective error elsewhere in the AMP literature). In effect, this lets one predict the per iteration MSE of the algorithm.  While the numerical results presented in this paper are interesting, they seem largely irrelevant to the rest of the paper. The results show that (D)-VAMP offers the same performance as (D)-AMP with Gaussian measurement matrices but can also handle ill-conditioned measurement matrices. However, this only demonstrates that (D)-AMP and (D)-VAMP have the same fixed points; it doesn't say anything about (D)-VAMP's state evolution. Moreover, the results make no mention of the state evolution whatsoever. These experiments need to be rethought (or at least better tied to the rest of the paper).  Overall, this is a potentially important paper that is held back by its experimental validation. Understanding (D)-VAMP theoretically is important and timely; (D)-VAMP may enable the application of the powerful (D)-AMP algorithm to real-world problems. Unfortunately, the experimental sections only show that (D)-VAMP works, which has been established elsewhere, e.g., "Denoising-based Vector AMP".  The paper is well written, some minor issues:  The first time the divergence is defined I believe it should be "normalized divergence" I'm not sure [30] is the intended denoising CNN reference.
