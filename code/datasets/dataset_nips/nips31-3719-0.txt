This is a good contribution. Posing the problem of under versus over exploration in terms of information flow is interesting. The authors clearly articulate the need to do this. The technical results are sensible and the presentation is good. There are a few comments that would help improve the presentation and the outreach of the paper (keeping in mind the variance in nips crowd).  1. Some real-world example need to be provided when motivating the stationary and diminishing information flows. 2. It is great that the authors summarized the technical results via remarks. However, some empirical plots would be helpful for different types/structures of H matrix?  3. There is no clear evaluation of the strategy to current adaptive MAB strategies -- understandable because of space, however, some comments about what to expect form such baseline comparison need to be reported.
