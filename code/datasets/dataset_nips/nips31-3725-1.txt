This paper proposed an online approach to train deep models. The approach trained the deep networks with multiply branches (including the target network) simultaneously. Then the trained single target network or the ensemble could be used for deployment. However, some equations were very confused. For example, Eqn.6 calculated the total loss with i from 0 to m as well as teacher loss. Moreover, the parameter is the same as the original network. Can it considered as an ensemble learning? Some theory analysis should be provided. In addition, the efficiency of the training should be discussed.
