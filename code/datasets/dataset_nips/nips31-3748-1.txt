The paper attempts to replace the MLE estimate for a sequence2sequence model with an adversarial criterion. The argument is that auto-regressive neural networks, i.e., recurrent neural networks, do not play nicely with adversarial training. The amount of novelty in the paper is limited as this paper is far from the first to consider a mix of recurrent neural networks and generation. Indeed, about a year ago Yoav Goldberg posted an adversarial review of a related paper: https://medium.com/@yoav.goldberg/an-adversarial-review-of-adversarial-generation-of-natural-language-409ac3378bd7.   I think the evaluation of the paper is quite borked. How can you even consider an evaluation of non-conditioned generation? The paper is hopefully linguistically lost. As far as I can figure, the only reasonable way to evaluate unconditioned generation is through grammaticality, i.e., syntactic correctness. For instance, is the sentence “A yellow banana is lying on the table” better than the sentence “a purple banana is lying on the table” just because the former is more common, and, thus, rightly has higher probability under *any* good model? Of course not! Any attempt at computational creativity has to be able to distinguish likely (probably not creative) from syntactically valid. The paper ignores an entire field of linguistic inquiry. See, for instance, Lau et al. (2018) in Cognitive Science, who investigate the ability of neural language models ot assess grammaticality.
