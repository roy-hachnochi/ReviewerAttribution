The authors study a distributed stochastic gradient in a master-worker setting with two constraints (a) the gradients computed by different worker nodes must be differentially private, and (b) the communication from the worker nodes to the master node should be limited via quantization. the authors design schemes where nodes add noise to their gradients for the sake of differential privacy before sending it to the master for aggregation.  The main insight of the paper is that binomial random variables are a good choice for the noise perturbations used by the workers; and that rotational noise can help improve privacy guarantees significantly.  The results seem relevant in that it combines two areas of work where there is significant amount of prior work - communication efficiency and differential privacy in distributed SGD. The idea of adding binomial RVs - which are the discrete counter parts of Gaussians - seems natural and intuitive, at least wit hind sight. From a technical viewpoint, it appears that the main contribution is to develop mechanisms for computing the mean of RVs in a differentially private communication efficient manner; since estimating the mean of the gradients reliably leads to reliable estimation of the gradient itself, this leads to reliable estimation of gradients.  I found the theorem statements tough to parse and proofs tough to read. I would have liked to see the following comments addressed: --> How does the scheme where noise is added to the gradients prior to quantization perform in comparison with the proposed scheme? --> It seems that the error of the proposed scheme decays as d/n. How does this decay compare with schemes that are not differentially private, or with schemes that are not quantized - a discussion in this regard would help understanding the results better.
