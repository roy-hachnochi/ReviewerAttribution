Main ideas ========== This paper proposes a method for solving two player games with imperfect information. The technique used is to perfrom a depth limited game tree search, and at the depth-limit consider a range of values - possible outcomes of following a fixed strategy - and then checking its relation to the best response.   The experimental results show that the resulting solver outperforms state of the art Poker AI players, and requires significantly lower computation resources. The authors also experimented with a deep learning based approach for the estimation part of their algorithm, with so-so results.  Weakness ==========  Clarity: Up to section 4, the paper is clear.  From section 4 and onwards, I found it very difficult to understand, because it is not clear what are the simplifying assumptions being made, what are implementation details, and what are the key technical contributions.   Also, the authors focus on two player games, but in several places in the paper go back to the more general n-player definitions. This is very confusing and unhelpful. For examples, see lines 94 and 125.    Strengh ========= Significance:  It seems to me that Proposition 1 is key to the theoretical correctness of the proposed approach, but it is not given a formal proof.  Also, the lack of clarity of the proposed method will make it very hard to verify or understand the main ideas underlying this work.  However, the state of the art results are extremely impressive.   Originality:  Novel as far as I could tell.    Others: Line 94: \Sigme_i was not defined.  Line 145: " ... of three lanes to choose ..." - This sentence is not clear to me at all.
