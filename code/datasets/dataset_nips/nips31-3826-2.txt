The main result of the paper is giving tight bounds on the number of n-variable boolean functions that can be expressed as degree d-polynomial threshold functions for any fixed d (d growing very mildly with n) also works. To me the rest of the results while interesting seem to be mostly easy applications of the key result to other more fashionable neural network models. However, the tightness of the main result does not translate to tight bounds when other neuroidal models are considered, because of the kind of non-linearities or weight constraints involved.   The main result is highly non-trivial, the proof quite lengthy though elegant, and resolves a 25 year old open problem. Although the proof uses a lot of heavy mathematics, the key contribution seems to be generalizing random matrix theory to a random tensor theory -- the key result being that a large number of stochastically independent random vectors in low-dimension (and hence clearly not linearly indpendent) still yield a high degree of linear independence when tensorized. Although the kind of techniques and results may be unfamiliar to a NIPS audience, I think it would be interesting to the NIPS audience and suggest the paper be accepted.  Below I've included some typos that I found in the 8-page version as well as the longer supplementary (however, the page numbers in the supplementary refer to the arxiv v1 of the paper):  8-page paper: Line 23: contained in |A -> remove the | Line 40: class of Boolean function -> functionS Line 59: Section -> section Line 60: W -> We Eq(7) : Missing [] in the middle term Eq(10) : leq => \leq I'm not really sure how to interpret the various results Sec 4.2 onwards that read of the form N^2(1 + o(1)) +/- \Theta(N) terms. Unless we know that o(1) is actually o(1/N), the additional \Theta(N) terms are essentially meaningless?  Arxiv version: Page 21 (towards end of Proof lemma 4.4): (Cauchy-Schwarz step) -> the equality should be an inequality Page 22 (middle of page just below equation) : extreme combinatorics -> extremal combinatorics? Page 25: I believe there are some typos in Lemma 5.3, e.g. V^\perp - U^\perp may not even be a vector space, so I'm not sure what its dimension would be. There appear to be a couple of typos in the proof as well.
