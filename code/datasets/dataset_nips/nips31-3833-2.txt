The author propose an end-to-end reasoning framework which can compose solutions without supervision. They present highly convincing experiments where they can demonstrate that their approach solves a comparable number of benchmark problems as a state-of-the-art theorem prover but with much fewer queries. I have background in inductive programming but nor background in theorem proving and in end-to-end learning. So maybe my enthusiasm is due to some lack in knowledge. In my opinion, the presented approach has a high quality and the results are original and significant. The paper is carefully written and a supplement provides details about the dataset and the competition.
