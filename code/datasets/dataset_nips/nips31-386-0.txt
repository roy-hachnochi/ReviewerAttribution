Summary  The paper provides a new lower bound in consistency analysis of convex surrogate loss functions. Section 1 provides an introduction which discusses previous work and contributions. The main previous work is Osokin et al, which is frequently referenced in the text. The main contribution is a generalization of the results of Osokin et al to inconsistent surrogates, and a new tighter lower bound. An additional contribution is a study the behavior of the proposed bound for two prediction problems.  Section 2 provides definitions of the task loss and surrogate loss, while section 3 defines the calibration function which links them. The concept of level-eta consistency is defined. Level-0 consistency is the same as Fisher consistency, whereas with eta>0 "the surrogate is not consistent meaning that the actual risk cannot be minimized globally." Section 4 provides a new lower bound, with discussion that clarifies how the paper is novel wrt previous work. Section 5 analyzes the bounds in two problem settings: multi-class classification with tree-structured loss and ranking with mean average precision loss. Section 6 provides a discussion and conclusion.  Pros: - frequent references to previous work which help clarify the novelty. - new proof technique and lower bound. - results include a comparison with previous work (Figure 1b) in order to show a visual example of how the previous bound is trivial and the proposed bound is tighter.  Cons: - no clear discussion of how the analysis may lead to new loss functions or efficient learning algorithms.
