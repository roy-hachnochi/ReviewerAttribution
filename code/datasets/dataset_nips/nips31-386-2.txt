The paper analyzes consistency properties of surrogate losses for structured prediction problems, generalizing the result of Osokin et al. to the inconsistent surrogates. The behavior of the proposed bound is illustrated in two concrete cases.  Overall, the paper is technically solid and makes positive contribution. In the inconsistent case, a non-trivial bound on the calibration function is given, which is a reasonable contribution. However it is not discussed in the paper how better bounds would lead to algorithmic implications.  In terms of presentation, the paper is also hard to follow, partly due to the fact that this work is heavily based on a previous paper (Osokin et al.). Additionally, the notation is overloaded and sometimes unclear. I believe the presentation can be largely improved.   A few typos found: Line 104: minimize -> minimized Equation (6) the order of losses is not consistent with mentioned in text.             Line 150 \eta -> \epsilon Line 156 than -> then
