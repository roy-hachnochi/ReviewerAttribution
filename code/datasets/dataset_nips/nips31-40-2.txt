This paper tackles the problem of manipulating images by sentences description. To preserve the text-irrelevant content in the original image, they propose text-adaptive discriminator that creates word level local discriminators. The experimental results show that the proposed method can better manipulate the attributes while preserving text-irrelevant content in an image than other state-of-the-art text-to-image synthesis approaches.  This paper is very well-written. It proposes a new task and a novel model to solve it. Both quantitative and qualitative results are convincing. Its contribution is significant and I recommend to accept it.
