This work presents a method for end-to-end sequence learning, and more specifically in the framework of Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC). The paper has two main contributions: - The first is a regularization of the training of the CTC objective in order to reduce the over-confidence of the model. In order to do that, the authors propose a method based on conditional entropy. More specifically, the proposed regularization would encourages the model to explore paths that are close to the dominant one.  - The second contribution is a pruning method in order to reduce the space of possible alignments. In order to do so, they suppose that the consecutive elements of a sequence have equal spacing. The authors prove that this situation corresponds to the maximum of entropy over the possible segmentations of the sequence.  The paper mainly advocates for the combination of the two contributions. The authors also provide details about dynamic programming to optimize the proposed objective. They finally compare their methods to the state-of-the-art approaches on different datasets.   The contributions of the paper are well motivated, and their effect seems to be significant according to the experimental results. The two proposed regularization are also well explained intuitively, and through supporting theory. In addition, the effect of the regularization is well analyzed in the experiments section. For all these reasons I vote for acceptance of this paper.   Minor comment: There is a typo in equation (3) in the partial derivative notation.
