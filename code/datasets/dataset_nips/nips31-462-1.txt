The paper introduces a novel optimization strategy for solving the graph matching problem. It starts with the original combinational optimization formulation and proposed a couple of relaxations, including, relaxing the integer variables to real variables, approximating the quadratic objective function using separable functions, which are then relaxed using a series of smoother functions (where the limit of the smoother functions approximate the separable function). The final objective function is optimized in two ways, namely, using path-following strategy and multiplication strategy.   I like reading the paper. The writing is clear. When introducing a relaxation, the outcome and various properties are explained. The idea of using separate functions is interesting and appears to be useful.  On the down side, I would like to see more challenging examples. Also, what is the key benefit of this relaxation? Does it merely improve the quality of the matching, or the relaxation makes it more scalable to large-scale GM problems. The improvements in map quality are not salient. So if it is the latter case, it would be good to share more examples.   Overall, the submission is solid. I am positively inclined, and if other reviewers are positive, then I am support accepting the paper.   Minor comments:  1. What is the converging criterion for Algorithm 1 and Algorithm 2, respectively?
