The key contribution of this paper is empirical evaluation of a new, numerical friendly GPU implementation of the EGT method for solving extensive form games. The evaluation is done against state of the art CFR/CFR+ variants.   Quality:   + The overall quality of the paper is high  + The evaluation is done on a meaningful games  + Authors tried hard to make the comparison fair, and I believe they did a good job in doing so.  - While authors mention the GPU implementation multiple times, there’s no analysis nor discussion what speedups this actually brings. Since the results (Figure 1) are all compared in the number of iterations, it should look exactly the same if the implementation would be on CPU.  -The experimental section is near impossible to reproduce. The reason is that the games the authors run the experiments on are the subgames reached by Libratus agent. These are not accessible which means that a) no-one can really reproduce the graphs b) somewhat breaks blind submission since it’s clear who has access to these subgames.   Clarity:  + The paper is well written and structured  Originality:  + Authors do a good job in explaining the previous work  - The actual contribution from prior work is not large, the paper is mostly about numerical stable implementation on GPUs and evaluation.  Significance:   + The results are for sure interesting for the community  - The results are not particularly surprising, pretty much align with what previous research would suggest
