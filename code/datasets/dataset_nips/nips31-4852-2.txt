  This paper tackles the problem of forecasting -- predict into a fixed horizon the future of a univariate random variable given its history and the forecast for the associated covariates. In this approach, instead of learning the (time varying) state space parameters of each time series independently, the forecasting model maps from covariate vectors to the parameters of a linear SSM for each time series using an RNN. The intuition is that the covariates contain sufficient information that an RNN can learn to predict the parameters corresponding to the linear time-varying dynamical system.  Experimentally, the paper tests the sample complexity of the method on synthetic data. On two publicly available datasets, the proposed method outperforms a baseline of DeepAR and ARIMA, particularly in the small data regime where there is only a short time horizon that is provided to condition upon.  Overall, the paper is well written and easy to follow. The idea is simple and appears, from the presented results, effective. As one might expect, this kind of model works best when the forecasts are being performed using very short initial time-horizons.  One concern that I have is the choice to include Section 4.3 in this paper. I understand the idea behind it (which is that for non-Gaussian likelihoods, one can use VAEs to maximize the likelihood of data and use variational learning for parameter estimation). However, (from what I understand) it is not experimented with and is primarily proposed as a potential extension. My suggestion would be to explore this idea in a different submission. In its current form, it only serves to show that the current proposal has potential future work.
