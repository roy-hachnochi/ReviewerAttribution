The paper proposes to learn a linear model for combining multiple objectives via an oracle that provides feedback via preferences. It formulates the problem as a dueling bandit problem and applies a simple adaptation of dueling bandit gradient descent to solve the problem. When training the underlying hypothesis that will optimize the current linear combination is expensive, the paper also proposes a boosting style algorithm that basically uses as base learners models that have been trained on each objective separately. Experiments on a multilabel problem show that the proposed approach can find good combinations of two objectives (instance margin and label margin) that will optimize different multilabel metrics.  The paper seems to be a straightforward combination of dueling bandits and the paper by Zhang et. al. 2016 and seems very incremental. Using boosting for blending the base models is a cute idea for avoiding to refit the model on the new objective as it evolves but I still don't think that this paper has enough new material to meet the NIPS bar.
