This paper proposes an adversarial learning approach based on GAN for repairing software vulnerabilities. GAN learns the mapping from one discrete source domain to another target domain, which does not require labeled pairs. The proposed model is shown effectiveness and the experimental performance is close to previous seq2seq approach using labeled pairs of data.  Pros: * Security vulnerabilities in software programs pose serious risks and automatically repairing vulnerabilities is an important task to study.  * It is much easier to obtain unpaired data in many seq2seq applications. The idea of using GAN to learn a mapping between two domains is novel, which is effective to train the model without paired examples.  * The paper is well-organized and easy to follow. The proposed GAN framework and the two regularizations are generally sound.  * The experimental results prove the effectiveness of GAN for vulnerabilities repairing, which obtains comparable performance of state-of-the-art seq2seq models which use labeled pairs of data.   Cons: * The discussion of the differences in the results of AUTO and PREQ regularization could be added in the experiment section.
