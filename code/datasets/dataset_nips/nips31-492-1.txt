This paper present new channel pruning approach for CNN compression.  (Pros) The paper is well-written and well-illustrated; hence it was easy to understand the authors’ proposal. It reports the minimum accuracy loss compare with existing channel pruning approach.  (Cons) However, I am somewhat skeptical on this paper because recently proposed compact CNN (e.g. ShuffleNet, MobileNet v2) can achieve higher accuracy with smaller model size and MAC Gops than channel-pruned model in this paper.   In the experiment, relatively heavy networks are used for model compression. Instead of these heavy network, If the proposed approach can squeeze the compact network successfully, then impact of this paper will be increased. Although there is an experimental result for MobileNet on CIFAR-10 in supplementary material, I think it is not enough. Results on ILSVRC-12 are needed.   Another skeptical point is that the fine-tuning process is too long compare to other methods – 60 epochs for ILSVRC-12 (vs 13 or 10 epochs in ThiNet). It is not clear the small accuracy loss is due to the proposed pruning approach or just long training.
