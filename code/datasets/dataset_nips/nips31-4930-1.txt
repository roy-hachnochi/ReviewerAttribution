The paper introduces a variance reduction strategy for stochastic EM inference. The general approach consist in considering EM as a fix point algorithm and then apply an already proposed a variance reduction technique to solve the fix-point equation.  The paper is clear and well written. The context and state of the art are well exposed. The main novelty is to apply the reduced variance step to the EM algorithm, which changes significantly the probabilistic framework. The proposed algorithm achieves a convergence rate that is comparable to the batch EM, which does not always scale for large datasets.  Both Theorems 1 and 2 are new, although Thm 1 is obviously the main result. The authors are a bit elliptic about condition (b) of Thm 1. It would be interesting to know for which typical model it holds and for which it does not. It would also be interesting to know if it holds for the models considered in the simulation study.
