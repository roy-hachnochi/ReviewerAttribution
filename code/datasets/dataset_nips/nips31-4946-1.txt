In this paper, the authors have presented the notion of spectral signatures and demonstrate how they can be used to detect backdoor poisoning attacks. Our outlier detection method relies on the idea that learned representations for classifiers amplify signals crucial to classification. To me, the idea makes sense and have some promising results. I have only one concern for this paper. If SVD is employed for the method, what is the computational complexity of the proposed model? Can the method be applied to large-scale real-world applications?
