The paper presents a novel idea to detect backdoor attacks in neural networks. Although the idea is interesting, the experimental evaluation presented is limited in comparison to accepted papers in similar fields in top conferences. To ensure that the paper makes the threshold, additional experiments are needed. In particular, new experiments that 1) assess what potential adversaries may attempt to do to circumvent the defense, 2) evaluate multiple DNN architectures, 3) explore the effects of sub-populations within the same class. It seems that the defense relies in finding the difference of population means; it is not clear if having a classification task, e.g. mammals vs. objects, would render the solution unusable.
