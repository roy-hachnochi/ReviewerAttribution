Authors propose to use matrix sketching methods to approximate some subspace based scores for outlier detection. They suggest " projection distance" and "leverage scores" as outlier scores. Neither the idea, nor the methods are original or new. leverage scores and projection distances have been used before for outlier detection, and authors use existing methods in literature to approximate these scores. It seem novelty of the work is in proofs. I did not double check correctness of all proofs. I have a question for the authors : in the experiment section, they mention to measure accuracy, they choose a value of eta' which maximizes F1 score. At the end they are reporting F1 scores of the competing methods. So why are they changing the threshold eta' to obtain the maximum F1. I dont see a training and testing phase, that you'll say for example eta' is found in the training phase and then it is used in testing to measure F1 score.... Please clarify.
