Proximal Graphical Event Models  The paper describes proximal graphical event models (PGEM) to characterize relationships between events based on whether parent events of an event actually happen in a time window that preceded that event. The author suggest a framework for setting the optimal width of a window and a greedy structure-learning algorithm to learn a PGEM to maximize BIC. In addition, the authors evaluate their algorithm compared with two alternatives using several synthetic and real-world databases.  Overall, the paper is well written, clear, original, convincing, and motivated.  My main concern is related to the structure-learning approach that is incremental in a greedy fashion, where parents for each variable are learned conditioned on the variable own optimal window, and windows can have different sizes (durations) and overlap. Then there is a danger that the domain causal meaning will be missed out (say explaining a disease in the light of comorbidities and/or symptoms of comorbidities that have different causes). I would expect the authors to consider and discuss this issue.  Major issues  Although Lemmas 2-4 are intuitively proved, they invite formal proofs.  I do not see major differences among the three graphs tested in Section 4.1, and thus I would expect the experimental evaluation to consider broader ranges of parameters for the synthesis of data.
