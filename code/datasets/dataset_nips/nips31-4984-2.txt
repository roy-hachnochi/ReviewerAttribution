The main drawback of Graphical Event Models is that they require the user to specify a set of basis functions, which may requires hardworking in hyper-parameter tuning. The authors then propose a new proximal graphical event models (PGEM), which can learn such a set of basis functions. My main concern about the paper is the writing.  (1) In section 2.2, the authors gives the definition of a proximal graphical model M. However, the authors did not give the associated distribution, and then directly goes to the log-likelihood in Section 3.1. For readers who are not familar with this topic it is hard to understand.  (2) The authors uses abbreviations such as BIC, AIC and BD directly, for readers who does have background, it prevents readers to get the main idea in several sections. Maybe the authors should write a small section about these definitions.  Minor problems: First page: (REF: Zhou et. al. 2013) should be fixed with correct citations.
