The paper describes an approach to make inference over the variables in a probabilistic graphical model by leveraging sequential Monte Carlo method by twisting the target distribution. Twisting of the target distribution allows the future observations to be of influence when making inference, which addresses a key weakness of existing SMC for PGM algorithm (Naesseth et. al. (2014)). The twisted target can be specified using existing inexact, yet fast inference methods for PGM. The authors propose three specific choices that can be useful for specifying the twisting function and they seem to cover wide range of models as demonstrated in the experiments.  I think the paper is clearly written and it is easy to follow.   But the paper may be slightly  lacking in terms of novelty expected from a NIPS paper. Twisting the function is not a new idea, adapting it for PGM and working out the details is not exactly trivial but its contribution appears to be incremental compared to previous work in this field by Naesseth et al. (2014).
