The algebraic problem of low rank tensor decomposition still does not have a satisfactory solution. Even finding the tensor rank is NP-hard [arXiv:0911.1393].  The paper assumes in eq(1) that the rank r is known a-priory which is rarely the case. But under this assumption the paper proceeds to systematically derive Approximate Message Passing algorithm in the large-N limit where mean-field approximation becomes exact.  The paper discovers several inference regimes depending on the signal-to-noise levels (SNR).  At SNR below curtain threshold inference becomes impossible. Detailed comparisons of AMP to Alternating Least Squares (ALS) are provided as well.  The paper is reasonably well written. However, it lacks any practical example problem where a low-rank tensor is embedded in additive Gaussian noise. Only synthetic numerical examples are provided.
