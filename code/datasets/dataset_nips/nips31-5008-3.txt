This line of research seems interesting, as it proposes an alternative view on the computation of low-rank tensor decomposition. On the other hand, my impression is that the paper itself needs some more work as it is quite technical and difficult to read. There are also some assumptions that should be better justified, such as r<N (top of page 3), N-->\infinity (last paragraph of Section 2.1). The simulations are useful but somewhat limited. In particular, it is unclear what kind of practical applications (if any) the authors have in mind.
