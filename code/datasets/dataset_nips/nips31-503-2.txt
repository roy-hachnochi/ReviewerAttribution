The paper offers a method to estimate data-dependent uncertainty in attention mechanisms in current neural networks using a Bayesian setting. Applications to a particular RNN model known as RETAIN, running on three time-series health data show promising results.  Pros: - The problem under investigation is important, especially in critical domains such as healthcare - The approach through Bayesian inference with variational approximation is reasonable  Cons:  - The novelty is not very significant as it is an incremental step from current advances in Bayesian deep learning - Evaluation on RETAIN only is somewhat limited, as there is no reason to stick with just one particular RNN variant. For health time-series, a major problem is irregular in data sampling, and this confounds with the uncertainty estimate.
