The paper studies the online portfolio selection problem in which capital is divided between $N$ financial instruments and rebalanced in each round. The goal of the learner is to reweight her portfolio between rounds as to minimize her (multiplicative) regret compared to the best constant rebalanced portfolio.  The problem is known to have an optimal regret of $O(N \log T)$ with $T$ being the time horizon that is implemented using a computationally-inefficient method. Many efficient implementations exist, most notably Online Newton Step which gives an $O(G N \log T)$ regret bound where $G$ is a problem-dependent parameter controlled by the adversary that can be made arbitarily large.  This work presents a computationally-efficient algorithm that enjoys $O(N^2 \log^4 T)$ regret bound independently of $G$. The authors do so by augmenting the ONS algorithm with the logarithmic barrier such that each instrument has its own learning rate. By noticing that $G$ increases whenever the algorithm has a large regret against one of the instruments, the algorithm increases its learning rate to account for the increase in $G$ thus quickly canceling its effect on the regret.   The paper is well written. The ideas are put forward in a clear and concise manner. Overall a very nice paper.
