[Summary]  This paper studies an online reciprocal recommendation problem. The authors first model the problem as the recommendation problem in which, at each time, boy b randomly chosen from set B visits a matching site and the site recommend girl g in set G to the boy and the same process is repeated by switching the roles of boys and girls. They assume a function \sigma from (G\times B)\cup(B\times G) to {-1,1}. The objective is maximization of the uncovered matched pairs by time T. They first proposed algorithm OOMM that recommends b/g to g/b for which \sigma(b,g)/\sigma(g,b) is known. Next they proposed algorithm SMILE that estimates clusters of (boys b)/(girls g) which have similar preference function \sigma(x,b)/\sigma(x,g), and recommend b/g to g/b for which b/g is a member of an estimated cluster whose \sigma(x,b)/\sigma(x,g) is likely to be 1 for (x=g)/(x=b). They proved that the number of the matched pairs uncovered by OOMM is proportional to the rate of known function values but that by SMILE is proportional to the number of the true matched pairs if the number of known function values are enough large. They also empirically demonstrated the superiority of their algorithms by comparing the number of matched pairs uncovered by them and with that by a random selection algorithm.   [Originality]  Their formalization, algorithms and theoretical and empirical results look new.  [Strengths]  * Clear formalization of the problem. * Theoretically guaranteed algorithms. * Performance superiority of their proposed algorithms for large real-world datasets   compared to the performance of a random algorithm.  [Weakness]  * How to set the parameter S remains a problem. * Algorithm SMILE is interesting but their theoretical results on its performance is not easy to interpret. * No performance comparison with existing algorithms  [Recommendation]  I recommend this paper to be evaluated as "a good submission; an accept". Their problem formalization is clear, and SMILE algorithm and its theoretical results are interesting. All their analyses are asymptotically evaluated, so I worry about how large the constant factors are. It would make this manuscript more valuable if  how good their algorithms (OOMM & SMILE) would be shown theoretically and empirically  compared to other existing algorithms.  [Detailed Comments] p.7 Th 3 & Cor 1: C^G and C^B look random variables. If it is true, then they should not be used as parameters of T's order. Maybe the authors want to use their upper bounds shown above instead of them.  p.7 Sec. 5 : Write the values of parameter S.   [Comments to Authorsâ€™ Feedback] Setting parameter S: Asymptotic relation shown in Th 3 is a relation between two functions. It is impossible to estimate S from estimated M  for a specific n using such a asymptotic functional relation.
