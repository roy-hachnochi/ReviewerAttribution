This is a strong paper that proposes a convincing solution to the open problem of selection of groups for group lasso. It proposes consistency guarantees (rates of convergence seem out of reach for such a difficult problem). The idea is to introduce a continuous relaxation of the mixed-integer problem, combined with recent results about bilevel optimization (Ochs et al.). Numerical experiments are convincing, even when the number of groups given as input overestimates the real number of groups. The paper opens a way to deal with a set of other losses and penalizations, which seems very promising. My only criticism is that the authors could do a comparison / parallel with relaxation techniques used for mixed-integer programming, since some heuristics used in this field might help or bring new ideas.  I also wonder what would be the performance of a MIP solver directly applied to the problem, with the subproblem solved by an efficient convex solver, such a numerical comparison might motivate even further the approach of the paper.
