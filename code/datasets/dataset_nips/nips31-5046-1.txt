After reviewing author response and other reviews, I'm slightly upgrading my score.  I agree with the author response about the differences between the approach on Song et al, which MUST be a part of the revised paper.  I acknowledge that adversarial images and adversarial domain names have different objectives.  However, the authors should temper claims that this is the first paper to explore non L_p-norm constrained perturbations.  The theme of the two papers are more alike than the authors rebuttal: generate a new object without constraints that can still evade a machine learning model.  Creating a domain name that appears benign to human and domain classifier may nor may not be significantly easier than hallucinating an image that is misclassified by a convnet.  This paper proposes generating adversarial examples (in a more general sense), from an AC-GAN. The key contribution appears to be the use of GANs to generate these general-case adversarial examples. It is clearly written.  However, the originality is low.  It collides with several previous works that the authors made no attempt to cite or references.  Without searching, the reviewer is aware of these two recent examples (there are likely many others):  (1) Song et al and colleagues authored similar work with the same motivation https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.02610 (2) Anderson et al demonstrated GANs for adversarially bypassing malicious domain detection, and also defined "adversarial examples" in this broader context https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.01969  Because of the lack of originality, this reviewer cannot recommend this paper for acceptance.
