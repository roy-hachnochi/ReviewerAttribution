The authors provide PAC-Bayes bounds using differential privacy for data dependent priors. They further discuss the approximation of the differential private priors based on the stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics, which has certain convergence properties in 2-Wasserstein distance. They further connect such an approach to study the generalization bound of neural nets using PAC-Bayes, which seems interesting. However, it is not quite clear to me why this procedure is helpful in measuring the generalization bound (e.g., for the neural nets). Empirically, we can measure the empirical generalization gap, and theoretically the differential privacy based bound can be looser than the PAC-Bayes bound. Further discussion regarding this aspect will be helpful.  After rebuttal: I thank the authors for their efforts to address my queries. The answers are helpful and I think the idea of connecting the PAC-Bayes and differential privacy is interesting.
