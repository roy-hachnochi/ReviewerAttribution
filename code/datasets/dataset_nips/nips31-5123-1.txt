In this paper the authors study dimensional reduction (DR) maps from quantitative topology point of view and show that no DR map can achieve perfect precision and perfect recall simultaneously. The authors prove upper bound on precision of Lipschitz continuous DR map. To further quantify the distortion, the authors proposed a new  measure based on L2-Wasseman distance and also provided lower bound for Lipschitz continue DR maps.  Comments:  1. The paper advances theoretical understanding precision and recall when  dimension reduction occurs. It has been observed in numerical experiments that there exists a tradeoff between precision and recall when dimensionality reduction happens, which was not previously well understood. This papers sheds some light towards that end. Main contribution of this paper is its technical proofs which this reviewer was unable to check in its entirety due to lack of time and expertise.
