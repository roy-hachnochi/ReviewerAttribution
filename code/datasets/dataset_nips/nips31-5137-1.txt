SUMMARY: The authors propose to learn a representation of regularization functionals in inverse reconstruction problems by following adversarial training approach. Theoretical derivations of the problem and its stability are presented, illustrative cases implemented for demonstration purposes.   PRO: * the overall idea of learning a problem (patient?) specific reconstruction function, or regularization functional, is interesting. * the authors presented a dedicated theoretic treatment of the matter  CON * results are little more than case studies, the chosen examples (at the end and in the supplementary material) demonstrate only limited advantages in qualitative and quantitative terms. * I somewhat feel that "Adversarial Regularizers in Inverse Problems" might oversell the purpose of solving a PET/CT image reconstruction task.
