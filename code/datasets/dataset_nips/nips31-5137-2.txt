This paper proposes a framework for training an adversarial discriminator, and using it as a prior for signal reconstruction problems. The authors ask theoretical questions about when such a regularizer would be successful.  The theoretical questions are well thought out, and the proofs are fairly simple and do not reveal any major new analysis methods.  The experimental setting is well setup (although lacking a few things I'd like to see) and I appreciate that the authors were upfront about the fact that their algorithm doesn't achieve the best performance on the denoising task.  While I think this paper is worth accepting, I have some qualms because the experiments feel a bit incomplete.  The are of regularization using neural nets is becoming somewhat mature, and a range of methods exist, including plug-and-play, and "regularization by denoising."
