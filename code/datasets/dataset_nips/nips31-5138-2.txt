The paper proposes a modification of Kleinberg's three axioms for clustering. In particular, instead of examining the property of a clustering function, the paper considers properties of clustering objectives. This is similar to the previous work of [Ben-David, Ackerman 09], but also taking into account the number of clusters and examining the optimum of a clustering objective instead of the cost. My comments are below: 1. In my opinion, the paper is of marginal significance, in comparison to existing work. 2. I have a question for the authors: in the negative cases (inadmissability section), optimal clustering for the instances are derived; how were you sure that these are indeed the optimum? For example, in Theorem 4.1, how can you justify that the optimal clustering of the original instance d is indeed an optimum (and the only optimum)?
