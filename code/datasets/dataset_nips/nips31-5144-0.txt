Reward functions often pose a bottleneck to real-world applications of reinforcement learning. Inverse reinforcement learning tries to overcome this problem by learning to mimic expert behavior. But this requires expert demonstrations which can be difficult or expensive in practice. This paper proposes an inverse event-based control, which generalizes inverse reinforcement learning methods to cases where full demonstrations are not needed, but only to know the probability that a certain event occurred.  Authors have done a considerable amount of work. However, I feel that the presentation of the paper needs to be improved before it can be accepted. In the current form, the paper is not self-contained and it is very hard to follow. It refers to additional material several times. I feel that it will be unfair to other authors who try to make their papers self-contained despite additional materials.  ==  In the rebuttal, the authors have agreed to improve the clarity of the paper for the final version. I have increased the score.
