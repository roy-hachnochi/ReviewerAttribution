After reading the authors' response, I've updated the score accordingly. Now I'm clearer about the authors' intuition than before. My major concerns are:  (1) d = O(p log p) as the VC dimension of a neural network is too large a number in the theorems, since the number of parameters in the neural network can reach millions easily. In consequence, it is saying that the target error is smaller than a super large number despite that d is within a reasonable range. (2) Though the results are not required to be SOTA, it should be at least comparable to SOTA. ~30% lower than SOTA still remains a problem. ___________________________________________________________________________ Overall: This work extends the previous work, called domain adaptation neural nets (DANN), to multiple sources.   Clarity: The idea is clear. The writing is easy to follow.  Originality: This work is incremental to previous research. It can be simplified by DANN with a multi-class domain classifier. For the proposed method MDAN, (i) the domain discriminator number is proportional to domain number, which is a problem in practice when the source domain number goes high. (ii) The proof is standard and straightforward using H-divergence. However, Corollary 1 and Theorem 2 requires the VC dimension of the encoder module. Since the a neural network is used, the VC dimension will go to ‘nearly’ infinity. It would be better if the authors can give some explanation on this point.  (iii) The competitive methods are limited (only DANN and standard neural network) on the text classification and vehicle counting dataset. It would be better if the authors can compare with more recent works, like the kernel or optimal transport domain adaptation methods. For the digit image dataset, recent works can achieve much better results than the reported ones. For instance, Shu, Rui, et al. "A DIRT-T Approach to Unsupervised Domain Adaptation." ICLR 2018,  reaches  98% on MNISTM dataset, which is 30% higher than the result given in table 2. Thus the comparison methods in the left part of table 2, which is best single source, should at least be more carefully selected. (iv) It would be better if the author can show the domain weights w in each setting. For instance, it is more likely that mnistm is matched to svhn since they are both colored images. However, mnist should contribute the most to mnistm since mnistm is generated from mnist. It would be interesting if the proposed method can solve this problem.
