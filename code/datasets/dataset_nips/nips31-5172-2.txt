This paper considered the problem of detecting latent community structure given a sparse graph along with high-dimensional node covariates. The problems with either sparse graph or high-dimensional node covariates have been rather extensively studied in the literature, so the modeling innovation is community detection based on both pieces of information correlated with the same latent structure. To me, this problem seems to be rather contrived. Not surprisingly, the threshold prediction is one (see equation (4)) that naturally bridges the two extreme cases where only one piece of information is available (see Theorem 1 and 2). From the technical viewpoint, the main result is a formal confirmation of the threshold prediction in the limit of large degrees via a Gaussian model. The proof is rather nontrivial and appears to be interesting.
