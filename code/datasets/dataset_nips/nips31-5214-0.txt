This paper improves the existing Attend, Infer, Repeat paper for sequential data and moving objects. This is a much needed improvement of the AIR technique and the results are very promising.   I have a few questions to the others and suggestions of improvements: 1,The sequence length is fixed and predefined. For multi-MNIST, the length is 10 and thus the model is always trained on models of length 10. What if the data has variable lengths? What if the SQAIR model is trained on different sequence lengths - make the length as a hyperparameter and show the performance. 2. A more practical experimentation would be on any self driving car dataset. It would be great if the authors could add results on that. 3. The details of the models and the analysis results are added in the appendix and in supplementary. Its an important part of the paper and should be included in the paper.
