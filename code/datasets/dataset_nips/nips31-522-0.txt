The authors introduce a spatiotemporal action detection approach using weak supervision. Namely, an L2 norm-based discriminative clustering approach is coupled with different types of supervision as constraints.  In particular, such constraints are related to video-level class labels, temporal points or bounding boxes.  In turn, a regularized cost function under a linear model is solved based on the Frank-Wolfe algorithm to relax integer constraints. Attained results show an interesting flexibility regarding the weak supervision, which is useful for many computer vision applications.  The paper is well-motivated, however, the mathematical derivations seem to be fair for a NIPS paper.  In particular, a deep analysis of Eq (5) could be included concerning the optimization foundations. Besides, the implementation and mathematical details of the supervision as constraints section could be enhanced (at least in the supplementary material).
