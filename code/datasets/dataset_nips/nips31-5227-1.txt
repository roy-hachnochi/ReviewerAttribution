PhaseMax is a recently developed convex relaxation of the phase retrieval problem that avoids the need to perform computationally intractable lifting. In this work, the authors derive necessity and sufficiency conditions to solve regularized versions of phase max, i.e., phasemax plus a regularization penalty, for instance an L1 norm.  In order to derive (slightly pessimistic) sufficiency conditions, the authors relate phasemax to another optimization problem that admits easier analysis. In order to derive (fairly sharp) necessity conditions, the authors analyze a linear approximation of the the equivalent optimization problem from before. Both conditions are written in terms of the quality of the initializer, that is how correlated the initialization is with the truth, and the amount of oversampling, written in terms of the intrinsic dimension of the signal.  The paper studies an important subject, makes an interesting contribution, and is generally well written. I have a few comments, listed below, but I feel the paper is worth accepting.  Comments:    More information should be provided on how one chooses the initialization. With complex $x$ and without prior information, "Fundamental Limits of Weak Recovery with Applications to Phase Retrieval" demonstrated that one cannot come up with a good initialization when m/n<1-o(m/n). Is there a way to initialize $x$ with fewer measurements when one knows something about it? If not, the results in this paper are not that useful.  How do the results presented in this work relate to those in [18]? Is [18] looser?  Minor Issue:  Authors should point readers to supplement to find proofs.
