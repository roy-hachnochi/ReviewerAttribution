UPDATE AFTER READING THE AUTHORS' RESPONSE: Thanks for the clarification/explanation about the missing text, that is very helpful!  Summary of the paper: This paper addresses the problem of phase retrieval of structured (e.g., sparse) signals. The authors propose a regularized variant of the PhaseMax convex programming formulation. For the special case of Gaussian random measurements, they give a thorough analysis, which shows that regularized PhaseMax succeeds with a near-optimal number of measurements, and also provides tight bounds on the location of the "phase transition" for successful recovery of the unknown signal.   Overall, I think this is an interesting result, with strong technical content. I think it is significant, because previous attempts at using convex relaxations (e.g., PhaseLift) for sparse phase retrieval have run into serious obstacles. Given these difficulties, I think it is nice to have a positive result, even if it is in a somewhat artificial setting (with Gaussian random measurements) that may not be useful for practitioners.  The proof uses standard tools from convex geometry, such as convex duality, descent cones and statistical dimension, which I know well; as well as a more recent technique, the "convex Gaussian min-max theorem," which I do not know so well.  One question: Where is the proof of Lemma 1 (stated in Section 3.2.2)? I looked in the Supplementary Material, and it appears to be in Section 4.5, but the document ends abruptly, without finishing that line of argument? Also, note that some of the references on page 16 are missing.
