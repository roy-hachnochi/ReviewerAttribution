This paper introduces consistent estimators for several information theoretic quantities, given access to iid samples from the underlying distribution. Known estimators impose very stringent assumptions on the underlying distribution (finite support or underlying density etc.), while the major thrust of this article is to introduce a method which is valid fairly generally, and has guarantees under minimal assumptions. I believe the problem to be of significant importance, and very well-aligned with the interests of this community. The paper is very well written, motivates the problem in very clear terms, and proposes a fairly general solution. The authors provide a very succinct summary of the state of the art, and compare their proposed procedure to other alternative and existing estimators through extensive numerical experiments.   As a comment, I request the authors to also discuss situations where the Assumptions (L209) are violated, and scenarios where their estimator might be expected to behave poorly.
