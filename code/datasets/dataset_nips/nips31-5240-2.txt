The idea of the paper is to use FDR and the knockoff filter for feature selection in neural networks. Of course both are already proposed by other work. I have the following concern of this paper. 1. First of all, I'm a bit skeptical about the originality of the paper. The paper is more like an application of existing work to neural networks. 2. The most serious point is I was unable to find why this approach is good for neural networks. My impression is the authors were using some relevant approach long time and so now just applying them to neural networks, finding one way of generating (or mimicking) the knockoff filter in neural networks. In other words I was unable to see any clear reason why the method is good for neural networks. I do not think this way is a proper motivation for developing a feature selection method for neural networks. 3. The method is proposed for feature selection. So the authors should compare their method with other feature selection methods more intensively. Honestly exploring this direction further, the comparison might be just between FDR (with knokoff filter) and other approaches. This is the reason I commented in #1.
