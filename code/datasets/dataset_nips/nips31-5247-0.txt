This paper proposes a meta-learning technique for dense image predictions. Going beyond image classification, authors propose to consider problems where multi-scale processing is important.  The problem is challenging and important. The proposal is well introduced and motivated. An extensive review of the related work is presented.   The paper is clear and easy to follow. The method is well presented and original.  The experimental results properly validates the improvement achieved with the proposed techniques in three different tasks.  In my opinion, the paper can be accepted as it is.
