Summary A Bayesian nonparametric approach is derived to find the posterior distribution on the number of tokens of type k observed using the information in a count-min sketch. A Dirichlet process is used as a prior on the relative frequency of observing different tokens and the posterior distribution is derived. The posterior has an analytic form and the authors show that the MAP estimator is the count-min estimate. The effect of the concentration parameter on the estimate is discussed. The idea is then applied to token within documents using a Beta-Bernoulli construction. The effect of using the posterior mean, rather than the MAP estimator, are illustrated on some simulated data sets.   Strengths The idea of thinking about sketches in terms of Bayesian nonparametric is interesting to me. The combination of an infinite-dimensional process with suitable independence structure (the underlying Poisson random measure) is promising and has the potential to give analytic posterior (which is key for their use in these problems). The authors derive a nice set of results which give a clear idea of how the method works.    Weaknesses The paper is fairly clearly written but I found it difficult to understand the count-min sketch from the authors' description. To me the main weakness of the paper is that it's unclear where this work leads. It would have been interesting to see how the method would work on more complicated queries than the number of time that a particular token has been observed. The paper also doesn't illustrate what's gained by replacing a point estimate by a posterior distribution.
