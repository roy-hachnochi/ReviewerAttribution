This paper proposes a method by which to identify paths between local optima in the error surface of deep neural networks as a function of the weights such that the error along these paths does not increase significantly. In addition to providing useful insights on the error surface, the authors develop an ensemble learning algorithm that prepares an ensemble of multiple deep neural nets found through exploring the weight space along the paths that they find.  The paper produces novel and useful insights on deep neural networks with implications on the training and development of an ensemble learning method that uses the same total training budget as single network training by exploiting the characteristics of their path finding method. The experimental results need improvement though. Standard errors and statistical significances of the results are needed, especially given the random nature of the algorithm. It would also be beneficial to give a comparison of the errors of the individual deep networks and the diversities of the networks between the proposed algorithm and the independently trained network ensemble algorithm. I suspect that the base model errors are better for the proposed algorithm but the diversity is inferior. This should be confirmed.  Figures 2 and 3 are especially insightful---please keep these no matter what.  Having read the author's feedback, my opinion of the paper has improved. This paper represents an excellent submission, and one that I hope the authors and others will develop further in the future.
