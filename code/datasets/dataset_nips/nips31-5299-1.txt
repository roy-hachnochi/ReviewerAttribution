In the paper titled "Legendre Tensor Decomposition", the authors proposed a technique named Legendre decomposition which combines tensor structure with information geometry. Under this technique, a tensor is converted into two parameters \theta and \eta with the Legendre transformation. Some theoretical results are given, such as the uniqueness and the optimality, and the connection with Boltzmann machines. Empirical results are also quite nice. It seems the current paper did not mention much about scalability and computational complexity. If possible, could the authors provide? Overall, the paper is well-written and provides sufficient technical contribution.
