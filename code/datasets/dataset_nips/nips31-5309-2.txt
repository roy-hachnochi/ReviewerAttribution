This paper develops a new theorem proving algorithm that uses Monte-Carlo search guided by reinforcement learning from previous proof searches. The algorithm shows strong performance as compared with a connection tableau system.   The paper is well-written and interesting. The proposed approach requires little domain engineering and seems to be effective, but I'm not familiar with existing works in ATP, and will find a discussion on the state-of-the-art solvers and existing performance on Mizar40 to be helpful.   Overall, the approach seems promising and may have the potential to be applied to solve general mathematical problems.  *** After rebuttal I've read other reviews and the author's response and have not changed my opinion.
