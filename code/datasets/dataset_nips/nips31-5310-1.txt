The authors address the problems of sample-efficient estimation of properties of discrete distributions. After identifying the shortcomings of the current state of the art (most estimators are property-specific, general ones usually have worse than linear running time, minmax estimators being too "pesimistic") they propose a new estimator that alleviates those shortcomings, applying to all Lipschitz properties in linear time. I'm not an expert in this subfield, but it looks like a solid piece of work with potentially big implications.   Comments: * Are there any properties that are frequently used and do not satisfy the Lipschitz condition in Sec. 5? * I'd suggest introducing the estimator earlier on in the paper, while still deferring the derivation to a later section. At the very least, present the full form of the estimator at a prominent point, since now it's up to the reader to find the different pieces in Sec. 6 and tie them together. * Summarizing some of the key experimental results in a table would probably help the readers * I'd encourage the authors to add a brief section with conclusions at the end of the paper
