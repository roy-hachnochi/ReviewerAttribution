This paper studies differential privacy for dynamic databases, which have elements added over time. I think this is an important direction, as this is perhaps a more realistic model than the static setting, when it comes to practical deployment. While there was some prior work for very basic dynamic settings, this paper makes a much more significant contribution in this direction. The authors provide a modification of Private Multiplicative Weights for growing databases. Beyond this, they provide black-box methods for converting static mechanisms to dynamic mechanisms. They also develop a number of other primitives to the dynamic setting (including Numeric Sparse and Above Threshold  of [? ] (broken citation in line 227...)). In short, I think this makes a number of important contributions to an area of practical interest, and recommend acceptance.
