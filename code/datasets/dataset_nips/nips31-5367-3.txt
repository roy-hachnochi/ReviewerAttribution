This paper provides online learning methods for estimating quantum states. The target of learning is not the quantum state \rho itself, but Tr(E\rho), a single scalar that corresponds to the outcome of a measurement E. Three different approaches are provided. The second and third approaches are largely based on the results by Aaronson in 2006 and 2007.   I'm not familiar with quantum computing / quantum states. Although I found in NIPS, papers in this direction has been increasing, they are still relatively sparse. So I wish the authors can provide more background, motivating examples, and applications of this technology in the introduction, rather than talk about math from the very beginning  (if space is not enough, putting some of them in appendix is still good).   In the texts, there are many terms that directly appear without explanation (just to name a few):  Line 72: POVM (whose abbreviation?) Line 88: quantum register Line 90: joint measurement Line 215: post-select (I know it's established in other papers, but maybe you can slightly explain why they use this verb?)  Line 216: the (high-level) meaning of mapping Line 218: high level interpretation of Eq. (3)?  Line 218: the definition of Tr_B in Eq. (3) Line 447: maximally mixed Again, maybe they are standard in your field, but I think slightly more explanations would greatly help most NIPS readers.   Speaking of the contributions, I think the paper is about the online learnability of quantum states, whose statistical learnability is already established in Aaronson 2007. The tools used are more or less standard, and the results seem not very surprising. Given that the readability suffers a bit, I tend to put this work around borderline.
