The key contribution of the paper is a method to adapt wavelet shrinkage to irregularly spaced covariates x. The idea is to solve for wavelet coefficients d on a regular K=2^J size grid while minimizing the wavelet shrinkage loss where the fitted values at the given covariates are interpolated from the fitted values W'd on the regular grid  by a linear transformation R that depends on x.  A related strategy in the literature is to minimize     \| Sy - W'd\|_2^2 + \lambda \|d\|_1   where S interpolates y from R^n to the regular grid and W' is the wavelet transform. But in this paper, they minimize     \| y - RW'd \|_2^2 + \lambda \|d\|_1   where R interpolates the fitted values on the regular grid to R^n. The former method takes only O(n) time after sorting (and writing it as \|WSy-d\|_2^2 etc.). The latter is slower because we have to solve a lasso type of problem.  Antoniadis and Fan (2001) also extend wavelets to irregular data in a similar fashion. However, their method is restricted by the fact that the covariates are assumed to lie on a 1/2^J spaced grid, even though they may not be equi-spaced.  In addition to the univariate case, they extend their method to additive wavelets and further give rates of convergence for univariate case.  The method performs well in simulations.  Minor questions: - Can you show that the main optimization problem (3) has a unique solution? - Why not use the accelerated version of proximal gradient? - How does the interpolation approximation error 1/n \| f_0 - R \tilde{f}_0 \|_2^2 scale w.r.t K,n? - Please specify the interpolation matrix in your simulations.
