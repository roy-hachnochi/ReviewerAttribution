In this work, the authors propose a Recurrent Neural Network variant which is both accurate and efficient.  FastRNN develops a leaky integrator unit inspired peephole connection which has only two extra scalar parameters. FastGRNN then extends the peephole to a gated architecture by reusing the RNN matrices in the gate to match state-of-the-art accuracies but with a 2-4x smaller model. And after the low-rank sparse and quantized approximation, FastGRNN could make more accurate predictions with up to a 35x smaller model as compared to leading unitary and gated RNN techniques!  Overall, the accuracy and the huge model size reduction ratio is very impressive. The paper gives a very clear review on the various RNN models and illustrate their proposed approach very clearly. I am not an expert on the model size pruning area but from educated guess, the experiment results are extensive, solid and impressive. And itâ€™s appealing that the model is actually evaluated on embedded platform like Arduino and Raspberry Pi.
