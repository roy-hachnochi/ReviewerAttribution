Update following rebuttal:  I thank the authors for their thoughtful reply to my question. I still believe this is a good paper, but the discussion with other reviewers and a second read have convinced me that it has its limitations. I have therefore adjusted my score slightly downwards.  -----  The authors present a method of penalizing mutual information between a representation and confounding variables in the context of variational autoencoders and variational information bottleneck. This corresponds to a principled, data-driven way of encouraging invariances in the representation which encode confounding variable identity. From what I can tell, the presentation is clear, connections to related work are sufficiently covered, results appear convincing. Good theoretical work!  The biggest drawback of the paper in my mind, and what limits the generality/relevance of the paper, is the assumption of Gaussian encoders, which appears to be necessary to approximate the KL divergence in eq. (18), as described in section 2.1.1. Can the authors say something about how this might generalize to other choices of distributions?  A small nit: equation 8 contains a sign flip.
