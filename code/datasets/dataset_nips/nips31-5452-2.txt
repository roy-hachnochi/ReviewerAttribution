The authors presented a system to collect large scale robot grasping data in diverse home environments, and showed that the model improved the grasp performance compared to the model trained with lab environment. To do the data collection, the authors built a low cost mobile manipulation robot platform. To incorporate the noise in robot and environment, they proposed a noise modeling network to model noise as latent variable.   Compared to other deep learning works in robotics which are normally done in a simulated or lab environment, the authors tackled an important and also more challenging problem in robotics on how to learn in an unstructured real world environment. The learning framework is built on top of the patch grasping presented by Pinto and Gupta. The authors made modification to add another noise modeling network to handle real world noise.  The paper is well written and easy to understand in most parts. The experiments are very thorough, and are conducted in the real world with comparison to other baseline methods. The results show the benefits of learning in the real world environment, which is not very surprising.  The following papers on learning grasping with large scale data collection in simulation are also related and should be cited: "Using Simulation and Domain Adaptation to Improve Efficiency of Deep Robotic Grasping", Bousmalis et al., ICRA 2018 "Multi-task Domain Adaptation for Deep Learning of Instance Grasping from Simulation", Fang et al., ICRA 2018  The following are some detailed questions and comments to the authors: (1) Instead of using noise modeling network, have you considered using the robot auxiliary information e.g. robot id as input to the grasp prediction network directly?  (2) It is not clear what the input "raw pixel location" exactly is from line 143-145, or from Figure 2. Is it the grasp position in the image space?  (3) In line 84, "to due to", extra "to".
