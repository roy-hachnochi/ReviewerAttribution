The paper considers a low-rank tensor regression model with sparsity, i.e. some entries of parameter tensors are zero. Specifically, the authors apply a divide-and-conquer strategy to make the estimation procedure more efficient and develop a stagewise estimation procedure to efficiently approximate the solution path. In general, the paper is well written and the results of experiments are convincing. Some comments are listed as follows. 1. In the Section ‘Experiments’’, especially for the synthetic data, the paper only reports prediction error and running time. What about the ability of SURF in terms of ‘variable selection’? This is important for model interpretability.  2. What is the definition of ‘sparsity of coefficients’ in the real data analysis?
