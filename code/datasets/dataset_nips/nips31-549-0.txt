This paper presents an elegant method of zero-shot recognition based on transductive domain-invariant projection learning over both seen and unseen classes. Main theoretical contributions are: (1) the idea of introducing self-reconstruction constraint for unseen classes data as well as seen ones (the third term in eq.1), (2) derivation of an efficient optimization algorithm for this min-min problem, and (3) introducing superclasses to better align two domains. The proposed DIPL method is shown to significantly outperform previous state-of-the-arts on many ZSL tasks.  Strengths: 1. The basic formulation (eq.1) is conceptually simple and reasonable, making the overall method beautiful and general. I think the idea can be useful in many related areas of few-resource learning.  2. The optimization algorithm to handle the transductive constraint (the third term in eq.1) is non-trivial and elegantly derived, resulting in a linear time complexity with respect to the data size which is practical in real situations.  3. Experiments are well-organized and convincing enough to prove the effectiveness of each technical contribution of the method. Particularly, transductive constraint is shown to significantly improve the overall performance. Proposed method is shown to consistently outperforms previous methods on various ZSL tasks.  Weaknesses: 1. It sounds unfair to say ‘only two free parameters’ (l. 248) considering another parameter beta is set to 0.01 empirically (l. 167). Considering that beta=lambda/(1+gamma), it should be also data dependent.  UPDATES: My score remains still. I think it's a good paper.  Sections 3.3 and 3.4 are bit dense and unfriendly, so maybe it would be a good idea to move some of them to supplementary. Also, the paper would be more perfect if authors the results on ImageNet and SUN are reported in the main content.
