Summary This paper proposes a novel formulation for transductive zero-shot learning.  The main idea is to enforce bidirectional reconstruction constraints between visual and semantic features on both labeled data from seen classes and unlabeled data from unseen classes. The term for unlabeled data leads to a min-min optimization problem and a novel solver is further proposed. They also compute the superclasses by clustering to enforce more constraints on possible unseen class labels. The experimental results show significant improvement over the state-of-the-art.    Pros -The proposed approach is novel and interesting -This paper is well-written and easy to follow. -The experiments are convincing and show significant improvement over the state-of-the-art.  Cons -The generalized zero-shot learning results on SUN are missing. -The large-scale experiments in the supplementary material on ImageNet are superficial. It would be much better if it can be evaluated on 2-hops, 3-hops and generalized zero-shot learning on ImageNet.   Additional comments  -Line 267: The author says that "we follow the same generalized ZSL setting of [10]". But it seems that this paper is following [52] by using HM instead of using AUSUC like [10]. -How many superclasses are formed? Is it sensitive to the performance?
