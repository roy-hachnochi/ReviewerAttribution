Before putting my review, I would like to underline that I am not an expert in this particular area of NN. It might be that I miss some important related work. The paper presents an approach to let push the losses of networks for unknown samples down. It is done by minimizing the deep features magnitude and maximizing the entropy of the softmax scores for samples from a given background class during training. Openset and Objectosphere loss also increase separation in deep feature magnitude between known and unknown classes. The methods work better than simple thresholding or softmax losses.  I think that the paper presents a very nice view on the outlier problem and has good ways to formalize the ideas and visualize the behavior. The only issue I see is the naming of the methods and especially the title of the paper. I don't agree that the network fears the unknown and that this is removed by the methods. It could be maybe even the opposite. Since the losses are lower it could mean that the network is more afraid of the unknown and that it would be good to fear the unknown samples. Maybe the term "Agnostophobia" is already used in the literature (I did a search and did not find it) - still, I suggest being very careful when introducing these "catchy" terms and maybe not do it at all. Minor grammar mistakes should be corrected.
