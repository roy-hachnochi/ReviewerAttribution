# 5501 # Update based on the Authors Response Thank you for the clarification. Based on the response I am willing to vote for an accept.  # Summary This paper proposes a new approach to improve the model’s robustness against unknown classes. The authors propose a new objective function that, unlike common detection algorithms, does not add the background class to softmax. Instead, for a given background example, the objective function maximizes the entropy of the softmax layer, which leads to a low magnitude feature representation for the background sample.   In addition, the authors propose the use of objectosphere loss to distinguish the known/unknown classes further by penalizing the feature representation of the background sample so that the network does not respond to unknown objects.   Theoretical and empirical proof demonstrate the potential capability of the proposed approach.  # Quality The authors define the problem well and provide a thorough literature review. The theoretical background is also well explained in the method section. Experimentation also shows the capability of the proposed approach.  I would want to see one more set of experiment, in which the proposed approach is used within a real detection pipeline such as, as described in the paper RPN of F-RCNN.   # Clarity This is a well-written paper. It flows well, and easy to navigate.  It is not explicitly stated in the paper whether the author will release their implementation for the reproducibility of the paper.  # Significance The problem defined in the paper is significant especially within the real-world applications of object detection algorithms due to excessive exposure to unknown classes in real-world scenarios. The paper’s solution is significant to tackle these issues.
