Summary: -------- The paper introduces a general framework for doing coordinate descent using bandit algorithms. It provides compelling experimental results by comparing to similar algorithms.  Quality and clarity: -------------------- The paper is very well written, from theory to experimental settings, with clear motivation and enough related literature. Proofs are readable and seem essentially correct (I haven't found errors by a quick read). Though not essential, it would ease reading if the authors explicit the results that they cite, in particular Lemma 22 of [22] does not immediately read their claim; it would also be nice to explicit the seminal inequality (14) on which the results are based (it is present in Lemma 3.1 of [16] but expliciting in the present framework would be nice).  Originality and Significance: ----------------------------- The paper provides a generic framework to analyze coordinate descent using any bandit algorithm on generic residuals. The theoretical results pave the way to various implementations while the experimental shows its benefits on real data sets. The paper is really complete on both theoretical and experimental sides and it will be a good basis for other works to pursue.   Minor comments: --------------- l 57: minimizing l 70: \bar x \in \argmin (not always unique), generally the authors always use =, a note should precise that it's a simplification Proposition 2: Replace \in O(d) by =O(d). In fact the authors use the notation \in O() several times l 166: Replace k==1 by K==1 l 496: form -> from l 461: L_i not L, then one gets r > and not = in the two following displayed equations Eq (45): In first inequality, oen misses a - and then it is not = but <=
