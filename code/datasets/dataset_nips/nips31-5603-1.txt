This work tackles the problem of learning non-linear dynamical systems defined over sets of discrete observations. The idea builds on the theory of Koopman opeators, where non-linear systems can by modelled via linear operators after defining a mapping of the states in an opportune latent space.  The authors propose a black-box approximation of this mapping via an auto-encoder-like model. After encoding, a linear operator is learnt on the dynamics of the latent representation. The learnt prediction, as well as the latent representation are subsequently jointly decoded to match the observations.   The study provided thorough experimental validation on the problem of fluid-flow modeling on cylinder systems. I am not confident with the problem and thus not aware of the experimental details and complexities. Nevertheless the proposed approach seems to provide competitive results when compared to analogous learning-based methods, while providing accurate predictions and plausible dynamics description.    The proposed approach is quite appealing and grounded on nice theoretical basis. Moreover, it is exhibits nice scalability properties. An issue of this work may be related to the interpretability of the modelled dynamics. Since the dynamics are modelled in the latent space, it is rather complicated to grasp any insights on the relationship between the states by inspection of the model parameters. Therefore, interpretability has necessarily to rely on post-hoc simulation and tests. While this may not be an issue in purely predictive tasks, this is clearly a critical aspect whenever we may want to identify meaningful relationship across states.   There is also the risk that the dynamics may sensitively differ according to the dimensionality of the latent space. This is to my opinion a key parameter of te model that should be properly tuned and justified.
