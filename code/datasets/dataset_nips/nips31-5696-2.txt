This paper presents an interesting development and demonstration of applications of deep learning of policies to transfer between heterogeneous hardware. The paper derives an interesting deep learning of policies which are novel work and interesting to the reader. The extra material presented is useful and serves to underpin the findings in the paper. It should be made available with the paper, although suits as extra material so as not to disrupt the flow. The video material is especially appreciated.  The paper is technically sound and has produced good data, I do wonder how re-creatable said data is, it may be beneficial for the authors to present this more fully and make available for others in the field.  However, one point I find interesting is that peg positions could be selected out of the range of the robots, this seems counter-intuitive for training purposes, as the setup makes a solution impossible. I do question whether this could have then have weighted the results in some manner, and it may be beneficial adding a discussion on this point.   I've got concerns over how well the results would transfer to a real-world system, there are a collection of high frequency dynamics that could cause issues. There also look to be some collisions with the workspace which would present a potential problem. This should be investigated further. It should also be evaluated whether there is a wide enough range of training data, and whether this 70% represents all the reachable environment.
