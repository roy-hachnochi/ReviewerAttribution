Title: Co-regularized Alignment for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation  Summary  Unsupervised domain adaptation aims at matching the feature distribution of a a collection of labeled data from a source domain with unlabeled examples from a target domain to enhance generalization to unseen data. However, matching the marginal feature distribution may not entail that the corresponding class distribution will be aligned across the source and target domain as well. To address this issue, the authors suggest to construct multiple diverse feature spaces where the alignment between source and target feature distributions is aligned for each space individually while also encouraging that alignments to agree with each other according to the labels of the examples of the source domain and the class predictions of the unlabeled examples from the target domain. The suggested method improves upon several domain adaptation benchmarks  Strengths  Method advances state-of-the-art on several benchmarks.  CoDA is fairly intuitive and easy to understand.  Excellent survey of related work.  Implementation and baselines are based on a publicly available code base.  Weaknesses  Experiments do not explore the construction of more than two feature spaces.  With the exception of SVHN, the utilized benchmarks are fairly simple classification tasks. However, this is a common practice in the unsupervised domain adaptation community and not a particular issue with this work.  No commitment expressed to release a reference implementation of this method.
