The authors demonstrate that, based on the spatiotemporal statistics of natural movies, it is advantageous (from an energy minimizing perspective) to maintain a retina with more than one convolutional cell type.  A key advance is that, whereas prior work in this domain has generally focused on the *spatial* statistics of neural images, here the authors make critical use of the temporal properties of natural movies.  This allows them to construct a theoretical justification for several types of retinal ganglion cell.  Overall I think this is a well-written and interesting paper.
