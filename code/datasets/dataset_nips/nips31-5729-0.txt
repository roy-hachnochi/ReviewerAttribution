The authors develop theory for causal inference in non-iid setting where samples are divided to blocks, based on segregated graphs (no partially directed cycles, no vertex with both neighbours and siblings). The paper includes extensive theory and a real data application. The paper is written very clearly. This is interesting research, studying causal effect identification in more general settings is likely to have impact.  Why would data dependence be symmetric and not asymmetric? – This would need further justification. Also different chain graph interpretations correspond to different types of symmetric relationships, does that make a difference here?  Graph theory: meaning of a sibling and neighbor should be defined.  Figure 1 caption leaves f and g undescribed.  Also  https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41237-018-0051-2 discusses causal effect identification in a type of CGs. This paper discusses causality in  graph with similar undirected, bidirected and directed edges http://proceedings.mlr.press/v52/pena16.pdf. I think these works should be cited.  p.2 I believe undirected and bidirected path are undefined and can be interpreted in several ways(depending on the direction intermediate edges): “path of bidirected edges”, “path of undirected edged” may be better?
