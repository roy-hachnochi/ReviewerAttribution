Summary: This work extends a line of work on active search to the batch setting. Some theory for this problem and its comparison to the sequential setting is derived and explored in addition to several relatively principled heuristics for the problem. Experiments on drug discovery datasets show gains over a natural baseline.  Quality: The paper appears to be correct and the experiments are relatively comprehensive, at least for the narrow line of related work.   Clarity:  This paper is well-written and has a natural progression of ideas. Theorem 1 perhaps can be described intuitively better and Proposition 1 can be described a bit more precisely.   Originality: This work is similar to an existing line of work in terms of experiments and results, but extends it to the batch setting.  Significance: As the authors mention, trading off the inconvenience of sequential search and the statistical inefficiency of the batch setting is an important question which the authors address well. Additionally, this work extends effective heuristics from the sequential setting to the batch setting.
