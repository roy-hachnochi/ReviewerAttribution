Takes a game implementation approach to recommendation systems design.  Model: there are n advertisers.  A user shows up, and then each picks an ad to push to a "mediator" (e.g. content provider).  The user's satisfaction with various ads is assumed known.  Player utilities correspond to the probability that their ad is shown.  Note that choosing a mediator in effect defines the payoff matrices of the players in a suitable game (players = advertisers, strategies = which ad to push).  Thus we have a game design question.  The submission shows some issues with simple mediators (e.g., violating fairness in some sense) and proposes a novel mediator based on the Shapley value.  (Where given player strategies and a user, the relevant cooperative game is defined by v(S) where v(S) denotes the given user's maximum satisfaction by any of the adds pushed by players in S).  Because the Shapley value has so many nice properties, so does this induced game (e.g., existence of pure-strategy Nash equilibria).  Also, the special form of the game allows Shapley values to be computed efficiently (usually computing them is #P-hard).  I found this an innovative application of game-theoretic techniques.
