The paper gives a tight 1/2 approximation for maximizing a continuous submodular function subject to a box constraint i.e. max f(x) subject to a_i <= x_i <= b_i where f is a continuous submodular function.  The algorithm and proof are inspired by the result of Buchbinder et al. for discrete submodular functions. The overall structure of the algorithm and the proof are similar to the previous work (the algorithm works coordinate by coordinate and the proof tracks similar quantities). The main new difficulty here is in dealing with the 1 dimensional problem and showing that no matter what the optimal value is, the gain of the algorithm is always at least 1/2 the drop in the optimal value after fixing a coordinate.  The proof is quite technical and I have not checked it carefully. A comment on the illustration: by lemma 4 in the supplement, h(z)-g(z) is monotone so the curve cannot really behave wildly like the figure shows. Maybe including that statement and correct the drawing in the main body would help the reader's intuition.
