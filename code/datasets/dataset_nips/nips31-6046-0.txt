Main ideas ========== This paper proposes two simple and elegant algorithms for two classical problems: ski rental and single machine non-clarvoyant job scheduling. The key novelty in these algorithms is that they accept as input also a prediction algorithm that provides additional input to the problem solver.  Then, the authors propose a nice analysis of the competitive ratio of the proposed algorithms as a function of the accuracy of the given predictor.   For each domain (ski rental and job scheduling), the authors propose a deterministic algorithm and a randomized one, showing that the randomized algorithms perform better both in theory and in practice.   Significance: The form of algorithm analysis done in this work, i.e., analyzing the robustness and consistency w.r.t prediction error, is in my view very important and under-studied. It fits well with the growing need for explainable and more predictable AI, and so I believe the significance of this work.   Contributing to the signficance is also the experiments done by the authors, showing that their proposed algorithm (even the deterministic ones) outperform current approaches.   Originality: I am not aware of prior work that proposed algorithms for these problems that use predictions and analyze them without any assumption about the underlying error distribution.   Clarity: the paper is very clear, self-contained, and really a joy to read.    Comments for improvement: ========================= 1)Lines 64-66: Here you define \gamma-robustness and \beta-consistency,but this is based on the notions of predictor and its error: either give a quick explanation of what the error is in the two problems you deal with, or just say this will be explained later.   2) Lines 134 and 136: you use d instead of b.   3) The paper is missing a conclusion and a future work section. I encourage the authors to add them.
