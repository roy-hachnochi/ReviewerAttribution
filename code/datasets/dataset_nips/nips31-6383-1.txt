The paper describes a model for building a chat bot where the bot is to recommend movies to users via natural language dialog.  The model mixes dialog modeling, sentiment characterization, and movie recommendation in a modular architecture that connects an HRED (for dialog modeling with context) to a hierarchical encoder (for sentiment analysis) as well as an auto-encoder based recommender module. The recommender module can be pre-trained by an external dataset.  Section 3 describes a process to create a collection of 10K conversations focused on recommending movies using Amazon Mechanical Turk.  The process is by itself interesting and could serve as a good example for similar data collection needs -- after the workers generate the natural language data, they are also asked to provide symbolic annotation for sentiment and whether the recommendation seeker has seen the movie.  Such input serves as ground truth for the relevant inference tasks.  The paper addresses a broad, new class of dialogs that is practically important and technically challenging, and is thus worthy of attention in this conference.  The model is well motivated and is shown to perform well compared to simpler or isolated models for the individual tasks.   The paper is well written and describes many detailed considerations in the model set-up and the experimentation process.  Some discussions on how such a model could be adapted to address other tasks would be interesting. As the paper sets out to explore conversational recommendation systems as a class of problems, it will be useful to summarize the experience learned in this particular task (and dataset), and highlight which parts are expected to be applicable to a wider domain, and the conditions on such domain that are pre-requisites for the method to work.
