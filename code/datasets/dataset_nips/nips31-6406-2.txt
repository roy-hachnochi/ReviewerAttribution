The paper proposes a new way to estimate entropy from Markov Chain samples and provides an analysis of how many samples are enough for consistent estimation. I canâ€™t say that I understand the paper well enough to do a good judgement, but the results seem interesting and useful, and I like the example experiment. Can you please shed some light on why it could be the case that your theory suggests that PTB should be easier than 1BW, but in practice opposite holds true (Fig 1)?
