This paper proposed convergence analysis for ADAM under certain parameter settings and proved the convergence to a stationary point for nonconvex problems. Moreover, the authors proposed an adaptive SGD (i.e., YOGI) and evaluated it on the different learning models.  Generally, the studied problem is interesting and the proposed algorithm demonstrated good performance on its testing problems. However, some important issues are not clearly stated in the current manuscript: 1. This paper has stated that YOGI controls the increase in effective learning rate, but it is not clear how it impacts the learning rate? 2. The proof of the convergence in ADAM only considered the case that $\beta_1=0$. Thus it is also not very clear how about the convergence proof with the condition $\beta_1\in(0,1)$? 3. There are some types and improper presentations in Appendix. For example, in the first line of page 12, the update rule $v_t,i$ of YOGI does not match with the update rule in Algorithm 2.
