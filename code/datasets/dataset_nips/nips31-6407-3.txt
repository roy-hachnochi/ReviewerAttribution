This paper studies the adaptive gradient methods (e.g, ADAM) for nonconvex stochastic problems. Specifically, the authors prove the convergence to the stationary point using the increasing batch size. They also propose a new algorithm of YOGI and achieve the same convergence result.  I have some concers on the "increaing minibatch size".   1. The authors claim that increasing batch size leads to convergence. It may be ambiguous. From Corollaries 2,3,4,5, we can see that the authors use a large and fixed batch size in the order of O(T), where T is the number of iterations. In my opinions, increasing batch size means that the batch size is increaing during the iterations and it may be more practical than the fixed and large batch size. Of course, it may be more chanllenging to prove the convergence with the real increaing batch size.  Comment after author rebuttal: the authors said that " the same theoretical guarantee can be obtained for increasing minibatch b_t = Θ(t)". I am not convinced of it. Hope the authors to include a detailed proof for the case of  b_t = Θ(t) in the final version. If the analysis only applies to the case of b_t = Θ(T), please point it clearly and do not mislead the readers.  2. More seriously, the theories in this paper require the batch size to be $b=O(T)$. In practice, we may run the algorithm for several epoches, e.g., 100 epoches. Let N be the sample size, then T=O(100N). However, the batchsize we ofteh use is much smaller than N, e.g., b=100, in this case, b=O(T) is an unpractical requirement. I think this issue is not due to the weakness of ADAM, but the weakness of the proof in this paper.  Comment after author rebuttal: I have made a mistake in the previous comment, that is, T should be O(100N/b) and b=O(T) leads to b=O(10\sqrt{N}). This setting is acceptable in practice.   From Table 1 in "Neon2: Finding Local Minima via First-Order Oracles", we know SGD needs O(1/\delta^4) iterations to find x such that $ ||\nabla f(x)|| \leq detla$. The complexity proved in Corollary 3 is O(1/\delta^2) such that $ ||\nabla f(x)|| \leq detla$. I do not think ADAM has a faster theoretical convergence rate than SGD. Thus it may verify that this paper has made some unreasonable assumptions.  Comment after author rebuttal: The authors persuaded me. Since the minibatch is O(T) and SFO complexity measures the total number of stochastic oracle calls. So the final compleixty of ADAM is O(T^2) = O(1/\delta^4). Hope the authors to make it clear in the final version and do not mislead the readers that ADAM is theoretically faster than SGD (they have the same theoretical complexity in the convex case).  Corollary 1 in this paper is also ambiguous. I have read the introduction of [8]. [8] proved that their method needs O(1/epsilon^2) iterations to find x such that $ ||\nabla f(x)||^2 \leq epsilon$. However, from Corollary 2, we know ADAM needs O(1/epsilon) iterations to find x such that $ ||\nabla f(x)||^2 \leq epsilon$. Thus, the comparison in Section: Discussion about Theoretical Results is not correct.  Comment after author rebuttal: The authors persuaded me. Please see the above comment.  In conclusion, the study in this paper may be significative in practice. But the theoretical analysis is not satisfied.  Final comment after author rebuttal: I am pleased with the theoretical analysis now. I do not evalute the experiments due to lack of experience.
