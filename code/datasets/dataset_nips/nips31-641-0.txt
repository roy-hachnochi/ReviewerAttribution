The paper presents a fairly comprehensive analysis of HSGD in a wide variety of settings from strongly convex to non-convex problems under the assumption of sampling without replacement. One of the main challenges in sampling without replacement is to tackle the lack of independence this creates. This is perhaps the main technical contribution of the paper where a comparison process is introduced to enable martingale based arguments.  The intuitive description of this in lines 130-136 is quite confusing and one really needs to look at the technical details to understand it. I think easier proofs could be obtained by using the fact that sampling without replacement results in negatively dependent variables for which the usual concentration bounds for independent variables apply unchanged.
