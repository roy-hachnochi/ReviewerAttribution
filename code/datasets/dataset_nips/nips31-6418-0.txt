The authors introduced a deep recurrent dynamics model for temporal abstract learning. The proposed method is based on the observation that in many sequential prediction tasks. Throughout this work, there is no any insight technical contribution. Besides, the experimental setting is problematic. There is no evaluate criteria. There is no compared method. The detailed comments are listed as follows, Strength  1) The presentation of this paper is good. 2) the authors give some temporal abstract results. By the qualitative analysis, it shows the effectiveness of the introduced method.  Weakness 1) The technical contribution is limited. Throughout this work, there is no any insight technical contribution in terms of either algorithm or framework. 2)  The experimental setting is problematic. There is no evaluate criteria. There is no compared method. So we cannot know the superiority of the proposed compared with the existing related methods.
