This paper presents a new approach to sparsify gradients in order to reduce communication costs in distributed stochastic gradient methods. The proposed approach, called ATOMO, generalizes existing approaches of entry-wise sparsification to sparsification with respect to an atomic decomposition, where the atoms are orthonormal. ATOMO provides an unbiased estimator the gradient, which satisfy a given sparsity budget, in the chosen atomic decomposition, and which minimises variance.    This generalisation is quite straightforward. Nevertheless, the authors make a worthwhile observation based on it: The authors argue that choosing an atomic decomposition other than the standard coordinate-wise one can lead to better performance. In particular, they show on some experiments that choosing SVD decomposition for sparsifying gradients in neural networks training can lead to faster training compared to QSGD; an approach which combines quantisation and entry-wise sparsification.  It would be interesting to also include comparison with the other related approach of TernGrad, as well as ATOMO itself but with coordinate-wise decomposition.  The paper is well-written and clear.    Minor comments & typos:  Eq. after line 87: missing gamma^2 before E[ ||ghat ||_2^2] Section 3: what if lbd_i = 0, are you considering 0/0 = 0, it is good to add a small remark about this. line 154: v should be g  Update: As stated 1-bit QSGD is equivalent to ATOMO but only for certain sparsity levels. I think including the comparison with ATOMO with coordinate-wise decomposition is a more informative comparison between coordinate-wise and SVD sparsifications.  I also agree with Reviewer 2 that some elements in the text can be cut out, such as theorem 10, lemma 8, and especially the lemmas related to algorithm which only overcomplicates a very simple method.
