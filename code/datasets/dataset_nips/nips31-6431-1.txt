The authors consider the problem of constructing generative models from partial observations. More specifically, they propose a generative model for networks where the observations consist of times when cascades spread over the network. In this setting, the observations lack information regarding the resulted edges. The goal is to infer the latent structure of the network over which the cascades propagated.   They propose a hierarchical non-parametric edge-exchangeable network model along with a inference framework, DYFERENCE.   I really enjoyed reading this work. The authors deal with a very interesting problem with possible real world applications. The proposed work is novel enough to my understanding. They do an excellent job presenting their idea in a coherent and scientifically deep fashion. The inference seems the most challenging part of the model but the proposed framework covers the difficult aspects of it.   More: The content appear to be correct regarding technical details. The submission is very clear and well organised. The experimental results are thorough and sufficiently prove the performance of the model.   Line 119: not sure how the integer valued weights are sampled here. Also, z_ij and d_uv in eq(3), why different term here?  All in all, I am eager to suggest acceptance.
