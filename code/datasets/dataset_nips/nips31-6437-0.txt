The authors propose unifying techniques used in optimizing the qEI and qKG acquisition functions and extend them to most, if not all, acquisition functions of interest in Bayesian optimization, extending these acquisition functions to the batch Bayesian optimization setting in so doing. Since all but one acquisition function rely on the max, which is shown to be submodular, the authors also argue that batch Bayesian optimization can be achieve by greedy construction of the batch leads to an almost exact batch (where "exact" refers to the batch that would optimize the batch acquisition function).  In certain parts this paper is slightly sloppy, in particular: - on line 117, where new variables are used without introduction; - in equation (4), which should explicitly include the derivatives of \mu and \Sigma, or at least package them as \theta to avoid needless confusion; - Table 1 features many acronyms which are not introduced until much later, and the last two columns are obscure and not explained in the caption; - or the entire subsection starting at 185, which is presently quite unclear.  Though the experimental setting seems fair and the results promising, it would be nice to compare to the performance when using the state-of-the-art method of optimizing q-EI, which I suspect---but could be wrong---is not using random search or CMA-ES, given the differentiability of 1-EI.
