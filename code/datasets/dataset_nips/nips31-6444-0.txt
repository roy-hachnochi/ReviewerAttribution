It was difficult for me to understand the motivation. Even after thoroughly reading this paper, I could not imagine a simple real world example of this framework. It may be due to the lack of my background knowledge, but I expect a description of such a real world situation in the introduction. Partially related, I could not imagine a situation that an adversary can change an agent's state, not just an observation of the agent. It is written in the paper (Definition 1) that only the observation of the agent is affected, but in the experiments it seems that the actual state is corrupted by a noise. Please make these points clearer.  [Rebuttal] My only concern was the lack of the description of the motivative real world examples, and the authors promised to address them in the introduction. The authors responses to the other reviewers are also reasonable. In the end, I expect that the final version of this paper will be rather improved.
