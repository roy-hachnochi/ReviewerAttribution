UPDATE: I have read the authors' reply, and am satisfied with the way it has addressed the concerns I had.  This paper introduces the problem named in the title, where uplift (individual treatment effect) is to be estimated from data in which either the treatment or the outcome is missing for each data point. By a clever rewriting of the uplift, it can be estimated in one go, giving better performance than naive methods that would need to estimate four different functions.  The problem addressed is significant, and the proposed method is novel to my knowledge. The article is clear and well-written.  I hope the authors can address the following concerns:  - The assumption (2) currently states that for all x_0, the probability of treatment must be different between p_1 and p_2 for that x. This is significantly stronger than "that the treatment policies are distinct" as you write in the text. Which do you mean?  - In the statement of Lemma 1, based on its proof and on assumption (2), I would expect the condition to be p_1(t|x) \neq p_2(t|x) here.  - Figure 1(a) displays results for b from 0 to 10, while according to the text, b is in [0,2]. More importantly, the plot shows that the baseline FourNCC outperforms the proposed method for almost all b, but this is not mentioned in the text. Please clarify if I'm misunderstanding something here, or otherwise change the text everywhere to reflect that the proposed method does not always outperform the baseline(s).  - Proof of Lemma 1: In the big system, I think the expectation in the third line from the bottom should read E_{...} [y] (p1... - p2...), similar to the line below it.
