The paper proposes an alternative objective function for the Laplacian k-modes problem (for simultaneous clustering and density estimation).  The proposed objective is a bound for the classical objective proposed in the past, which has a certain number of computational advantages. For example, the updates in the iterative algorithm can be done independently for every point and thus the algorithm can be easily parallelized.  I found the proposed bound/objective interesting and its computational advantages significant. The experimental results are convincing; it is particularly interesting that the proposed algorithm is producing solutions that are in fact better for the original laplacian k-modes objective that the algorithm designed for that objective.
