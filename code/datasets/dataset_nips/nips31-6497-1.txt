The paper presents a simple technique for speeding up the decoding process for a generic autoregressive seq2seq model. The proposed technique consists of some heuristics-based methods and it looks very straightforward to me and involves little novelty.  Pros:  The authors have presented a technique for speeding up the decoding process for deep autoregressive models. The empirical results demonstrated the effectiveness.  Cons:  The technique involves some heuristics-based methods. The top-k and distance-based methods are used, but these are very typical techniques used in the literature. It seems there is very little novelty involved.
