In this paper a deep convolutional neural network for learning spherical images is proposed by modifying the spherical CNNs of Cohen et al. using the Clebsch-Gordan transform. The main purpose is to improve the computing efficiency by using this transform instead of the Fourier transforms, while rotation invariance of spherical images is kept. Though some experiments are provided to demonstrate the proposed method, the computing efficiency is not fully illustrated.
