This paper is about non parametric density estimation. The quality of an estimator is evaluated using adversarial losses, for example maximum mean discrepancy, Wasserstein distance, total variation. The estimator is built using the first coefficients of a given orthogonal basis, specifically all the elements of the basis with indices lower that a threshold. The authors provide an upper bound for this estimator when the classes of functions are smooth that improves previous results. They also give a lower bound and show on several examples that the rates match. The estimator depend on the threshold and in order to get adaptive result, the author build an estimator of the threshold and prove that they can still obtain the same rates. Finally, they apply their results in the case of GANs and the sampling problem. The paper is well written and easy to follow. Looking at density estimation through the adversarial losses is quite new and the results of the paper are the ones we are looking for. This work can really help to understand the nature of GANs and VAEs and could be helpful for practitioner that use it. Even though I did not check line by line the proofs, the ideas are quite classical and I am confident that the results can be reproduced.
