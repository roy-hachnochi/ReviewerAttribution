This paper studies minimax rates for nonparametric density estimation using integral probability metrics, when densities can be expressed in a countable basis of a Sobolev-type ellipsoid.  Pros: important problem, the IPMs bring an interesting application to GANs. I have appreciated the discussion after Theorem 9.  Cons: Paper that looks simultaneously mathy and drafty at the same time (see comments). The papers key contributions are in fact looser than expected from reading the paper: gap between Th. 1 and 3 (see below), constants that are not constants in Example 4 (see below), so-called tightening of Liang's results in Theorem 7 that is in fact far from obvious (see below). Fixes to consider (L607-L608, see below).  Details:  Theorem 1 vs Theorem 3 : unless significant restrictions apply, there is a huge gap between the two Theorems due to the fact that the upperbound in Theorm 1 depends on 1/(inf a_z) * 1/(inf b_z) while the lowerbound in Theorem 3 depends on 1/(sup a_z) * 1/(sup b_z)  Theorem 1 : I do not agree with L156 -- we cannot say that the second term decreases with Z at a rate depending on the complexity of F_G, because it involves a tricky dependence between L_G and b.  Example 4: c and C are not constants: they depend on d. Furthermore, \zeta is not "some" real >0. It in fact depends on n (L616 - L617 Appendix). This makes very hard to read (6) and it is certainly not as easy at it looks from just (6).  Theorem 7: in L225, the authors say that the upperbound of Liang is loose, so the authors' Theorem is better. But loose in what sense ? There is absolutely no insights into how we should consider Theorem 3.1 in Liang "loose" with respect to the paper. Furthermore, there is no proof of the Theorem, which makes even harder the task of comparing the results (I would have loved to see the expression of C in L237 that the authors come with). Instead of comments like L228-L229, why not expanding the proof in the Appendix so we can have a concrete idea ?  Appendix: * L568-L569: there lacks the |.|^2 in tilde P_z in the first ineq. * L596-L597: notation || * L607-L608: I do not follow the third to last inequality, which would be a natural consequence of assuming p_\tau(x) \geq 1/2 -- that you do not assume -- but otherwise seems hard to obtain. * (16): missing =0.  I do not like the drafty-look of the Apppendix, in particular the TODO list of things to do, change, amend, etc in red. This gives the impression that the authors went very fast into proving some things -- perhaps too fast sometimes: it is not acceptable to have L662-L663, since you have no idea of what c looks like -- it is certainly not a constant.  Typoes:  L71: remove "to denote [...] at most n". This statement is useless (and in fact, wrong as stated).
