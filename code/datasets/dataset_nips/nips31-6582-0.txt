The paper proposes a framework to work with approximate Bayesian computation in an optimisation setting.   While the idea is interesting, the presentation is a bit limited: there are many English errors and there is a clear point which is not well explained: from equation (5) on the loss function is intended to be either negative or positive, so that the minimisation problem is meaningless.
