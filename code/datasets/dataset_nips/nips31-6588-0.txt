This paper proposes to deal with the issue of noisy labels in training conditional GANs.  In the first case, they consider the situation where the confusion matrix between the true label distribution and the perturbed label distribution (marginally) is known.  In the second case, they consider the situation where this confusion matrix is not known.  In their "RCGAN" model, two classifiers are trained.  h1* is trained on real data samples with the noisy labels, and h2 is trained on generated samples to recover the label used to generate, and the generator is trained to produce samples conditioned on a label y which are classified to have the label y under both of these classifiers.  In the training of the discriminator, for "real" samples the real x and the noisy corresponding label are both given to the discriminator.  The generation process starts by sampling from the clean marginal distribution, running the generator conditioned on that clean label and providing that along with the corrupted label to the discriminator.  Finally they show that by training this model it's possible to do an optimization problem over z in G(z,y) to assign labels to data points for which a number of noisy labels are available, as is the case in crowdsourcing.  This seems like an elegant and very reasonable solution for an important problem.    Small issues:   -Calling the classifier h_1 is a bit confusing as h usually refers to hidden states.    -In equation 1, I think the sample from the noisy y distribution should be called y_tilde and not y.
