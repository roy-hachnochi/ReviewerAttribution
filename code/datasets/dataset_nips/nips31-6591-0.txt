This paper is on the robust learning of Bayesian networks from data. In particular, we assume the structure is known, and that we want to estimate the parameters from a dataset where a fraction of the examples have been adversarially corrupted (they come from some other distribution).  The authors provide an algorithm that is both computationally and statistically efficient.  They also provide experiments verifying their approach, and further demonstrating the usefulness of their algorithm even when the network to be learned is outside of the scope of the theoretical assumptions made for the bounds.  The paper is relatively technical, but the authors do a good job explaining the higher-level ideas and intuitions.  The experiments were also nice, demonstrating that the algorithm works well in practice, even in situations that it was not designed for.
