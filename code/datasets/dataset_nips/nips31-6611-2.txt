This paper establishes correspondences between quantum graphical models and Hilbert space embeddings. Based on these correspondences, the authors propose a new model (HSE-HQMM) as a nonparametric approach to model probability distribution and make predictions. Experimental results demonstrate better performance for the proposed method over existing methods. Specific comments follow:  1. an explanation of why quantum-circuits are needed in the presentation will be helpful. 2. It will also be helpful to provide some details of the hardware specification and runtime of the experiments. 3. More applications other than predictions will be great, given the versatility of HSE-HQMM.  ===== The reviewer would like to thank the authors for their explanation.
