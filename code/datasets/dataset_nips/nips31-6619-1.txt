This paper extend the CycleGAN by spliting the latent code into content and domain parts and achieves encouraging results in one-to-many unsupervised image-to-image translation. The entire framework is clean and well motivated. The paper is clearly written and easy to follow.  It would be better to evaluate the chosen of hyper-parameters and show the influence of hyper-parameters on the performance.
