Summary  This paper proposes new family of fairness measures that incorporate social welfare and risk aversion, measures from social welfare in economics. An empirical analysis is given using the COMPAS (classification) and Crime and Communities (regression) data sets using 5 different algorithms.  It demonstrates that tradeoffs between accuracy and improved fairness.  Comments  the abstract states   "a rational, risk-averse individual who is going to be subject to   algorithmic decision making and is faced with the task of choosing   between several algorithmic alternatives"  I found this confusing because the first part of the sentence seems to imply the individual is an end user or subject of an algroithm decision, but the 2nd part suggests that this user/subject will have the ability to choose which algorithm is used for the decision. Usually such users have no say in the choose of the algorithm.  The example in the intro provides a nice motivation, but later talks about "higher welfare" without defining its meaning.  It would be nice to give an informal definition when it is first referenced.   The caption of Fig 2 mentions 3 metrics: Dwork measure, social welfare and Atkinson index, but the 3 charts seem to be accuracy, Atkinson, and social welfare.    Fig 2c gives Dwork measures and calls it "average violation".  If this is the same as 2c, it would be good to have the same label on the y axis.   ----------------------------------------------- I have read the authors rebuttal and appreciate that they will clarify the explanations in the revised version of the paper.
