Summary:   This paper attempts to answer an interesting theoretical question regarding property (of a distribution) elicitation. It is already known that 'identifiable' (a set of linear constraints can express distributions with same property value) properties are 'elicitable' (property can be expressed as a minimizer of a loss function in expectation). The central question of this work is under what additional conditions identifiable properties are convex elicitable (convex loss functions elicit those properties). In finite-outcome setting, they show that, under mild smoothness conditions, all real-valued identifiable properties are convex elicitable. The proof relies on a construction of weight (and associated convex loss) function for an identifiable property.   Comments:  The theoretical result (and the associated loss construction scheme) brings a computational advantage in solving the ERM problem associated with the property.   Overall, the paper is well-written with a clear introduction, motivation, and problem statement. The article seems to be technically correct as well.
