This work extends Gaussian Process Factor Analysis (GPFA) by using a sparse variational GP approximation, leveraging inducing points to tackle the scalability issues with GPFA and allowing the use of a more realistic point process observational model. Furthermore, the authors propose a nested GP approach for simultaneous inference and temporal alignment of the latent trajectories across trials. The proposed extension are tested in a simulated dataset, and compared with other relevant methods. Finally, the authors apply the proposed method to neuronal recordings in motor cortex, showing not only that the temporal alignment leads to better cross-validated performance, but that the temporal warping inferred on a single trial basis is related to behavioural variables such as go cue and reaction time.  Quality:  The approach taken here is extremely interesting both technically and from a neuronal data analysis perspective. The testing provided is thorough and convincing, and the application to neuronal recordings elevates the quality of the submission even further. No qualms here, great work!  Clarity:  The presentation is very clear (which is impressive given the subject and the number of innovations introduced) and the paper is nicely structured. Highly polished paper.  Originality:  This work borrows from several recent advancements to propose a new GPFA extension. While there are a number of GPFA extensions where different noise models are considered I donâ€™t know of any other method that also joins the temporal alignment across trials in this way.  Significance:  Not only are the extensions proposed technically interesting, they are of high interest for the analysis of neuronal recordings, particularly the effort to understand changes in brain state across trials. I believe this work can have a significant impact in the analysis of high dimensional neuronal activity.  ===============================================================  Nothing to add on my end regarding the authors' response.
