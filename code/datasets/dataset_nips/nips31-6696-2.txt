The authors propose a method for decomposing the responses of neural populations into low-dimensional structures. This paper improves upon previous Gaussian process Factor Analysis methods by using a variational approximation to perform inference in continuous time and with stochastic timing differences between trials. The methods were well presented and easy to follow. The motivation behind applying the timewarping methods to neural data is strong, and the variational approach makes this methodology practical for real-world applications. The results did not, however, demonstrate how these methods behave and scale as a function of neurons, experimental conditions, or trials. One small detail that I missed was how the strictly increasing property of the timewarping process was enforced.
