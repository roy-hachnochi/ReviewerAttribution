This work focuses on the representation of the pooling layer in CNN. Using CNNs, the pooling layer usually run the maximum pooling or average pooling, also called the first order pooling. To improve the representation of pooling layer, this paper presents the second order representation in statistics which includes mean and variance. Finally, the authors impose the sparsity constraint to estimate the weights for different second order representations.  Pros : 1. Typical CNN usually extracts first-order information in pooling layer. This work extends the extraction of second-order information to represent the pooling layer, such as Gaussian distribution. Complete representation is helpful for prediction. 2. To reduce the information loss or the instability caused by dimension reduction in pooling layers, this work adopts the matrix decomposition and uses the parametric method to carry out the square-root normalized second-order representation.  Cons :  1. The idea of the mixture model is the key contribution in this paper, but the weight of each component models seems to define by experience. 2. Although the performance of this idea is very good, thereâ€™s no novel mathematical proved in this paper.
