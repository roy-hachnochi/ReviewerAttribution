In this work, a new branching strategy for survey propagation is proposed. Specifically, the paper introduce 'streamlining constraint' in place of using decimation, which adds disjunction contraints between subsets of highly magnetized variables. The algorithm is empirically reported to improve existing k-SAT solvers.   In overall, the paper was easy to read and idea seemed novel to me. I liked how the extension from decimation to streamline was very simple, but possess the potential to provoke further related works. My only concern on the scheme itself is that adding streamlining constraints will increase the size of problem (as mentioned briefly in paper), and reporting how much the algorithm is slower than just using decimation would make the paper more useful for practical applications.   Minor comments: - In algorithmic design choices, it seems rather natural to use memory threshold in place of iteration threshold, since it is a more closely related quantity to our computational resources. For example, one could think of a scheme which combines streamlining and decimation by adding streamlining constraint whenever memory is possible, and using decimation otherwise.  - In context of MAP inference in undirected graphical models (GMs), there is a similar scheme that is called 'uprooting and rerooting', which modifies the GM while keeping the MAP assignment invariant. It would be very interesting to see whether if similar scheme is effective in max-product belief propagation for GMs.  ---  I have read the author's reponse and considered it in my review.
