In the paper "Sketching Method for Large Scale Combinatorial Inference", the authors introduced a combinatorial inferential framework for graphical models. The new framework provides both the statistical validity and computational efficiency. The results in the paper is for Gaussian graphical model (rather than Markov random fields). The three large-scale combinatorial inference examples are connectivity test, Bipartiteness/K-colorability test, and fast max clique test. Additionally, the paper also discusses the trade-off between the statistical validity and the computation complexity. Overall, the paper is well-written and provides sufficient theoretical results.  One question I have is that whether the results in current paper (as in Gaussian graphical model) can be generalized to Markov random fields.   I have read the response from the authors. Their response to my question is satisfactory. I would like to keep my original scores.
