The focus of the paper is on spectral clustering, and more specifically on its tendency to detect many small clusters instead of the actual structure of the graph. This property is first quantified using some random graph model. It is then shown how edge-wise regularization can be used to find relevant clusters. Some experiments on real datasets illustrate the effectiveness of the approach.  The paper is interesting, topical and well written. The main criticism I have is that only simple cuts are considered. The extension of the results to more than 2 clusters is not even mentioned. The gain in computation times shown in Figure 7 should also be discussed: why does rARPACK work faster on the regularized Laplacian?
