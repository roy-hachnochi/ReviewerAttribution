The paper shows a family of data-driven clustering algorithms called (a,b)-loyds++. Parameter a has to do with the initialization phase, while parameter b has to do with the local search/optimization phase.  One of the main technical and interesting results of the paper is the structural result that shows that for a given clustering instance, with high probability over the randomness in Algorithm 1, there are only polynomially many possible sets of output centers in phase 1 of the algorithm as parameter a varies.  This is used for specifying the sample complexity as well as the computational complexity of the proposed algorithm.  The experimental part of the paper is very short and laconic and it is very hard to infer the practical significance of the proposed method.  In general, although many of the ideas in the paper are neat and they are nice combinations of existing ideas in learning theory, I am a bit skeptical about the practicality of the proposed algorithm.
