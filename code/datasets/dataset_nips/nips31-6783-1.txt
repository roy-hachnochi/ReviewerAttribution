This paper is a purely theoretical paper on provable properties in learning with beam search via imitation learning. The basic setting is imitation learning, where you assume a "dynamic oracle" is available at any state. While this setting is definitely useful in some scenarios, e.g., syntactic parsing, it is not often available in harder problems such as machine translation. So while the theorems in this paper are interesting and went far beyond existing perceptron-style theorems, its real-world application is limited to those scenarios with easy-to-compute dynamic oracles.  On the other hand, I think experiments in those imitation learning scenarios would be valuable to compliment the theoretical results.
