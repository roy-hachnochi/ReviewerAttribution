This paper explores the use of continuous tempering for sampling of multimodal posteriors using HMC. As pointed out by the authors, the main contribution lies in the experimental results, which show good results on real datasets.  The exposition is clear most of the time, but one point is not clear to me.  The target posterior is obtained for those samples where \xi=\xi*, such that T=\lamda(\xi*). But since \xi is continuous, in order for the set of points where \xi=\xi* holds to have non-zero probability, the function \lambda() should be flat and equal to T in some region. But no discussion is given of this point.
