The authors present a version of dropout that zeros out square blocks of neurons rather than individual neurons. They experience robust improvements relative to dropout.  This is a good paper, with potentially very wide-spread applicability.   The authors only present validation error in all their studies, but not test error. They claim that this is "common practice". I quickly checked the ResNet / DenseNet / Stochastic Depth / ShakeShake and ShakeDrop papers. Only one paper (DenseNet) seems to use validation error consistently and one (ResNet) partially. So I wouldn't call reporting the validation error common practice. In any case, this is a terrible practice for obvious reasons so I would urge any author (including the authors of this paper) to break the trend by reporting test error. If the authors feel that reporting validation error is necessary for comparion, they can report both.    Did you use the validation set for hyperparameter tuning? If so, in what way? Since you write "we first estimate the block_size_factor to use (typically 0.5)", it seems you are using it for at least some tuning. How is reporting validation error on the final model then still unbiased?  I am confused by your treatment of the DropBlock hyperparameters. On page 3, you start by saying that you don't set gamma and block_size directly, but block_size_factor and keep_prob. But then in line 156 you say "gamma = 0.4". I am assuming you mean "keep_prob = 0.4"? Similarly, in table 2 / line 210, you use gamma, but I think you mean keep_prob.  How do you compensate for DropBlock? E.g. in dropout, if a feature is dropped with probability gamma, all other outputs are multiplied with 1/(1-gamma). How do you handle this in DropBlock?  Have you tried block_size_factor=1, i.e. dropping entire channels? What happens then?  ### Additional comments post-rebuttal ###  I apologize for the stupid comment regarding the imagenet test set. I didn't know that it is "secret".   "We are happy to create a holdout partition of training data and re-do the experiments for the final submission of 33 the paper." I am envious of your seemingly unlimited GPU access :) But seriously, I wouldn't want to burden you with this is everyone else if using the validation set for final numbers. I will leave it up to you whether you think having a test partition would improve the paper.  The block_size_factor=1 results are interesting. Maybe you can find space to include them in the final paper. Also, you write "we first estimate the block_size_factor to use (typically 0.5)". I'd like to see more details on how this estimation happened. Also, I can't find drop_block_size for figure 4 (it's probably 0.5 ...).   In figure 4, right side, "after sum" is missing an 'm'.
