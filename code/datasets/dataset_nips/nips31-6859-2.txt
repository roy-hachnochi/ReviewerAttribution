This paper aims at solving the regularised Wasserstein barycentre problem for the semi-discrete case. It assumes the distribution of the probability measures over a network and formulate the problem as the minimisation of a convex objective under equality constraints. The equality constraint is formulated via the Laplacian of the graph representing the network, so that information flow is only allowed between agents that are connected with each other. To solve this problem, the authors develop a general primal dual method for stochastic optimization and apply it to the original distributed barycentre problem.   Algorithm 1 is essentially the accelerated method applied to the dual problem with stochastic gradient. The obtained theoretical result is quite surprising as usually solving the dual problem will not lead to a bound as good as (6). If we look at the proof, we found that equation (34) should not be derived from (33). It is then not clear how the authors get (34) and then (37). Unless this point is clarified, the results claimed in Theorem 1 are not proved correctly and the theoretical part of the paper does not hold. ---This part has been clarified in authors' feedback.
