The paper describes a novel model for image compression that uses neural networks. The novel model extends the existing Ballé's (2018) model by adding two elements: (1) Generalizing the hierarchical GSM model to a Gaussian mixture model (2) adding an autoregressive component.    As the result section describes, the model seems to be effective on the Kodak Dataset. In fact, it outperforms Ballé's method as well as variant of this method.   Overall, the paper seems to be a solid paper with interesting results.   However, the authors do not help in understanding how the model is in fact useful in pratical situations or why it is important from the point of view of its theorical results.
