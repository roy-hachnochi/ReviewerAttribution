This paper extends the work of BalleÃÅ et al. from GSM model to GMM model, and also added an autoregressive model with the hyper-prior. By doing that the paper reached a better performance compared to baseline approaches including Balle et al. As I don't have deep understanding of the context and the previous literature, I can't judge too much of the technical quality here.
