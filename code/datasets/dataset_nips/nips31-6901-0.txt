OMP is a well known and widely used method for sparse learning from linear regression. There have several works which provide the support recovery of OMP under different settings, e.g., noiseless setting under various conditions like incoherence. In the noisy setting, the existing bound in [28] does not match the known lower bounds. The main contribution of this work is to improve these support recovery results for OMP and obtain matching lower bounds.  Generally, this work is very well written. The studied problem about the support recovery of OMP is important and of great interest. The authors provide sufficient theoretical results for OMP. These results extend the applicability of OMP.  For the experiments, how to initialize the solution?   -------------------------------------- Updates after author feedback the authors have addressed my concern. I increase my rating from 6 to 7.
