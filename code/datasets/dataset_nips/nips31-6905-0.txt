This paper studies differentially-private change-point detection -- detecting the point at which samples from a distribution stop coming from P_0, and instead start coming from P_1. It provides the first finite sample guarantees for the MLE for this problem non-privately (I'm not an expert in change-point detection, can anyone else confirm? It seems natural enough that I would expect someone else to have studied it prior...). The authors study the offline problem (where the entire stream is given at once), as well as the online problem.   I like this paper largely because it initiates the study of what I consider to be a fairly basic and interesting question, private change-point detection. My main criticism of the work is the assumptions that are required on the data. In particular, there is only a true differential privacy guarantee in the case where the likelihood ratio is bounded. In the case where it is bounded only with high probability, there is a data-dependent privacy guarantee, which makes me uneasy (what if the model is wrong, who knows where the data truly comes from, etc.). There is some vague text justification on why a bound is necessary -- is it possible to make this justification rigorous, in the form of a theorem? The algorithmic techniques are not too surprising, but that's acceptable in my opinion for the first paper is the area.  The authors should note that the submission format is for 8 pages + citations, with no appendices (which should be put in the supplementary material).  EDIT: The authors are advised to compare their results with the recent line of works on private hypothesis testing, particularly the ones focusing on minimax sample complexities, as these seem to focus on very similar problems (see, i.e. Gaboardi et al.'16, Kifer-Rogers'17, Cai et al.'17, Aliakbarpour et al.'18, Acharya et al.'17, etc.).
