Given observational data (on all variables) from source domain(s) and interventional data (on all variables except Y) from target domain(s), the paper develops a technique to predict P(Y). The paper relies primarily on a certain conditional independence assumption between context and system variables.  Causal graph is partially constructed to check if this assumption holds.  Solution is inspired by ideas from varied areas such as graphical models, causal structure learning and domain adaptation.  The advantages of this work over existing work are that it does not require (i) causal graphs as input, (ii) interventions to be perfect and (iii) targets of interventions to be known. The problem and assumptions have been very clearly stated. Related work is written well. Example 1: It would be helpful if you additionally mention that in this case intervention targets are known. Also on line 64, where you note that observation measurements are available, it will be helpful if you state the same using notations as well.  Line 35: An informal definition of imperfect interventions will be helpful.
