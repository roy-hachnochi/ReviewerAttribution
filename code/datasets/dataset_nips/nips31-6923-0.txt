This paper that is built on top of Bhaskara etal. [3 in the main paper] described an analysis linear independence of rank one tensors produced by tensors powers of randomly perturbed vectors and allowed for discrete perturbations. Moreover, the described analysis is related to the recovery of assemblies of neurons.  Overall, the paper gave a detailed analysis of the tensor decomposition using l=1and a general case although a better differentiation with respect to [3] is needed. Moreover, the proposed application of recovering assemblies of neurons is misleading. For instance, the application aim is not clear enough because the abstract mentioned recovering assemblies of neurons but on the main text and problem formulation aims to talks about assembly association and the structure intersection of cell assembly intersection, and also how the problem is posed since there is ambiguous definitions, e.g. what do you mean about m classes of neurons? Or entities or concepts? Moreover, what would it happen if there is no association among neurons but there is still an overlap as have been shown in different papers [1,2]? And how it affects the analysis if we do not have the same number of neurons for each ensemble? Therefore, a detailed experiment of applying the proposed approach would have a great impact into the neuroscience community. Minors comments: Footnote 1. Replace … for . Line 163. Typo Gassuian.

Elife 2017.  ===================================================  I appreciate the author effort of addressing my concerns, but after reading carefully the author’s feedback I keep my score because there is a weak connection to application of cell assemblies association or not very clearly written as mentioned by R2  “it could spend more time explaining the relationships between the assemblies problem, the venn diagram formalization and tensor decomposition”. Therefore, I was interested how could the proposed approach deal no concept association among neurons besides having an overlap as have been shown in different papers [1,2]? and how it affects the analysis if we do not have the same number of neurons for each ensemble? and how will a neuroscientist be benefit using such approach without a direct formulation or analysis on real data?
