This paper gives a new smoothed analysis result on tensor powers of randomly perturbed vectors. This may sound very technical, but as the paper mentioned tensor decompositions have been widely applied to learning many latent variable models, and in many cases they provide the only algorithms with theoretical guarantees. To apply tensor decomposition algorithm, it is common to require that tensor powers of the components are linearly independent (and in fact even the smallest singular value is large).  This paper generalizes result of Bhaskara et al. and showed that for fairly general types of perturbations (which they summarized using (\delta, p) nondeterministic property), the perturbed rank-1 tensors will be (robustly) linearly independent. This could lead to better sample complexity guarantees for learning many latent variable models. The particular motivation in this paper comes from a problem of association of assemblies. In this application the components of the tensors need to come from a discrete set (the hyper-cube), which rules out the previous result by Bhaskara et al. The techniques in this paper gives a satisfying solution.  At a high level the proof technique of this paper is similar to Bhaskara et al. as they look at the projection of each tensor into the orthogonal subspace of existing tensors, and try to construct certificates that show the projection is large. However at a more detailed level the proof is novel. Both the (\delta, p) nondeterministic property and the echelon tree idea seem novel and applicable in other settings.  The first part of this paper is not very clearly written as it could spend more time explaining the relationships between the assemblies problem, the venn diagram formalization and tensor decomposition. The proof on the other hand is very clear.  ==================================== After the response: I will keep my score but as reviewer 1 pointed out the application on cell assembly is confusing and probably not very convincing. I have no expertise in the application so my review is purely based on the tensor decomposition part. If this paper were to be accepted I hope the authors will make an effort in improving the presentation.
