Summary =============== The paper proposes a method to certify the adversarial robustness of a given ReLU neural network. The main difficulty in certifying these networks is dealing with the non-convex ReLU constraints. The proposed method formulates these as quadratic constraints to obtain a quadratic program that is then relaxed to an SDP. The idea is natural and well-executed. An important feature of this approach is that the verified network does not need to be "verification-aware" (i.e. trained towards the goal of being verifiable by this procedure). The experimental results are compelling, constructing the first certificate of robustness for verification-oblivious MNIST models w.r.t. moderate sized L_infty perturbations. This is a clear step of progress towards robust and verifiable modes, thus I recommend acceptance.  Quality =============== The problem studied is important and has received significant attention recently. The method is natural and effective. All necessary experiments are conducted. There is a good amount of analysis explaining how the method differs in terms of approximation tightness from the corresponding LP relaxations qualitatively and quantitatively.  Clarity =============== The paper is well-written. The approach and analysis is clear. There are a few places where writing looks sloppy (e.g. beginning of Section 3.2) but this has no effect on the overall readability.  Originality =============== The approach is novel and is clearly differentiated from prior work. While SDP formulations for NN verification where also proposed in Raghunathan et al [17] the approach is essentially completely different. In fact, it's unclear if these SDP relaxation could scale reasonably to more than a single layer.  Significance =============== Training adversarially robust models is an important topic. There are currently three approaches towards evaluating these models: a) empirical, b) exact verification, c) efficient upper bounds. This paper makes a significant step in direction c). In fact it is the first method to verify independently trained networks on MNIST against moderate-sized adversaries (eps=0.1).  Additional comments =============== I don't understand the choice of using a 2-layer neural network for the LP-NN. The paper of Kolter and Wong [11] uses larger models and achieves a provable error rate of at most 8% with LP-cert (half the error rate you report in Table 1). Why wasn't the original model from their paper used?  Comments to the authors =============== 66. "..and is likely intractable.": In fact the ReLUplex paper shows that verifying ReLU networks is NP-hard in general. 274. "tighte", typo References: you list Madry et al. twice.  ** UPDATE ** ============== While I stand behind my original score based on the technical contributions of the paper, I agree with Reviewer 2 that several improvements to the exposition are in order. I believe that the authors should implement these improvements independent of the final decision. I personally would like to see experimental results for LP-NN applied to large models.
