The authors propose a boosting method (SMTBoost) for survival analysis with competing risks. Each weak predictor is a tree that is constructed using a splitting rule based on a modified version of Grayâ€™s test statistics. The prediction at each leaf node is given by the nonparametric Aalen-Johansen estimator. By introducing an extended loss function (eq.2), the authors extend the discrete label boosting to nonparametric multivariate density estimation, which is the core contribution of this work.   While relatively straightforward, the approach performs well. Based on a series of empirical evaluations on two synthetic datasets and one real dataset, the authors show that SMTBoost outperforms all baseline methods.  I've read the author response.
