Geometry based data generation  This paper proposes to a geometric method to generate data by exploiting the intrinsic shape of the data manifold. This contrasts with typical approaches where data density is estimated, rather than directly exploiting the geometry of the data manifold. The methodology builds upon the diffusion maps of Coifman & Lafon but uses a different kernel.  Taken separately, diffusion maps and the MGC kernel are not new. However, the method, SUGAR, can elegantly estimate the intrinsic geometry of a data manifold, particularly in heavily unbalanced datasets, and consequently generate synthetic data in undersampled area. This has high potentials in a series of applications where data is severely imbalanced. Experiments are performed on synthetic data, such as with rotate MNIST digits, and real data, where relationships between gene-phenotype is studied. Results are convincing and clearly demonstrate the benefit of exploiting the intrinsic geometry of the data manifold.  <addressed>On a possible negative side, the proposed method depends on a k-nearest neighbor search - this is a general question, but it remains unclear how to choose k, and how to prevent having disconnected components. This may imply additional assumptions on the data manifold, for instance, not guaranteeing a connected manifold.</addressed>  Authors indicated that no k-nn has been used, instead a Gaussian kernel provides a diffusion process across the graph
