The authors present interesting work on gradient descent calculation for spiking neural networks, a topic which has seen vigorous research in the last couple of years. The work is timely, and could be significantly improved by including a computation analysis of the trained networks, a pursuit that is described as left for future research.  Major Comments: Much recent work has focused on developing semi-biologically plausible rules for training spiking nets. Therefore, it would be useful for the authors to elaborate on how their method is more appropriate. For example, the authors state that some of these papers ”…neglect a derivative term that is crucial for computing accurate gradient flow through spike events” (lines 55-56). It would be useful to elaborate on these specific claims.  The authors make reference to Supplementary Materials for gradient calculation, but there are no Supplementary Materials?  Can the method be extended to training addition parameters of the network, such as the various time constants of each neuron model?  There is no reference to Figure 2 at all, although the reference should be in section 4.2.  Section 5.1 does not contain any specific results. I feel like there is a Figure missing somewhere.   References to Figure 3 are incorrectly labeled as references to Figure 2.  Minor Comments: - Line 67: typo, “ANN models purple” - Line 75: typo, “resembles to”
