I went back and read the main paper one more time. The following two points sums up the contribution of the paper.  1) L65-68: "We propose a hybrid approach, adapted embeddings, that combines loss functions for deep embeddings with weight adaptation in the target domain. This hybrid approach robustly outperforms every few-shot learning and every deep metric learning method previously proposed on k-ITL. "  2) L144-147: "In contrast, weight adaptation determines model parameters using both source and target domain data. We explore a straightforward hybrid, adapted embeddings, which unifies embedding methods and weight adaptation by using the target-domain support set for model-parameter adaptation"  In plain English, this is just saying: "We use the test *and* train set to train embeddings in contrast to the standard practice of only using the train set" and it empirically worked slightly better. It's a no brainer that the performance increases as you also train on more (k) test data. Figure 2, 3 shows this (compare blue dotted line vs blue solid line).   All in all, this is an experimental paper stating using additional examples from test domain increases the performance over not using them. Also, I think results on omniglot (smaller image; simple strokes on white background;) is very convincing in contrast to "online products" (larger images; real images on real background;) are anecdotal at best.  For NIPS, I would not recommend the paper to be accepted, because the added value to the NIPS community is too limited. The described contribution is more technical rather than a big conceptual step.  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                  This paper compares the lines of research on deep metric learning, few shot learning, and weight transfer and proposes hybrid approaches: weightadapt, adaptprotonet, adapthisloss. These hybrid approaches are obtained by deciding up to which layer you should initialize the network weights from other pretrained network and by choosing how to split the dataset (fig 1).           The proposed hybrid approach is a mere hybrid and severely lack algorithmic novelty sufficient for a publication at NIPS. Furthermore, the experimental comparison is performed on simple datasets (MNIST, Isolet, tinyImagnet, Omniglot) which is not a fair comparison against Histogram loss [31]. In [31], the authors report results on CUB-200, Online Products which are significantly larger in size.           Due to the lack of algorithmic novelty and inconclusive experiments, I vote for rejection.
