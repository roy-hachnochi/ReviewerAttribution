In this paper, the authors propose a framework for leaf-labeled tree probability estimation given a collection of trees such as MCMC samples by introducing a novel structure called subsplit bayesian networks (SBN) which relaxes the assumption that clades are conditionally independent. They show that every tree can be uniquely represented as a set of subsplits. They compute maximum likelihood with weight sharing to learn the parameters of SBNs for rooted leaf-labeled trees. They also discuss that how the proposed framework can be generalized for unrooted trees and propose variational EM algorithms for this case.  The paper is generally clearly written. The model is well-defined, with examples making the relaxation of independence clear. Also in the learning progress, the update steps are carefully derived.   The paper could benefit doing the following additional experiments:1. One major contribution of the proposed model is its flexibility. Compared to CCD, it should be able to gain more accuracy while there are some more dependence on the parameters. Drawing the parameters with different degree of diffusion doesn't really vary the depency.  Thus the experiments the author showed are not sufficient to conclude how much is the gain from the relaxation of independence assumption. Also, it is surprising that as \beta increases and the parameters are more diffused, SBN is gaining less accuracy compared to CCD(figure 4, third picture from left). By using the shared parameter technique, when the parameters are more diffused this sharing parameter approximation intuitively is more accurate. 2. It would be useful if there are some experiments benchmarking the computational and statistical cost of parameter sharing especially given that parameter sharing entails a trad eoff in variance for some bias.  3. In section 3, B^*_x is claimed to be the minimal SBN over X. The proof seems to be straightforward. However, the proof is needed to support this statement.  4.In section 3, it is shown that for a particular example, CCD can be viewed as a simplification of SBNs by further approximation of the conditional probabilities. Does this hold in general?   Minor comments: 1. Some of the parameters should be carefully defined. E.g., in section 4.2 the unrooted tree T^u is not defined.  2. In section 3, it is not clear that how lexicographical order is defined on clades for the tree in Figure 1. According to the definition of the subsplit, if (Y,Z) is a subsplit  then Y>Z. In the example ({O_3},C_6) and (C_7,{O_8}) are two subsplits; therefore, we have  {O_3} > {O_4,O_5} and {O_6,O_7}>{O_8} in lexicographical order which is not clear how t his order is defined.
