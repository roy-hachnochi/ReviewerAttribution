The paper is of very high quality and clarity.  I includes a well-written background and summarization of approaches, placing this work in calibrated anomaly detection.  The authors apparently speak math more fluently than this reviewer, nevertheless, because of careful highlighting, and with a little commitment, this is accessible to readers outside of the primary subject area.  This paper provides an interesting theoretical contribution.  However, there is no experiment or application, as is often the case for strong NIPS papers that relate theory to practice.  Minor comments: Figure 1: The first term (density estimation in Section 3.2) appears to be missing square brackets in the expectation
