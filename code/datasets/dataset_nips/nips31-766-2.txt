This paper studies the problem of calibrated anomaly detection by introducing a new type of loss functions that may depend on the density threshold. By incorporating quantile control, the authors develop algorithms that can estimate the target function and the score threshold simultaneously. The author also discuss how to solve the corresponding optimization problem based on partially capped loss and a kernel absorption trick. The proposed approach includes one-class SVM as a special case. The paper is well written and easy to read. I am just wondering if itâ€™s possible to give some consistency results or generalization error bounds?   The experimental results looks promising.
