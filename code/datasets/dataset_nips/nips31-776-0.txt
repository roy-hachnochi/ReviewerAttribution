This paper studied stochastic composite mirror descent, for both convex and strongly convex objectives, and established high probability bounds. The results are stronger than existing ones from the perspective of removing smoothness assumptions or improving the rates, removing the bounded subgradient assumption, and obtaining high probability bounds rather than expectation. The authors also studied the scaling of the estimation error with respect to the number of iterations of the SGD.   It seems that the authors claimed that the introduction of Assumption 1 is novel, as lines 113-117 said, and also there were some interesting martingale arguments. The results are clearly stated. The reviewer finds this paper non-trivial, but it is not clear whether the contributions are significant. In particular, the rates in this paper have essentially been obtained in the past, and it is the reviewer's understanding that a more careful martingale analysis and Assumption 1 help weaken the previous assumptions. The reviewer thinks the paper has some incremental value.
