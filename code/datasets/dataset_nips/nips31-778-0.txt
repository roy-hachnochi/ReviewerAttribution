This paper studies the task of text generation and proposes to use both retrieval and generation for this task. The formulation proposed in the paper jointly trains to trade-off when to retrieve and when to generate. Given this requires making a hard decision between when and what to retrieve vs when to generate, the paper trains this joint network using policy gradients (the classical REINFORCE algorithm). The paper evaluates the proposed method on the task of generating medical image diagnosis reports, and reports improvements in performance over straight up generation or retrieval methods.  I like the paper as it feels like a very natural solution to combine retrieval with text generation methods, and the paper proposes a clean formulation for doing this. In my limited knowledge of the field, I am not aware of other works that explicitly do this (and there may be works that I am unaware of).  I am also not sure as to how popular is this task in the community, and it may make sense to include results on more standard datasets and tasks (such as Image Captioning).
