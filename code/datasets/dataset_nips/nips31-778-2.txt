This paper proposes a model for medical report generation capable of deciding whether to retrieve template sentences or generating new sentences. This model, the HRGR-Agent, achieves the state of the art on two datasets and outperforms existing methods on human evaluations as well. Overall, this paper presents a method that is not particularly novel to a new application domain (medical reports) that contains some interesting challenges (e.g., referencing the location / attributes of the generated findings as mentioned in line 51). Nothing in the method is specific to the medical domain other than the template database, so it's a little strange that it is not evaluated on other tasks, especially since the templates are generated by simple document frequency thresholding (couldn't you also try this for summarization with a larger set of templates?) As such, I'm borderline on the paper's acceptance; it is a well-done application paper but perhaps a little lacking novelty-wise for NIPS.  Detailed comments: - The proposed method reminds me of a copy mechanism in principle (a decoder can decide either to produce a token from the vocabulary or copy part of its input). The relationship should be made clear, as the implementation here seems especially similar to that of See et al (ACL 2017).  - Why does the generative model fail to detect "effusion" in Fig 1? Was "no effusion" an option for the retrieval system? What if you added common bigrams or phrases (e.g., "mild_effusion") to the vocabulary of the generative model?
