This paper proposes a new regression framework to learn time-varying quantiles of asymmetric heavy-tailed financial asset returns. The methodology is based on the novel heavy-tailed quantile function (HTQF) that models the conditional quantile with capturing how the tail-behavior is far from (or close to) a Gaussian one. The (time-varying) parameters of this function are generated as outputs of long short-term memory (LSTM), where the inputs are polynomials of the centered return processes. Following the quantile regression procedure, the model is finally estimated. The authors provide thorough experiments and real data analysis in the latter half of the paper.   The methodology is unique and interesting in that the traditional quantile regression framework is combined with a recent technique of LSTM and the original HTQF.   Comments: - It's better to cite CAViaR paper by Engle and Manganelli (2004, Journal of Business & Economic Statistics), which proposed a bit similar methodology to estimate quantiles inspired by GARCH models.  - The proposed framework will become clearer if eq. (8) is explained more specifically. Readers from the economics side are not necessarily familiar with LSTM. (More precisely, I’m curious why (8) can generate the parameters successfully. Why is tanh used in the last step? I’m happy to get  intuitive explanation as I’m from the economics side.) - On page4, the authors write ``it can be shown that, for an HTQF with ﬁxed values of its parameters, there exists a unique probability distribution associated with it.’’ A formal proof will help readers to understand it.
