The paper considers a family of statistical models for pairwise measurements, in which we observe scores that come from triplets of the form (user, item1, item2). The problem is to estimate the underlying score function of user-item pair, which is assumed to be low-rank, and the observation to be generated by a natural exponential family.   The authors address the problem from a novel angle as a semiparametric estimation problem, which avoids the need to specify the log-partition function in the natural exponential family.  A penalized contrastive estimator is derived and its consistency and error bound are analyzed.  Numerical simulation supports the rate established in the bound.  I find this a nice addition to the learning from pairwise comparison literature. I recommend accept.    Detailed Comments:   1. Equation (3.2) (3.4)  effectively reduces the problem to a logistic loss matrix sensing problem with a specific randomly generated sensing matrix.  Can a similar robustness to model misspecification be stated for other sensing matrices and other link function? 2. The exponential family distribution of p(y|Theta) really needs to be a natural exp. family.   In general, one still needs to specify the model class in order to reparameterize a given exp family to a natural one. In that sense, the semiparametric view is not as strong as it seems.  3. Assumption 4.3 is somewhat strong as it rules out Gaussian, Poisson and many others. Perhaps it suffices to use sub-gaussian or sub-exponential?
