This is overall a good paper. The main contribution is an analysis of behavioral data using a probabilistic model with SOTA inference methods. The author motivate the model very well. Although some parts of the benefit from a clearer description (see detailed comments below), the paper is well written overall. The experimental results are convincing.  Detail comments:  1) I’m assuming that the locations of the GP over $x$ are given by the event times $t$, correct? If so, then this would merit emphasizing more; also then the graphical model in figure 2a is slightly incorrect: x then receives incoming arrows from all time-intervals $i_n$. 2) eqn 3: This doesn’t seem to be exactly the ELBO the authors optimize, as $\log p({x_n,t_n,y_n})$ cannot be evaluated, eg it is definitely not jointly normal in $x$ for example. I’m guessing the authors use the forward factorization from p4 l156-l157. Is this correct? 3) It would be nice to see some exploration / model comparison wrt to GP hyperparameters such as dimensionality, bandwidth etc. 4) What are the baseline model in the results table? It would be good if the authors could document how those for evaluated (at least in an appendix).  5) It would be interesting to see a trial by trial visualization of the inferred latent variable $x$.
