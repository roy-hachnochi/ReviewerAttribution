Manuscript titled 'point process latent variable models of freely swimming larval zebrafish' describes a novel probabilistic model of animal behavior which can be very useful for neuroethology, psychology, and computational neuroscience. The paper is well organized and written, but missing some details.  The main contribution of this work is a novel probabilistic model based on prior scientific knowledge that contains both continuous and discrete latent states which is very commendable. The inference method is a combination of standard stochastic variational inference, message passing, and sparse-GP methods.  The three scientific questions outlined in L40-44 were not fully answered through the data analysis. (1) no test was done to determine if discrete or continuous only model explains the data better. (2) only inferred parameters are visualized without data generation or empirical quantities. (3) indirect evidence for hunger encoded in the continuous latent variable in Fig 5.  Eq(1) is pretty much useless.  Fig 2b can be misleading. How were the inducing points chosen?  Fig 3&4: colorbars needed! (does dark mean high probability?)  How were the hyperparameters for GP estimated?  How was the dimensionality of x and number of discrete states chosen? How did you end up with 4 discrete states?  Details on the bidirectional RNN and the inference network in general are missing. This is crucial for the successful implementation & high-quality approximate posterior.  How was the model initialized for training?  Table 1: are these only likelihoods on the timing? (and not the mark)  L59: subset -> set  Table 2: are the AR on the interval sequence? Are these regular AR or nonlinear-Hawkes / GLM style AR models? More details are needed.
