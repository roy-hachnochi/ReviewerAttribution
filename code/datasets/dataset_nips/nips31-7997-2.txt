# Summary: The authors consider the algorithmic relationship between spare linear regression (SLR) and sparse principal component analysis (SPCA). These relationships are subsequently used demonstrate how SLR methods may be used to solve the SPCA problem. The latter is a valuable tool in for interpretable data exploration and many methods have been proposed. The authors consider two problems: recovering the leading sparse PC and hypothesis testing (testing for non-isotropic noise).  The manuscript is very well written. The extensive literature on both SLR and SPCA is well documented. The proposed algorithm and intuition behind it are also clearly communicated.   The only reservations concern the experimental results, which are not extensive. My concerns are as follows:  - the data generation method is unclear.  - many of the hyper-parameters employed are not justified (they should at least be tuned in some data driven manner). For example, $\lambda=.1$ is used for the Lasso (line 298), but how such a value is selected is unclear.  - Figures 1 and 2 are unclear. The x and y axis label is too small to read and no error bars are provided.   # Minor comments:  - line 218: LMMSE introduced but only defined later on (line 236)
