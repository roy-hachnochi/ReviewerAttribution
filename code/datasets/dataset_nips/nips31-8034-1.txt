The authors motivate the necessity of novel dimensionality reduction techniques that address the notion of fairness.  The fairness is understood as balanced reconstruction errors for each of the two groups rather than an average global reconstruction error. Thus the authors propose a novel formulation of the dimensionality reduction problem and propose a solution to it with analytical performance guarantees. I appreciate that the authors motivate why they search for one fair projection instead of trivial finding of different projects per groups.  I have two remarks to this work: The first one is about the relevance of class-conditional projections like parametric and non-parementic versions of LDA by Fugunaga. They explicitly account for within class and between class covanriances (but with a different optimization criteria of course). Intuitively, a similar approach would allow for a closed-form solution. Perhaps non-negative SVD shall be covered in the related work too as a different, but related problem, i.e. finding projections that optimize for better representations of individual groups of data points (whem classes/sensitive groups are not predefined). The second part is that the title is not obvious to interpret. I am not sure what is considered as a price of the fair PCA. I though that this would be a loss in average reconstruction error due to balancing of per group reconstruction errors.  Minor: there are small presentation issues, e.g. Figure ?? === I read the authors feedback
