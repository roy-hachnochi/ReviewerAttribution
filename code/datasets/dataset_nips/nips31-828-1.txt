Summary: A seed branch is used to generate semantic seeds and a similarity branch which computes pixel similarities. A cascade random walk neural network is designed to diffuse information regarding the constructed graph considering the affinity matrix.   Originality: The author should highlight its difference with the method proposed in "Convolutional Random Walk Networks for Semantic Image Segmentation" which also use similarity method. And I think a major difference is the similarity learning and cascade random walk which I think the inherent idea is very similar.  Significance: Quite interesting and graph-based method for semantic segmentation is a very interesting direction.
