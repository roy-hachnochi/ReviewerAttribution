CDAN (Conditional Adversarial Domain Adaptation) is a new model for domain adaptation. Standard methods of DA use an adversarial setup where there is a network F that generate the features, a discriminator D that discriminates the features from Source and Target and a classifier G that ensures that the classification task is well done for the source domain. However the discriminator D only compares the features and ignores the output G. This article states that in the general classification task where there is multimode distributions the standard case can not perform well.  Accordingly this paper uses a conditional GAN that takes into account into the discriminator both the features f and the output label g. The method propose several ways of combining f and g for conditioning the discriminator. Also the paper claims that there can be vanishing problems during the training and it shows that while the Wasserstein GAN loss solves it, it does not perform well for DA (I always wanted to know why Wasserstein loss was not used for DA). Accordingly it proposes a new loss that prevents the vanishing gradient and performs better: Priority loss. For combining f and g the paper proposes a method that can be intractable, accordingly they also propose an approximation.  The method is tested in the standard DA tasks. However I miss results for the VISDA setup that lately is becoming a standard. The ablations studies are very meaningful: conditioning strategies, convergence, visualization and discrepancy.  The paper is well written and motivated, the method explanation is clear and the formulation seams correct (However I didn't check it in depth and I skiped the demonstration of the theorem).
