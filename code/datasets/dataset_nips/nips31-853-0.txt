The paper proposes estimating statistical leverage scores by regularized Christoffel scores. It develops Christoffel functions for kernel methods and tries to characterize  the relationship between population density and leverage scores.  The results are original and the paper is easy to read.  However the significance is hard to gauge. It would have been nice if the authors could have taken the approach and applied it to Sketching or a related task where  statistical leveraging is important. Such an application would have illustrated the significance of the obtained results.
