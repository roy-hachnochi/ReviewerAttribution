Conceptually, it makes sense to use an RNN to denoise images. Using non-local information is conjectured to help in denoising, as shown by the experiments. There is however a bit confusion in this work between image restoration and image denoising/super-resolution. Image restoration is defined as the task which consists of inverting a point spread function. This operation is useful in a wide array of domains ranging from astronomy to microscopy. Image denoising can be viewed as the simple case when this PSF is equal to identity and image super-resolution corresponds to a decimated version of this identity operator (so that it does no longer consist of a convolutive model). There is no evidence that the approach presented in this work applies to more general problems than denoising and super-resolution. Qualitative results are missing in the paper, so we do not have any idea of how the results are improved visually. At the same time, the overall improvements are not ground-breaking in terms of PSNR values
