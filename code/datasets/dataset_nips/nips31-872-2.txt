Post rebuttal update: After reading the rebuttal and other reviews, I upgraded my score to 6. The clarifications should be added to the paper.  ************************  Paper summary: The paper proposes an approach to estimate the 3D coordinates of objects in a scene and the room layout. The model includes three components. First, the bounding box coordinates are estimated. Second, a layout prediction module finds the floor, ceiling and walls. Third, through a physics engine the stability of the predicted scene is estimated.  Paper strengths: - The paper tackles an interesting problem. Including the physics engine in the training loop is interesting (unlike previous approaches like Mottaghi et al. that use the physics engine in a passive way).  - The paper provides large improvements over Factored3D, which is a state-of-the-art method.  Paper weaknesses: - The paper has serious clarity issues: (1) It is not clear what "unsupervised" means in the paper. The groundtruth bounding box annotations are provided and there is physics supervision. Which part is unsupervised? Does "unsupervised" mean the lack of 3D bounding box annotations? If so, how is the top part of Fig. 2 trained? (2) It is not clear how the fine-tuning is performed. I searched through the paper and supplementary material, but I couldn't find any detail about the fine-tuning procedure. (3) The details of the REINFORCE algorithm is missing (the supplementary material doesn't add much). How many samples are drawn? What are the distributions that we sample from? How is the loss computed? etc. (4) The evaluation metric is not clear. It seems the stability score is computed by averaging the stability scores of all primitives (according to line 180). Suppose only one box is predicted correctly and the stability score is 1 for that box. Does that mean the overall stability score is 1?  - Another main issue is that the results are not that impressive. The physics supervision, which is the main point of this paper, does not help much. For instance, in Table 2, we have 0.200 vs 0.206 or 0.256 vs 0.261. The fine-tuning procedure is not clear so I cannot comment on those results at this point.  Rebuttal Requests: Please clarify all of the items mentioned above. I will upgrade the rating if these issues are clarified.
