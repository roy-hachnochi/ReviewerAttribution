The paper presents some impossibility results for semi-supervised learning with margin based losses that decrease with increasing margin (includes popular losses like hinge loss, log loss, etc). They are of the following form: take a classifier w_sup which is trained using only labeled data; take a semi-supervised classifier w_semi (\neq w_sup) that is learned using any semi-sup algorithm utilizing unlabeled data as well; consider a composite loss L(w) on labeled and unlabeled *training* examples; the results say that there exists a labeling of the unlabeled samples for which L(w_sup) is smaller than L(w_semi). It is shown that for margin based losses that increase in a region (such as least squares loss), such a labeling may not exist.   Although the impossibility result is interesting, I am not convinced about its use or significance. The proofs are essentially based on constructing a labeling of unlabeled samples such that samples with higher margins on the positive side with w_semi are assigned -ve negative label (and vice versa). It is unlikely if impossibility results obtained with this type of post-hoc pessimistic labeling will have any bearing on real semi-supervised learning settings.   ================== I have read the author response. However, I still have concerns on significance and usefulness of the results.
