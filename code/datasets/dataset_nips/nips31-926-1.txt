This paper combines local convolutional neural networks with symbolic graph reasoning, which consists of three different layers including local-to-semantic attention layer, graph propagation layer, semantic to local mapper layer. Experimental results prove the effectiveness of the proposed approach on the task of semantic segmentation and  image classification.  Strength: -The paper is very well written and easy to follow -The proposed method seems to be very effective Weakness: - the novelty of the proposed method seems to be straightforward and marginal
