This paper describes a method to integrate knowledge graph in a deep neural network, which is usually learned end to end by data. To achieve that, a module named "symbolic graph reasoning" layer is used to functionally merge the knowledge graph (node embeddings and adjacency) into the hidden space, to help the subsequent tasks. A good amount of experiments are done on several datasets, and the results are on a par with state-of-art results.    The paper is well written. Motivations and methods are laid out nicely. Experiments with the methods are at the same level of the state-of-the-art results for the used dataset. In analaysis, variants of the method was done to isolate the effect of some of the components.   Several comments:  1. The coco-stuff results in [27] has a slightly higher number (50.3). Should it be cited as well?  2. The paper: "The More You Know: Using Knowledge Graphs for Image Classification. Kenneth Marino, Ruslan Salakhutdinov, Abhinav Gupta" seems to be a more relevant method to compare to.
