The work is a further improvement of the DVAE. Most notably, the work exploits various elaborate techniques to allow the DVAE to be trained by the IWAE objective function. Specifically, on the prior distribution side, the works proposes (1) a mean-field approximation as well as (2) an alternative parameterization that enables the Gaussian integral trick. To accommodate the structure of the prior, a more general and inverse CDF free approach to reparameterizing overlapping transformations is proposed, with three different instantiations. Empirically, it is verified that with multiple samples DVAE# trained by the IWAE usually outperforms DVAE and DVAE++. Also, the power-function transformation shows a superior performance in terms of both better likelihood score and lower gradient variance.   Strength:  - The idea of training DVAE with the IWAE objective is well motivated. - The techniques proposed to achieve the goal are very delicate. - The empirical results support the proposed ideas.  Weakness: - While the novelty is clear there, many proposed techniques are too specific in the sense that they can only be applied to the particular DVAE design with a Boltzmann prior and one-to-one correspondence between the discrete (binary) latent variable and continuous latent variable.  - Due to the delicacy of the model design and training procedure, it will be quite difficult for others to replicate the work.  Overall, I find the work solid, though not general enough.
