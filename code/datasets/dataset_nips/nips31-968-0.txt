In this paper the authors define a new set of metrics for evaluating the performance of time series anomaly detection algorithms. They argue (and demonstrate) that existing precision and recall metrics that have been designed for point anomaly detection algorithm evaluation, do a poor job of estimating the quality of results for time series anomalies. This is actually a very important problem in the domain of time series anomaly detection, and has not been addressed in the literature, except in very specific context, such as the Numenta Scoring Model.  The authors pay attention to important aspects of sequence anomaly detection such as existence (the only one previously considered), overlap, and position bias in coming up with a final score. They show how under certain assumptions, these definitions align with the point based metrics. The fact that these proposed metrics are tunable make it suitable for any anomaly detection task, unlike the Numenta model.  Strengths: 1. Paper is well written and easy to understand. Notations are clearly defined. 2. The metrics are well thought out and appear to cover all aspects of time series anomaly detection. 3. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of this evaluation framework over existing models.  Weaknesses: 1. Figures (especially Figure 3) are hard to read and should be made bigger 2. Although this paper is not about comparing different anomaly detection frameworks, the paper would have been more complete if it compared results from at least one more detection technique other than the LSTM-AD approach to show that the evaluation framework produces similar results across multiple anomaly detection techniques for the same data set.  This paper can open up the basis for designing new anomaly detection algorithms using these metrics for optimization.
