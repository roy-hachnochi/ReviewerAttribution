Pelee is a variation on DenseNet which is a CNN network architecture that has many shortcut connections between layers (within a DenseNet block all layers are connected to all previous layers in the block with shortcut connections) The authors make a number of modifications to the original DenseNet and combine  it with a modified version of SSD (Sinlge Shot Detector). They make many design choices to optimize speed in both DenseNet and SSD and find that they are able to maintain accuracy; thus providing what seems to be a very practical network for use on low power devices (eg. iPhones) at reasonable frame rates.  The modifications to DensNet and SSD and justifications are described in sufficient detail. The modifications are not blindingly novel, but are well thought out and effective as a whole, which is the point.  The comparisons with other state of the art optimized CNN (multi-object localization) architectures appear reasonable. YOLOv2(-228) and MobileNet-SSD are the right models to compare to.  This is good work, with good results, the code is online and I am sure it will be useful to many.  Note: There are a few references to YOLOv2 without saying YOLOv2-228. I assume all comparisons are made to the 228x228 pixel input version of YOLO, but this isn't clear from the start. YOLOv2 (high res) is better for accuracy without considering speed or size.
