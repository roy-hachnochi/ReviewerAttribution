Summary         This paper proposes a scheme to jointly learn components of a pipelinen in order to reap the benefis of end to end learningn (no error propagation) and learningin a pipeline( simpler tasks) simultaneously.  Overall, the contribution is good, but not groundbreaking and the presentation issues bump it below the acceptance threshold for me.      Strengths:     The paper approaches a high level problem and takes an interesting and novel approach to doing so, integrating mutliple types of learning The paper describes a method for jointly learning a pipeline for parsing physics problems presented as images.      The method is well described and the presentation is mostly clear and easy to follow.     The description of the evaluation and the specific claims that the experiments are designed to assess is especially clear. Enumerating the claims and breaking analyses down by claims is easy to read and provides a good framework for discussing the paper, eg in a reading group.        Weaknesses:     There are a lot of presentation issues that detract from the readability of the paper.      (minor) the acronym SOTA is introduced, but only used in a single paragraph; this makes for an unnecessary load on the reader to try to commi that acronym to memory, when it's not necessary to the paper; removing this would require minimal revision and improve readability, especiaclly sincne it's the frist paragraph, it is offputting to introduce non essential complexity so early     line 27: is "jointly" missing prior to learning?      related work as the last section makes it difficult to position the paper in context and leverage prior knowledge to understand the work, moving this to before the novel aspects would make the paper easier to read      line 179: "We present this difference merely due to philosophical reasons" is dismissive of your choice of presentation; either explain why the differentiation is advantageous, even if not strictly necessary, or don't make the distinction      (minor) table 1 and figure 3 visually blend together; better separation would improve readability      line 207,251: missing "material" after supplementary      line 283: for completeness, the name of the metric should be used instead of 'performance'.  I think from the figure that it's F1score, but the text should stand alone.      figure 5 x label should have units, from context I think it's samples, but sometimes similar figures use % of total and it's unclear.      (minor) results tables and figure captions should contain the C# that they relate to, to connect to the structure of the text better.      Notationally, the claims in the experiments section and the content at the end of page 4 should use different characters; context makes intention somewhat discernable, but unique characters will reduce ambiguity further and be useful if people aim to have a discussion about the paper      PSL should be defind as an acronym in the text, not only in the citation      (minor) inonsistent use of the oxoford comma, some occurences of two items joined by ",and", and other sort of random seeming uses of commas; occurencecs should each be reivewed against a single choice of style for consistent use throughout the paper      the final sentence is unclear
