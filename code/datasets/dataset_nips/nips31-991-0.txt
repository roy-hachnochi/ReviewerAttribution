Update post-rebuttal: Please include explanation / references related to "Cons" 1 and 2 below.  Summary: The authors study a variant of a standard economic model of production economies, wherein agents may produce and consume goods according to simple rules.  It is shown that a simple decentralized dynamic yields economic growth whenever such growth is possible according to the production rules.  Other facets of the model, such as inequality, are also addressed.  Pros: The results presented are strong and compelling: a simple distributed trade dynamic "finds" a growth opportunity and naturally rewards the participants multiplicatively, leading to growth of the economy as a whole.  The insights about inequality are also interesting and natural, and several other natural questions, such as the basic dynamics in terms of periodic points, are also addressed.  Cons: Firstly, I would like the authors to give better intuition or rationale behind the choice of dynamic.  Why should bids be updated this way?  Is there a natural economic or game-theoretic reason from the agents' point of view?  (I.e., is this mechanism "rational" for the agents?) Secondly, and more importantly, I struggle to see this paper as a good fit for NIPS.  What is the connection to core NIPS topics?  A brief glance at the bibliography shows one JAIR paper (I may have miss some) which I believe is a symptom of the authors not taking the time to make the paper of interest to more than a tiny fraction of NIPS attendees.  I would invite the authors to respond to this point (and the previous).  Other comments and questions: Line 289: The linearity of the proportional update mechanism seems crucial in this result; have the authors thought about how robust this result is, in the sense that "nearby" dynamics yield the same result? Line 325: Use ~, as in Lemma~\ref{...} Line 395: viceversa -> vice versa
