This paper illustrates how to use the non-local prior to detect change points in the Bayesian framework. The simulation study demonstrates the Bayesian model selection (BMS) is robust to the error distributions. The non-local prior has been used in the Bayesian community and the theoretical foundation is well understood. The paper is easy to read except the abbreviations in Section 3.  • In Section 3, the results are discussed assuming that readers know all abbreviations and what they are. It would be nice to spell out the exact name and a brief reason of the behaviour of those methods. • In general, I feel this paper sits on the boundary of statistical journals and NIP. With my limited experience, I question whether the usage of non-local prior and the case study (MRgRT data) are appealing to types of problems that the NIP community interests.
