I found this paper hard to read.  Although I am familiar with both the physics of MRI and deep learning (and have worked at the intersection of the two), it was difficult to follow the exact details of the optimization objective, the data consistency term, etc.  More generally, this paper seems to be only a marginal advance over other methods.  It seems to fall into the category of "Here is a new DNN architecture with features tuned to a specific problem, and some experiments showing that it works."  There is no theoretical justification for the choices made, although they seem reasonable given the context of the problem statement -- however, the final experiments show that the method performs only slightly better than competing DNN-based reconstruction methods, and given the error bars show, it is not clear that the results are statistically significant.  Given the readability issues; the ad hoc nature of the architecture; and the less-than-stellar results, I do not believe that this paper crosses the bar for publication in NeurIPS.
