They discussed some issues encountered in implementing SVRG method in practice and provided experiments to show that SVRG estimator fails to significantly decrease the variance. However, the failure to decrease the variance does not mean that the SVRG method is not useful. The effectiveness of variance reduction methods is usually related to many factors, e.g., the initial point, minibatch size, step size, while the authors did not tune the parameters (e.g., used fixed minibatch size 128 and step size for all experiments) and thus might not show the effectiveness of SVRG.
