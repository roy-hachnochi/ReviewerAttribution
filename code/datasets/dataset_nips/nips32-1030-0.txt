Somewhere in Section 2, clarify what $\mathcal{M}$ is. I suppose it is simply R^n, with its usual manifold structure.  Eq. between lines 54 and 55: Perhaps use a different notation to disambiguate between the acceleration of (the components of) \gamma (which is with respect to the affine connection), and the acceleration of the components of x, which seems to be in the classical sense. For example, in the book by Absil, Mahony and Sepulchre, they use D/dt for covariant derivatives, and d/dt for classical derivatives. So, for acceleration induced by the affine connection, we would have D^2/dt^2.  Section 3: For smooth functions, strict convexity does not necessarily imply that the Hessian is everywhere positive definite (though the reverse is true). Isn't this an issue when using the Hessian of $\phi$ to define a Riemannian metric?  Around equation 1: Can you explain more how the two discussions under "biorthogonal coordinate systems" are related? My understanding is: if we perturb x along the direction v, then y is perturbed along the direction D(\nabla \phi)(x)[v] = Hess \phi(x)[v] = H(x)v, and we call this u. If this is the right way to think about it, I would suggest to include it. When thinking about these two structures, I am wondering: would it help to think of two manifolds, M and N, and to think of \nabla \phi and \nabla \phi* as a diffeomorphism between these two manifolds? Then, the relationship between tangent spaces is clear through this map, and each manifold can have its own flat connection.  I am more familiar with the definition of connection as a map which takes two smooth vector fields and outputs one smooth vector field, corresponding to a directional derivative of one along the other. If available, can you give a reference for a textbook that shows it is equivalent to specify the geodesics?  Line 116: the velocity should be a vector; -f(x)/\rho seems to be missing \nabla. Also, it should be specified that this is the velocity in dual coordinates (on a similar note: the sentence goes on to say "... of the connection", but it would be good to specify which connection explicitly.  Section 5: Here, phi was set to a special form (spell it out?) so the Bregman divergence is just the squared norm. But then, duality is used here by applying to f the concepts that were exposed for phi, regardless of Bregman divergence concerns. Specifically, for any smooth, strictly convex function q, we have a well defined q*, and the gradients of q and q* are inverse maps of one another, giving a diffeomorphism for R^n. This is used in two ways in the paper: it's used with phi in the context of Bregman divergences; and it's used with f in the context of primal-dual proximal point methods. Is this interpretation correct? Perhaps this could be clarified?  Lines 138-140: Is the point that you would like an expression for g^k that the distance between $g$ and $g^{k-1}$ rather than $x^{k-1}$? This could be stated more directly.  Line 154, "due to the flatness property, a simple closed-form solution can be derived by equating the derivative to 0" -- why is flatness necessary here? The definition of g^k at the bottom of page 5 is a the unique solution to a striclty convex problem; there's no need for flatness to claim that the optimum is attained when the gradient wrt g is zero?  How do we initialize the algorithm, equation (5)? Do we need to be able to compute at least the very first "gradient of the conjugate of f"? Is that an issue in practice?  Line 211: wouldn't \dot \gamma(t) be in the tangent space to the tangent bundle of M, rather than in the tangent space to the manifold M itself?   Line 20: simpliest -> simplest Line 45: is type -> is a type Line 51: $x$on -> $x$ on Line 52: mention the name "Christoffel symbols"? Line 78: missing comma "coordinate, with" Line 130: missing reference after "Equation" (also, "i.e." should not start a sentence) Line 215: it's -> its
