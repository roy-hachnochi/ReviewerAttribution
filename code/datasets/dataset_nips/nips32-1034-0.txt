Bases on the optimal transportation theory, the authors have developed a new approach to tackle the multiple marginal matching problem. The authors have provided details to derive tractable objective function, which can be formulated as a GAN problem eventually. Theoretical analysis on the generalization of the method has been conducted. Experiments on both toy and real-world data are helpful to justify the effectiveness of the method.  In Section 4.1, the authors linked potential functions in multiple domains using a uniform potential function with different weights. This assumption seems to be a bit strong. Some more explanations are necessary to justify the reasonability of this formulation.  In Problem IV, the authors state that 1/N can be taken as a default value for lambda. If so, the problem will be nearly the same with the objective function of classical WGAN. Further considering the generators for different domain, the whole process of the algorithm may not show significant difference from WGAN, except that more than one generator has been used. In addition, the correlation between multiple domains seems to be investigated in a very straightforward way by assuming that a shared discriminator (in WGAN) for multiple domains. It is therefore unclear whether this simply approach indeed is helpful for exploring the correlation.   It is very interesting to discuss the generalization in the paper. According to  definition 1, the generalization is defined over training sample. How about the generalization over unseen test examples?  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ The authors addressed my concerns on the technical details in the rebuttal. The proposed algorithm is theoretically motivated and has shown performance advantages in experiments. This paper is interesting to me, and I would like to vote for an acceptance.
