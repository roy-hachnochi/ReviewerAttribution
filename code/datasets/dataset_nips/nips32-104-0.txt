Clarity: the article is clear and well written, In this aspect the paper is an "accept" for me. (6) Significance: results are significant as they are new and they will generate some impact for practitioners. This is an accept as well (6) Quality: this paper is of high quality, it is clear there is a significant research effort behind. The combination "theoretical results + empirical validation in simple cases" is sensible given the type of paper this is, and the audience. Accept too (6) Originality: This is the item where I tend to reject more than to accept (5). I think it is definitely original, but all the theoretical contributions seem to me a bit marginal:  I am very familiar with Bernton et al 2018, the paper that develops the technique (in turn, mainly based on Basseti et al 2006 and Pollard 1980) that is used here. After reading the supplement of this paper I am left with a "deja vu" feeling; some proofs look way too similar to Bernton et al, making me wonder whether they are rather straightforward adaptations. Indeed, It is no surprise all results of Bernton et al hold here too as this is a kind of average of one-dimensional wassersten distances.  It is no surprise as well it is possible to establish a distributional limit in the multidimensional case here (unlike Bernton et al), although I think it is a very nice observation. Question for the authors: Does the obtained distributional limit here gives any intuition about what should be the limit in the multidimensional case for the vanilla wasserstein distance?
