Authors define generalized sliced wasserstein distances by appealing to the notion of generalized radon transform. They provide some elementary properties (e.g. saying when it is a distance),argue they are preferred over vanilla sliced wasserstein and conclude with some empirical validation.  Clarity: the paper is clear and well written Originality: the material presented here is original and has not appeared elsewhere Quality and significance: here are my concerns, which altogether prevent me to recommend publication. I recognize the hard work that has been put on this paper, and I think it is a nice idea, but I believe the results should be strengthen.   My main concern is that it is not made clear why the generalized sliced distance is a significant improvement over the vanilla sliced distance. It is hard to tell from current experiments: figure 2 compares between several generalized sliced and the linear one. In many cases results are better for the linear distance, making me wonder whether the improvement seen in some cases might be an artifact of multiple comparisons. Because of this, I am not fully convinced that the improvement on figure 3 is not a consequence of having chosen the best model. Authors should therefore make a strong point about e.g. how to tune the generalized distance in such a way that it will consistently outperforms the linear one (and not overfitting). A discussion in terms of complexity is also encouraged  Currently, the first 5 pages of the paper are mostly definitions and review of other results, but I would expect more substance for a neurips submission there. If that section is shrunk a bit and replaced with more experimental validation (some of this is available in the supplement, but still needs some polishing) it would mean a substantial improvement.
