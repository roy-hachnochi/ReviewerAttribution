The paper establishes connection of sliced-Wasserstein distance to Randon transform. From this viewpoint, a family of generalized SW distances are defined from generalized Randon transform. This enables a number of contributions including in particular non-linear slicing, and using only a single projection. Empirical evaluations shows the advantages of the proposed distance family over the classical sliced-Wasserstein distance such as much less iterations and better data generation quality. The problem is important. The analysis is new and convincing. Empirical evaluations also nicely demonstrate the proposed generalized distance scheme.
