********* edit of review report after discussion ************  I have gone through all the other review reports, the authors' feedback, and the meta-reviewer's comments, as well as the discussion up to now.  For Reviewer #1's concern about making theory, I tend to be open-minded since I can not find solid evidence that the paper is making theory only.  For Reviewer #4's comment about the over-claim of the result the paper proved, my take is follows. First, for many problems, the true local minima enjoys the flat basin. A famous example I have is the following paper:  McGoff, Kevin A., et al. "The Local Edge Machine: inference of dynamic models of gene regulation." Genome biology 17.1 (2016): 214.  where the fitting to the gene expression level dynamics is expected to be flat near the true value, because the natural evolution tends to select the dynamics robust to the changes of the environment or external stimulations. Second, the authors have explained the motivation of using the Levy process to model the noise. As long as the motivation is valid, it is hard to say that the jumps are unusual.  Based on the above reflection, I tend to maintain my previous rating of this paper, and am happy to vote for accepting the paper for publication.  *************************************************************** Originality: The task is new and the methods, I believe, should be standard in the analysis of stochastic differential equations. This work is a novel combination of the techniques in stochastic differential equations, and the deep learning methodologies. The difference between this work and the previous works in literature is clear: the introduction of the S-alpha-S noise. To the best of our knowledge, the related works are sufficiently cited.  Quality: Due to time restriction we have not got enough time to go through the proof. However, we are sure that all the claims are well supported by the theoretical analysis if the analysis is correct. The work presented in this paper is complete. The authors are careful and honest about evaluating both the strengths and weakness of their work.  Clarity: The submission is well organized and clearly written. Since this is a theoretical paper, the proof provided in the supplementary materials form sufficient resource for readers to "reproduce" the results.  Significance: The results are important. Since the analysis covers an important case of error distribution of which the existence is verified by experiments, the work presented in this paper has a big potential to be influential. I believe that other researchers and practitioners are likely to use the results of this paper. This submission addresses a difficult task in a better way than previous work, and advances the state-of-the-art results in a demonstratable way. The work provides unique theoretical analysis.
