This paper presents an interesting finding that is backed up by rigorous analysis and reasonably persuasive examples. Although the idea is quite simple (vanilla gradient descent with warm enough initialization), the execution is precise and the writing quality is very high. I find the theoretical contributions to be clear and elegant, while the data analysis is a bit lacking. In particular, the lack of convincing real data analysis makes it unclear how how realistic the assumptions are/how strong the theoretical statements are in practice. However, the assumptions are rather standard, and it is unsurprising that requiring many random restarts etc are necessary for difficult non-convex settings. Finally, it is not totally clear exactly which results extend to non-symmetric tensors, though I assume many of the choices in this regard are for exposition.
