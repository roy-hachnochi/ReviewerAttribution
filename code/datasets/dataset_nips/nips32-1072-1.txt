In this paper, a fast nonconvex algorithm along with theoretical guarantees on local convergence and linear time computational complexity are developed and analyzed for symmetric tensor completion. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated by conducting numerical tests on synthetic data and it is shown that the proposed method has some merits for dealing with noisy data.  Overall, the paper is well-written and easy to read. The motivations are clear and the technical content of the paper seems to be correct. However, there are some issues that need to be addressed to further improve the current paper.   - The experimental results are very limited. The main drawback of this paper is that there is no comparison with existing methods, which limits their contribution. - It is unclear whether the proposed method is really useful in practice. More experiments need to be done on real data. - Except for the theoretical analysis, it would be better to show the efficiency of the proposed algorithm with experimental results. - There is a discrepancy between the title of the paper that promises a tensor completion method and the proposed algorithm that is done only for symmetric tensor, and hence completely neglects the difference of decompositions to deal with symmetric tensor.
