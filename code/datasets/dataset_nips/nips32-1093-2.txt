- Dynamic pruning idea is very interesting. Compared with static pruning ideas, dynamic pruning may use more parameters without increase the runtime during inference.  - Authors realized the idea by using partial sum of a subset of input channels to generate a decision map. The description of training is clear in general, however, the motivation of using partial sum to make decision and why this helps with the results were not explained. Meanwhile, in the inference, given a test example, how to decide the base channels and the optional channels?  - The paper is technically sound and fairly amount of experimental results were presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed idea.
