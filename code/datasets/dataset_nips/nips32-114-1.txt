This paper addresses single image SR problem based on zero-shot learning. Unlike conventional learning-based SR methods which assume known SR kernel and utilize external database to train the network during training phase, this work assumes unknown SR kernel, and thus estimates the kernel in a blind manner at test time. Then, the estimated kernels are integrated with conventional SR methods (e.g., [29]), and improves restoration quality by a large margin with the aid of the accurately estimated SR kernel. Overall, this work is a natural extension of previous work [23] using learning techniques, and the manuscript is well organized and easy to read. Here are some questions and minor comments.   a. Discriminator D is a binary classifier in this task, but renders a 2D map rather than a single value. Is there any specific reason to employ this network architecture?  b. I believe the proposed method can estimate SR kernel even when the input images are down-scaled by bicubic interpolation. From this view (assume GT kernel is bi-cubic), it would be great if the authors provide quantitative comparison results with conventional datasets (e.g., set5, set14, ...) c. Isn’t it possible to train the SR network with train datasets whose LR images are down-scaled with various SR kernels as well as bi-cubic kernels? (i.e., SR kernels might be generated by modifying Levin et al’s blur kernel generation technique) d..How do you handle the estimated SR kernel to integrate with ZSSR[29] which is implemented on coarse-to-fine (multi-scale) manner?
