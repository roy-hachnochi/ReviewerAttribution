This paper investigate kernel estimation method for blind super-resolution. I think this paper has the following strong points: 1) The idea of using distribution of small patches to guide the training of kernel estimator is interesting. 2) The authors proposed to use deep linear networks for estimating the kernel, and provided a good justification of using such a special network architecture. 3) The authors have used some prior information to regularize the training of kernel estimator. 4) The proposed algorithm achieved good results.  Despite the above strong points, I think this paper also has the following drawbacks: 1) Lack of experimental justification. Although the authors have discussed the reason of their design choice, but it will be better if the authors could provide experimental results to show the effect of kernel constraints, kernel estimator with/without activation function ... 2) More implementation details should be provided to make this work reproducable. For example, training details, hyper-parameters ... I think there must be many tricks in selecting patches for training the discriminator. 3) is there a non-negative constraint for the estimated kernel?
