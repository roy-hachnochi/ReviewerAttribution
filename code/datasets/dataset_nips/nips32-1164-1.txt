    The paper proposes a new optimization algorithm for differentiable architecture search. The main difference compared to other differentiable methods is that it adds a wipe-out step, which eliminates the "experts" that have very small scores.      The paper is not clearly written. It seems to be that the formulation of the paper is very similar to DARTS. It changes the name of "component" in DARTS to experts, but it does not make a fundamental difference.      In terms of optimization algorithm, the main difference compared to DARTS method is that it has a wipe-out method. I think the main benefits of the wipe out is the search speed, but it has the risk of eliminating useful "expert" at the beginning.      Not all the notations in Algorithm 1 are well defined. This makes understanding of the algorithm difficult.      In general, I do not see enough novelty in the proposed method, and the writing is not clear enough.
