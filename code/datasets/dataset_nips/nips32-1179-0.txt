         The paper is well written.  The explanation is easy to follow.  The proposed approach is well-motivated.          Ln. 129: the paper states that CNN^2 need to use far fewer filters to achiever performance comparable to existing schemes.  Does the accuracy of CNN^2 improve as more filters are added.          Am I correct to assume that the size of the features remain the same as the input as one moves up the layers due to concentric multi-scale pooling?  Is it necessary?
