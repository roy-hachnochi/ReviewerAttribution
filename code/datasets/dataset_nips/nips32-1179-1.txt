Originality:  To my knowledge, the motivation for such dual-pathway design is not new. But the particular design of this paper, CM polling in particular, is definitely novel.  Quality:  I think the evaluation of this work is quite thorough, but missing some important items.   1. Missing an important ablation study. It seems that using CM pooling in vanilla CNNs is not not shown in the paper. This makes it less clear if the this pooling actually improves the performance of vanilla CNNs.   2. Missing Vanilla CNN tuning details. It is great that the authors provided the hyper-parameter search details for PTN, CNN2 and Capsule nets. Yet it seems unclear how the vanilla CNNs are tuned. It seems that hyper-parameter tuning plays a significant role in CNN2's performance(6.7% performance drop by changing the last channel# from 40 to 64).  3. Scales of the study. The number of instances in each class is so small ~15-20, which might lead to great variance. This makes it hard to interpret the numbers.  4. Missing confusion matrices. Having a confusion matrices would make the numbers more interpretable as it provides details on the error patterns between classes.  Clarity: This paper is well written with significant and thorough reference to related works.   Significance: Personally, I believe this direction of incorporating biologically inspired inductive bias into network designs, and the particular problem of generalizing object recognition across vastly different views are of great significance. However flaws in the evaluation sections do have a negative impact on this.
