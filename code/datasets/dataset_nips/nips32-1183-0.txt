This paper is largely well presented and is original work on an important problem. It contributes a new actor-critic approach to dealing with covariate shift in an off-policy objective. Empirically, this seems to result in some gains in performance, although it would need to be evaluated in a wider range of tasks and situations to understand if it more broadly applicable.
