Originality: I think the method is new and the counterfactual objective is first studied. The objective is related to [Imani, E., Graves, E., and White, M. (2018)] and use [Gelada, C. and Bellemare, M. G. (2019)] methods to tackle the new objective.  Quality: I would leave my main concern for the intuition for your objective function, and the difference between equation (4) and equation (5). Without emphatic term i(s), the main difference between the two objectives is the sample distribution. The original objective for on-policy setting is to let the distribution as $d_0(s)$, the intial distribution for $s_0$. The excursion objective can be explained as we first execute behavior policy $\mu$ until converge and then we execute target policy $\pi$ (since we are now using value function $v$ under policy $\pi$). The excursion objective make sense if $P^{\pi}$ is ergodic where we don't need to care about the initial distribution. In this case, objective (5) is almost the same except that we first run enough step to reach stationary distribution for policy $\pi$ and then we execute $\pi$ again.  If (4) and (5) are not different under this reason, the counterfactual objective in this paper, which can be thought as a shrinkage version between (4) and (5), should not be much difference from the excursion objective which is already well-studied in [Imani, E., Graves, E., and White, M. (2018)]. I would need more explanation from authors for this main concern.  For experimental part, figures 2,3 don't seem to show convincing result that Geoff-PAC over OPPG and DDPG. And from figure 4,5 it seems all the methods is not good enough compared to other paper's results (e.g. this paper https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.02900.pdf).   Clarity: I think the paper is easy to follow and well-organized.  Significance: As I mentioned in quality part, and empirical results seem not as good as other off-policy optimization paper. And I would also like to hear more discussion on the choice of $\hat{\gamma}$, I believe we can choose that in a clever way using shrinkage method and may discuss that on the paper as well.  In sum I think this is an interesting paper. But since I have a main concern on the objective the authors propose I tend to reject the paper at this moment.
