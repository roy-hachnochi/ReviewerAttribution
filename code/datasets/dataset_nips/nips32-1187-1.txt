"Equation 24 in Levy and Shimkin (2011))." --> it's better if the paper is self-contained. Fig.2 --> why in most of the cases DAC is not performing well on the first task? "4.3 Option Structure" --> I am not entirely sure what do we learn from this section as it's rather descriptive and there is no conclusion to be made (and no baseline to compare with, or no way to quantify the performance)  Fig. 1 --> Why DAC outperforms the baselines only on two tasks out of four? Rows 227-228 "The main advantage of DAC over AHP is its data efficiency in learning the master policy." --> it's not clear how this statement is supported by the experimental results. Rows 249-250 "DAC+PPO outperforms all other baselines by a large margin in 3 out of 6 tasks and is among the best algorithms in the other 3 tasks." --> that does not support the statement provided in the abstract. Also, would be nice to define what is a large margin. Rows 253-254 "We conjecture that 2 options are not enough for transferring the knowledge from the first task to the second." --> what can we learn from it?
