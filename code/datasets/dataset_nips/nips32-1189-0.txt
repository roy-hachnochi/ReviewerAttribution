This paper provides a novel and interesting solution to the problem of numerical instability in ML based methods on hyperbolic manifolds using a group based tiling approach.  The work is well supported by experiments and the mathematical statements are backed up by extensive proofs in the supplementary material.  The work is generally very clear considering the complexity of the underlying approach. In places, however, the writing seems rushed and would benefit from the authors reviewing the language. I have highlighted several typos in the improvements, but there are likely more. There are also some inconsistencies in the bibliography.  The major limitation is that it does not apply to dimensions greater than 6, which are required by most existing work in this field. The authors mitigate this problem in Section 6, so that it is my belief that the work is still significant, though less so than were the group based tilings to be readily applicable to many existing models.
