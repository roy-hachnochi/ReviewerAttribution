Originality: the method is very novel and creative, some of the best ML papers I recently read. Previous work is mostly well cited, with some exceptions of recent hyperbolic embeddings papers from recent NeurIPS/ ICLR / ICML conferences.   Quality: As said above, the proposed method is usually technically sound and complete, e.g. section 4 and attached appendices, but has a few weaknesses or incomplete discussions in sections 5 and 6 that I will briefly touch below. The authors are typically honest about their work, with the small exception of Algorithm 2 (RSGD) which works only for restricted objectives that depend only on the hyperbolic distance function. My current grade is conditioned on clarifying this issue in the main text.   Clarity: paper is clearly written in general. However, sections 5 and 6 and their appendices should be explained more extensively (I know the page limit is a problem, but at least the appendices should be clear). The experimental section is too small for an easy reproducibility of this method, so I am asking the authors to both publish the full code to reproduce all the reported results and to do a better job at explaining the training details (and hyperparameters).   Significance: as said above, this is an important contribution to improve hyperbolic embeddings and reduce their inherent numerical errors. It would be hard for someone else to redo this important piece of research and its valuable theory. However, I believe there are still a few points that could be improved both in the write-up and method that would make the paper stronger.
