This paper proposes to control the level-sets of neural networks. To do so, the paper first proposes ways to find and manipulate the level-sets. The approach can improve both the generalization and the robustness against adversarial examples, by augmenting one more layer to the model.  This is a quite interesting idea on using the level-sets. The results are quite solid, in particular on defending the adversarial examples.  I have a few detailed comments: 1. How well does the model converge? Is it guaranteed to find level-sets through optimizing (3)? 2. What is the practical speed of training the network due to that we have to get the level-sets per iteration? 3. Could you provide ImageNet results on the adversarial examples part?  Would like to adjust my scores if these questions can be resolved during the rebuttal period.
