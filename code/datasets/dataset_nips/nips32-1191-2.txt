The paper has a few conceptual shortcomings:   There is no guarantee that the iteration in Eqn 4 would successfully sample a point on the level set.   A good distribution of points on the level set should also account for local geometry, e.g., curvature, which is not addressed in the proposed method.   A sparse set of samples may not provide adequate control over the behavior of the entire level set.   Some of the theoretical results, e.g., Lemma 1 and Theorem 1 do not strike as particularly surprising.    Experimentally, the geometric SVM loss appears to lose its edge as soon as a little bit of data is collected (in small sample regimes one would need to resort to stronger priors or go e.g., semi-supervised route in any case).   Still, the empirical results in the robust learning setting and surface reconstruction seem to be promising.      Line 144: S(theta_0) should be S(theta)?
