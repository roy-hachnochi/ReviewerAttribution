Originality: main technicalities including the assumptions, the initialization, and the main proof technique is very similar to the previous art. However, the improved upper bound in lemma 4.2. is insightful and novel, to the best of my knowledge.   Quality: I only checked the proofs at a high level, but the submission seems sound to me, and the comparisons with the previous art seems legit. Clarity: The submission is very well-written and well-organized. The proof sketch section is specifically well done. Significance: the results are important because their improve the previous results on the over-parameterization requirements, however, the requirements are still far from being realistic.  >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> after feedback <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< I have read and considered the authors feedback in my final evaluation.
