 CLARITY: Overall the paper is clearly written. There were few parts that I had hard time understanding (i.e., such as line 223-224, how can q(z_i|x_i, x_j, w_ij) denotes the posterior with and without edge information? I guess it's when q_0, and when q_1?) The authors seemed to have squeezed the format a bit too much. There's a lot of details, might be better to focus on key contributions and make the paper self-containing. For example, Figure 2, as is, impossible to decipher and we have to look up the supplementary material to understand.   Overall, I found it hard to tell apart the contribution of homophilic prior on the performance. The particular design choice of encoder and decoder architecture (section 3.2), as well as how to set the global network embeddings (section 3.3). A proper ablation study should be designed to test where the improvement is coming from. I assume maybe the PWA baseline that the author is proposing is the proposed method minus the homophilic prior? But it wasn't super clear. And then the delta between PWA and VHE is fairly small...  The model introduces the notion of link, no link, and unknown, but then the experiment doesn't show whether modeling of unknown brings meaningful differences?   ==== AFTER THE AUTHOR RESPONSE: Thanks for careful response and pointing out the ablations. It is much clearer with the author response. Though, about (d), the figure doesn't seem to support that modeling unknown link brings significant gain..
