SUMMARY This papers contains a new and original contribution to the rapidly increasing literature on sampling from a multivariate strongly-log-concave density function.  The standard setting is considered: the potential function is m-strongly convex and L-gradient Lipschitz. The authors propose a new discretization of the  underdamped Langevin diffusion, which leads to an improved approximation of the invariant density.  EVALUATION I found this paper very interesting. It is based on the following very simple idea of  randomization. Instead of approximating an integral \int_0^h f(x_t), for a small h, by h*f(x_0), one can approximate it by the unbiased random variable h*f(x_{h*a}), where a is a r.v. uniformly distributed in [0,1]. I am sure many researchers working  on the problem of sampling have already had this idea, but to the best of my  knowledge, none of them have managed to convert it into an improved  approximation bound. The main high-level contribution of the paper is that it shows  how one can take advantage of the aforementioned randomisation trick. The latter  is quite general and can be applicable in other situations than the one described in  the paper.   I have checked almost 90% of proofs and find that they are correct. The paper  could be better polished, but I would not penalise it for this reason. The material is clearly presented. There are two minor weaknesses, listed below, that should  not be difficult to fix in the final version of the paper.   - in the comparison with the prior work, the authors do not present the latest  results. Therefore, the comparison embellishes the contributions of this paper.  Indeed, in table 1, in the row corresponding to the Langevin diffusion, the authors  should present the result of "Analysis of Langevin Monte Carlo via convex  optimization", which improves on [13,17]. In addition, for the Underdamped  Langevin Diffusion, in the table,in the abstract and in the text, it would be more  appropriate to compare with [15], which provides an improved bound (kappa^1.5  instead of kappa^2).   - The authors do not keep track of numerical constants. I would very much  appreciate to see results with precise values of constants, as it is done in many recent references cited by the authors.   SPECIFIC REMARKS/TYPOS  - Line 9: compare with [15] instead of [10] - Line 14: applies -> apply - Line 16: problems -> problem - Lines 32-33: this lines oversell the contribution (which is not needed). If one uses  the methodology of evaluating a method adopted by the authors, that I find fully   justified, the current best algorithm is independent of d. By the way, the sentence   on lines 32-33 contradicts the content of table 1. - Lines 44-45: when mentioning ``the current fastest algorithm'', it might be helpful  to cite [15] as well.  - Lines 106-107 - same remark - Line 131: depend -> depends - Line 132: I guess Omega(d^1.5) should be replaced by Omega(d^2) - Line 136: I suggest to use another letter than f, which refers to a precise function (the potential) - Lines 170-171: [18,15] -> [18,13] - Lines 180-181: the meaning of "accurate" is not clear here. My suggestion is to   remove any comment about accuracy here and to keep only the comment on  unbiasedness. - Line 191: please emphasize that the distribution is Gaussian conditionnally   to alpha.  - Lemma 2: it should be clearly mentioned that these claims are true when u=1/L - Lemma 2: I suggest to replace v_n(0) and x_n(0) by v_n and x_n - Line 201: same remark - Section A: everything is conditional to alpha - Lemma 6: mention that u=1/L - Line 400: Schwarz is mispelled
