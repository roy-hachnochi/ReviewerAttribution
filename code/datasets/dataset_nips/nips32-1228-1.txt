This work may be of considerable interest to people working on (applications of) stochastic differential equations. It is generally well written and appears to be technically sound (to the extend I could verify). What I considered to be missing in this paper was "at least an illustration of how the algorithm might eventually materialize into a machine learning application" (quoted from the NeurIPS CFP).
