------------------- Updates after author feedback.  I have read your feedback carefully.  I really appreciate your efforts doing the simulation analysis. The plots look good.  Several details like how to evaluate distributional distance epsilon numerically and how to tune the step-size is missing, but I think you will have them in the final version.    I would like to maintain the accept suggestion.  ------------------- Originality: The proposed algorithm is new. It can be seen as a variant of the previous proposed underdamped Langevin algorithm (Cheng et al. 2017) with better discretization scheme. Quality: The main proofs (of the main result in Theorem 3) are complete and correct: I checked the proof of lemma 2 and proof of Theorem 3 in the Appendix. There is no simulation analysis. It would be great to see whether one achieves this epsilon^{1/3) improvement via randomized midpoint method in simulation analysis. Clarity: The organization of the main paper is good. However, the writing can be improved. For example, 1. Make a distinction between Markov process and Markov chain algorithm which is a discretized version of the corresponding Markov process. For instance, line 99 directly uses LD both the Langevin diffusion and Langevin algorithm. 2. Introduce notations before using. For instance, line 109, when ULD was introduced, it was not clear what variable u mean here.  Also, line 169, it was not clear what v_n(h) is. 3. In Algorithms 1, W_1, W_2, W_3 were not only introduced in Appendix, making the reading of the main paper difficult. 4. The statement of the Theorem 3 is awkward: what does it mean "Algorithm 1 can find a random point X"? Maybe a statement on the distribution at step N is better. Significance: This paper improves the previous rate for log-concave sampling and provides new ideas for designing new sampling algorithms.
