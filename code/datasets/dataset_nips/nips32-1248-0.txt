The paper proposes a neural network model for temporal point processes. The model uses a neural network rather than a parametric form to model conditional intensity function. To overcome the need to integrate the intensity function to compute likelihoods, the model estimates the cumulative intensity function, which can easily be differentiated. Experimental results on synthetic and real data sets show superior performance compared to state of the art. I believe this paper has the potential to be very impactful. The proposed model is clever and effective, yet simple to understand and implement.  My main reservation is that evaluation results were limited to likelihood-based metrics (log likelihood scores and intensity function curves). The paper would have been even stronger if it contained metrics that are tailored to concrete prediction tasks (e.g. time prediction error). Minor:L95: I understand that training with long sequences can be problematic due to gradient vanishing/explosion but the word "intractable" gives the impression that the problem is computational complexity.  ====================================================== I thank the authors for their response and for conducting prediction experiments.
