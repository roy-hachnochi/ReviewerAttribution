The proposed model mainly focuses on modeling the integration of intensity function. The paper is well written and easy to understand. The proposed model is mainly based on monotonic networks and technical novelty is a bit incremental as it is more like an application of monotonic networks to point processes. As for experimental evaluation, the paper only shows the improvement of log-likelihood evaluation, while a major application of point process models is prediction,  such as event prediction and time prediction (see experiments in Du et al 2016). The intensity function is important in making this prediction, however it is not clear to me how to use this proposed network to derive the intensity function and make predictions, and this aspect is also not evaluated in the experiments.  ----------------------------------------------------- the authors' response addresses my concerns, and I changed the initial score
