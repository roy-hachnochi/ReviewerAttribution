1. Before rebuttal: Technical details are clearly written, easily understood, and reproducible. The experiments can validate the authors' argued contribution. My only concern is that the core novelty of the paper should be formally refined, since Taylor expansion has been used before in [31], Tick-tock is not novel enough compared to previous fine-tuning step, and group pruning is an engineering technique for using the proposed GBN. 2. After rebuttal: Reviewers #2 and #3 also have concerns on novelty. I am satisfied with the authors' feedback on the core novelty, so I increase my score to 7.
