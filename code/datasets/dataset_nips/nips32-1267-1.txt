Originality: Minor. Although the overall Gate Decorator method is effective, most of the individual components have been proposed in previous work. For example, pruning filter based on BN is proposed in [26]; The Taylor expansion formula is proposed in [31]; The iterative pruning setting has been proposed in [8]; The sparse constraint on scaling factor has been proposed in [26], etc.  Quality: The technical claim is sound. Extensive experiments make the paper convincing.  Clarity: The paper is generally well written except for a few typos. It is also well organized.  Significance: Minor or medium. The results are not very surprising. Other researchers may borrow the idea of GBN and Tick-Tock procedure to improve the performance. However, it did not compare with the previous state-of-the-art pruning methods based on AutoML, making the advantage less convincing.
