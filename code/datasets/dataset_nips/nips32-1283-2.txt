The paper considers the problem of convex optimization in the distributed setting where each of the m users observes n i.i.d samples from an unknown distribution and are allowed to transmit a one-shot message to the server. The server then tries to find the minimizer of the expectation of some convex loss function over certain parameter space. This problem has gathered a lot of interest recently, especially in the setting of federated learning, where the data are located on users' devices.  In the setting where m >> n and each user can only send a limited number of \log(mn) bits, previous results based on sending local minimizers fail to achieve an error that goes to zero when m tends to infinity and n is fixed. The paper proposes multi-resolution estimator (MRE), which can achieve an error of \tilde{O} (m^{-1/d}n^{-1/2}) when d > 2 assuming the loss is bounded, smooth and strongly convex. This matches the lower bound in this setting up to logarithmic factors.  The algorithm is based on the observation that when n is small, local minimizers don't carry all the information needed to compute the overall minimizer. The algorithm complements this with estimations of gradients on randomly selected points around the local minimizer. The final output is the point with the smallest gradient norm.  The author also empirically demonstrates the result by two simple examples of ridge regression and logistic regression.   The paper is well written with a clear statement of the result and analysis. I enjoy reading the paper. The result is cute with interesting observations. The result could have been stronger if the author can analyze the whole tradeoff between the communication budget and expected loss. Overall I would recommend the paper for acceptance.  Minor comments: 1. There is are missing ellipsis in Fig 1. 2. Corollary 1 seems to be stated in the wrong direction. 3. When stating the communication budget, it would be nice to include d, the dimensionality in it or state the dependence clearly at the beginning.   ==================== After feedback:  Thank the authors to address my concern on the tradeoff when larger amount of communication budget is provided. I have increased my score from 6 to 7.
