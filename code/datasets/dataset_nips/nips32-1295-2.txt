This paper follows the framework of conditional independence tests provided by [4]. Instead of assuming the type of distribution, it uses GAN to simulate the distribution and then make conclusions based on distribution comparison. Some theoretic and empirical analysis of this method is provided in a logical manner. The experiments are well organized and easy to read. The framework is not new but introducing GAN may help to extend the testing to high dimensional data. Theoretic analysis does not completely cover all aspects that a hypothesis testing method needs.
