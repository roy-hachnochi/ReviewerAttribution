After reading the response, I believe the authors could make the problem formulation and algorithms more clear. I am raising my score accordingly.  ================================================== Overall, I feel this paper is not self-contained and incomplete. There is no complete algorithm being presented. Some of the notations are not well-defined and somewhat confusing. The authors also spend much effort explaining the proofs while the problem formulations and algorithms are not clear. I believe the priorities should be reversed. My detailed comments are as follows:  1. Section 4 on page 4: This seems to be a partial/incomplete introduction to UCRL type algorithms. Many of the key components in the UCRL algorithm which are likely needed in this paper (such as the empirical transition counts, the notion of epochs, etc.) are not explained. It is therefore not clear what is the purpose of this section. In particular, (1) the notation $\overline{P}_t$ seems being only verbally defined as the ``empirical transition function''. Its precise mathematical meaning is unclear. (2) The elements in $\Delta(M,t)$ seem to be probability measures q(x,a,x'). How does it also contain conditional probability measures P(x'|x,a)? It might better to define explicitly what \Delta(M,t) is. (3) What is $\epsilon_t(s,a)$? It is not defined anywhere in the paper. What is the role played by this constant and how does it affects the performance of the algorithm?  2. Section 5.1: This section is not self-contained and confusing as there is no algorithm presented. Instead, the authors simply refer to a previous paper [4] and mention a few things that need to be changed there. I believe this is not a good way of presenting algorithms as the readers have to look back into [4] in detail and connect dots and pieces in order to understand what the algorithm does.   3. Section 5.2: Since UC-O-REPS is not clearly explained and the empirical transitions are not defined. It is rather difficult to follow this section, and it is not clear what is the motivation for defining a new transition $P_t^*$.  4. The proofs seem to follow the proof for UC-O-REPS [4] rather directly. However, many of the key components in UC-O-REPS are not explained. For example, this proof does not explain why the algorithm requires the notion of epochs here or why the empirical transition matrix should be updated per epoch in the way suggested by [4].   Other comments: 1. Line 130: Change ``different than'' to ``different from''. 2. First equation after Line 130: A summation is missing in the computation of expectation. 3. Line 132: ``For this purpose we constraint the confidence...'': Change ``constraint'' to ``constrain''. 4. Line 134: It is not clear what the elements in $\Delta_\alpha(M,t)$ are. The elements in $\Delta(M,t)$ seem to be q(x,a,x'), which are incompatible with q(x). 5. If $\Delta_\alpha(M; t) = \emptyset$, then, [$q_{t+1}$ is chosen to be an arbitrary occupancy measure].
