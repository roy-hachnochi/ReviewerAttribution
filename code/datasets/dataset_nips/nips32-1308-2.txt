1. Originality and Quality. This is work is original to the best of my knowledge. Adequate citation is given to related work. 2. Clarity. The paper is very well written and straight-forward. Adequate intuition and discussion are provided in the paper. The writing is reader-friendly as proofs for important lemmas are included in the main paper.  3. Significance. The idea of the first algorithm is straight-forward but the proof needs slight modification due to the bias. The idea of the second algorithm is not very trivial.  ========= Update ========= Thank you for the feedback. My overall score remains the same.
