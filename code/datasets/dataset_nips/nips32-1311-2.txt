The proposed partitioning process fit the least square regression over the node and select the optimal split. In addition, for each leaf node, Lasso linear regression model is fitted. My concern is that this can be very slow for large-scale datasets. It is interesting to see the empirical time cost in the experiments.  In the experiments, authors compared baselines such as GUIDE, CART and MARs on 9 datasets, and found CART is the worst method. It is reasonable to think CART might not be the best for base classifiers in the ensemble. Although authors compared WRF of SLRT with RF/WRF of CART, it is better to have comparing results with base classifier such as GUIDE and MARS to see how much the proposed method can improve.  LASSO linear regression on leaf nodes is used for prediction. How did authors determine the regularization parameter in the experiments? How sensitive it is to affect the predictive results.
