+ Three challenging and large-scale video datasets are used: Something-Something, Kinetics, Moments-in-time. + Various ablations are provided. The experimental analyses lead to very interesting observations that are useful for the community. The fact that TSN [15] does not improve with more #frames, whereas bLVNet-TAM does is interesting to see (Fig 3). The performance breakdown for different components in Table 5 is nice. Overall, there are many take-home messages to learn from this paperâ€™s experiments. - In terms of methodology, the paper combines existing blocks: Big-Little-Net [7], TSN [15], TSM [4]. Therefore, its technical contribution is limited.  * Final rating: I keep my initial score, i.e. 6, after having read the rebuttal and the other reviews. I thank the authors for the clarifications provided. Despite the limited originality, I believe that the paper can be a valuable contribution to the community with its simplicity, positive results, and comprehensive experiments. I encourage the authors to incorporate the clarifications in the revised version.
