The paper is well-written, with an accurate notation. The contents are well-organized and the proofs look sound from a high level inspection. I think that the paper provides nice contributions by extending the applicability of stationary state distribution ratios to very general off-policy policy evaluation settings, in which the off-policy samples are potentially drawn from heterogenous and unknown sources (such as multiple unknown behavior policies). Adapting the same idea to off-policy policy optimization, which is proposed as future work, would make this contribution even more significant. The paper does not display any major issue. I report below a couple of detailed comments.  - The figures are overall too small, the tick labels are not really easy to read. In Figure 2 the x axis label is missing. The authors might improve the figure display in a final version of the paper. - Before turning to the appendix, it was not completely clear to me what were the actual TD and IS algorithm that the authors compared to DualDICE in the different experiments. I suggest to add a few lines in the main text to clear this point.  --- Thank you for the detailed answers. I am looking forward to future developments of this work.
