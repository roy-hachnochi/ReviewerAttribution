The paper provides a new deep unfolding formulation of belief propagation. The  idea looks natural and reasonable. However, I felt that the novelty is a bit weak because the idea is a straight extension of Nachmani's works.  Numerical results show the new algorithm outperforms the conventional algorithm when the code is short BCH codes.  The gain obtained by the modification is not so large (compared with Nachmani's original) but the idea deserves to be known.  I have read the author response and my opinion remains the same.
