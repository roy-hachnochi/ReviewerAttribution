Quality The algorithms and corresponding analysis are nontrivial but straightforward technically. Proofs in the main text and appendix appear to be correct except for one detail: In the proof of Lemma 1, how is the last term in the second to last equation upper bounded by \delta M? This requires justification since the setup of Theorem 2 implies \epsilon > 2/3 \delta. If this is an error, I suspect the proof can be corrected without significantly affecting the main results.  Question: For the Blitz algorithm, why do the number of queries to f consistently decrease for larger k?  How much of the performance of FIG is due to the stealing trick (Appendix C)? Is the proposed algorithm still competitive with Gupta et al. without the stealing trick?  Originality Interlacing idea appears to be novel, but the proof techniques build on previous work. For example reordering trick which is crucial for lifting the monotonicity assumption goes back to Nemhauser et al 1978  Clarity: Overall very clear, well organized, and a pleasure to read. One type on line 119, ";j;greedy"  Significance: This is an important open theoretical problem, and the reordering trick may be applicable to other recent algorithms for monotone submodular maximization. The experimental results would be more significant with an application besides than cardinality-constrained (weighted) max-cut.  Question: How does the algorithm perform on monotone submodular functions?  ---------------- EDIT: The authors addressed my concerns about ablation on stealing trick and a small typo (Algorithm 2 and line 190). Therefore I am keeping my review at accept
