This paper proposed a transfer learning based anomaly detection algorithm to infer the anomaly scores of the target domain examples by transferring knowledge on related domains.  To achieve this, a latent domain representation vectors are trained to capture the domain knowledge.  Quantitative experiments and empirical studies are presented to manifest the efficacy of the proposed algorithm. In general, the paper is well-written and well-organized. My main concern is that there lacks some insightful discussion regarding the proposed problem and algorithm. In particular,   (1) The proposed algorithm requires to obtain the exact number of normal/abnormal examples in each domain. However, it could be impractical in real-world applications.    (2) It is often the case that the target domain and source domain may have the imbalanced sizes of data. Will it be problematic for the proposed algorithm?   (3) In many applications, one may observe that the anomalies are partially overlapped with the normal patterns. Can the proposed algorithm handle such specific case?
