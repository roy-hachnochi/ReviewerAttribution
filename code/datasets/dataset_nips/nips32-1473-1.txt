Generally speaking, this is a high quality paper which solve the compression problem in a different but effective way. By utilizing the proposed algorithms, the end users do not need to spend hours uploading dataset to the cloud, which is quite friendly and attractive for end users. The paper leverages the strength of PU learning in augmenting data and the strength of KD method in compression. The experimental results show that the network can be compressed effectively with only 8% of the original data. The paper is well-written and easy to understand.
