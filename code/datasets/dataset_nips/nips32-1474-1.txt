1. Background and Related work are completely missing, making the paper hard to follow:   2. No clear empirical comparison and discussions connecting to the previous methods. For instance, multiple toolboxes exist from the previous differential graph models. However, the manuscripts included no results from these baselines. It seems that the computational cost is huge compared to the differential graphical models in the literature. Without a clear benefit of empirical improvements versus the tools, the significance of the paper is questionable.   3. Besides, the fPCA process is the same as the fglasso framework. The difference is the new loss formulation in this manuscript. However, the intuition or justification hasn't been discussed in the main draft about their new loss.   4. Computational Complexity wrt $p$ or $n$ hasn't been discussed. This is an extremely important perspective. However, the manuscript includes no discussions, both theoretically and experimentally.         5. In the experiments, a major concern is that the number of dimensions is low.  The maximum $p$ considered is 120 and in most cases, $n$ is larger than $p$.  Thus no experimental results show and justify the high dimension consistency claim. More experiments to show the bottleneck that limits $p$ to 120 or why larger $p$ haven't been considered should be added.  6. In the experiments, some guidance should be added to guide when assuming data as functional is advantageous vs estimating from discrete time points.  Some related results are in the appendix, however, a clear discussion about the advantages of one method over the other hasn't been discussed.   This is particularly relevant for the EEG experiment: Only qualitative results for this dataset have been added, how do the other baselines (estimating individually vs direct differential) differ in the types of edges recovered?   7. The simulation results are only on one set of data parameters, how does the underlying true sparsity of the graph affect the estimation performance?          8. Minor Comments - Experiment details are missing: How is $M$ and $L$ chosen? using cross-validation? - Some notations are confusing and should be revised:  For example, $t$ is used multiple times to represent different variables, for iterations as well as time points.
