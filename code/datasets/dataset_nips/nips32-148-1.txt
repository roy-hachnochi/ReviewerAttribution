This paper studies the generalization property of GAN models from an interesting perspective, which is built upon the intuition that reducing the generalization gap usually coincide with protecting privacy. To my knowledge, this angle of analysis is new to the body of GAN research. The empirical results/discussion on membership attack methods and various regularizations also enriches our understanding on the performance of GAN.  That said, the pure theoretical advancement is good but not strong - The key results Thm1,2 are direct variations of differential privacy and may appear incremental rather than fundamental.   Section 4 can be improved - it would be great if the authors can also provide guidlines of GAN design along the way of discussion.
