Some detailed comments are provided below: 1.  It is hard to understand what Remark 6 conveys. The error bound condition (assuming that this refers to Lemma 1) is derived from the PL condition, so what it means that “this error bound condition instead of the PL condition is enough to derive the results”. 2. The analytic strategy in this paper is to first establish the convergence of SGD for each stage and then extend it to K stages for the considered START algorithm. Then, derives the test error bound of the stagewise SGD. A further step is to show how the bound can affect or guide a specific choice of K in the practical stagewise SGD.  3, It might be better to use “START” in the paper title and Figure 1, instead of “SGD”, because the regularized terms have been added to the updating formula so it is not the vanilla SGD.  It would be better to discuss the link between this regularized version and vanilla SGD to further shed light on the vanilla SGD. 4, This paper mentions “Corollary 2” several times, such as in Line 183 and Line 237. However, the paper does not have Corollary 2. This paper seems to be prepared in a hurry. 5, In Line 49, definition of \mu should be given before its use. In Line 123, the assumption $| f( w, z )|\leq 1$ is strong, which only works on the function value range [-1, 1] so the authors need to give more explanation why it does not lose the generality.
