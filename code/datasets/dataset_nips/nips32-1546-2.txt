Originality: This paper manages to unify different perturbation based algorithms to one template and as a byproduct it gives a randomized version of UCB. Moreover it excludes the two natural approaches for obtaining the optimal regret bound for adversarial bandit problem and provide a conjecture with strong evidence.  Quality: The proofs are reliable. The paper gives supporting argument on the conjecture it proposes.  Clarity: The paper is clearly written.  Significance: The general analysis on perturbed algorithms for stochastic multi-armed bandit problem is inspiring. We may use it for more complex settings. Also it    eliminates two possible ways of pursuing the optimal regret bound for adversarial multi-armed bandit problem and shine a light on what the optimal perturbation should be.
