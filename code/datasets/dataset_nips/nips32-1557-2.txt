novelty: paper addresses new problem with a new approach. I think the problem is interesting. Originally I was not convinced by the approach, given that this could lead to learning adversarial examples as well, but results seem to confirm the   the validity of the proposed method (though I still have some doubts in point 5)  quality: the proposed method is in general clear and should be easy to implement given the paper. Experimental results confirm the proposed approach.   clarity: the paper was in general easy to follow,   significance: I am unaware that this problem has been addressed before. Extracting knowledge from a network without access to data is potentially impactful.
