 originality: as far as I know, the combinaison of Siamese network, nonlocal operation, co-excitation and margin-based loss in a 2 stage detector for 1-shot object detection is novel  quality: the paper is technically sound. The experimental validation is is impressive (nice ablation study, strong results on 2 challenge,ging tasks). However, I have a major concern about the evaluation protocol: at test time the query image fed is from the classes present in target image, and performance is evaluated on that. This methodology uses information about test images, which is barely acceptable.  It would have been better to see the results if the unseen classes don't even share the same meta-category as training classes. For eg: classes from vehicle metacategory can be kept for testing and animals metacategory used for training.   clarity: the paper reads very well. However, the introduction doesn't mention anything about margin based loss. Related works could talk about one shot detection instead of few shot detection and the intuition behind it. This section is too brief. Some citations are missing (eg: resnet paper)  significance: the paper might have impact due to its originality and the quality of the experimental validation.  post rebuttal remark: Regarding my comment on the evaluation protocol, I'm fine with the authors' response. After reading all the reviews and the rebuttal, I'm inclined to raise my rating to 7.
