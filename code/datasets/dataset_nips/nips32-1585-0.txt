This paper proposes the first channel coding schemes with both encoder and decoder designed through neural networks. The code seems to outperform the state-of-the-art coding scheme in certain scenarios, and also has good generalization property to other channels. It also suggests some training guidelines, which is crucial for obtaining a good channel code. My only concern is the complexity of the code designed in such a way. In case it ends up having exponential complexity in the block length, perhaps it is unfair to compare it to the state-of-the-art low complexity coding scheme. The right target, in that case, should be how close it gets to the performance of the maximum likelihood decoding. Nevertheless, the idea in this paper is original and the writing is clear and easy to understand.   After rebuttal: In the authors' feedback, they claim that complexity analysis will be added in the final version. I look forward to reading this part. I also read the authors' response to other reviewers and felt it is reasonable. Therefore, I am in favour of acceptance.
