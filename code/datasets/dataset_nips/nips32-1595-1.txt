The author for the first time formulated the problem of causal effect identifiability in the presence of CSIs for binary variables, which is original. The manuscript is well structured and easy to follow; more details could be given for 5.2. The proofs for the rules are with good quality. Some more simulation results could be provided for a better understanding of the proposed algorithm.   There are several concerns: 1. In 4.1, have all the rules been listed? 2. Will the greedy algorithm recover all the identifiable probability distributions? Although the problem is NP hard, can you provide a comparison of the greedy search result with an exhaustive search in the simulation? 3.  How to identify the representatives of val(C)/~^s ? Is it through exhaustive search?  Update:  Thanks for the author for answering the questions. I think it is still not very clear to me what is the gap between the set of all identifiable causal effects and the rules identifiable using the rules listed in 4.1. But overall it is a very interesting work with good quality and I will keep my initial score.
