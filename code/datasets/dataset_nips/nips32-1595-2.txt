 This paper proposes an automated search procedure for identifying causal effects when context-specific independence relations are present in an observed distribution. Equipped with sufficient conditions for conditional independence statements (Boutiller et al. 1996) and LDAG representation (Pensar et al. 2015), a simple search algorithm is implemented. Overall, the paper is clearly written, and it was easy to follow theorems (clarity). However, it is hard to measure the novelty of the paper (originality), which I will discuss below. Hence, the proposed algorithm may be useful for some researchers, but its significance (impact) is unclear.    It is nice to see the rules (basic probability axioms + (CS) independence) written clearly, which lead to the implementation of a search algorithm. However, there is nothing special about the rules. A set of sufficient criteria is implemented to check them in a sufficiently fast way. Is necessary (and sufficient) criteria impossible to provide even with a faithfulness assumption (or its modified version taking CSI into consideration)? The primary contribution, perceived and highlighted by the authors, seems to be the implementation of the search algorithm. However, the implementation cannot usually be an important factor to weigh in the acceptance of the paper.  ** after rebuttal ** I somewhat disagree with the authors rebuttal in L39–41. Do-calculus *is* the result of basic probability axioms and conditional independence relations in a causal graph. (The authors proved it using LDAG w/ interventional nodes for Thm 2 in the appendix.) There is no reason to “prevent the need for … do-calculus.” But, I generally agree with the authors’ intention. Anyhow, I value the importance of the paper, and recommend the acceptance of the paper.
