I have only positive remarks on this paper.  Originality: This paper extends theoretical results from [Xu et al] and [Fan et al] on bounds of the variance of reparameterization estimators.  Quality: The paper is of high quality: - Theoretical results of high quality: assumptions precisely stated, proofs given in their gist with details in supp materials. The limitations of the results are clearly stated as well. - Experimentations are rigorous and intuitive. The results on the different types of subsampling, to optimize the variance of the estimator, are interesting.  Clarity: This paper is very well written, clear in its theoretical and detailed and intuitive in its experimental part.  Significance: The results are significant and of interest to the NeurIPS community.
