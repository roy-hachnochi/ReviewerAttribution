Originality: The variance bound for the gradient estimator is novel and understanding the technical condition would be helpful in analyzing the stochastic gradient descent method.  Quality: The technical results are sound and clearly highlights the novel contribution. However, it was not entirely clear how the choice of constant M or M_n would be made?  Clarity: The theorems and the lemmas are clearly written. The main contribution of the paper is clearly described through the technical results.  Significance: How the results on the bound on the variance of the gradient estimator is overall makes an impact in variational inference? Surely, there is the other term the entropy whose gradient will also play a part in optimizing the ELBO (w) function  and hence variance of the gradient of h(w) term should also be controlled - isn't that so or am I making a mistake?
