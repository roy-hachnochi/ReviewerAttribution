[I read the response, no change in my opinion, mostly due to limitation of my confidence.  I at least tried to challenge other reviewers in discussion...]  Within the constraint of NeurIPS format, I think the authors do a very good job at building the intuition for the complex proofs. Overall, the result *look like* roughly what I would expect, it is good to see clearly the dependence of network structure in convergence bounds, and think the result valuable.  However, I am concerned that this work will not be properly reviewed in this conference. (I did not check the proofs)  Section 4 To be honest, I would prefer removing the whole section. The experiments do not reflect anything practical at the moment. The contribution is clearly theoretical, addresses a (in my opinion) interesting problem, but I am not aware of a single production use - but I can surely imagine some in the future enabled by progress in telecommunications technology.  Other L142 - Is p and integer? make clear L152 / Eq (7) - Provide a reference?  I thought some of the remarks in early Sec 2 (ref [43-45], Problem reformulation) could be relevant to work of Loizou and Richtarik: A new perspective on randomized gossip algorithms, which you are maybe unaware of.
