This paper contributes methodology for the improvement of methods that are commonly used for statistical, likelihood-based, approximate inference. More precisely, the paper propose improvements of the popular Variational Inference method.  The authors investigate the optimisation of variational objectives constructed by using Monte Carlo estimators of the likelihood and particularly the effect of such optimisations on the approximation of the posterior distribution of interest. They develop a procedure that they call “divide and couple” in order to find an approximation to the posterior of interest that diverges no more than the gap between the log-likelihood and its lower bound derived from the Monte Carlo estimator. The authors give both the theoretical foundations for their new method and guidelines for its practical implementation. I find the research question very interesting and the paper clearly written with careful description of their new methodology.   I have below a few comments on the paper.  1) The authors have to organise better Sections 4 and 5 in order the implementation and the results of their empirical study to be more clearly presented. Moreover, a small section with conclusions would very useful if added after Section 5.   2) There are small mistakes regarding the readability of the paper; for example in line 118 the word “be” should be added after “are going to”. The reference list needs to be checked again since I think that the paper in [1] refer to the paper published in JRSSB.
