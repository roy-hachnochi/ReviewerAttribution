Quality:  Given the impressive performance of the method in reducing catastrophic forgetting, even without labeling of individual tasks, this seems to be a significant result. In addition, the authors are thorough with their experiments, considering several parameters, and present a reasonable level of understanding of how the method is working.    Clarity: While I am not an expert in the field, I found the description of the method, in particular the description of the V-trace target, to be unnecessarily dense. I would have very much benefitted from some more detail and intuition behind the first equation, especially the truncation of importance sampling weights.  I found the behavioral cloning elements very clear, and the other components would benefit from similar exposition. I found the discussion of the experiments to be very clear.   Originality and Significance: I think the advances in this paper are both original and significant.
