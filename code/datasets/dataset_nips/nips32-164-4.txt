On the positive side, the paper is well-written, the ideas and algorithm are fairly straightforward, and the performance of the algorithm is good. I also thought that the discussion and accompanying experiments distinguishing between interference and forgetting was very nice, and as the authors point out these experimental protocols can be useful for future studies of continual learning.  On the negative side, I felt that this advance was somewhat incremental, especially given that the advantage of this method over existing ones was not clearly demonstrated (see below). I should say that I'm not a stickler for state-of-the-art if the paper's ideas are highly original, but I don't think that is the case here; the main selling point of the algorithm is its simplicity. On this point, though, I wasn't sure whether it's really that important that the algorithm doesn't need task boundaries. It seems to me that these boundaries are available for most tasks. In any case, it was interesting the algorithm could perform well without knowing the boundaries.  Detailed comments:  Is 50-50 new-replay always the best tradeoff? Can this percentage be optimized by the agent?  The cumulative performance table shown in Fig 7 is all over the place, with different tasks favoring different algorithms. I don't see any clear pattern here favoring CLEAR. Moreover, on those tasks where it does come out on top, the error bars are overlapping with those of other algorithms (though this is hard to interpret because the caption doesn't say what the error bars are showing; are these standard errors?).  Minor comments:  p. 7: "that P&C" -> "than P&C"  Text in figures is not legible.
