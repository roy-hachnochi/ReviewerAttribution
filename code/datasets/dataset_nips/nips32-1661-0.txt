This a a solid work. The authors proposed a simple hierarchical prior modelling an infinite mixture and improved state-of-the-art density estimation. This can be seen as an extension to both GECO (Rezende et al) and VampPriorVAE (Tomczak et al), which was also properly cited. The paper is well written, very clear and the evaluation collaborates the expected improvement in performance. Some minor comments to add: * Should the optimisation problem be: min KL(q||p) s.t. E[C(x, z)] < K^2 * I wished the authors could have described more of the results of the graph-based interpolations. In what way is the interpolations done with VHP+REWO better than the models compared to? Is there a way to quantify these results? (Path length of A* algorithm?) * It would be good also to see whether the Lagrangian update alone already leads to a good performance, or whether it is actually the hierarchical prior. * In terms of reporting the results it would be better to do multiple runs and report LL mean + standard error
