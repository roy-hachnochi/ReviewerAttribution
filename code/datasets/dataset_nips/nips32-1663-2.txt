Originality: The model, algorithm and analysis seems to be novel, but as a standard generalisation of previous results. Relevant literature seems to be covered.  The proofs have not been thoroughly checked, but the arguments and approaches seems to be sound. The heuristic for adapting prior work to the new generalised setting is well founded.  Clarity: The paper is generally well written and with a clear focus, comprising of a single result. The non-technical sections are well structured and care seems to be put in conveying the contend.  There is however a glaring problem with the technical sections, including the algorithm itself, where more than 10 variables and constants are introduced with little to no explanation, but merely mathematical definition. While this might amount to a functional and correct algorithm, it makes understanding it quite difficult. Unsurprisingly the resulting confusion carries over to the analysis. With this complicated an algorithm, naming quantities so there qualitative function is well motivated would help the clarity tremendously.   Significance: The result seems novel and well motivated both in application and literature. It is however incremental, and the scope of the paper is rather small.  While  keeping the scope well focused is definitely a plus and makes it easy to get an overview of the paper, additional contributions as alluded to in the conclusion might be beneficial.    ====  In the rebuttal the authors have promised to address the concerns I raised. I have raised my score slightly due to this.
