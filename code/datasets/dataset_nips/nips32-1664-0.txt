Originality: While safe interactive machine learning has been investigated before, I really like the reductionist approach taken here which uses any unsafe IML algorithm as an oracle and combines it with safety testing to make provably safe decisions.  This reductionist approach is original. Adequate citation of earlier works has been provided.  Quality: The submission is technically sound.  Clarity: Most parts of the paper are well written. I really like the detailed explanation of the algorithm. However, it is still a pretty hard paper to read. The authors use a lot of ideas from a previously published paper Turchetta (2016) and unless the reader is very well aware with previous techniques it is hard to follow some of the arguments.  For example, the safe expansion strategy is hard to follow w/o prior knowledge. Lines 184-203 are hard to understand w/o prior knowledge. Similarly, the choice of heuristic (lines 225- 236) paragraph was also hard to understand.  Furthermore, it is not clear to me about the computational aspects of the proposed algorithm. For example, what does the safe expansion steps entail computationally? How easy is it to maintain and update the sets S_t^o and S_t^p? Significance: This is a significant result in the area of safe interactive learning.
