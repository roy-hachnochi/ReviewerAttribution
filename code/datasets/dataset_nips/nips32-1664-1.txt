Overall, the paper is tackling an important problem. Safe exploration is particularly important since it allows autonomous agents to gather data about their environment without violating safety constraints. The paper’s theoretical guarantees are also strong, ensuring that it finds the optimal solution within a slightly constrained version of the safe set. The assumptions appear to be standard.  My main concern with this paper is its comparison to prior work, in particular, (Berkenkamp et al., 2017). The authors state that (Berkenkamp et al., 2017) “can benefit from more efficient, goal-oriented exploration”. Is this difference reflected in the theoretical guarantees provided by the authors? If not, don’t the authors at least empirically compare to this prior work to show that they obtain better solutions more quickly? I would be much more positive about this paper is the authors could clearly convey the difference between their paper and this prior work.
