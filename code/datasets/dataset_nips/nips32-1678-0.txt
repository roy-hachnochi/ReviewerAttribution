Beautiful approach to deal with categorical and integer variables in Bayesian Optimization that builds a graph with the combinations of these variables. Necessary approach to continue the research in making BO able to deal these variables. When I read papers such as this one I am willing for it to be accepted. I do not have much to say rather than good job. And I say this being an author that have proposed another approach in the same scenario. If we add the quality of the paper with the sensational supplementary material, the theoretical material added and the quality of the experiments, I heavily recommend for acceptance this paper. It is a paper that I will give a seminar to my colleagues without a doubt and maybe, who knows, expand it. Congratulations to the authors.  The code would have been nice to be uploaded.  I just wish to say to the authors that I would like to see an extension of this paper published in a journal, it would be very great.
