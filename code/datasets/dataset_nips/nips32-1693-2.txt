Update: I thank the authors for their feedback. The additional experiments address my concerns regarding larger scale experiments and the discussion about the choice of lambdas clarifies my concerns regarding convergence. Thus, I decided to raise my score. ######################################################################################################################################## (1) Summary of the Paper This work advocates the usage of image quality objectives as regularizers when training GANs in order to obtain more natural looking images. In particular, two different metrics are used: (i) a variant of the SSIM index and (ii) a gradient penalty inspired by NIQE along the WGAN GP framework in order to achieve a superior performance to several baselines, as demonstrated empirically on 3 datasets.  (2) Paper Clarity The writing of the paper is clear and it is easy to follow. It is well motivated and contains enough background information.  (3) Methodology and Significance The idea to use image quality metrics as regularizers is simple, yet seems intuitive, which I appreciate.  However, while the new regularizers are shown to have a superior performance in terms of FID/INC, I have several concerns/questions. Specifically: - How do the regularizers affect the stability of training? How sensitive are they to the choice of the hyperparameters (the lambdas)? - In Table 1 and 2, are the scores provided for FID and INC computed using the same trained model (i.e. same lambdas), or are they tuned separately for both scores?  Overall, while the method is simple and intuitive and it appears to work well, its contribution is somewhat limited. The main reason behind this is that it is only applied to one particular GAN variant i.e. WGAN GP and it is not clear how one can extend it to other GAN versions. Furthermore, since the main motivation of the submission is to generate more natural looking images, a proper evaluation should include some higher-resolution datasets where the regularizers can potentially have a bigger impact.
