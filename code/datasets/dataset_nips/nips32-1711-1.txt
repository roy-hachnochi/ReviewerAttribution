Originality: In order to deal with multivariate data the paper proposes to use a particular case of the Linear Model of Coregionalization (LMC [1]). For dealing with spatially aggregated data the paper proposes to use a Gaussian likelihood around the weighted aggregated value of the prediction across regions, resulting in a intractable marginal likelihood which is approximated by using Riemann sums. These are very straight-forward ideas, nevertheless they are effective.   Quality: The paper is technically correct and the experimental section is well done.  Clarity: The paper is well written and easy to follow for the most part. Only the section concerning the extension to multiple domains needs more details in my opinion. For instance, is normalization needed across domains?  Significance: It is a good paper and the experimental section shows the importance of choosing the right likelihood function for the data, but I find the contribution rather limited in scope.
