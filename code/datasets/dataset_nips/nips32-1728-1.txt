Pros:  - The paper is well written and easy to read.  - The proposed PoseWarper network is novel and makes sense. Even though similar ideas have been explored in the literature, e.g, for facial keypoints in [53], I still found the ideas presented in the paper novel for body pose estimation.  - The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated for three different applications on the validation set of PoseTrack-2017 dataset.     Cons: - For frames with multiple persons, the proposed approach requires track ids of the persons to know which two bounding boxes should be used to learn the PoseWarper. I understand that track-ids are significantly easier to annotate as compared to poses, but this should be clarified in the paper. Currently, I couldn't find any explanation for this.  - It's not clear how person association b/w frames are obtained during testing? Are the poses tracked following the approach in [23] before performing pose aggregation in Table-2?   Conclusion: Overall it is a good paper with sufficient technical contributions. Exploiting temporal information for improving pose estimation in multi-person setups has been quite a challenge and this paper proposes a good way of doing this. However, I request the authors to kindly address my concerns below during the rebuttal.
