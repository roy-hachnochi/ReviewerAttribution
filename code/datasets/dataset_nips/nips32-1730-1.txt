Quality: I view this as a significant result. It is interesting that a competitive self-supervised learning scheme exists which only relies on limited backpropagation, and this understanding might be a step towards biologically plausible learning rules.   Clarity:   I found this paper and methods to be reasonably clear, but I had several questions about the techniques. In particular, I donâ€™t understand how the authors implemented an autoregressive model without backpropagation through time   Originality and Significance:  This work seems to be original and significant. Neural systems receive large amounts of unlabeled data, and need to draw semantic features from them a biologically plausible way, and this might be a step towards understanding how this is accomplished. In addition, these schemes might have benefits for distributed training.
