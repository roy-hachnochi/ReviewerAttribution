In this paper, the authors propose a framework for scalable graph partitioning and matching. They use the pseudometric Gromov-Wasserstein in a scalable setup by utilizing a recursive mechanism. They provide detailed analysis of the complexity of the method. They justify the design of this method and they cover the related work in depth. In the detailed experimental setup, they mention all the comparison methods that are being used, the real and synthetic data, as well as the metrics that those methods will be evaluated. In their experiments for the graph partitioning, they focus both on analyzing the complexity/runtime for their method and the comparison methods, and they provide detailed results on a variant of mutual information metric. For the graph matching task, again the authors provide an analysis for node correctness metric and runtime for their method and the comparison methods.  Overall, the paper is about a problem interesting for the NeurIPS community and the authors propose a novel setting to use the Gromov-Wasserstein distance in the graph matching and graph partitioning tasks in a scalable way. The paper is well-written and each claim is well supported by the authors comments', proofs or references. The reviewer has only concerns regarding the experiments and the metrics used in the analysis (see below for metric recommendations).
