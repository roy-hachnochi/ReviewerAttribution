Paper Strengths:  The authors tackle an important and challenging problem of few-shot fine-grained classification. The proposed approach is simple. Experimental evaluations demonstrate the effect by modifying the GAN generated images by combining them with real images at the patch level through meta-learning.  Paper Weaknesses:  1) The proposed approach in this paper can be viewed as a straightforward combination of an off-the-shelf GAN and [7] that learns to linearly fuse two images for data augmentation. The novelty of the proposed approach is somewhat limited. In addition, the connection with [7] is not fully discussed.  2) Since [7] is directly relevant to the proposed approach, it would be more convicting to show the experimental comparison with [7].  3) The technique in the proposed approach seems not restricted to fine-grained recognition. It would be interesting to evaluate the approach on standard generic image few-shot benchmark such as miniImageNet.  4) How is the performance if we do not use a pre-trained GAN generator but train the generator also in an end-to-end manner?  5) How is the performance with respect to the number of generated examples?  6) Why does the proposed approach work for few-shot learning? It looks like that the GAN image is similar to the original real image. Hence, their combination does not introduce diverse examples beyond the given real images.
