This paper introduces a new RL framework that considers the time of taking action. The relationship between the new method and classical MDP is also specified in the paper. Based on the new framework, the authors propose a new actor-critic algorithm. The idea of this paper is interesting, and the paper is overall well written. My main concern is that the definition of the real-time RL problem seems to be inconsistent with the motivation of the paper. I understand the authors want to take the time of the action into consideration, but the definition of real-time RL, we cannot see this accurately.
