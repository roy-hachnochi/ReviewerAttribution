Summary: In this work, the authors propose a modular pipeline, reminiscent of traditional control architectures in robotics, in which a map is updated online, a state-belief distribution is maintained over the map through sequential filtering, and a policy is conditioned on this belief. This architecture is demonstrated on a vision-and-language navigation task, although in principle could apply to other spatial tasks as well.  Originality: Neither map->estimate->control pipelines nor end-to-end differentiable Bayesian filtering are new, as the authors note, but this application is a novel and promising avenue for this sort of task. In particular, conditioning a reactive policy on the Bayesian state estimate has the potential to avoid overfitting, since its input has been abstracted away from the observations. The performance results in the paper are poor in the absolute sense, but do seem to show less overfitting. The action space of the agent is also novel, although it requires significant domain and task knowledge in the form of the structure of the navigation graph.  Quality: The technical contribution is sound. The results fall significantly below state-of-the-art algorithms. Perhaps performance could be increased by techniques such as reinforcement learning and data augmentation, as in the state-of-the-art approaches, although this is not clear.  Clarity: The paper is well-written and organized. The video attachment is helpful for understanding.  Significance: With such low performance results, it is not clear that this work directly advances the field in this area, despite its novelty.
