The paper presents an interesting approach that allows signatures to be used as a layer anywhere within a neural network. The development of the method is well justified by both logical and theoretical argument and is technically sound. Simple as is, the proposed framework has revised the traditional feature transformation based Signature usage, and enriched the body of NN research.   Moreover, the discussion about inverting signatures and generative model provides further insights.
