Originality:  This paper proposes a method to use the signature transform as a layer of neural networks. If this is the first work which successfully integrates the signature transform into deep learning, the novelty is high.  The previous studies and the motivation of the work are well introduced.  Quality:  The way the signature transform is integrated into neural networks technically sounds.   This seems to be an early work and the experiments are not very extensive. It is basically like "this works". Therefore, it is not very clear if the proposed method is meaningfully better in the real world applications. It would be great to have better explanations on what types of problems can be solved better with the proposed method than existing ones, and it is confirmed by experiments (i.e., more things like Figure 6 and Table 1).   Clarity:  The writing looks good to me. The experimental section is too brief and it could be improved. The paper needs to have conclusions.  It was not clear how the sigmas in both equations in Section 6 relate each other.  Significance:  I think this is important work. If the signature transformation can be used as a layer and it has unique and important characteristics which are not trivial to represent by other means, the significance of the work is large.
