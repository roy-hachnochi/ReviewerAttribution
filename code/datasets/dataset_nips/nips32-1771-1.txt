- Originality To the best of my knowledge, this is a novel work. The representational power of neural ODE models has not been studied much in the field.   Although the negative examples and proof techniques are standard results in point-set topology and metric spaces, the appropriate application makes the idea very interesting. The related works section seems adequate.   - Quality The work is technically sound, with both cleanly written proofs and comprehensive empirical analysis.   - Clarity The work is clear, concise, and coherent.   - Significance See part 1 of the review.
