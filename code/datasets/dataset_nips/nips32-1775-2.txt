Overall, the paper is fine: setting, proposed approaches, theoretical analysis, and clarity. Still it may be improved in few ways.  The main improvement would regard the motivation of the paper. Typically  * the paper should give insight on why the best assortment selection with current assumption wrt. the reward distribution is different from the best assumption with cascading click model, or position-based click models; * the paper claims frugality of the proposed approach wrt. computation time (compared to UCB based approaches). That claim could be enforced by providing the computation time measured in experiments.  It would also be enforced by a theoretical analysis of computation time. * current experiments are on simulated data (derived from real-world data). Experiments on real-world data with assortments would be more convincing.  It's also unusual to have bibliographic citations linking to arXiv version of each paper without reference to the conference/journal where the paper was accepted. To name one, paper [39] has been accepted at UAI'16.    ____________________________ POST REBUTTAL --- I thank the authors for their thorough answer.   I agree with the authors regarding the originality and the soundness of assortment optimization as opposed to cascading/position-based model (let's denote them "independent optimization models") for multiple recommendation setting. Still, I think THE PAPER should include as much insights as possible to demonstrate the potentiality of assortment optimization: * some simple examples where assortment and independent optimization are selecting two different assortments (with substituable items, obviously), * some real-world datasets/analysis demonstrating the benefit of such modelization, * an empirical comparison to state of the art regarding independent optimization models.   Such comparaison is even more required given that several papers with independent modelization were published in Machine Learning avenues.  By the way, I would prefer the semi-synthetic data to be derived from real-world datasets with assortment properties. There are publicly available "baskets" datasets, I wonder if they may provide the required starting data.  Finally, I acknowledge that appart from paper [39], arXiv citations concern papers which are still unpublished. Having five of them cited remains surprising.
