The paper proposes an optimization framework for ultrametric fitting in the context of hierarchical clustering.  The main idea of the paper is to use a min-max operator directly in a cost function defined for a given edge-weighted graph in order to find the optimal ultrametric for a dissimilarity graph. Two different ultrametric related cost functions and two different regularizations are used. Experimental evaluations on superpixel adjacency graphs from the datasets of the LIBSVM webpage illustrate the performance of this hierarchical clustering approach compared to state-of-the-art unsupervised Ward method and semi-supervised SVM.  Strengths:  - This paper address an interesting problem of hierarchical cluster analysis by using an optimizations framework for ultrametric fitting.  - The usage of the min-max operator in order to solve the optimization problem of finding a best ultrametric has not been studied so far.  - Paper is overall well written with a good structure. However, some details should be clarified (see below). - The authors make good use of already existing cost functions for evaluating an ultrametric for their purposes. - The experimental part gives a good overview of the comparison to the state-of-the-art agglomerative methods.  Weaknesses: 1.) l Line 8,56,70,93,: Usage of the word equivalent. I would suggest a more cautious usage of this word. Especially, if the equivalence is not verified.  2.) A differentiation between the ultrametric d and the ultrametric u would make their different usages clearer.  3.) Line 186 ff. : A usage of the subdominant ultrametric for the cluster-size regularization, would make the algorithms part more consistent with the following considerations in this paper.   4) The paper is not sufficiently clear in some aspects (see below for a list of questions)  Overall, I have the impressions the the weaknesses could be fixed until the final paper submission.
