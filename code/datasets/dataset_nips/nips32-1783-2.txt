Originality: For the aforementioned contributions, I believe this work provides a creative, unique approach to this problem.  Quality: I believe this paper to be technically sound, a complete work that presents interesting approaches for hierarchical clustering.  Clarity: The paper is written well and clearly explains the approach. But there were a some details that I thought could have been made clearer in both the presentation and in the experiments. Unless I’ve missed something, I think that it would be good to more clearly state the process (and its complexity) of going from the ultrametric fit to data to a dendrogram. I believe this can be done using the LCA function applied to all pairs of points / the Jacobian of \phi. If there is no room in the body of the paper, I believe it could be included in the supplementary material. I also think the experiments could better show the effectiveness of the approach constructing high quality hierarchical clusterings. I believe a more clear experiment would compare their optimization of Dasgupta’s cost to alternative approaches to illustrate which approaches find clusterings with lower costs.   Significance: I believe the work introduces novel methodology and a creative approach in a relatively unexplored space of gradient-based methods for hierarchical clustering. The methodology is clearly expressed. However, I do feel that the experiments of the paper are a bit weak and could be made stronger as mentioned in the clarity section. The work compares both hierarchical clustering objectives and optimization methods, but it would be stronger if the experiments compared the proposed method to alternative approaches that also optimize the Dasgupta cost function. I also think the paper would benefit from a lengthier discussion of the merits of gradient-based approaches for ultrametric fitting (and perhaps further experiments to support this). The paper does not give theoretical results.
