The authors propose a setting where agents receive a sample (e.g. a research idea), and they can transform samples into one of multiple signals (e.g. a conference). The ability to convert certain samples into signals is given by a bipartite graph. There are two types of agents, “good” and “bad”, which both try to appear as being good, while the goal for the paper is to come up with an approach (requiring as few samples as possible) to differentiate between the two. The authors show that the sample complexity to differentiate between good and bad is mild and dependent on the directed total variational distance (d_DTV) between the good and bad distributions. On the other hand, it’s NP-hard to distinguish if the d_DTV is close to, or identical to, 0. Finally, the authors show that in a special case where signals are partially ordered, the sample complexity goes down and the hardness result disappears.  The paper proposed a nice model to study learning from strategically manipulated samples. The results in this model are exciting, and point at interesting potential follow-ups.  After author response: Since I had raised no serious concerns, the authors feedback did not need to address my comments, hence my review and score remains the same.
