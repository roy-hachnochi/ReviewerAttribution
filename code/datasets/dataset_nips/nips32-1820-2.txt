Originality: The idea for applying neural network with an attention mechanism to approximate DPP probability seems to be new but the novelty of the idea seems to be limited as it just applies existing techniques to a new scenario without a novel adaptation to it. The theoretical justification in the main paper is more novel.  Quality: The technique used in this paper seems to be valid and the objective function is validated theoretically in a sense.  The 3 experiments can show that the DPP net gives a reasonable approximations to true DPP.  Clarity: This paper is clearly written and relatively easy to follow. However, it will be very helpful to provide a slightly more detailed review of DPP in the appendix for non-expert readers.  Significance: The key contribution of DPP net is to reduce the computational time for DPP to linear (excluding the training time). This seems to be valuable for practitioners that allows them to use DPP for real, large data set. This can also act as a component for downstream tasks. My main criticism is the novelty.
