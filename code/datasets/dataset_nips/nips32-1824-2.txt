This is a very strong contribution. In terms of organization, I would have moved all the numerical values learned (W_1, B_1, u_1, â€¦) and many of the equations describing the systems the algorithm was evaluated on into the appendix, and spent more of the main paper describing more of the systems implications of the algorithm. In particular, Appendix B Table 1 and some commentary about how that cost differs from other approaches (LQR?) would be more immediately useful to the reader. I would also have loved to see validation of the approach on a real physical system with real-world complexity to help understand how this approach may scale. More discussion of the limitation of the approach would also strengthen the paper. None of these issues are critical. In general, making it possible to certify non-linear controllers is a huge problem, and new approaches to this issue are of general interest to the community. POST-REBUTTAL: thank you to the authors for their feedback. I had hoped for a slightly stronger statement than 'Yes, we *can* add evaluation of the control designs in physical wheeled robots.', but this doesn't change my overall assessment. Increasing my confidence level based on peer reviews.
