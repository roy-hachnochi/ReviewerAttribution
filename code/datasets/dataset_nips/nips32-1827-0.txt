The paper gives an algorithm for facility location that uses O(n log n) update time and has O(n) total recourse. It also gives an algorithm for k-means and k-median that uses \tilde{O}(n+k^2) update time, but the authors do not analyze the recourse for this algorithm; I believe the recourse is O(kn). The space used by all algorithms is O(n). By comparison, the naive algorithm for facility location uses O(n^2) update time and O(n^2) total recourse while the naive algorithm for clustering uses O(n polylog n) update time and O(kn) recourse, since a reclustering (such as by restarting an instance of the Meyerson online facility algorithm) can be computed upon every update when all the points are stored. The paper also performs empirical evaluations for their algorithm in comparison to Meyerson's online facility location algorithm.   The facility location algorithm works by adding all new points as facilities for a consecutive number of steps, and then performing a maintenance step of finding a good subset of facilities among all points. When a point is deleted, the algorithm first considers whether the deleted point was a facility and if so, it opens a facility at the closest point.  While the facility location algorithm is elegant, I'm not sure that the k-means and k-median algorithms obtain an advantage over the naive algorithms in space, update time, or recourse. I also think the discussion surrounding the empirical evaluations are insufficient or confusing. For example, I'm not sure why the blue line appears in the legend for Figures 2b, 2e, and 2h. Thus I think the paper can become a nice contribution but do not recommend acceptance in its current form.  In particular, it is unclear to me whether it makes sense to run facility location algorithms on data sets considered: -- What does facility cost of 0.5 mean for Twitter/USCensus?  -- There is no description of what the CoverType dataset actually is.
