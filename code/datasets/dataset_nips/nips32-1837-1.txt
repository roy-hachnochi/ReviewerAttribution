This paper considers challenging settings for ODT problems with noisy outcomes. The authors consider several new settings such as unknown number of hypotheses and persistent noisy models. The authors design new adaptive and non-adaptive algorithms to achieve (nearly) best possible approximation ratio.  I have to say that I don't work on approximate algorithms. The results look interesting to me, but I am not at a good position to judge the novelty.
