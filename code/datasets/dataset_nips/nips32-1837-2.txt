I comment here on the long version of the paper, which is actually easier to read than the short version.  Title: it oversells the scope of the results, since the only type of "noisy" outcomes * handled thoroughly in the paper are erasures with equal probability to be +/-.  Section 3:  - the proof of Lemma 3.4 shows that G_E(e*) > S/4, but the statement of of Lemma 3.4 claims that G_E(e*) > S/2. - the proof of Lemma 3.5 states that y \noin \cup T_{b,x}(e) f_{b,x}(E): I guess that f_{b,x}(E) should not be there.  Section 4: - The equivalence between both algorithms is interesting, but it basically boils down in showing that the way the * entries are treated is the same for both instances. It would be good to clearly identify the alternative algorithm ODTN_h in Section 4.1 (only ODTN_r is actually introduced in Section 4).  Section 5: - in Proposition 2, how do you get that the number of hypotheses in X' is at most 2Cm^\alpha and not 4Cm^\alpha, since |T^{+}(e) \cup T^{-}(e)| \leq 2 \max{ |T^{+}(e)|, |T^{-}(e)| } \leq 2Cm^\alpha ?  REVISION: Comment on Section 7 deleted after authors' feedback, which clarified my question, indeed r = 245 and h = 45 are correct. Other comments remain unchanged.
