Originality: This work is based on the MDR estimator for OPE. By modifying MDR and changing the way of choosing the parameters, the proposed estimators can simultaneously meet all the desired properties defined in the paper (i.e., efficiency, stability, and boundedness.). It is a straightforward and effecient idea, although a bit incremental.  Quality: The technical points claimed in this paper make sense, also with theoretical guaranttees. However, I have a few questions about the experimental settings. 1) In the CB/RL experiments why do the authors choose those evaluation/behavoiur policies rather than the others? Will different choices lead to different results/conclusions? 2) From the tables in both CB/RL experiments, I did not see some obvious difference between DR and REG/EMP, particularly in Table 3, 4 & 7. Otherwise, how can we judge that the minor differences between them come from the algorithms but not other factors (e.g., the choice of behaviour policies, measurement error, or even variance)? 3) In all the tables, what are the variances of all the approaches in terms of RMSE, which I think is a good indicator as well.  Clarity: Generally the paper is organized in a clear manner and is well written, but at times there exist some notational confusion and unclear statements. For example, the author did not explain what MDR stands for in the paper although providing the reference.  On Line 60, the authors claim that "all of models are wrong to some extent" but did not say why and in which extent, etc.   Significance: Although the proposed method has a reasonble guaranttee in theory, I am still in doubt how to use it in real-world RL applications. Because what I saw is that they used the linear/logistic function in all the experiments, which makes no sense in many RL problems, even in many RL simulations.
