We found that the paper presents interesting results and it is well written. We are not expert in this topic. However, we found a couple of issues in the paper.  - In the text, it is written “Koopman”. It should be Koopmanns.  - The authors often emphasize on a particular finding in the paper, which is that the connection between Lawler’s QAP and Koopman-Beckmann’s QAP. It turns out that the connections between the two formulations are straightforward and well known in the literature. See for example: RE Burkard, E Cela, PM Pardalos, LS Pitsoulis, The quadratic assignment problem. Handbook of combinatorial optimization, pp 1713-1809, 1998  - in [42], the authors proposed a generalization of the graph matching, where the inner-product of data is replaced by a general function. This is pretty related to the use of kernels. While [42] lacks the theoretical foundations that allows the RKHS in the submitted paper, the authors of the latter should well explain the differences with [42].  - Kernels to measure similarities between edges, or between nodes, have been previously investigated in the literature. Moreover, the path-following strategy used for convex-concave relaxations is also not new. We think that the authors need to emphasize on the contributions of this work.   ================================= We thank the authors for the rebuttal, which responded to all our concerns. We have updated our review correspondingly.
