- The authors present a kernelized version of the PATH algorithm for network alignment, utilizing a novel EnFW algorithm to approximately solve successive Frank-Wolfe iterations. This allows for dramatic algorithmic speed-up versus the standard Hungarian algorithm approach to F-W.    - $K$ in (3) only scales quadruply with respect to $n$ in the dense graph setting. In sparse settings, if the max degree is polylog(n), then up to a polylog factor, $K$ only has $n^2$ nonzero elements and can be efficiently computed and stored.  In the dense setting, the gain from kernelizing is more substantial.  - The EnFW subroutine is quite an interesting alternative to the Hungarian algorithm; does EnFW have a provable runtime?  Introducing the entropy regularizing term allows for dramatic speed-ups; does it affect performance versus an exact solution to (14) being computed at each step?  There are a number of variants of F-W that scale to large problems (see, for example,  Ding, L., & Udell, M. (2018). Frank-Wolfe Style Algorithms for Large Scale Optimization. In Large-Scale and Distributed Optimization (pp. 215-245). ).  It would be interesting to see EnFW compared (runtime-wise) to these existing approximate F-W solvers.  - On page 5, you claim: We give an explicit formula for computing the stepsize s, instead of making a linear search on [0, 1] for optimizing $F_{\alpha} (X + s(Y âˆ’ X ))$.  In classic F-W applied to GM, $J_\alpha$ is a quadratic function that can also be exactly optimized.  - For the simulation and image experiments, you compare KerGM to 5 algorithms, the most recent of which is from 2012.  There have been a large number of GM algorithms in the recent literature that scale to very large graphs (see, for example,  Zhang, S., & Tong, H. (2016, August). Final: Fast attributed network alignment. In Proceedings of the 22nd ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (pp. 1345-1354). ACM.  and  Heimann, M., Shen, H., Safavi, T., & Koutra, D. (2018, October). Regal: Representation learning-based graph alignment. In Proceedings of the 27th ACM International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management (pp. 117-126). ACM. ).   Including comparisons to more recent approaches would be helpful for gauging the efficacy of your current algorithm.  The experiments on the PPI networks are more compelling for including more recent comparisons.  - In the synthetic datasets experiment, what are the outlier nodes?  - Line 140 in the appendix:  Why is the final condition not $G_T^*\leq \frac{2\Delta_0}{T+1}$?  Where does the $\sqrt{\cdot}$ come from?  This would have a small impact on the statement of Theorem 1.
