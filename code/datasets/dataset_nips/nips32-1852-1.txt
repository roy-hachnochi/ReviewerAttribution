Overall, I appreciated this paper very much. It addresses the problem of the use and misuse of transfer learning for medical applications and is therefore of high practical value. It is very clearly written and should be accessible to most attendants of NeurIPS.   Some minor comments:   - Page 2, line 38: microaneurysms appear as small red dots (not yellow). The yellow lesions (which may or may not be roundish) correspond to exudates.  - Page 5, line 162: the authors certainly mean Figure 3 (even though Figure 8 can be seen as a confirmation).  - Figures 2 and 3: What I found surprising is that the average CCA similarity across layers of the fully trained models is lower than the CCA similarity on the first layer before training, even for random initialization. Probably I missed something, but maybe the authors would like to comment on this, because others might find this intriguing as well.  - Page 7, lines 197-199: I do not fully understand the second statement. I do not see from these two graphs that all larger systematically move less than smaller models. For instance, the different CBR variants show nearly the same value on the right plot for all three scenarios, and on the left plot, I also do not see a clear picture.   ----   Update: I have read the answers by the authors and found this convincing. The paper is going to make a fine contribution to NeurIPS 2019.
