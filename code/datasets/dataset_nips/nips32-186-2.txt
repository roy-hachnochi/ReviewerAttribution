The paper is very well written, however, from my point of view, the generalisation of the study made in [21] to block coordinate approach is quite straightforward.  However, Theorem 2 is a very nice and important result. But it is only a small part of the paper. It is the first time that such a bound is given and it is very useful for the understanding of RED approaches.   Experimental section lake of some computation time comparison (not only with respect to the number of iterations), while block coordinate approach can be faster than a batch approach for some problem when the operator A has very correlated columns.   ** After feedback **  The authors have clearly answer my concerns. For thm 1, I was convinced that  a similar result was in [21], but I was wrong. So I have decided to revise my evaluation.
