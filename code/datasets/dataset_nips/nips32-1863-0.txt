Solid paper with interesting theoretical results. In a high level, the challenge the authors had to solve is: how to achieve or even state learning when there are so many sources of infinities, such as example models and elements in each model's underlying universe? Of course, the paper considers a specific instance of this general question that arises in the context of a restricted version of first-order logic and a particular class of models for the logic. But I found its formulation of the problem elegant and the solution nice. Specifically, I liked the idea of using the fact that formulas cannot distinguish certain non-explicitly named elements and cannot count in a sense more than certain syntactically determined numbers. Also, the use of partial model and random-masking process is quite clever.
