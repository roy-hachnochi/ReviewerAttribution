While the basic ideas explored here are interesting, I have several concerns with this work:  (1) The primary motivation or contributions of the paper are not well articulated. The title and writing at various places suggest "personalized interventions". But, the methods for auditing policies for fairness as well as the evaluation results are centered around scenarios where interventions are conducted in a randomized and controlled (i.e., non-personalized) way. So in what way is the work related to personalized interventions, beyond perhaps, making a case for personalized interventions to achieve fairness?   (2) The focus of much of the main (8-page) paper is on unfairness measures (disparity in TPR and TNR) and how to estimate them, but not on mechanisms to achieve them. This makes me wonder how well suited the paper is to NeurIPS and if this paper would not be a better fit for a conference focussed more on fairness. Because one might argue that, while the ideas are conceptually interesting,  technically the paper does not contribute much.   (3) I think there is an error on line 168 -- it is hard to distinguish between p_{10} and p_{00} rather than p_{10} and p_{11}. Can you check this again?
