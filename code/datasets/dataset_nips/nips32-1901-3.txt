Update: I have read the other reviewers' comments and the author feedback, which has adequately addressed my concerns. My overall score remains unchanged. ============ Originality. Proposition 2 seems to be the main novel observation of this work. Although it is straightforward, it is nice to point out that the monotone treatment response assumption, which is reasonable for 'positive'/beneficial interventions, allows for identification in this case. The insight seems to be present in previous work [32], so extending it to give expressions for TPR/FPR is not particularly original though still useful. The partial identification results are quite novel, though I was not sure of the practicality. How should uncertainty sets for p_10 be chosen? Is there any way to estimate how much the monotone treatment response assumption is violated in practice?  Given the monotone treatment response assumption, many "non-causal" results from previous work can be applied without modification, e.g. [34]. Robust ROC and xROC extends the standard tools to the partial identification case, but it's not clear how useful these notions are/if they provide any additional insight, even in the case study provided. They seem to be too pessimistic and it's hard to interpret in the curves in Figure 2.  Quality. Paper was well written.  Clarity. Writing and results were clear. Figure 2 had too many curves and it was unclear how to interpret.  Significance. It is important to address identifiability issues for 'fairness metrics' in applications involving interventions (and therefore missing data). Empirical verification was somewhat limited, since only 1 dataset was used.
