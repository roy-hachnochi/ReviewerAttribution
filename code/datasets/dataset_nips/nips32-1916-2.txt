The paper considers the problem of characterizing the landscape of empirical risk using the population risk. Particular attention is devoted to the case of a degenerate population risk. Their main theorem proves a close connection between stationary point and local minimizers.  The paper improves on state-of-the-art in the characterization of the above mentioned landscape. Previous work could not explain the situation where the Hessian is degenerate (has zero eigenvalues) near a stationary point. The main assumption in the present paper is that the absolute value of the Hessian's minimal eigenvalue must be bounded away from zero. This includes includes (some) degenerate saddle point and strict local minimizers. It does not include degenerate minima, which is surprising (a drawback).   The presentation of the paper with a separate, clearly written section on the "main result" is good, since the details are rather technical.   In the section "main results",  comments on the parameters eps and eta are missing. Need the conditions hold for any positive eps and eta? I think, you require only existence of eps and eta such that the assumptions are satisfied. In that case, the reader would like to see an intuitive description of the meaning of these parameters in the presented examples of matrix sensing and phase retrieval and an explanation of the proof strategy for obtaining the parameters.   Is there a standard way to compute the parameters eps and eta?
