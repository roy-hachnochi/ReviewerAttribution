This is an interesting and very well written paper. The observation that previous methods (such as extragradient) fail in the stochastic setting for minimax problems is novel and important,. The main algorithm (SVRE) aims to address this failure. My major comment is that the theoretical guarantees given in the paper need strong assumptions, e.g. the assumptions do not hold even for the counter-example provided in section 2.2. Can the authors find a counter-example that satisfies assumption 1 (i..e both L^G and L^D are strongly monotone). Also, can the authors provide some theoretical guarantee for the case where functions are non-convex?
