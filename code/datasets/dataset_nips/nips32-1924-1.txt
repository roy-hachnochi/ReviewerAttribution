+ The problem is well-studied in the DP literature, but the paper still manages to provide a contribution that is novel and has practical relevance. The fact that the algorithm does not need to know the domain is great.  + The algorithmic ideas are fairly natural and has Propose-test-release style flavor.   Q: Can we include sparse-vector to characterize the privacy cost at a more fine-grained level?  - It would be interesting to see a practical/empirical evaluation of the algorithms mentioend, while highlighting the savings in privacy cost, and compare it to existing results in the literature.
