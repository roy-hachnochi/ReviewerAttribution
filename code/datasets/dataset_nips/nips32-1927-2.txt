I think this is a good paper with a clear structure and is nicely written.  However, the paper focuses on stochastic bandits with independent arms, with is an extensively studied realm with abundant results.  Although the authors present a convincing theoretical analysis, there is no significant improvement over previous bounds (as the authors mention, TS for MAB is already minimax optimal).  The generalisation of TS to finite-horizon problems is not novel, and the exploration-exploitation trade-off has also been addressed in previous literature.  This could be the start of an interesting line of work, but I do not think the current version is above the acceptation threshold.
