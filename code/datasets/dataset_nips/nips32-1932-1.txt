This paper presents a novel method to estimate mixture models by matching structure in sample covariates. It is clearly written and easy to understand. The proposed method is quite straightforward, and therefore the originality may not be strong enough. In addition, since the model is very complicated, it might suffer overfitting problems with noise data. Itt is also hard to scale and apply the proposed method to big data using popular cloud computing infrastructure today.
