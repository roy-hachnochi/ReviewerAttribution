a. I like the idea of using two VAEs to model dance at different levels. Generating complex sequence is very challenging. So decomposing generative process into stages makes a lot of sense. b. The proposed dance synthesis model uses autoregressive approach to generate dance sequence, simplifying the sequence generation process. The low level VAE decomposes dance unit into initial pose and movement. The high level VAE models movement sequence, and shares a latent space with the output of music VAE. c. The adversarial losses and reconstruction losses are carefully design to improve the naturalness of generated dance. d. The video demo clearly shows that the proposed model outperforms the baselines. e. Paper organization and presentation are good.
