The paper is well written and answers some interesting theoretical questions at the intersection of non-adaptive group testing and graph learning. The problem, thought connected to structured group testing, seems novel in this particular incarnation. While the algorithms proposed are not especially novel, the authors needed too perform some nuanced analysis, and I particularly appreciate Appendix H that outlines the difficulties.   Overall, this is a strong paper with interesting results. I recommend its acceptance.
