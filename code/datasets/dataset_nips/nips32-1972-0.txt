The introduction and general idea behind the paper is written in a way that is easy to understand and logically structured. There are, though, a few places were clarity could be improved. Most of these are around the plot in Fig. 4 which is often referenced as showcasing particular properties, especially in 3.2. This is in part due to the content and meaning of the figure never being fully and completely being introduced, doing so would be beneficial for a figure which appears so central to the paper.  Another aspect that would have been nice to see is a comparison of the theoretical results with the practical ones, i.e. it would be interesting to see how loose the bound from Theorem 2.1 is in practice, at least for the datasets used.  In the experiments it is mentioned that 1000 runs were performed for every experiment, yet only the average value is reported. While the log scale might make the variance of those values hard to impossible to visualize providing some intuition on the variability in the results would be appreciated.
