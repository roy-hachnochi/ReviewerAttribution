This submission attempts to improve an existing randomized algorithm for estimating the medoid of a set of points using a multi-armed bandit technique by taking advantage of sampling distances using the same reference point. Intuitively, this improved technique makes sense. They show that the assumption that looking at the difference of their random variables improves concentration (Fig 4). Through both theoretical guarantees (The 2.1) and experiments they show the benefits of this sampling technique paired with a suitable multi-armed bandit algorithm.  While the idea of correlated sampling is obviously nothing new, this technique has not yet been applied to the medoid problem.   The mathematical content is of a relatively high quality. The precision of writing leaves something to be desired. In a number of places there are grammatical errors and the phrasing is somewhat sloppy. This is a minor detail, but giving the manuscript to a proofreader proficient in technical writing would benefit this work.  This algorithm is one that is likely to be used in practice for estimating the medoid of a dataset when the cost of an exact solution (O(n^2)) is too expensive. However, I am not fully qualified to judge how often such a situation arises, or the importance of the problem of computing the medoid of a dataset. Including references or specific examples in which this computation is needed would go a long way in motivating the importance of the problem. The first paragraph of the paper simply fails to do so, and lacks any references.
