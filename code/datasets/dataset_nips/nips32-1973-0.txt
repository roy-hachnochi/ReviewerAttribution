Pros.  + paper is clearly written and easy to follow  + contributions are clearly stated and sufficient literature review is provided  + result seem to be novel and significant as they give important insight about the impossibility of improving SGD types method for the strongly convex case  + the analysis appears to be novel as well, which might have some usage in the construction of other lower bound under different assumptions and frameworks.  Cons.  - the analysis seems to be too narrow and cover a small subset of algorithms  ---  I have read the authors feedback.
