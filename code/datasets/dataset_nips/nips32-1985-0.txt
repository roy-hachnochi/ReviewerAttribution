The addressed problem (sketching) is interesting and the authors manage to obtain new (asymptotic) theoretical results for various methods. These can help analyzing their trade-offs between computational requirements and different statistical efficiency measures. The paper is well-written and the results are presented in a simple, understandable way. The proofs, located in the supplementary material, are nicely structured and seem correct. Several widespread sketching methods are studied and the presented simulation results support the theoretical claims of the paper. Drawbacks of the paper are that it only considers the basic OLS and the results are only asymptotic. These reduce the significance of the results. For example, studying some more advanced versions of LS, such as regularized LS (ridge regression) or total least-squares (TLS), would have improved the importance of the work. Also a finite-time analysis would be more convincing. Nevertheless, the asymptotic results provide nice details in understanding the behavior of various sketching methods.
