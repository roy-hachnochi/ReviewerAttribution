## Originality ## This paper studies the asymptotic behavior of sketching methods for the least square problem. The difference between this work and previous works is relatively obvious.  ## Quality ## The paper is technically sound. The results of the theorems make sense and each of the theorems is fully explained. However, I did not carefully check the proof of the theorems.  ## Clarity ## The paper is well written, the organization is very clear, and the notations are concise and accurate.
