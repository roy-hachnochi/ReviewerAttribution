Detailed remarks  Concerning theorem 1, the bound you prove is related to theorem 4.3 of (Mohar, B. (1989). Isoperimetric numbers of graphs. Journal of combinatorial theory) where a tighter upper bound is proved for laplacian matrix. It would be great to discuss whether your bound is tight in the general case of signed Laplacian matrices knowing that this one is (up to what I read) is tight for the Laplacian one. In particular it would be great to recall what you refer to as the 'Cheeger inequality' (which I believe concerns the first smallest eigenvalue) and the known result for the 2nd eigenvalue of the Laplacian in the paper previously cited  Concerning the derivation of theorem 2, the result of theorem 1 appears naturally as the ingredient to bound the 3rd term which is the main originality of the proof. As a consequence, I think it would improve the readability of the paper to announce the use of Th1 earlier in the paper since I understood the logic of your sections only at my second read of the paper.  Finally it would have been great to provide a numerical illustration of your result in theorem 2 by simulating graphs and showing whether the bound of theorem 2 indicating when the graph is correctly recovered by the SDP. This could have improved the paper even if it is not mandatory for the sake of the presentation.  Minor remarks The notation change from V to \textit{V} (footnote (3)) is a bit weird since it is very hard to distinguish.
