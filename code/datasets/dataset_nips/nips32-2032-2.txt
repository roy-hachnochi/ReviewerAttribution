Originality - I think the primary originality of the paper is limited to the engineering set-up specific to obtaining the dataset. It appears quite comprehensive and addresses a number of different geometric patterns that could prove to be a challenge for ultrasound-based image reconstruction.  The biomimetic portion of the network also comes across as novel. Although, the specific impact of that portion of the network architecture is not clear.  The rest of the paper applies standard supervised learning techniques to a labeled dataset and is not novel.  Quality: This is a reasonably well written paper and attempts to solve a real-world problem. However, since the theme of the paper is a bat-inspired network, the paper fails to address the importance of the biomimetic part of the design. Figure 6 appears to perform ablation studies to judge the importance of the spectral and temporal and spectral cues. The authors claim that the comparison with SAE provides justification for the use of the biomimetic path. However, it would have been a more compelling argument if the performance of Bat-G was reported with the biomimetic connection removed.   Clarity: the paper is well motivated and the experimental set-up is clearly described. The paper does a relatively poorer job of explaining the choice of baselines that were studied - e.g., why SAE, is it SotA on ultrasound image reconstruction? In the absence of such explanations, it is hard to judge the impact of the paper.  Significance: I think the core significance of the paper comes from the large ultrasound dataset. The significance of the methods described in the paper is less clear.   Post-rebuttal comments: I have increased my score based on the rebuttal.
