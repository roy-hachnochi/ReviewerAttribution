Originality; the work sheds new light on CTBN models and how to learn them from data in the case when big data has to be managed. Furthermore, the formulation of the structural learning algorithm for complete and incomplete data is a relevant step to improve effectiveness of CTBNs. Quality; the submission is formal and sound. However, I have the following concerns: Pag. 2; formula (1), I would ask to explain why the likelihood misses the part related to permanence in any given state, Pag. 3; I read "The integral ca ..." which one ? I suggest it is better to clarify this point, even if I know it. Pag. 5; the assumption about the alpha>>1 is quite strong and I would kindly ask to better motivate, investigate and analyze its' impact on solutions. I think this could strongly limit the application of the proposed approach in case where you have few observations w.r.t the number of variables. I found some minor typos.. I also would like to know something about inference on the CTBN once you have learnt it from data, i.e. how are you computing filtering, smoothing, ...? Clarity; the paper is in general quite clear, even if some more details and examples to introduce the idea of mixtures could have helped the reader to better understand the proposed approach. Significance; the contribution, in my humble opinion, is relevant with specific reference to the research area of CTBNs. Furthermore, it can help improve results achieved in relevant application domains as finance, medicine and biology.
