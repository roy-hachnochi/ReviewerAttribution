This paper studies the problem of privacy-preserving text classification. More specifically, the authors develop a SMC based method for logistic regression and AdaBoost models. Experiments on a real dataset validate the performance of the proposed method. However, the current paper has some issues need to be addressed: 1.The proposed method can only protect the privacy at the inference procedure. To achieve this goal, some other privacy-preserving frameworks, such as differential privacy (DP), can also be used. For example, DP can directly add some small noise to protect the privacy at the inference procedure, which is very simple and efficient. In this sense, the contribution of the current paper is not very clear. 2.The proposed method can only be applied to some very specific models, like uni/bi gram logistic regression and AdaBoost models, which are not the state-of-the art models in both theory and practice for text classification. As a result, the proposed method may not have too much impact. 3.In experiments, there is no baseline result, i.e., the result for non-private method. And the results in terms of accuracy and time seem to be not good.    --- After reading the author response, I agree that the proposed SMC framework is a contribution to the secure ML community, and I would like to increase my score.
