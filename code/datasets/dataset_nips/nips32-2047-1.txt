The secret sharing method has been used a lot in multi-party computation. Yucel Saygin wrote several papers on secure clustering using secret sharing. In contrast, the authors force their computations to remain on a ring and could thus map to the 2 adic ring. The mapping and equations are straightforward and not surprising. But the contribution is nice and could stimulate future research. Writing is sound and clear.
