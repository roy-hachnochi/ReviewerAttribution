Summary: this paper investigates the primal-dual link between f-GANs and Wasserstein autoencoders (WAEs).  Originality: this paper provides many theoretical results concerning generative methods. Even though I am not very familiar with the theory of optimal transport, the proposed content seems novel, in particular in the field of GANs and autoencoders. A generalization bound for these methods is also provided, as a complete novelty.  Quality: I was not able to check all the proofs but the paper seems technically sound. I wonder in which sens Theorem 13 is a generalization bound.  Clarity: Overall, the paper is not very easy to read. The theoretical results are claimed without clear explanations. Why are the results important and useful? As minor remark, it is unclear how the rhs of (2) depends on X and Z.  Significance: this analysis that is conducted by this paper is useful to understand the good and similar performances of f-GANs and WAEs.  Rebuttal: I have read the authors' response and I thank them for clarifying their work.
