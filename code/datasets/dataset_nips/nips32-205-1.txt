Summary: It is the purpose of this article to establish links between the two most popular generative models nowadays, namely GANs and (W)AEs. In Theorem 8, an (in)equality linking both criteria is stated, tending to explain the performance similarities between the models. An introduced f-WAE model is also thoroughly analyzed, linked to an f-divergence or a Wasserstein distance depending on the weighting operated. Finally, Authors use findings of Theorem 8 to derive generalization bounds on WAEs.   Major Comments: - The paper is well written, related works are correctly discussed and notions well introduced, making the submission self-contained although quite dense. - The established results are strong and profound, making them of particular interest on such a hot topic as generative models. The fact that Theorem 8 can be viewed as a generalization of Lemma 4 is particularly striking, and attest of the soundness of the approach. - Generalization bounds derivations are an attractive "application" of the previously derived equivalence, endorsing the utility of a unifying framework. - Authors mentioned the "contrasting abilities" of GANs and WAEs, can the derived equivalence be used to design a "best of the two world" training strategy, attaining high performances while avoiding instability?   Minor Comments: - l. 116: a precision on the reference (Lemma/Theorem number in [14]) may be interesting - l. 215: the same objective*s* - l. 242: it was show *that* - l. 245: a prac*ti*tioner   Overall Evaluation: The theoretical results seem profound and their derivations are well conducted, although I may lack knowledge on the related works to fully asses it. It is a good submission.
