The paper is sufficiently original for presentation at NeurIPS. It draws very interesting conclusions from a very relevant duality based approach to the analysis of GAN's.   The analysis is technically sound and reading through the proofs gave me the impression that they are correct.   The clarity of the exposition is of a sufficiently high level.   The results are very significant and fill a gap in the current knowledge about GANs and similar generative approaches. It will help the community reaching a better understanding of this type of techniques and their relationships.
