Their algorithm is clearly explained. It is easy to implement and have good theoretical convergence properties. As the authors have pointed out, a closely related (but not identical) approach is already used in literature for an optimisation problem however its use in sampling is novel. I find this paper a high quality work which potentially can have some impact both in terms of the practical applications of the proposed sampler as well as the way the convergence analysis is carried out.
