This paper targets modeling the temporal dynamics in high-dimension marked event sequences without any given causal network of markers. This is a difficult problem and rarely studies in previous studies. The authors propose a seminal adversarial imitation learning framework which consists of a generator model that takes a bottom-up view to imitate the generation process of event sequences and an interpretable and efficient random walk based sampling approach to generate the next event. The methods are novel and have good intuition.   The paper is well written and easy to follow. One suggestion from me is not to put too many things in a single section ``Introduction and Related Works''.   The experiments are well conducted and analyzed. Some conclusions are demonstrated.    But I have some concerns about experiments part. Check ``improvements'' part for details.
