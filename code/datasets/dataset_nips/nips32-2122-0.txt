-Did you run any experiments exploring the efficiency of the proposed fitting procedure?  For a known model, how many samples are needed to reliably estimate the up/down tail dependence parameters?  How does this vary with the strength of the dependence parameters (both rho and u/v)? -Can you provide more detail on the proposed fitting procedure.  How many probability levels do you consider in the quantile regression?  After estimating the parameters of y1, you invert g() to draw samples of z1, which are then used to estimate the parameters of y2, etc... It seems that the estimation errors will compound, making the estimate of the parameters of yn incredible noisy. Is it possible to remove some of the estimation error by proceeding along a different variable ordering? -Please define/address the constant A in eqn 2/3. -Why are u and v required to be greater than 1 in eqn 3? -How are the ideal number of violations in table 1 calculated?
