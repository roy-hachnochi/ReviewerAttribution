The paper proposes a novel way to model correlations separately from tail dependence. The model comes in two flavors: lower-triangular model (an extension of the Gaussian vector factorization case) and one-factor tail dependence model. The authors demonstrate an algorithm to learn model parameters, and show through simulations its flexibility to model tail dependence and, combined with GARCH-type models, to forecast the conditional distribution of multiple asset returns.  Originality I believe this is a novel approach to model tail dependency. Existing approaches such as the copula approach and elliptical distributions are compared.  Quality The proposed model lacks theoretical analysis, e.g. its consistency properties but simulations are provided to ground the method. Note also that the model comes with great flexibility to model tail dependency but at the same time allows more degrees of freedom to overfit. I would be interested in a way to cope with this problem.   Clarity The paper is quite well-written, symbols are clearly defined, and the algorithm is clearly specified.  Significance This paper proposes a new way to address an important problem of tail dependence model with some evidence of method soundness
