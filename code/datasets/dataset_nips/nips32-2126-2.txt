This paper improves upon existing approaches to the principle component projection problem in an interesting way. The approach builds upon existing approaches by using more sophisticated techniques for matrix sign approximation, and for solving the resulting subproblem that arises.  As a reviewer I'm knowledgable on SVRG and variants rather than the PCP problem, so I can't comment much on the novelty of the innovations specific to PCP. The application of SVRG here is interesting however. I'm not aware of previous applications of SVRG to asymmetric matrix solves as done here. They use a weighted sampling variant to get tighter bounds, which is interesting. Weighting sampling doesn't see much practical use as the sampling weights can be hard to determine, however for matrix solves there is a clear choice as used here.  The experiments look well executed, however the focus on a single synthetic task is a definite weakness of the paper, it would be nice to see a real-world application.  The paper is well written, although very dense. I think the description of the results is presented with sufficient formality. I don't have too many comments in that regard.  In terms of significance this seems like a solid improvement in the research area.  Smaller notes:  Abstract: “had superlinear running times” should be sub-linear? I'm unsure.  “directly applied to problem” should be “directly applied to this problem”  “PCP and PCR to solving following “ should be “PCP and PCR to solving the following”   “This is stated in formal in the” should be “This is stated formally in the”  “compared with ones “ should be “compared with the ones “
