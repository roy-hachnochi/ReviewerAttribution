Personally, I'm not an expert in the topic covered in this paper, so my review should probably be downweighed. Having said that, the theoretical contributions seem weak. The conditions in Lemma 2.3 are not discussed and so the implementation of the echo noise mechanism in (3) may be unclear in practice. Furthermore, there is also no discussion on why we can restrict S(x) to be diagonal. One of the claims the authors make is that prior assumptions on Gaussianity allow for analytical tractability. By assuming that S(x) is diagonal, aren't the authors also making assumptions for analytical tractability to ensure that the mutual information can be computed in closed-form?  The relation to rate-distortion theory in classical information theory is also very weak. In particular, where is the distortion measure?   The claim that Echo has "approximately the same wall time" as VAEs should be substantiated with evidence. Currently, this claim is weak.   In general, this paper is not very convincing.
