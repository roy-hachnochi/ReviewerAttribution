This paper proposes a novel and unified model for individualized learning, partial ranking, and abnormal detection, which simultaneously solves important problems in personalized learning.  In general, it is well-written with a good organization and easy to follow.  I think this work could benefit our community in its style as it blends intuitions with solid mathematical machinery. This is what I hope to see most in the application papers. As I have mentioned in the contribution part, I particularly enjoy the optimization rules induced by the split-LBI method, which provides a dynamic way to learn and select the correct model.
