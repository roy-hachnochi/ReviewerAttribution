The formulation of annotatorsâ€™ ranking decision, i.e. integrating personalized preference, abnormal deviations, common score, and random noise simultaneously from a probabilistic view, is well-designed and novel. The proposed model can give user-specific partial ranking prediction and abnormal user detection simultaneously, which is an early trail in the direction. It is also pleased to see that iSplitLBI achieves reasonable performance in discovering incomparable pairs.  The proposed model unites simplicity and effectiveness, which makes it possible to be widely adopted for future work.
