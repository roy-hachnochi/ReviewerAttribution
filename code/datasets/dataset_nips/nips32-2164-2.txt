# Originality The task is new, though there are related works on autonomous reconstruction of 3D scenes or next-best-view selection for object pose estimation. There is a lack of thorough discussion on these related tasks and the special challenge in the setting of 3D human pose reconstruction, as well as how the special challenge is solved in this work.    # Quality  It is a solid in general. The proposed approach is technically sound. The experiments and baselines are well designed and sufficiently demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.   One concern is that the reward is based on visibility of body joints in the selected views, and the authors claim that no annotation is needed for training. The question is how to know the true visibility if there is no annotation?  # Clarity The idea and methodology are clearly presented. The paper is well organized and easy to follow.    # Significance This is a new task. My main concern is if this task is useful in practice. For the multi-view setting, I was not able to imagine why not using all views. For the active observer setting, the assumption that human is static is impractical. Pose estimation is usually for motion capture where people are moving.
