Originality: the approach in the paper is novel and one that I haven't seen before. It provides an end-to-end training platform. I see it as essentially modeling a neural network to learn the residual dynamics that gets thrown away under the STE model.   Quality: The paper is thorough. It motivates the problem well, does a good job of explaining its approach and lays out experiments on a number of networks and baselines.  Clarity: The paper is clear in it's explanation of the problem, its approach and the results.   Significance: Limited - since results are shown only on CIFAR benchmarks. It would be interesting to see results on Imagenet.   Post-response comment: Thanks to the authors for pointing out their benchmark on ImageNet which I had overlooked during the original review. I have improved my score to 8.
