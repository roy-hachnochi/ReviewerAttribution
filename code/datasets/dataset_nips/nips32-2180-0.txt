In this paper, the authors propose CLaR (Concomitant Lasso with Repetitions) which is an approach to solve lasso problems with multiple realizations and heteroskedastic noise. Overall this is a reasonably good paper although I found parts of it to be not explained very clearly. The authors provide a theoretical justification for their approach, an algorithm to solve their problem and some applications in simulated and real MEG data.   Technically, this is a reasonably sound paper. The objective function combines a novel loss function with the L 2,1 norm to promote sparsity. My main comment is that the motivation for the approach is hard to follow, because the authors introduce a lot of different concepts (heteroscedacity, concomitant estimation of coefficients and noise, and M/EEG data) without explaining well the connections between them very well. For example, why does increasing the number of observations lead to heterocedasticity? (line 26) What are the repetitions the authors are combining (e.g. in an MEEG context)? I would suggest a modest re-writing of the introduction to make this clearer. After a couple of readings it seems that the approach was specifically designed with M/EEG in mind. If that is the case, I would make that case explicitly in the introduction and please also provide a more detailed explanation of the M/EEG problem setup in the main text of the paper - currently this is not very clear. Moreover, the authors approach is also couched in multi-task learning (MTL) terminology without this connection being made fully explicit  In the real data experiments, the authors set the regularization parameter on the basis of their expectation to see  only two sources in the data. This may be reasonable for the data they are evaluating, but this knowledge is unlikely to be true in general. Perhaps the authors can comment on that. How would they then set the regularization parameter in other settings?   Other comments: - the authors seem to abuse their notation. on line 65, the authors define $||.||_{p1}$ to mean the l_p1 norm for any $p \in [1,\inf]$ but then they use this notation to mean the norm induced by the estimated precision matrix $S^{-1}$ (e.g. in eq. 2). Is this a misunderstanding?  - line 45: probably should be "reduces noise variance inversely proportional to the number of repetitions". - _why_ does the homoscedastic solver fail after whitening? (line 222)
