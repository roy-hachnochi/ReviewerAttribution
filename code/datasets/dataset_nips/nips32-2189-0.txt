 * This study is solving an important problem in the area of recommendation systems, namely, candidate set generation  * The idea is benchmarked against popular metrics (precision, recall, f-measure) over two public datasets, with offline and online experiments.   * The baselines benchmarked against are also popular and standard approaches (DNN, ITEM-CF). The results presented for this work beats the benchmarks by a good deal, and in particular, the online test results are very good.          * I am not sure if the novelty of this paper is suitable for NeurIPS. It is an incremental improvement to an existing model (TDM) by doing an additional optimization step. The resulting improvement is impressive, though, and it feels like this would be more applicable to an applied data science conference such as KDD or WWW.   * There are portions of the paper that are difficult to follow, especially in the explanation of the Joint Optimization Framework. The explanation of TDM in Section 2.1 is helpful, but it would be even more helpful to have a direct comparison between the tree building steps between TDM and the new proposed method. For example, having a side-by-side comparison of Algorithms1 & 2 with its TDM predecessor would go a long way in understanding detailed differences.   * Moving to iterative joint learning would likely introduce challenges for training time (or potentially challenging of infrastructure for supporting optimizing tree hierarchy). It would be good if the authors could provide some tradeoff or comparison there. Maybe that could explain why the paper did not mention whether it has been deployed to production (although online A/B results were shown).  * It would be good to talk about some of the more practical aspects, such as how many levels of the tree is chosen and how sensitive is the algorithm to these kinds of parameters?  * Figure 2: it seems that the Clustering algorithm outperforms JTM in the first few iterations, so would be curious about the intuitive explanation why thatâ€™s the case.  * Although the paper mentioned that an A/B experiment were performed to evaluate on CTR & RPM (no statistical significance reported), but no where in the paper mentioned whether the method were finally deployed to the full production system. It would be good to have clarity on this in the paper.
