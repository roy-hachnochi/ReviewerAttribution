Originality: Authors propose to extend the tree-based deep model (TDM) for recommendations by jointly optimizing the tree structure. The idea of joint learning itself is somewhat straightforward. The proposed algorithm is also somewhat straightforward, but it has the advantage of being simple and clear, which will allow future research to easily build upon it.  Quality: The contribution of this paper is mostly empirical, and the performance of the proposed approach is impressive in both online and offline evaluations. Authors do a great job in making sure relevant baselines are included in the offline analysis, which allows us to measure the impact of each design choice (for ex: joint learning vs. only learning deep NN parameters). Offline experiments are conducted on public datasets, which shall be replicated in the future.  Clarity: The paper is clearly written. Authors provide sufficient literature survey and the paper is mostly self-contained. However, it could've been nicer if the network structure of the proposed model was described.   Significance: The proposed method is a straightforward but clearly useful extension of TDM. It provides significant improvements over TDM or other strong baseline models, and therefore has a good chance of being widely used in large-scale recommender systems.
