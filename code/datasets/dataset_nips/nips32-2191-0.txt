This paper proposed a policy based approach to device placement. It starts with an i initialized placement and the policy learns to update the placement of a candidate node by optimizing the delta in reward function (runtime).  The main advantage of this work over prior methods is generalization, which is a key requirement for adopting this method in real-world systems. The mutating approach along with the use of graph neural networks seem to improve the sample efficiency and robustness of results.  It is very clearly written and experiments show significant improvements over baselines.
