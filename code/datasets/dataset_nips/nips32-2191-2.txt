The paper presents a new approach to device placement of a compute graph by using a graph embedding neural network. The graph embedding network computes features that are used in the a policy to compute which device the next node in the graph  should be assigned to (It appears to me, that the order of the nodes is possibly fixed and not addressed by the policy; the order seems to be based on how the graph is fed into the model, and the authors make the point of showing that the method is more resilient to changes in order of nodes at test time, compared to RNNs in section 4). The learning algorithm used is a policy gradient algorithm with time step based baselines.  The paper presents the ideas very clearly, and has nice results. The contribution is more from the combination of ideas than from a new idea. Graph embedding networks have been applied for various tasks, and device placement has been addressed previously by Mirhoseni et al. However, this paper shows how to combined these thoughts, allowing policies that are resilient to changes in node order and also generalizes to other graphs.
