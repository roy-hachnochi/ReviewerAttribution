This paper presents cross-attention for few-shot learning. It performs cross-correlation between the query image and each image in the support set. The obtained cross-attention maps are then used to gate the feature maps to obtain the final feature maps from both query and support images.  I think the motivation is sound and proposed cross-attention maps for query and support images are novel. The experimental results validates the effectiveness of the proposed method.   My major concern is on the time complexity of the proposed method, as it requires to conduct cross-correlation between query and every support images. In the comparision table, I think the authors should consider time complexity of different compared methods.  I think the idea is novel and results show SOTA performance.  My only concern is the computational complexity, as it needs to
