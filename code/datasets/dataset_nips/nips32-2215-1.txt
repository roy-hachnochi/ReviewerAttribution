Originality: This work gives a thorough overview of the state of the art for the problem at hand. It combines the technique of optimization of Riemannian manifolds together with the Huber loss. Quality: The quality of the paper is high. Content is well organized and all the theoretical claims contain a proof provided in the supplementary material. The reviewer was not able to evaluate the correctness of all of the proofs. If the source code was provided, it would have been easier to get a sense of the performance of the proposed method. Clarity: Narrative is clear. Content is organized well. Significance: The solved problem is of great importance. Sparse blind deconvolution is still an open research question. Most the the papers in the domain still balance the performance trade-offs and costs in the terms of number of required samples.
