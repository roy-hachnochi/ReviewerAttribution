- Originality:    - The authors propose to look at provable guarantees for regularized weighted low rank approximation, while the related works mainly study the weighted low rank approximation problem. Thus, the problem in this paper is new. However, the proposed algorithm and the techniques to analyze its complexity is similar to those in [RSW16], which makes the contribution of this paper incremental.   - The related work is adequately cited. - Quality:     - The authors provide theoretical analysis of their claims in the supplementary material.    - Though the authors claim that the proposed algorithm can be significantly faster than other algorithms, they did not conduct experiments to support the claim. The authors may want to conduct experiments to show how much faster will the proposed algorithm be than the previous algorithm (e.g., SVD). - Clarity: This paper is clearly written and well organized. It provides enough information to reproduce its results. - Significance: In this paper, the authors theoretically show that we can solve the regularized weighted low rank approximation problem with the time complexity bounds in terms of the statistical dimension rather than the rank. In many real applications, the statistical dimension is lower than the rank. The derived complexity bounds ensure that we can solve regularized weighted low rank approximation problems fast. Thus, the result of this paper is important.  [RSW16] Ilya 354 P. Razenshteyn, Zhao Song, and David P. Woodruff. Weighted low rank approximations with provable guarantees.
