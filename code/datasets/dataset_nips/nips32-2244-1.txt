This paper discusses mainly theoretical convergence results for MC-based variational estimators of f-divergences. To the best of my knowledge, the presented theoretical convergence analysis of the f-divergence estimators is novel work. The results give nice and comprehensive rates of convergence of both the estimator's expectation, as well as its MC-estimator, for different f-functions. This convergence result gives theoretical justification to several well-established methods that can be interpreted as special cases of this work. The paper is well structured, very accessible and provides both high-level proof sketches and exhaustive proofs in the supplementary material. The work is in general well motivated and provides practical context to the theoretical results. As a minor drawback, the motivation and context seems to focus quite strongly on variational-inference related methods, while estimators of f-divergence are of interest in a much broader field as well.  Limitations of the proposed results were recognized (such as constants still potentially depending on the dimensionality, but not in N^{-d}).
