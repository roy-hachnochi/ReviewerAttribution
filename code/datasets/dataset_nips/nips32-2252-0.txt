The article contains 10 theorems which constitute the backbone of the paper. In my opinion, the most important is Theorem 1, which links GNNs and distributed local algorithms. Later approximation results for GNNs are dependent on earlier results obtained for distributed local algorithms. The key technical part of the proof is presented in Lemma 13 in the Appendix that states that every distributed local algorithm can be simulated using a GNN.   The novel GNN models  (VV_C-GNNs and its subclass CPNGNNs) proposed in the paper can be characterized by the following high-level description: proposed classes of GNNs "can send different messages to neighboring nodes by using port numbering, and this strengthens model capability".  In the following theorems, a number of lower and upper approximation bounds are provided. Example: Theorem 7. The optimal approximation ratio of CPNGNNs for the minimum vertex cover problem is 2. In other words, there exists a CPNGNN that can solve 2-approximation for the minimum vertex and for any 1 ≤ α < 2, there exists no CPNGNN that can solve α-approximation for the minimum vertex cover problem. ============== Update: I appreciate the extra information on the availability of examples provided in your response. In my opinion, the choice of Reinforce is quite problematic, but the design of this experiment does not influence my assessment of the paper. I maintain my score.
