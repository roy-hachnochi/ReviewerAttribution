The paper deals with parametric point processes on the real line. The authors show that thinning a point process by keeping each point at random with given probability $p$ is a method that compresses the intensity, but preserves its structure. Hence, it provides a downsampling method.  The method seems to be new, even if it is not a major breakthrough. It is more elegant than the different techniques to paste sub-interval downsampling, and the proofs given in the paper are quite general.  Yet, it misses an evaluation of the uncertainty of the estimate.   The paper is clearly written, even if it is sometimes unnecessarily abstract (see, eg. Definition 2.2 of the stochastic intensity). By way of example, the theoretical results are applied to two particular parametric cases: non-homogeneous Poisson point processes and Hawkes processes. This is a good idea because it helps to understand the general theoretical results, and to see their possible use.
