The thinning idea of learning point processes is interesting. The paper is well written. The only concern I have is on the applicability of the proposed model. In the real world experiments, only the task to learn a Hawkes process is discussed. However, Hawkes process is a weak baseline and there are many other point process models that are shown to have better performance than Hawkes processes on the IPTV and taxi data. It would improve the paper if these models can be compared and discussed.   -------------- thanks the authors for your response, which addressed my concerns. I changed the score accordingly.
