This paper presents a unique approach to computationally efficient parameter estimation in point process models using thinning properties. The problem is well-motivated, and the background should be clear to those with some familiarity with point process theory. The derivations are thorough and the experiments provide validation to the claims of computational efficiency and accuracy in the case of deterministic intensities. Overall, the goal of accelerating inference for point process models is a practically relevant one for the ML community, and this paper opens the door to further valuable research on computationally efficient, low-variance gradient estimators for more complicated point process models.  Though overall this is a good paper, I recommend the following improvements: First, the paper will likely not be digestible to those without significant prior knowledge of point process theory. To broaden the potential audience, I recommend adding some additional background on point processes (perhaps to an appendix; the background in section 2 is quite dense). Second, theorem 4.3 could use additional clarity. The assumption of decouplable intensity functions is clear, but an explanation of how restrictive the assumptions on A and B are in practice would be useful (perhaps add some examples where the assumptions are not satisfied). Third, I think the analysis in section 5 on the bias of the gradient estimators is lacking. The claim in lines 188-189 seems unsubstantiated ("a larger gradient is not a bad thing..."). Please expand upon why we shouldn't be worried about the biases of your estimators when the intensity is not deterministic.
