The paper is proposing  a DP MCMC algorithm for posterior sampling, adopting the Barker acceptance decomposition and sub-sampling, and by that improving the DP guarantees and the computational requirements.  The paper has a rigorous language and it is nicely written. What needs to be more clear from the beginning is the contribution over Seita et al. It takes to page 4 to figure out what this paper is contributing, which is all the results on differential privacy under decomposition and sub-sampling. In addition,  the paper needs to clarify what is the aim of having privacy and against which third party?
