Response to rebuttal: I read the authors' response and I don't have any further comments. --------------------------  ORIGINALITY ===========  The proposed q-means algorithm follows along the lines of the classical k-means algorithm but takes advantage of recent advances in quantum computing (such as vector tomography and quantum linear algebra). Its originality lies in putting all the pieces together and giving a rigorous analysis of the resulting algorithm.  QUALITY & CLARITY =================  The paper is of a very high quality, and the authors take great care in giving rigorous analyses of all the steps and of performing experiments in order to validate some of the theoretical claims.  The writing quality is uneven. In general, the supplementary material is in a much better shape than the 8-page main submission. For instance, in the main text, there's no comparison at all to previous work, or a section which describes the novelty that allows them to beat previous records.   SIGNIFICANCE ============  Given the excitement around quantum algorithms for machine learning, this paper is of high significance and should be of interest to many NeurIPS attendees. Also, the quantum parts of the algorithm are nicely packaged into separate modules, so it gives a very good template of how quantum tools can accelerate classical algorithms (provided access to quantum data of course).
