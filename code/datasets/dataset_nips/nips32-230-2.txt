In this paper, a category anchor based domain adaptation approach is proposed for semantic segmentation. The centroid of each source domain category is used as anchor for discovering confident target samples, in which difference of distances to anchors is used as the metric. Identified target samples are then labeled according to its closest anchor. Then the pseudo-labeled target samples are used for training the segmentation model. Distances to anchors are also used as a regularization to guide the training. Experiments on benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.   The paper is well written and easy to follow. One problem with the proposed method is that it involves many hyperparameters, for example, $delta_d$, $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2$. Although ablation study is provided in supplementary, it is still quite limited. It would be more convincing if a wider range of vlidatation on the hyperparameters are provided.    How important is the warm-up stage? What if you remove it?
