Originality: While the paper does not propose a novel algorithm, it presents an in-depth discussion of the (lack of a) relationship between the EF and F despite the seeming similarity. From a scientific standpoint I find this kind of contribution that strengthens the understanding of a family of methods and raises questions for new avenues of research substantially more valuable than yet another "state-of-the-art" algorithm on some arbitrary benchmark that provides little insight into why it works.  Quality: The write-up is clearly focussed with a thoughtfully chosen set of empirical examples and experiments. I think this is a well-executed paper that clearly warrants publication in NeurIPS.  Clarity: The paper is well written and structured, and overall easy to follow. I appreciate that crucial ideas are re-emphasized throughout the paper, making it easy to keep them in mind throughout and when relevant, and that existing work is credited clearly.  Significance: The paper raises some overlooked subtle, but, as demonstrated, important issues. I therefore believe that this is a significant piece of work, even though second-order optimization is perhaps somewhat niche at the moment.
