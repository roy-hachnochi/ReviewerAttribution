This paper proposes an interesting idea in order to efficiently forecast non-stationary time series at multiple times ahead. In order to achieve this, the authors introduce an objective function called Shape and Time Distorsion Loss (STDL) to train deep neural network. The paper is well written, clear, and of certain significance. In Figure 1 the authors illustrate the limitation of certain existing approaches as a way to motivate their contributions. I am not convinced with the arguments presented there. 1) The use of online regression with adaptive tuning parameters can accurately predict the target provided in Figure 1 (e.g. Recursive Least Squares with Forgetting Factors, Kalman Filter with adaptive noise and so on...) without having recourse to new approaches. 2) Those algorithms are missing in the related art section.  Furthermore, the authors mention that  "Experiments carried out on several synthetic and real non-stationary datasets reveal that models trained with STDL significantly outperform models trained with the MSE loss function when evaluated with shape  and temporal distorsion metrics, while SDTL maintains very good performance when evaluatedwith MSE.", this is a strong statement as the authors do not compare their approach with online approaches capable of dealing with non-stationary time series.  However, the approach to training deep neural networks with the shape and time distorsion loss is interesting but deserves to be compared with competing approaches that showed promised for non-stationary forecasting.
