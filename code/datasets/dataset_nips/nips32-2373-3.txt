originality: high, the proposed method for the SGD estimation is novel, while the second-order approximation is standard but reasonable. quality: high, the theoretic analysis and algorithm looks reasonable clarity: high, paper writing is clear significance: medium, the experiment is not as excited as the proposed method and analysis. Therefore, it may not show practical usage now, but this direction may bring out some work that can be improved, as it is an important question.  -----------------------------Post-Rebuttal--------------------------------------  After the authors addressed my question in the amount of data to remove, I raised my score to 7. The main contribution of the paper is to provide an efficient algorithm to estimate the influence function better when using SGD updates, which is useful to the field since most measures (such as influence function) in Deep learning does not consider the optimization procedure. The framework can also provide decent theoretic analysis, and potentially can be improved with better high-order approximations. The experiments are not very practical useful yet (compared to other data cleansing methods), but the method proposed is still useful to the community.
