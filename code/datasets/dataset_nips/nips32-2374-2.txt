Originality: The method is new and provides a direct generalization of the Linear Distance Metric learning.   Quality: Theorems are clearly interesting to validate the methodology. Fitting capacity result (Theorem 2) ensures that there exists a curvilinear metric that can well separate the data. The Generalization bound ensures empirical loss converges to the expected loss. However, it is unclear whether this ensures that the algorithm converges to the/a Distance introduced by Theorem 2 (the distance well separating the data). It does not seem to ensure that the obtained Distance perfom well either. Also, a discussion on the purpose of tensor $A$ in Theorem 3 could be beneficial. Finally, the topological property certifies that the object learned is a (pseudo)metric; which is a useful property.  Clarity: The paper is well written and well organised and pleasant to read. In particular, the "Geometric interpretation" paragraph is a good step to get the insights of the paper. However, it should be stated clearly that the authors focus on "supervised metric learning", aimed at learning metric for classification; the first 3 pages are quite misleading in that matter.  Significance: The comparison with the state of the art results convince me that it is a method likely to be used in practice. Although the theoretical results ensures polynomial approximation of the metric could behave well enough for classification, it is not clear whether the algorithm converges to this solution after reading Theorem 3.
