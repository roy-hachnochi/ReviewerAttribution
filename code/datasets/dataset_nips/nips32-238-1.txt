Originality This paper has an originality. The invertible recurrent inference machine (i-RIM) is a new structure.  Quality The proposed method i-RIM outperforms all conventional methods. In particular, the i-RIM shows very nice results on the MRI reconstruction task. For instance, the i-RIM sits on top of the leader board of fastMRI challenge.   Clarity The authors need to do a better job in their writing and motivating the problem. It is not easy to read.  The text in Figure 2 is very hard to read. Please increase the font size.  Significance This paper contains a new structure which shows very nice results in MRI reconstruction tasks.
