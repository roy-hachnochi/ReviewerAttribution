This paper introduces a memory efficient method to train a model for inverse inference. This is done by introducing RIMs and use them for iterative inverse process, a series of inverse operations from the output all the way to the input. Simply, put this is basically running RIM for inverse each of the layers to bound the memory.  The other part of the paper is to introduce a set of invertible layers (e.g. orthogonal convolution / residual block with spatial downsampling). These parts are somewhat apart from the proposed method above. While certainly this is a good contribution, but the coherence of the paper was blurred from adding this.  My overall impression of the paper is a direct extension of the RIM paper plus a few useful tools for inversible neural network especially for vision. This makes this paper more like a swiss-army-knife than a very solid piece of in-depth work.  Although I believe this paper would be very useful for Computer Vision community, somewhat blurry focus of this paper makes me hesitant to recommend this paper to be accepted as-is.  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I thank authors' rebuttal and it did address some of my concerns (especially the coherence part). I am happy to recommend this paper to be accepted.
