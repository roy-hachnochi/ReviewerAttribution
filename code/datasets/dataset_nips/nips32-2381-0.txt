This paper clearly build on a foundation of previous work; but it's approach appears original to me.  I want to commend the authors for writing a very clear and easily readable paper.  I also like that the discussion includes an attempt to provide intuition for why the CNF approach does not work as well as the d-DNNF.  Nice.  The quality of the paper is good.  The authors do a thorough job explaining their approach and validating it with relevant data sets.  One minor complaint is that although Fig 3c showed very good improvement for moderate complexity, the high complexity case is not that compelling.  The authors shouldn't point the the high case as evidence.  In fact, I'd like to see more discussion of why the low and high cases don't show as much improvement as the moderate case.  That could lead to some deeper understanding of the method.  This topic is very relevant and significant to many NeurIPS attendees, and will continue to be for the foreseeable future.
