I've read the response and the justification for assumptions A and B are nice. The score has increased to 7.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------  1. Originality: This paper devises a new distance function applied in BGP algorithm. The framework is existing but the author gives a number of improvements and for the first time gives convergence theorem under some conditions. 2. Quality: The theoretical derivation looks sound and the experiments are rather comprehensive. 3. Clarity: The text is mainly clear, but the statement of BPG-MF algorithm is a little confusing --- one needs to read through many sections to get the whole algorithm. 4. Significance: The results are theoretically valuable as a non-alternating optimization method with thorough analysis. But in real data experiments this algorithm does not show a significant advantage in performance over the traditional methods, especially when computing resource is limited.
