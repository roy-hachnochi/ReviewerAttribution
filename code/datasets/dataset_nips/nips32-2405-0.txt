This paper proposes a deep learning training strategy using natural gradient variational inference, and claims that this will preserve the benefits of bayesian principles. However, experimental results by the proposed method are not very impressive compared with other baselines despite the more complicated training process. In addition, I think it would be better if the author can discuss more about how easy the proposed method can be generalized to different deep models.
