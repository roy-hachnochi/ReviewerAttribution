The idea of this paper is novel but tightly linked to the popular 'pseudo-marginal MCMC' work (2009). Nonetheless, it has  key differences which are explained in the paper and addresses a different sampling problem (i.e. transition in multimodal distributions rather than dealing with intractable likelihoods). As such, I find the idea of this work interesting, simple and new.  I also think this paper can potentially have the same impact that the aforementioned work had. The quality of the paper is high and the proposed method and the relevant works are explained clearly.
