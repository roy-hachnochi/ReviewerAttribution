The authors propose a novel algorithm for stable matching problem in a two-sided market. This algorithm is a cute extension of the classical DA (Deferred Acceptance) algorithm. The modification includes three important components: - Monotonic Deferred Acceptance - Strongly Deferred Acceptance - local search steps (resulted in Deferred Local Search)  The paper is well written and structured. The technical presentation is clear with a good balance between formal notations and informal explanation. The core contribution of the paper is the novel algorithm that achieves O(n^2) complexity (w.r.t. the number of participants in the two-sided market).  It would be great to see an evaluation or application of the proposed algorithm in practice (real example).  //After rebuttal: thank you for clarification on practical evaluation. Please, make sure to include it in the next version of your paper
