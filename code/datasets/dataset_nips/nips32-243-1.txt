Originality: This method is a novel extension of existing work.  Quality: There are no obvious technical issues with the submission, however, some parts of the writing are unclear and I had to make my own guesses about what authors mean in some places (see Improvements section for suggestions).  Clarity: The introduction is clear but the main text is not very clear. In particular, it was hard to understand how the proposed algorithms actually work.   Significance: In theory DA produces unfair matchings. In many practical applications there is only a few stable matchings anyway so the unfairness doesn't really matter. This algorithm may be important for cases where indeed there are many stable matchings and we care about fairness.
