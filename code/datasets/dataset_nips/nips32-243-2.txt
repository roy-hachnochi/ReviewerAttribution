Comments:  The problem being addressed is a nice twist on a classical combinatorial optimization problem, and focusing on the fairness aspects of the famously-not-fair stable matchings that pop out of standard DA is a good thing.   I found the paper extremely readable, and the authors clearly know the related literature and state of the art in stable matching.  Still, some minor comments regarding language/notiation/citations/etc follow: * Was there a reason to use M instead of the standard \mu to represent the matching function/matching?  (In fact, \mu is used to denote a matching in Algorithm 1 instead of M.) * It would be good to define a few terms more formally and stick to them.  For example, at various times, couples "break up" (L121) or are "abandoned" (L125, L133), there can be "divorcees" (L127) afterward, and so on. * "Idle" in Theorem 3.1 should not be italicized. * I'd be careful about the wording used in the Conclusions, where "finding an equitable stable matching" is NP-hard and then a polytime algorithm for finding "stable matchings of good equity" is proposed.  I get what you're saying, but you don't want somebody to write the paper off because of what that might seem to imply. * L220, ``all agents to an idle state'' not ``all agents in an idle state'' * n isn't defined in the Algorithm 1 block  * The cost of a matching also isn't defined in the algorithm block, not clear if this refers to regret cost, egalitarian cost, balance cost, or some other cost.  (And, those costs haven't been discussed for a few pages by the time the reader hits Algorithm 1, so it'd be good to add a sentence near the algorithm block in general.)
