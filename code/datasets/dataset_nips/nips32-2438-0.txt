This paper is very intriguing. Although there is no conclusive empirical evidence of the usefulness of auxiliary tasks, their design and justification remain on the whole ad-hoc. This paper describes a new method based on geometric properties of the space of value functions to represent learning. The results show that predicting adversarial value functions as auxiliary tasks leads to rich representations.   Overall, this innovative perspective to represent learning is good for us to understand the learning process. and the literature review shows that the author is knowledgeable in this field. As the author said as I quote, their work may “opens up the possibility of automatically generating auxiliary tasks in deep reinforcement learning ”.   Here are my major concerns:   The author tries to describe his representation starting at part 2. A description of the previous version of representation would be better for a reviewer to get a general idea before describing a new representation for RL. I would suggest the author put “Related work” in part 2 instead of part 5.
