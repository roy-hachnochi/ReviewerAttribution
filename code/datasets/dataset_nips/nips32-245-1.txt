Originality: The problem tackled is in itself original, it is well motivated (not artificial), and can open a new line of research, combining the best of semantic segmentation and zero-shot learning. The approach proposed is a straightforward adaptation of [7] to the proposed settings.  Quality: Given that the problem is new, there were no real competitors, so the authors came up with a sound baseline. The main approach described in the paper is reported to work better than this baseline on Pascal VOC and Pascal-Context datasets. The choice of datasets is correct, although semantic segmentation papers tend to report results also on others such as COCO, and Cityscapes.  Clarity: The paper reads well overall, and the figures (mainly Fig. 2) help in the understanding. The problem is well motivated, and the paper organization is ok.  Significance: As mentioned above, other researchers may get interest in the proposed problem, trying to get better results at this. In this sense the contribution of the paper is important. The contribution about zero-shot learning and self-training (ZS5Net) seems to miss that there is a subarea within ZSL, called transductive ZSL, that has studied this same problem before, with papers such as: Zero-Shot Recognition via Structured Prediction.
