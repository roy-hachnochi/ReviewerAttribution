-- The results presented in Table 1 are a bit mixed. While U-Time does not do worse than any other algorithm to which it had been directly compared, many methods were not implemented for many of the datasets. I believe it remains to be demonstrated that a significant advance to automated sleep staging has been made.  -- The architecture of U-Time is a bit hard to understand from the diagrams and descriptions given.   -- Would the time-series network architecture possibly generalize to segmenting other types of time-series data for which some event segments are very rare?
