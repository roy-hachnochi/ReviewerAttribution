This paper proposes simple method to approximate Sinkhorn distance quickly by combining two previous techniques and presents a new analysis. The experimental results also show that the algorithm can obtain a low excess error efficiently. The results seem convincing.   The presentation could be improved. The background is not enough and some notations are used without definition.
