The paper is well written, and the method seems to be working nicely. The ideas and methodology are good. The main issue is that the experiments are somewhat weak. There are no tests done on common networks, and use a small somewhat "engineered" fully connected network only. Indeed, QSVRG showed similar test problems, but that paper is from 2013. Also, in QSVRG the authors considered two data sets â€“ CIFAR10 and MNIST, and not only MNIST.   After rebuttal: the authors have somewhat addressed my concern about the weak experiments. Trying Resnet18 on CIFAR10 is nice, but is considered a toy example. Still, this much improves the quality of the results. In light of this, and the other reviews I upgrade my score to 7.
