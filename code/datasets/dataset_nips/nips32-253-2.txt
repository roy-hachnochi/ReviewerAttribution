a) Originality：This paper propose a new method based on metric learning, and related work cited adequately. b) Quality: The paper is well written in general. It has the intuitive explanation for the motivation, the theoretical analysis and the experiment results. And experimental results support the authors' claim. c) Clarity：The paper is written clearly and easy to understand. d) Significance: The paper provides a new  method which is easy to understand and implement.  e) Some concerns: 1) Differ from other works' visualization of the last layer, this paper shows that of latent representation. Authors have said that the penultimate layer tends to have more information, but the proposed triplet loss is added on the output layer, is there a gap between the visualization and the proposed algorithm TLA?  1) Why do authors focus on the infinite norm adversarial attack? Is it the limitation of the proposed method? Can the method be applied to other ones? 2) It is too few to choose only AT and ALP as baseline.  3) There is a mistake in Fig 3. The figure does not agree with the notations in this paper.
