This paper provides several improved results on statistical qualities of entropic optimal transport.  Entropic OT has been a heated area of research for the past several years.  This paper provides improved theoretical understanding for entropic OT from a statistical point of view, improving upon previous bounds and providing a central limit theorem for entropic OT for subgaussian random variables.  Previous CLT was known only for for probability measures supported on a finite set of points.  Originality: Provides fresh theoretical results in sample complexity and limiting distribution that improve upon previously known results. Quality: The problems are well-motivated and placed in context.  Theoretical claims are supported by proofs.  Simulation studies assess empirical performance. Clarity: The paper is well-written and clear.   Significance: This paper provides improved statistical understanding of entropic OT, with a highly improved sample complexity bound, and more broadly applicable CLT.   ***  I thank the authors for their careful reading of our reviews and for addressing my concerns.
