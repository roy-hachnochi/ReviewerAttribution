Typo: Just below (2) `defiend' is written instead of `defined'.  There are many places in which the notation c(x,y) is used without it being defined, for example in (3). By comparing with Proposition 3 much later in the paper it seems that the authors intend c(x,y)=\|x-y\|^2/2, but this is not at all clear earlier in the paper.  At the top of page 3 the authors state that the Wasserstein distance W_2^2(P_n,Q_n) converges to W_2^2(P,Q) no faster than n^{-1/d}. A citation should be provided.  There is no discussion in the paper of how close S_\epsilon is to W_2^2, or which values of \epsilon one is interested in in practice. Is the idea to choose \epsilon small in order to estimate W_2? In this case I would have liked to see some bounds on |S_\epsilon - W_2^2|.  Page 5, line 139. The authors write `Applying the bound on E L^2...', but no such bound has been established. Do they mean the bound on E L given in Proposition 2? This would suffice.  It is not made clear what the functions f and g are in the statement of Theorem 3. I guess they are the optimal potentials from (4), but this should be stated.  On page 6 the authors write that the proof of Theorem 2 has two main steps, and they label these steps (a) and (c). Is there a step (b) that is missing? Or did they mean to write (a) and (b)?  My main concern is with the proof of Proposition 3 that provides the link between EOT and entropy estimation. It is written that \nu is assumed to be a translation invariant measure. In the proof, \beta is a probability measure which, in line 195, is taken to be \nu, and so it must be the case that \nu can be taken to be a probability measure. However, it seems to me that the only translation invariant measure on \mathbb{R}^d is given by the Lebesgue measure (up to a scale factor), which cannot be normalized to be a probability measure on all of \mathbb{R}^d. Therefore, it seems necessary to take \nu to be compactly supported, which is not what the authors are focussing their attention on, as they claim that there results only require bounds on the subgaussian constant, and not on the support. The proof of Propostion 3 thus seems to be incomplete.   ==========================================================  UPDATE (after author rebuttal):  The authors' rebuttal addressed most of my concerns.  In reply to the rebuttal, I will just add that Theorem 4 on entropy estimation here does not show how the bounds depend on the dimension d. If you want to discuss the behaviour of the entropy estimator when d is large then the bounds should show this dependence.  I have now changed the overall score.
