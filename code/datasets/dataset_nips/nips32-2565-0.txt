Clarity: The paper is very well written and the contributions are clearly expressed.  Quality: Technical quality of the presentation is high.   Originality: the techniques seem to be original (although I am not an expert in this area, so my knowledge of the surrounding literature is somewhat limited).   Significance: Unclear. The authors use the adjectives "shallow" and "deep" in several places but really they seem to be contrasting 1- vs. 2-hidden-layer networks. It is not clear how/whether the approach can lead to non-trivial separation results for *actual* deep networks.    ===  Update after rebuttal period: bumping the score up, please add formal comparisons with Eldan-Shamir '16.
