 In this article, the authors studied the approximation complexity of the discriminant function of GMMs, and showed that deeper networks (i.e., neural network models with two hidden layers) can exponentially reduce the number of parameters needed, compared to shallow ones with a single hidden layer. In this vein, I find this work complements the existing literature by considering the practical relevant context of separating GMMs.   If the authors had manages to relax the Assumptions 1-3 to cover more practical settings, my rating would be higher, but I think it is entirely appropriate to postpone such improvements to future work.   **After rebuttal**: I have read the author response and my score remains the same.
