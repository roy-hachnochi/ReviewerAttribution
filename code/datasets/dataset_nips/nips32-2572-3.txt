After the rebuttal, I have increased my score accordingly. ################################ The authors propose a kernel mean embedding nonparametric estimation for low-rank Markov chains, and provide corresponding statistical rate.   Majors: 1. Nonparametric estimation for Markov chain probability kernel seems to have been considered in [1]. And [1] assume a more general model with an approximately low-rank structure with exponential decay of the eigenvalue. Minimax estimate rate is also derived. Can the authors clarify the novelty beyond [1]? 2. I feel assumption 2 is strong since the authors assume the kernel function for Hilbert space can be exactly represented by a finite sum of basis functions. Does this mean that there is no approximation error any more? Typically in RHKS literature, people represent the kernel function by an infinite sum spectral expansion. Different kernel functions then are categorized by different eigenvalue decay rates, e.g. polynomial decay kernel or exponential decay kernel. 3. The rate in Theorem 1 is just a parametric rate that roughly the same as the one in [2][3]. So I am wondering how hard to generalize the technique from [2][3] to this paper. 4. I appreciate the authors could implement their method on Atari game. But I am not convinced that why you take the last hidden layer of DQN? What is the benefit and will it improve the score of the game? The explanation for some particular actions of a game is quire artificial since we know vanilla DQN itself is not stable. The author should test some datasets to show that if the transition kernel is indeed low-rank.    Minor: 1. The comparison with plain KME is not fair since reshaped KME uses additional information, saying the knowledge of low-rankness.  [1]. Matthias LÃ¶ffler, Antoine Picard.
