The authors proposed to exploit the structure relationships between point clouds from both global and local perspectives are very enlightening. As such, the complicated relationships between point clouds can be more comprehensively exploited. Moreover, one novel contextual representation of each point is proposed, which considers its neighboring points to enrich the semantic meaning of each point. Such contextual representations are clearly motivated, with ablation studies demonstrating the corresponding contributions. The corresponding novelties and contributions have been summarized in the “Contributions” part. And the questions and some detailed comments are listed in the following. 1. I am wondering the results if considering the spatial-wise and channel-wise attention with each GPM. How does it perform, comparing with the proposed GPM. 2. For the ablation studies in Table 5, it seems that the performances of different components, namely CR, AM, and GPM, perform differently over different categories. Please provide more explanations. 3. What about the performances by stacking different numbers of GPMs? 4. Some more qualitative results should be provided.
