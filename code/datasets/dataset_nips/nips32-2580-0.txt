Originality: The paper introduces a kernel variant for IV regression that combines 2SLS with RKHSs that is novel, and provides an extensive review of the literature with connections to many fields.   Quality: The paper is of high quality, and provides theoretical proofs and extensive experimental results. A more thorough discussion of the limitations of the method would be useful to understand the extent of its applicability.   Clarity: The paper is very clearly written and well organized, a pleasure to read. The assumptions are clearly stated.  Significance: Extension of IV regression to nonlinear settings is a relevant research topic as many real-world applications involve nonlinear interactions. Thanks to the theoretical proves provided and the efficient ratio for training samples, this work could be used in applied fields in a fairly straightforward way.   Comments/questions: • The connections to the kernel embedding of distributions in stage 1is very nice, and there are two papers that I find could be referenced: the initial paper of kernel embedding of distributions: A. Smola et al 2007 – A Hilbert space embedding of distributions, and K. Muandet et al, 2017 – Kernel mean embedding of distributions: a review and beyond, which is a nice review. • Line 16: reference to IV regression • How does KernelIV perform if the data indeed comes from a linear setting, where h(X) is a linear function of X? Does it still outperforms the other methods? • How does KIV perform if the efficient ratio n/m (Line 300) cannot be satisfied?  • What kernels did the authors use in the experiments for K_XX and K_ZZ (Alg 1) and how did you choose the parameters of the kernels? Is there a robustness study w.r.t. to these parameters? • A more detailed description of the parameters used in the experiments for the different methods would have been useful, but this was probably a problem of space.
