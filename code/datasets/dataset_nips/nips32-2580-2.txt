== Finite dimensional output RKHS == As mentioned, it seems that the authors implicitly assume that the output RKHS H_X in the first stage (conditional mean embedding) is finite dimensional. I explain this below.  - In the proof of Theorem 6 in Appendix, the authors assume that the covariance operator T_1 admits an eigendecompositon in terms of an orthonormal basis. However, unless T_1 is shown to be a compact operator, such a decomposition may not exist; see e.g. Thm A.5.13 of Steinwart and Scovel's book. The problem is that, given that the operator-valued kernel is defined as in lines 165-166 (which results in Algorithm 1), the covariance operator is not of trace-class (and thus is not compact), if the RKHS H_X is infinite dimensional. This can be seen from the proof of Proposition 21, which is given in [17, Proposition 13] where the output RKHS is essentially assumed to be finite dimensional (this can be seen from [17, Eq 71], where the middle term becomes infinity if the RKHS is infinite dimensional and the operator-valued kernel is defined as in lines 165-166). Therefore, the results in the current paper does not hold unless H_X is finite dimensional. This should be clearly stated and discussed.   - In Hypothesis 5, a power of the covariance operator is introduced, but this may not be well-defined. This is because, to define the power, one needs to introduce an eigendecomposition of the covariance operator, but this may not well-defined if H_X is infinite dimensional, as mentioned above. Anyway the authors should explicitly state the definition of the power operator somewhere in the paper or in the appendix.  - From what I remember, Grunewalder et al [25], who borrowed results from Caponetto and De Vito [11], essentially assume that the output RKHS for conditional mean embedding is finite dimensional, from the same reason I described above. This is why I suspected that the current paper also implicitly assumes the output RKHS being finite dimensional.   Other comments: - In Theorem 2, the optimal decay schedule of the regularization constant should be explicitly stated.  -  Where is the notation \Omega_{\mu(z)} in Definition 2 and Hypothesis 7 defined?
