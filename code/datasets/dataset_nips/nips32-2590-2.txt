The authors introduce a novel Bayesian optimization approach based on Thompson sampling to to tackle multi-task optimization problem. Their approach is based on Gaussian Processes with Gibbs kernel which allows to capture the variation in difficulty between tasks; they use a Bayesian approach to learn the kernel hyperparameters.  To the best of my knowledge, the authors cite and compare their work to the relevant papers for this task. However, I have not followed the recent developments of this field and can therefore not make a precise judgement regarding the advancements of the state of the art made by this submission.  The paper seems technically sound. However, due to time constraints, I have not checked the proof of the theorem.  The paper is clearly written and all the concepts are precisely described. The figures could be improved in order to be more easily readable when printed in B&W.
