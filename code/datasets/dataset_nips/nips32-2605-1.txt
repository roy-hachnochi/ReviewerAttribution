The multi-round interview scenario is interesting, and has potentially applications beyond hiring. The algorithmic and theoretical extension from [Chen 2014] is non-trivial, the two algorithms are sound, with clear intuitions and computationally feasible.   The two settings are analogous to those in [Chen 2014], but with intuitions updated for multi-round setting.   The writing is generally clear.   ------ update after author feedback ----------- I read other reviews and author feedback, and feel that the feedback helps provide perspective and have addressed concerns raise in the reviews.  Assuming the explanations and additional info in the feedback makes to the final version, I maintain an accept rating.
