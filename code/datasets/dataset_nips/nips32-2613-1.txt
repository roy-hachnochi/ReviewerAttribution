This paper proposes a probabilistic model-based method for estimating effective connectivity among brain regions based on simultaneous EEG and fMRI recordings. The model is a linear state-space model for sensor-space EEG data, with the observation (forward) model pre-specified from a given lead-field matrix and task-based ROIs defined by fMRI.  The technical idea sounds reasonable, although rather straightforward and the advance from previous studies like [7] appears to be quite small. Most crucially, the method does not seem to really exploit the advantage of simultaneous measurements because the task-based ROIs can actually be defined even from fMRI-only measurement during participants do the same task.   The paper itself is very well-written, with high clarity. The simulation and real-data experiment are well conducted, although it is not easy to validate the method from the real-data result.  As minor points, is it necessary to assume that Q_x is diagonal? Some comments will be useful on how the technical idea of this paper differs from previous uses of fMRI for spatial priors [12-14].  Comments after authors response: I still think that the method is not far beyond the previous work [7] because the key idea of reducing ROI-based source connectivity estimation into sensor-space AR model fitting has already been presented in that work and other modifications on the model is rather straightforward once the formulation is given. Some specific modeling and algorithmic details (e.g. modulatory connectivity, initialization scheme) are likely new and useful, which I initially overlooked.
