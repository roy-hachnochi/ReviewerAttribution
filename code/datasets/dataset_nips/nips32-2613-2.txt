In this work, the Authors propose a linear state-space model for estimating effective connectivity using EEG and fMRI data. The fMRI data is used to localize the ROIs and constraint the optimization of the model inferred from EEG data. The temporal dependence between latent variables is modeled as a first-order MVAR in the presence of external and context-dependent inputs. Such a model is complemented by a linear forward model for propagation. Variational-Bayes inference is used to estimate the model, adopting some strong assumptions, e.g. Q_s diagonal. Experiments on simulated data are conducted in order to characterize the importance of constraining sources to what fMRI data suggests, both in a block and in an event-related design. On real fMRI/EEG data, from a face, car, and house stimulation paradigm, the proposed method is used to study the connectivity patterns between FFA, PPA, SPL, ACC, FEF and PMC for face-house processing, suggesting that additional connectivity is required for recognizing a house relative to a face.  The manuscript is very well written and the proposed method is very interesting and grounded.  Issues:  - The main issue is the absence of the code implementing the proposed method. The Authors do not commit even to publishing the code of the proposed method and simulations after acceptance. The Authors do not offer any explanation for this decision which, in 2019, is pretty difficult to accept. Same thing for the EEG/fMRI dataset. It is true that many practical details are present in the manuscript and the supplementary materials. Still, reproducibility of the results seems not a major concern for the Authors. But it is for me.  - What about the time required by the entire method to be computed? No mention of that.
