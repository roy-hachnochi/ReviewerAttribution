In general, the idea of this paper is pretty simple and neat. Although there are closely related ideas in the literature (and the authors cited those), this paper delivers a completely differentiable approach to the problems it is to solve. - As this paper has promised, it only works for those combinatorial problems that involve a hidden grouping or (its dual) partitioning. Many other combinatorial problems on graphs remain untouched. - They rely on efficient computation of the expected training loss, $\ell$. Although one can compute such loss for a group of problems, it is not likely to compute such an expectation in every case. It is not clear how one can approximate such differentials. - Line 243: no need for the Trace. - Line 267: the 2-approximation is not optimal, as it is (1 - 1/e) for Facility Location.  - The intuitions on Section 5 are nice but are not backed up with mathematical reasoning. It is hard to reason about DNNs in general, though.
