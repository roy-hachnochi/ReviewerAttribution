This work builds on a strong foundation of related work; but does so in a novel way.  The paper is very clearly written, which is much appreciated!  As for quality, the authors perform a thorough analysis comparing against a variety of expert baselines on a variety of data sets.  Their supplemental material is very comprehensive.  As for significance, NeurIPS attendees will be interested in the pipeline presented and the novel incorporation of a differentiable proxy graph optimization; but they might not be as interested in the problem of graph optimization more broadly.
