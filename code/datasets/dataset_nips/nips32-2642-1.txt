The paper introduces a generative model for predicting the location of spikes from microelectrode array recordings. Inference is performed by reformulating the learning algorithm as a Variational Autoencoder.  While the model is well defined it bothers me that the amplitudes are modelled as Gaussian random variables. Spikes are essentially defined as non-gaussian events on the potential. Even though spike detection is not addressed in this work, I would expect the amplitude of the spikes to be modeled as non-gaussian in order to learn the appropriate structure.  The paper seems to deal with localisation in a much more sophisticated way than anything else that is currently available. However, the numerical comparisons do not provide sufficient comparison with other localisation approaches. The paper would improve considerably through a better comparison with other modern localization approaches. All in all a good paper but it needs more comparison with state of the art.  After reviewing the rebuttal: The reply for non-gaussianity of spikes was not satisfactory. If the authors are going to use a variational inference approach you should try to work on models with the appropriate prior distributions. Modern computational frameworks allow for more modelling flexibility than what is exposed in this work. I think the original score is sufficient for this work.
