The improvement of the complexity results stems from tensor reshaping described in Lemma B.2 so that the sketching for tensor can be reduced to that for matrices. It follows closely the work by Diao et al. AISTATS 2018. However, it seems non-trivial to piece together different components with details for achieving the results. Also, extensions with analysis to other related problems are considered. It would be good if experiments on real data can be given.
