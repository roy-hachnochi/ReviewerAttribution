The paper makes three key contributions. First, the authors provide results on hardness of the problem by reducing it to the PINWHEEL scheduling problem and provide negative results on solvability of the problem even with prior knowledge of the rewards and delays of all the arms. Second, motived by the obtained result on hardness of the problem, the authors show that a simple greedy algorithm that plays the available arm with the highest reward is asymptotically (1 -1/e) optimal. Finally, the authors show that by exploiting the free exploration of arms due to the unavailability the UCB algorithm achieves the log T cumulative regret with respect to the oracle greedy algorithm with known rewards.      The presentation of the paper was mostly clear. The claimed contributions are discussed in the light of existing results and the paper does survey related work appropriately. Specifically, the authors put and compare the proposed setting in the context of other settings such as sleeping bandits, combinatorial semi-bandits, and bandits with budget. Regarding the quality of the writing, the paper is reasonably well written, the structure and language are good. The paper is technically sound, and the proofs seem to be correct as far as I checked.
