The authors investigate several settings of selling an item to a single buyer repeatedly over T timesteps, with the goal to maximize revenue. The assumption is that the buyer uses a no-regret algorithm to decide which option (that the seller offers) to choose (given the private value that they have). The authors propose 1-eps approximations of the entire surplus when values are adversarially chosen using a polynomial (in eps^-1) number of options. When restricting attention to the class of critical mechanisms, they achieve revenue guarantee of O(log log H / log H) for stochastic values and O(1/log H) for adversarial values (where H is the support of the distribution).  While the problem is well-motivated, the exposition seems pretty informal at times which makes the claims difficult to verify (see details under “improvements”).
