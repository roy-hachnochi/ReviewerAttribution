Update: I am happy with the author's response. Thus I will keep my original score.   Original comments:  In this paper, the authors proposed a new method for policy evaluation when one only has proxies for true confounders. In particular, the author shows that the policy value can be consistently estimated in square root-n convergence rate when the outcome function is unknown.   Pros.  Policy evaluation with the existence of latent confounders is a very important question in contextual bandits. Although there is a large body of literature when assuming unconfoundedness, the problem of developing efficient policy evaluation method when allowing for latent confounders has been seldomly investigated. Itâ€™s good to see that this paper has filled this gap.  Cons.  In this paper, the author only provides explicit bounds and algorithms when the function class follows a RKHS. It would be interesting to see explicit bound and implementation of such algorithm in other class of models, such as neural networks.
