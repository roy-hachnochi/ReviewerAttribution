A novel hyperbolic graph convolutional network is proposed in this submission, which shows outstanding performance on the graphs possessing hierarchical structure in the link prediction and link prediction tasks. The only concern the reviewer has is the definition of activation function defined in equation 10. It means that after implementing a normal activation function on T_o^{k_{l-1}}, the intermediate vector defined in this tangent space is directly mapped to a space with radius k_l via exp_o^{k_l}, is this mapping even mathematically plausible?
