To me, the main issue with this paper is that it tries to claim as a contribution the use of implicit function. Since at least 3 CVPR19 papers have already presented a similar idea (which is problematic to me, even if formally ok and not ground for rejection) I think this is a bad strategy for this paper, which has another contribution which I think is valid, useful and improve results, but is lost because of this presentation: it does not appear anywhere in the title and not clearly in the abstract. Simply looking at the title and abstract, I would not be likely to read the paper and would simply discard it as one more late paper building on the same idea. I would also have no chance to find it back if I wanted to cite it.  Clearly not related work, but "PIFu: Pixel-Aligned Implicit Function for High-Resolution Clothed Human Digitization  Shunsuke Saito*, Zeng Huang*, Ryota Natsume*, Shigeo Morishima, Angjoo Kanazawa, Hao Li" has a similar approach using local features, it might be nice to discuss the relation of the two works in the final version  === Post-rebuttal   please include the new dataset and experiments including more camera variation promised in the rebuttal
