In this paper the authors investigate the following cost-effective active search problem: the goal is to find a given number of positive points which minimize the label cost. Here they used the Bayesian decision model. They show a strong hardness result: any algorithm with complexity O(n^{n^0.16}) cannot approximate the optimal cost with in \Omega(n^0.16). Previously there is an upper bound O(1/\sqrt{log n}) for the maximization version of the problem. They also give an approximation algorithm for the minimization problem as well as some experiment under different scenarios.  Here are some detailed comments: The author claim that it results in an exponentially stronger bound (n^0.16 vs \sqrt{log n}). (Line 147) However, the two problem are different, one is minimization problem, one is maximization problem. There is no necessary connection between the approximation ratio for the min and the max problem. For example, for set cover problem, the approximation ratio for minimization version is O(log n), but the approximation for maximization version is 1-1/e. For the hardness result, what is the dependent on the parameter T? Because when T=O(1), there is some DP algorithm which can solve the problem in polynomial time.  Line 110, “Let p(x)=p(y=1:x,D_i)”, here the notation of p(x) does not show the dependence on index i
