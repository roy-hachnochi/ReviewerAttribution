Originality: learning weakly-communicating MDPs was already attempted in Bartlett and Tewari who give a very similar result to the one given in this paper (based on span-regularization rather than exploration bonus).  Quality: The results seem sound.  Clarity: The paper is well-written.  Significance: The idea of exploration bonus has received a lot of attention in recent results. However, given the work of Bartlett and Tewari, the benefit of using exploration bonuses is mostly computational.  --- Edit --- Having read the authors response, I agree that this is the first tractable algorithm for this setting. I have raised my score.
