Post rebuttal: I feel this is a strong paper and will maintain my score.  - Figure 3 is a very nice visualisation; I hadn't thought of plotting the corruption to the objective landscape under model quantisation before. - This seems to out-perform some of the recent mixed-precision results as well; you may want to directly state this in one of the comparison tables  - I'd like to see time comparisons for training and inference - there should be better baseline comparisons (although: this method seems to match normal training, so there's very little margin for it to be out-performed. The comparisons should be used to emphasize that more complex methods actually end up under-performing the proposed method)
