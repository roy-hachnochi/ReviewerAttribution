Originality: It is a novel combination of well-known techniques. It is novel, but not a radically new idea.   Quality: The paper is technically sound, the claim are supported by experimental results. One aspect is missing, though: applications with MCUs normally also have throughput constraints. These are frequently seen in NAS papers as a secondary objective beyond accuracy. This is missing here, both as a optimization constraint as well as in the evaluations.  Clarity: In general, the paper is clear. Some minor items are missing, though: 1) what is CIFAR10-binary? 2) What microcontroller is used?   Significance: In general, the direction is interesting and the paper will provide a new state-of-the-art comparison point. The lack of code and thus reproducibility will have a strongly limiting impact on the significance of this work.
