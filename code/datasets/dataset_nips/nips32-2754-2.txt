• The quality of writing and explanation of the methodology is well done. • The background info about MCUs in the introduction is helpful in building motivation for the problem, however, it may be useful to sacrifice some of these details for more detail in the methodology sections (specifically sections 3.1, 3.4, 3.5). • The design and description of the "multi-objective optimization" framework is also well done. Specifically, the way the authors encode the objectives in (1)-(3), and the desire for a Pareto optimal configuration is reasonable and seems extendable in future works. However, there are some non-trivial topics in this section that could use some more explanation, including the SpVD and BC pruning methods (S3.3), Thompson sampling (S3.4) to get the next configurations, and the coarse-to-fine search (S3.5). • It seems like morphism is primarily included to minimize search time, however how does the framework work without morphism? Do the resulting configs of a morphism-search and non-morphism-search match? Using morphism, is there a strong bias to the initial configuration? • Line 195, how is f_k( omega ) unknown in practice? You define them in (1)-(3) and they seem directly measurable. • Since SpArSe is a "framework" for CNN design, how would this method scale to larger problems/hardware, e.g. CIFAR-10 and/or ImageNet for mobile phones? Or is the future of this framework somewhat limited to MCU designs? • Multi-objective Bayesian optimization is used as the unsupervised learning algorithm. Although the authors do mention that existing approaches to NAS (i.e. reinforcement learning-based) are much less efficient. However, can these other optimization processes (along with genetic algorithms, etc.) be dropped into the SpArSe framework as well? Or is the MOBO an integral component of the proposed framework?
