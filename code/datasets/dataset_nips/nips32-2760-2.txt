The fast forward model to generate the simulated spectra is not clear, which makes hard to understand the general picture and the theoretical results. This should be described in a clear and extended manner in the supplementary material. Ideally the code should be provided.   AUC not defined.  In Related work, a summary of references is given but neither substantial analysis nor hard numbers to compare are provided.      Line 108-109: Elaborate in the meaning of this sentence to make it clearer, e.g. what is Beta?  Missing labels in Fig. 5.  Line 203: Forgot to remove note? Did the authors verify that 90.6% was the correct value?  Line 222-223: Inverse problems are, in general, a difficult topic and therefore in any application systematic analysis are mandatory. It is not clear how the stability analysis performed really guaranties the robustness of the method. I would suggest a more extended and clear study should be performed.
