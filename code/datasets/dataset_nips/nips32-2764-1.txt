Strengths:  - The proposed model is relevant and close to how most human learning is done ie. through hierarchy of concepts and often inference is done through interaction of those concepts. - The proposed model learns the visual concepts and the meta concepts which specifically aid in zero shot learning and generalizing to noisy, unseen and even biased dataset conditions.
