I would have liked to see more analysis of why the proposed "adaptation" approach helps to improve the quality of the results. Compared to the baselines and other methods, the empirical results in this paper are of a higher quality both quantitatively and qualitatively. It would have been interesting to show some failure modes and analyze why the failures happened - e.g. stretching the adaptivity to the limit. I don't find the notation in the paper very clear - it requires lots of rechecking to figure out what the different letters mean. If the paper is accepted, the authors should consider modifying their notation.
