Similar to the univariate case, the ordering in the d-dimensional space should also be the constraint of the multivariate quantile function (MQF), correct? Would the parameterization of the sum-of-squares (SOS) flow enforce this constraint on the MQF? Besides SOS flow, is there any other generative model that can enforce this constraint?  To demonstrate the advantage of the multiple gradient descent algorithm (MGDA) in optimizing the objective function (5), did the author run ablation study by comparing it against the baseline of training the reconstruction loss first and then optimizing the negative log-likelihood term? Is there any significant improvement by using MGDA except no need to tune lambda?  The performance of difference approaches on the MNIST dataset are pretty close. Did the author run any statistical test to confirm the performance gap is significant?
