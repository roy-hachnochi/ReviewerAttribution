This paper presents a generic method for solving a practically relevant problem of novelty detection. The authors show that existing methods including the classical One-class SVM [42] as well as the recent Latent Space Autoregression [1] can be recovered as special cases of the proposed method.   Overall the paper is well-written and ideas are presented clearly. On the technical front, it exploits the recent work [19] and combines the existing techniques to come up with a generic/unifying method for novelty detection. For this, it also introduces a novel multivariate generalization of quantile functions.  What I further liked in the paper are   1. the proposed method allows one to define scoring rules for novelty detection based on both quantiles as well as the estimated density  2. instead of trying to find the right trade-off between reconstruction loss and the negative log-likelihood (via tuning the regularization parameter), it shows that one can employ multi-obejective optimization to get better results.  3. A thorough experiments are conducted by comparing several baseline methods with suitable scoring rules.
