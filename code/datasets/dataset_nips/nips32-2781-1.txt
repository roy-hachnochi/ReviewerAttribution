Quality/Significance: Somewhat interesting combination of previous ideas. Adaptive sampling provides good motivation for differentially submodular functions (Appendix A).   Originality: The authors briefly mention [HS16] but do not explain how the definition its results  A preprint by Gupta et al. is cited in the references as [GPB18] but never mentioned in the main paper or the Appendix. It contains a definition equivalent to differential submodularity in the case where g and h are the same function (as they are in many of this paper's proofs).   Also, the proof of Theorem 6 is very similar to Section 5.2 of [GD18].  For these reasons, it seems like the paper combines several existing lines of work with limited novelty. Without further detailed discussion, this is a key weakness  Clarity: Generally clear, but organization could be improved. Several of the paper's key details are pushed to the Appendix.   d defined as both the feature dimension and a submodular diversity function  The name DASH might cause confusion with ProtoDash [GDC17]  [GD18] Gurumoorthy et al.

However there are some additional concerns about how the proposed algorithm performs in large-scale settings. Therefore my final review is still borderline
