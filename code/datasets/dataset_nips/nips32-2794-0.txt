In the past year, a number of papers have given theoretical insight into "double descent" risk, where the minimum risk is (counterintuitively) found at some $p > n$.  This paper provides "double descent" results under slightly different settings from the preceding literature.  Originality: The idea of double descent is not new, but the authors explore this behavior in a slightly different setting compared to preceding literature.  One useful advantage of this paper is that there is no minimal eigenvalue assumption.  Quality: Claims are supported by theoretical analysis and complete. Simulations to illustrate the expected behavior would be welcome.  Clarity: The paper is properly motivated, well-written, and placed within the surrounding literature.  Significance: The paper is an interesting addition to the interpolation / double descent literature, but aside from analyzing its behavior under different assumptions does not pose many new ideas.  ***  I thank the authors for their careful reading of our reviews and for addressing my concerns.
