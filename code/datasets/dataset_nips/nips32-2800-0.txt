This study links "factor group-sparse regularized matrix factorization" and "Schatten-p-norm regularization with p=1/2 or 2/3" theoretically.  This perspective is interesting.  However, the proposed method and results do not have big impact in practical perspective because the convex regularized matrix factorization itself is very naive, and non-convex regularized low-rank matrix recovery is now widely studied and there are many related works such as truncated nuclear-norm[ex1], weighted nuclear-norm[ex2], capped-l1[ex3], LSP[ex4], SCAD[ex5], and MCP[ex6].

Also in another perspective, greedy rank-increment approach [ex7,ex8,ex9] for low-rank matrix recovery should be referred for discussion.  This does not need to estimate initial d unlike regularized matrix factorization methods, and it is usually memory efficient. [ex7] M. Tan, I. W. Tsang, L. Wang, B. Vandereycken, and S. J.
