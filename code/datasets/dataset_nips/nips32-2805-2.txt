A generally good paper.  The paper proposes a class of point processes, called mutually regressive point processes that captures both excitation and inhibition in sequences of events. The proposed approach, can model nonlinear temporal interactions in continuous time.   The construction builds on a generalization of Hawkes Processes in a new combination of existing methods. We can recover the traditional Hawkes processes by certain parameter settings.  The resulting construction is quite involved. It is based on the augmentation of the Hawkes Process intensity with a probability term. This term is equipped with a weight parameter that tunes the influence of a certain type of event to another.  In particular, a sparse normal gamma prior is proposed to be placed on the weights so that an interaction between 2 types is inhibitory or excitatory in a probabilistic manner. The paper is well justified and supported for the sampling scheme in the generative model as well as the inference procedure. For the former,  there is a detailed explanation for the hierarchy, the parameters and the constraints. For the latter, there is a thorough description of the inference and the related methods (eg thinning)  However, as a downside the paper is heavy in notation which is because of the many parameters involved in the construction. The heavy notation makes the reading/comprehension of the paper not straightforward.  The authors give the precise algorithms for inference. The synthetic data experiment supports the validity of the model. Regarding other experiments, although the paper brings interesting directions in the use of these processes for neuron data, the experiments are limited. Also, sufficient comparisons to other models on both interpretation and predictive performance are missing.
