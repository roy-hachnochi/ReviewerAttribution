[Originality] This paper is one of the first papers, if not the very first, to introduce a coupled ODE framework that takes a principled approach on neural ODE to dynamically controlling the neural net parameters. There exist some previous papers on dynamic parameters in neural nets, but they are not quite related to neural ODE and specifically not looking into the discretization issues in neural ODE. And with one additional coupled ODE, the presented framework can perform inference efficiently.  [Quality] The theoretical part of this paper is sound and mostly self-contained. The authors presented detailed experiment results with several examples of the proposed framework. It clearly shows that the proposed coupled ODE framework has advantage over the original neural ODE. And I believe the authors makes a good job in evaluating their and others' work.  [Clarity] The paper is clearly written with some visualizations for readers to understand the proposed framework. Key equations for the variants of coupled ODEs are provided.  [Significance] The paper presented an efficient way to improve neural ODE via allowing a separate dynamic weight evolution ODE and coupling this one with the original ODE. The performance gain is likely to indicate that this approach is effective. And the use of dynamic parameters in neural ODE may inspire other work in different applications which involve both dynamical systems and requirement for adaptability (for example, robotics).
