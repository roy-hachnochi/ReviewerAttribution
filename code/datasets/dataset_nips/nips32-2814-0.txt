While a huge amount of work exists on sample-complexity of entropy estimation, the space complexity was overlooked. However, it is clear that from the practical point of view, it is important to study the trade-off between sample and space complexities of statistical estimation tasks. So in that sense I consider the main idea of the paper original. Most part of the paper are clear, but I do think that the authors should read their paper carefully and fix some typos/grammar mistakes. The proofs are easy to follow.   For me, there is one main disadvantage for this paper: Overall, the trade-off is not clear. The authors just proposed a simple algorithm which has sub-optimal sample complexity and "constant/optimal" memory complexity. However, to really study the complexity a lower bound is needed. It would be much more interesting to come up with a statement that roughly says that: "if one insist on a memory complexity of at most X then sample complexity must be at least Y".   Update: reading the detailed author response I now realize that obtaining a lower bound is quite challenging. Thus, I decided to increase my score accordingly.
