Originality:  - The paper is novel in that it is the first to work with the Overcooked environment. That in itself is not worthy of high marks, but in this case what they do with it is important because they address a real problem in the current multi-agent literature around self-play being sufficient for any form of interaction.  Quality: - This submission is of high quality with the proper experiments and caveats.  - I am giving it really high marks because it persistently tackles the main hypothesis presented at the beginning that self-play is insufficient for collaborative environments because it does not account for humans (or, in general, any suboptimal agent) taking actions that deviate from optimal. The result is a set of experiments that deliver on the hypothesis as well as takes early steps towards addressing these issues via training alongside agents behaviorally cloned from human actions.  Clarity: - The paper is well written, albeit there are typos littered here and there such as on L257 with "simulat".  Significance: - These results are important, not just for what they say about self-play but very much for the environment that they introduce and the potential for research into collaborative approaches in multi-agent. I implore the authors to release this to the community and additionally ask them to consider shouting an open call for contributors to this to make it even more amenable to human interaction. This is the kind of setup that we need more of going forward.
