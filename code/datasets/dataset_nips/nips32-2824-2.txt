------------ Edit after reading the other reviews and the rebuttal: Thank you for answering my questions.  I have no concerns. ------------  I have a strong background with CFR / CFR+, but not any in accelerated methods, optimistic regret matching, or the other theoretical components of this work.  Through that lens, I liked this paper.  This paper considers the application of optimistic regret-minimization algorithms to extensive form games.  It follows a similar setup as CFR, the current SOTA algorithm for solving large games, which decomposes the overall regret-minimization problem into independent subproblems at each information set.  Theoretically, the new algorithms should have faster convergence than the CFR+ variant of CFR.  Empirically, the authors show that these methods converge dramatically faster than CFR+ in small games, but slower in the slightly larger game of Leduc hold'em.  I found that the paper was clearly motivated and described.  To my knowledge it is novel, and significant: CFR / CFR+ has had a long run as the SOTA algorithm for solving large extensive games, and any technique (such as this one) with stronger theoretical bounds and faster convergence (even if only in smaller games) is of interest.  The paper is well structured with ample discussion of each component.  While I'm sure that I didn't appreciate all of the details without a theoretical background in this area, I think I could probably implement it from this description.  Overall I don't have any substantive issues with this work.  I've listed some questions in the Improvements section.
