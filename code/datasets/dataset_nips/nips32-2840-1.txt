This paper examines the question of whether influence functions for determining the impact of a single training point on a modelâ€™s predictions generalize in the case where a group of points (e.g., a demographic group) that likely have cross-correlated effects are all removed.  This is a fascinating and important problem.  The authors demonstrate empirically that across five datasets the actual effect and the influence as approximated by the influence functions are correlated.  This is an important result and validation for the real-world use of influence functions in important fairness domains.  They then provide an analysis attempting to characterize the conditions under which the approximated influence and the actual effects are correlated, including nice experiments demonstrating that the Newton approximation is highly correlated to the actual effect.
