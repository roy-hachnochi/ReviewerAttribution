Originality: The proposed Attention Attractor Network is novel.  Quality: The intuition of using the attention attractor network is not that sound. The motivation of the model is to prevent forgetting base classes. But the method (line 160-166) takes the cosine similarity between the average representation of novel classes and the base class weights.  This is purely intuitive. Clarity: There some places not very clear.  Significance: the empirical results seem significant.
