I would like to thank the authors for their response.  =============================   Originality ----------- * Although the literature in node representation learning and community detection is quite vast, this paper is positioned in a way that diverts from the norm. The method proposed is treating the two tasks as one, and jointly learns embeddings, rather than going through iterations of optimizations.  * The work includes an adequate number of citations to recent and older works in the tasks at hand. Moreover, the authors proceed to compare against a big number of these methods in the experimental section.  * The novelty of the work is still limited, since the techniques used are well-known and have been applied to other domains already. Still, this work is the first to apply and combine them for community detection and node representation learning.   Quality -------- * The theoretical analysis in this paper is quite shallow, since the techniques that are being used are already known and established.  * The experimental section of the paper is one of the strongest points of this work. It is very extensive, compares the proposed work against a variety of other methods, and the comparison is done on a number of different tasks and using different metrics.  * The authors are honest in evaluating their work, especially in Table 3. They still provide a reasonable explanation for the performance of their method compared to either ComE, or the rest of the methods.   Clarity ------- * The paper is overall well-written; it feels like a polished work.  * There are places that could be improved in terms of details, which I will mention below.   Significance -------------- * Looking at novelty, this paper's strong points are the methodological contribution that it makes through the proposed modeling, and the kind of empirical analyses that it enables. In the rest of the dimensions, i.e., theoretical and algorithmic, the paper is not adding anything novel to the literature.  * The proposed model enables a unique approach to data exploration. Indeed, as showcased in the plots, the learnt embeddings can be used to produce very interesting plots for quite large and messy networks.  * As I mentioned previously, this method is a significant and highly non-trivial addition to the tools for network exploration. These tools are finding more and more users and use cases, which means that the potential impact of this work is high.
