The joint analysis of node representations and community structure is an interesting and original avenue for analyzing networks. I agree with the authors that this should be much further investigated in the future, and indeed that more should be done in the networks realm in the area of integrative analysis. The comparison with current community detection and node representation algorithms was also very useful, and making the code publicly available is beneficial. The paper would have benefited from considering theoretical guarantees that are available to community detection methodologies, such as the detectability limits of the method as well as asymptotic properties of the method. Also, it wasn't entirely clear from the applications what the additional benefit was to applying vGraph over applying community detection and node embedding methods individually.
