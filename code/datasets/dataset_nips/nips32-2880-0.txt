This main paper contribution is a similarity measure that at its core is the inner product of network gradients at two given data points, which distance we want to measure. It then develops the formula for shared-weights multiclass classifier so one can apply this measure to modern neural nets. The presented theory seems to be well established and original.  The introduction, specifically the motivation part and similarity section, is quite clear and invites the reader to dive in into the details. Good job. The theory is developed step by step, from simple NNs to modern ones, in an easy to follow way.  The paper might benefit from higher significance: The developed approach has a lot of potential insights; however, its primary purpose: to better understand the self-denoising effect, was weakly achieved. Moreover, experiments of successful applications of the method are lacking. One thing that worries me is that this statistic can be highly unstable during training and therefore not usable in practice.    minor points: -Pg. 7 doesn't have all of its line numbers. -Double-Check math notations, as in pg. 7 var expression. -figure 4. doesn't seem to have a log scale. -section 2.4 notations are confusing, a network diagram/more explaining of notations or anything the authors find useful should help. -lines 124 -139 are unclear, specifically the rotation invariance and information metric aspect (and here also, missing line numbers). -More straightforward outline: after reading the introduction, one expects that after the theory of the measure and density estimation (sections 2-4), there will be an application section. The "enforcing similarity" (section 5) follows, which relates to the training stage and distracts from the main point. There are too many mini-topics, which makes it harder for the reader to follow: for example, in section 4, density estimation branches off to simulation description, overfit analysis, and uncertainty analysis, which I find confusing.
