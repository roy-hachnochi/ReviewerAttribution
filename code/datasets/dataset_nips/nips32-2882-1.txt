The paper introduces a new concept of submodularity, which is called the adaptive sequence submodularity defined on directed graphs and hypergraphs. The sequence submodularity on directed graphs and hypergrahs has been already proposed for non-adaptive maximization by Tschiatschek et al. (AAAI17) and Mitrovic et al. (AISTATS18). Moreover, extensions of submodularity to adaptive optimization has been studied well for various concepts of submodularity. However, such an extension is not known for sequence submodularity. The paper is the first study to do it.  The adaptive sequence submodularity has many applications obviously, and thus I think the problem studied in this paper is very important.   The paper presents an adaptive greedy algorithm for maximizing the adaptive sequence submodular monotone functions. This guarantee is better by a factor 1-1/e even compared with the existing guarantees given by Tschiatschek et al. (AAAI17) and Mitrovic et al. (AISTATS18) for the non-adaptive sequence submodular functions. Because of this, the significance of this theoretical guarantee is also obvious. The authors also verified the performance of the algorithms through experiments whose settings are realistic.   Summing up, the paper introduces a new useful concept of submodularity, which has obviously many applications, and gives a new theoretical guarantee of a greedy adaptive algorithm improving upon the existing guarantee for special cases. These contributions are valuable both from the modeling and the theoretical aspects.   Update: After reading the author's rebuttal, I have chosen to maintain my score.
