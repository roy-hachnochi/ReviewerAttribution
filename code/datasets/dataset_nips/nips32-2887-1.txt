Very well written paper. Clear statement of contribution. Few assumptions made about reader's existing knowledge of stochastic gradients and online learning. Good review of existing methods, which supports motivation of proposed method. The new method itself is introduced analytically with assumptions that don't hold in practice, but addressed experimentally. Thorough experimental details and proof in appendix. The overall research is sound and makes a novel contribution, which appears to advance the state of the art of some machine learning tasks.
