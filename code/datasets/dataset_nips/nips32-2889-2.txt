This paper proposes a method to discover the biases of face and gender detection systems by optimizing the conditioning variables of a GAN using bayesian optimization. Additionally, this work also releases a dataset with gender and geographic region labels.  Pros: This is a well written paper Cons: The necessity of using a GAN is not well explained in the paper. As far as I understand, the objective in Eq 4 can also be optimized via querying the database created by the authors with the relevant conditioning variables \(theta\). There is no need to generate samples conditioned on \(theta\) using a GAN. At the bare minimum, querying would use better quality images for optimizing Eq 4. In ‘Validation of Image Generation’ (Section 4) it would be helpful if authors provide a breakdown of quality ratings with both geographic region and gender (the authors do mention that there was “no significant difference” in lines 230-231, but I’d still like to see the scores for the sake of completeness.). Additionally, FID scores for each region and gender would also give further insight into the quality of images generated by the GAN. Such a search procedure is most likely an overkill for a parameter vector that has only 8 possible values (4 (geographic region) x 2 (gender); as explained in the ‘Data’ section)  Post Rebuttal comments: I would like to thank the authors for their detailed response. As far as I know, GANs generally do not generate images with a greater variety than the dataset they have been trained on (as claimed by the authors on line 34 of the feedback), however I do agree with the authors that one could sample more images using a GAN. In light of their response I have upgraded the rating to accept. In the camera ready version, I would additionally like to see a comparison of the face detection failure rate of GAN + BO and Querying + BO.
