*the paper is very well written; main ideas are explained clearly; results are presented mathematically rigorously    *I have only a view comments which refer to comparing the proposed strategy to taking just the last iterate:    -Algorithm 1:  when I understand correctly, one has to calculate all iterates up to t=2T-1 and needs to store all iterates from t=T up to t=2T-1 -is the map t --> A_t  monotone under the assumption of (strong) convexity ? this question refers to the choice of T* in Algorithm 1 - wouldn't any t \geq T* also do the job? ... the best choice would possibly be the argmin of all t satisfying the condition in l.16 (which is possibly the last iterate)  -could you comment on this?   *the benefit of this strategy compared to just taking some kind of averaging seems clear; but I do not see the benefit compared to taking the last iterate
