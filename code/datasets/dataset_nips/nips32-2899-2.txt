The paper makes an important contribution to the literature of SGD optimization algorithms in that it introduces an algorithm that achieves (1) last round convergence, (2) allows for sparsity constraints imposed by regularizer, and (3) achieves the optimal convergence rate. The algorithm is a simple variant of the SCMD algorithm. The original version either gets (1) and (2) with suboptimal (up to a log T factor) convergence rate, or with time-averaging achieves (3). The main change in this paper is a subroutine that searches for a specific round that admits the optimal convergence rate, the existence of such a round is guaranteed by the fact that time-averaging gets optimal convergences; searching for such a round, however, is non-trivial.  Experiments on real-world dataset clearly show the competitive edge of the new algorithm.
