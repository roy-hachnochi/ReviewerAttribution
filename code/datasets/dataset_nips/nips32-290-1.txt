The work is a solid contribution towards refining privacy-preserving bayesian linear regression, in which the bayesian interpretation is handled correctly even after injecting privatization noise. Several methods of implementing these models are explored, and the theory behind these changes are evidenced by empirical tests.  Originality: the MCMC based method appears to mainly be a direct use of a mostly off-the-shelf idea, but the derivations of the Gibbs updates for the sufficient statistics based model are novel. Related work and appropriate comparisons are cited.  Quality: The work is a solid complete contribution, with propositions backed up by empirical tests.  Clarity: the work is clearly written and structured.  Significance: the work greatly improves over the naive baseline, and the sufficient statistics method is shown to also be nicer than the MCMC method while achieving comparable results.
