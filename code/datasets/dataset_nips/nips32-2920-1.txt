originality:  Incremental. Guided by the theoretical results, this paper proposes to find a function by Randomized Coordinate Descent in each step of boosting.   quality:  The theoretical part and the proposed algorithm are sound. However, the proposed RGB is much slower than the original GB.   clarity: This paper is well written. However, the theoretical part is not easy to follow.  significance: Not clear, due to the experiments are in small toy data (UCI data), no results on large datasets.  cons: 1. My most concern is the speed of RGB for it will search multiple trees in each iteration. And I do not think Line 271-273 is correct, for the single tree learning in GBDT could be in parallel, such as XGBoost and LightGBM. Therefore, RGB will be much slower than GB. And experiment should have comparison over speed as well. 2. The used datasets in this paper are all small datasets from UCI. It would be better to have a comparison on large datasets, for we don't use small data in most real-world tasks.
