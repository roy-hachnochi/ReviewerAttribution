ORIGINALITY The originality of the work is somehow limited as it is porting the SSD approach for object detection to action localization. While I understand that the encoding of the sentence with the referring expression and the addition of the temporal dimension is novel, it is not a breakthrough idea either.  (after author's feedback)  The authors have better explained the novelty on how the sentence is encoded and linked with the video. The proposed approach is more novel than I understood after my original review.  QUALITY The reported results are state of the art in the presented datasets. However, as there are no comparative results in terms of frame/second or size of the model or memory footprint, the results are somehow incomplete.  CLARITY The text is a bit tedious to follow, especially when describing an architecture.  SIGNIFICANCE The significance of the work seems limited beyond setting new state of the arts in three benchmarks.
