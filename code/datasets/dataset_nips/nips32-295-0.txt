The paper deals with inverse problems addressed within the Bayesian framework. More precisely, the prior for the unknown object is defined through a given set of candidate objects (data-driven prior). The paper proposes a solution for the question of hyperparameter tuning and it is original regarding this point. It clearly propose an advance of the state of the art for a class of important problems.   The paper is technically sound and clear written.
