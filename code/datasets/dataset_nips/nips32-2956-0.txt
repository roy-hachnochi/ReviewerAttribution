Originality: To the best of my knowledge, the work presented in this paper is quite novel.  Clarity: The paper is well written and well structured.   Quality: The paper advances the understanding of CasDF with strong well proved theoretical results. Moreover, the derived algorithm makes sense, and the experimental analysis is strong enough.  Significance: The theoretical result of the paper is in my opinion important and useful to the field. The experiments show improvement over the baselines in all setting. One missing detail in the results is to report average performance with standard deviation to show the significance of this improvement, especially that some results are close to each other.
