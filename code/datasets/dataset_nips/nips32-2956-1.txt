[response to authors] I’ve read all reviewers’ comments and the authors’ response letter. I think this work has theoretical novelty in understanding CASDF and has experimental support. It will be valuable to the field for future studies. Comments are addressed. Overall, I will keep my score.  -------------------------- This paper provides a new perspective to understand and explain the cascade deep forest, and proposes a margin distribution reweighting approach to minimize the gap between the generalization error and empirical margin loss, which produces much better model performance. The method is supported by mathematical theories and empirical experiments. The theories and proofs are clear and solid. Experiment settings and results are clear.
