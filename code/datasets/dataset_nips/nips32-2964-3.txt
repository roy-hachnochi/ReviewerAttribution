** I noticed that one of the files in the codes-for-reproducibility, submitted by the authors, contains a name-like-string which could possibly be of authors (see dmuxspec.yml). This happened after having formed an opinion about the submission, fortunately, but I am not sure if this is a violation of reviewer's code of conduct (or equivalent).**   I believe that the submission could be something much more than a 'self-learning version' of Sinha, Namkoong and Duchi [9], if the authors put additional efforts in persuading the readers of the importance of the proposed notions, e.g. minimum supervision ratio and SSM Rademacher complexity. For the readers who are already familiar of the results in [9] or [11], I do not think Theorem 1, 2, or 3 *per se* would come as surprising or significant; the proof ideas are already quite well-established. Instead, I will be more interested in the nature of newly suggested notions, such as MSR, and an in-depth analysis on the objects would be a more contributing fraction of the submission. For example, it would be quite interesting to see if MSR could be characterized explicitly under simple scenarios, from which one could understand the dependencies of MSR to various parameters.  Here are a few minor remarks: 1. I noticed that in section 1.2, authors use distributional robustness learning quite interchangeably with adversarially robustness, which are quite different subjects to me, in the sense that the latter is more about pointwise perturbations instead of distributional. 2. Is n equal to n_l + n_{ul}? This could cause unnecessary confusion, as in Section 1.1. n is introduced as a cardinality of the dataset D = {Z_1, ... Z_n}, without any context of being semi-supervised. 3. Missing a space between sentences, at line 222. 4. Typo at line 246, denot -> denote. 5. Some readers may be interested in seeing the choice of model in the main text, to be more critical about the robustness guaranteeable by semi-supervised methods. 6. The title of the reference [20] should be "Monge blunts Bayes:...," if I am correct.
