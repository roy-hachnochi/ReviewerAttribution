This paper combines spike-slab prior, SGMCMC and stochastic approximation to prune the structure of neural networks. The author proposes to use SA to optimize the meta parameters, such as spike-slab selection parameter gamma, and use SGMCMC to get the posterior distribution of weights.  Right now the pruning seems to be done in a per scalar fashion. It would be morenteresting if the authors could study more structural version of pruning. E.g. use spike-slab to select which pathway to turn on and off, so we can have more structured sparsity pattern that can be speedup more easily.  Most of the current experimental study are focused on small neural networks, what would it take to scale the experimental results to bigger datasets and models? We could also argue that SG-MCMC-SA works better for small neural network domain. Some discussions on this would be helpful.
