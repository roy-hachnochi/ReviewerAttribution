This work treats the sparse weight distribution as a mixture of Gaussian distribution, and use Focused Quantization to quantize the sparse weights. The integrated quantization and pruning method help compress the model size. Recentralized Quantization uses MLE to find the appropriate hyperparameters and Shift Quantization uses powers-of-2 values to quantize a single high-probability region.  In terms of the compression algorithm, the idea is novel and makes a lot of sense. In Section 3.6, there is a small mistake, the variational free energy should be represented as L (θ, α, Φ). Since α is responsible for the cross-entropy loss and Φ is composed of hyperparameters that are related to the discrepancies between the weight distributions before and after quantization, it is not included in the set Φ.  In terms of the computation reduction, the powers-of-2 values can replace integer multiplications with shift operations which is cheap for hardware implementation. However, in this work, the whole pipeline is too complicated.  In line 258, the authors mentioned that they have only one high-precision computing unit. However, the Recentralized Quantization actually introduces two high-precision parameters, μ, and σ (in addition, for each weight, these two params are different). The dot products in this paper, therefore, requires more high-precision multiply-adds units.   This paper is well-written and easy to follow, except some figures are confusing. For example, in the last two blocks of Fig. 2, the meaning of y_axis should be defined clearly. Also in Fig.4, it seems that the standard deviation σ is missing.  The experimental results are solid. However, this paper mainly presents a quantization method over sparse weights. The real effectiveness of this quantization scheme is not well evaluated. The authors should provide a comparison of their model between the model after pruning but before quantization to demonstrate the quantization performance.
