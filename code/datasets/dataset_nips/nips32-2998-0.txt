In general the paper is well written and easy to follow. I have couple questions about the results of the paper. See the comments below.    The main concern is on the significance of the results. In particular, are the results in Section 2 about the reparametrization, and the result in Section 3 about the concentration of Markov chain mean estimation significant? The results look very interesting to me, but I am not familiar with this field. Other reviewers may have better judgement.     Another concern is that the proposed algorithm needs the knowledge of P, as it is used to compute the stopping rule. This dependence makes the algorithm much less practical.   Questions about the results: 1. Is the R_a term natural in Lemma 2? It seems to be a bit technical  2. Is the lower bound result in Section 3 under the same conditions with other references? For example, compared to [DZ98] and [Lez98]? 3. Does the algorithm need to know \phi?   Minor comments: 1. Line 81-83: \mathcal{X} and \mathcal{S} are not unified. 2. Line 91. What is y_m? 3. Line 205, P_{(q,\mu)} is not defined. 4. Line 248 and 250, how are \hat{\mu}_a(N_a(t)) and \hat{\mu}_a(t) defined?   ================ After rebuttal: Thanks for the reply. The rebuttal confirms that the algorithm needs some sort of knowledge of P. I think it needs some further justification why this is not a serious concern, or it should be stated explicitly. As it is also pointed out by Reviewer #4, the claims in section 3 are misleading.  The comparison of The results of [Lez98], [DZ98], and Theorem 1 should be more rigorous and careful. I will keep my original score.
