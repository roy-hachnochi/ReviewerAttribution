This submission presents two new and expressive types of normalizing flows where computation of Jacobian determinant is efficient. The main problem that I see is a rather linear presentation of the background material and the main theoretical contribution. The easy fix to the former would be to introduce a table that lists different normalizing flows, specifies any assumptions (e.g. volume preserving, diagonal Jacobian), lists computation costs, etc. The benefit of such simple addition would be immense. The easy fix to the latter would be to produce a diagram to illustrate what CONF is, how different sections are related to each element of it. Another problem that I see is that in a number of cases I see proofs by statement (...appears to be particularly well suited to capture structure in images and audio signals...) and procedural descriptions ("we do that, then we do that". E.g. for normalization, we use a data dependent initialization transform....). Each of these cases needs to be properly referenced and argued for by describing the problem, detailing possible solutions and then picking one that you argue is the best one to use.   Overall, I believe that the submission is sufficiently original, lacks quality and clarity in some respects and is of sufficient significance to the specialists in normalizing flow community.   Following authors feedback and other reviewers comments I hope that the authors will address the issues raised in an adequate fashion. Under this assumption I raised my score by 1.
