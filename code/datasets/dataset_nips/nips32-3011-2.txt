Originality: Whilst previous research may have been headed in this direction (perhaps Zheng et al. 2017), this paper has fleshed out those previous ideas fully and produced an excellent architecture. The paper is adequately cited.  Quality:  The submission is a complete piece of work, in that it clearly explains the background theory and achieves excellent empirical results. The authors take care to compare their model fairly to other normalising flows (e.g. controlling the network capacity to be the same as that used in other architectures when finding flow parameters).  Clarity:  The paper is well-written and easy to understand.  Significance:  I expect this architecture to become a useful tool for future ML research and applications.
