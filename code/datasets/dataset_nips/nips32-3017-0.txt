- The contribution is not clear in the introduction section.  - The related work is not sufficiently included in the paper.  -  The theoretical results in the paper are interesting. Especially, the characterization of the convergence rate of the continuous algorithm in (13). The different discrete optimization algorithms are recovered by using the Forward-Euler scheme. The main missing part is related to the discussion of convergence rate results after doing the discretization. How does the rate in (13) extend to the discretized version of the algorithms?  *Minor comments*  Line 15: "algorithms to perform"--> "algorithms perform"  Line 89: "gradiet"  Line 44: There is a (!) sign there, I wonder if something is missing
