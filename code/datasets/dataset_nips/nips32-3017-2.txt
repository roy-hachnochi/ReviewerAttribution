1. This is a terse paper but it is extremely well-written.  2. How novel is Theorem 4.1? I am wondering if the system of equations in (9-11) given the action functional in (6) can be derived using existing techniques, say the ones in Casgrain and Jaimungal (2018 a,b,c).  3. The convergence rate in (13) is particularly interesting. Can you comment on the scaling of the stochastic term with time? 4. The development in Section 5 leaves a lot to be desired because it has a number of debilitating assumptions. The model for grad f = sigma W^f_t on Line 222 is very basic; it is only accurate towards the end of optimization when the system is near a critical point. Similarly, the linear state-space model in Section 5.2 assumes that each component of the gradient is an independent linear diffusive process; this is not at all realistic. Can you give examples where the Bregman Lagrangian leads to existing or new optimization algorithms without such assumptions?
