The authors picked a relevant problem and the approach they propose looks reasonable. I have two major concerns:(i) the methodology assumes that the latent representation encodes similarities between networks. This can behave very different from what the authors intended (see Donnat and Holmes in AOAS) since different measures of similarity on graph space may lead to radically different results when clustering; (ii) There is literature for modelling multiple networks via latent variables. It is not clear how the proposed method relates to established approaches (Gollini and Murphy, Nielsen and Witten).  The results from the real data sets look promising.
