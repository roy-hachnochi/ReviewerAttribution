This paper proposes a novel algorithm to utilize the data with missing views, and the algorithm shows the superior performance. Strength: 1) The proposed strategy of handling view-missing is novel and elegant compared with existing strategies. I agree that most existing methods [5][8][16] are not flexible especially for the data with large number of views and complex missing patterns. 2) The theoretical analysis of completeness and versatility is a good support for the success of the learned multi-view representation, which is inspiring for the field of multi-view learning. 3) The designed clustering-like loss is interesting and a good choice for small-sample-size data. Moreover, the conducted experiments are extensive, and the proposed model achieves better results consistently.  Minor comments: (1) It will be better if the authors could provide analysis about the computational cost, and release their code, since there may be potential applications for the method.  (2) In Figure 4, different clusters correspond to different digits, so can you label the clusters with corresponding digits?
