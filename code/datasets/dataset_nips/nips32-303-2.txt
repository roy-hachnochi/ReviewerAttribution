The paper proposed a multi-view learning framework that is able to handle missing views. The improvement compared to state-of-the-art seem to be the preservation of versatility with the new formulation, and better numerical results shown in section 3.  I increased my rating after reading the authors' feedback.  The paper is clear and related algorithmic steps/analysis are well presented. I like the discussion on the consistence and complementarity while establishing the framework.   The technical part (1)-(5) is intuitive and easy to follow, although the existence prove in prop 2.1 does not bear much guarentee on the versatility of (5), which requires a more in-depth study of its solution property.   Together with the results in supplement, the evaluation part is comprehensive with alternatives compared and discussed. I would encourage the authors to share their implementation for reproducibility and future works on partial multi-view learning.
