This paper is well-organized and well-written. The targeted research problem is well-defined and the proposed solution looks reasonable and promising. However, I have some concerns about the proposed method.   1. In the computation of the topological loss, it is critical to find the matching between the point sets of the estimated and true persistence diagrams. How to efficiently find the optimal matching is not very clear in the paper.   2. Because of the high computational cost of the persistence diagrams, the paper works on small patches. Will the topology of the combined patches be consistent with the original whole image? How to handle the boundaries between patches?   3. According to the results, the proposed method overperforms the existing methods in terms of the topology-relevant metrics but underperforms some methods in terms of the segmentation accuracy. In my opinion, the segmentation accuracy does not conflict with the topological consistency. Could the proposed method maximize the performance on both types of metrics? If not, how about a post-processing method that preserves the topology? In this way, perhaps we could obtain a segmentation result having both high accuracy and correct topology.
