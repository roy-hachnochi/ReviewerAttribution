Originality: The idea is very inspiring in the paper. Motivated by GNN and over-parameterized neural networks, a Graph Neural Tangent Kernel is presented.  Quality: The presented algorithm seems technical sound. The experimental results are good. My concern is that there are too many parameters to search in such small datasets, make it very difficult to use in practice.   Clarity: The paper is well written. The authors have nicely introduced the algorithm and the theory behind that. I like figure 1 which shows how to transform the GNN to GNTK.  Significant: Currently, theoretical studies for GNN is rather limited in the research community.  This paper would enhance theoretical studies in this area.
