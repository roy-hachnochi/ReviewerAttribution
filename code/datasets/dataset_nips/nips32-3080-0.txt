Update: increased score due to concerns being addressed in author response  - Originality That integrating Hamiltonian-type dynamics with symplectic integration achieves better results does not sound surprising. However, formally proving acceleration for standard strongly convex and convex models is by no means an easy task. To the best of my knowledge, this is first work to theoretically show symplectic integrators can achieve acceleration by integrating a specific type of ODE (i.e. the high-resolution polyak heavy-ball or NAG limiting ODE). Related works are sufficiently cited.  - Quality Overall, the submission is technically sound, mostly supplying full proofs for theorems and lemmas. However, there are slight technical issues that need to be addressed which I mention in section 5 of the review.  - Clarity The clarify is fair in general. I understand that condensing a supposedly 30+ pages theory paper into 8 pages is a daunting task, but I feel the the paper can be greatly improved in this aspect. See section 5 of the review for details.   - Significance See section 1 of the review.
