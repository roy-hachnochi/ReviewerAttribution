<Strength> - The motivation of the paper is clear and its contributions are clear (see section 1). - The method was well written. - Experiments are strong.   <Weakness> - The paper is overall well written, but the preliminary parts explaining 'softmax bottleneck' and 'mixture of softmax' was hard to understand without knowing the original papers.  - Need more ablation studies about the gate sharing ratio (r) and the number of sigmoids of the sigmoid tree (K) to provide further information about the proposed method to other researchers.  - (Misc) Why the method name is Mixtape? Line 132: missing latex reference (??)   --------------------------  The rebuttal addressed my concerns on their rebuttal.  I believe the author will provide more detailed analysis and experiments in the final paper.
