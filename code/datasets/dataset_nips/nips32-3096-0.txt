Quality:  The paper studies policy evaluation with smooth nonlinear function approximation in the batch setting. Authors consider the mean square projected bellman error as objective and cast it to saddle-point problem using convex conjugate trick to avoid double sampling (which is used in several works). The obtained saddle point problem is strongly concave with respect to the dual variable and nonconvex with respect to the primal variable.  Then, they extend SAGA to devise a variance reduced algorithm and provide it convergence rate to a stationary point. Some detailed comments:  - in line 116: the definition if the projection \Pi is wrong. \Pi is rather the orthogonal projection on the tangent space that passes by V_{\theta} and translated to the origin. I encourage the authors to go back the original paper of Maei et al. - in equation (9): the objective J(\theta) should be devided by 1/2 because the conjugate of 1/2||x||^2 is 1/2||x||^2.  - Authors seem to use interchangeably stationary point and saddle point. while a stationary point is not necessarily saddle point. Could authors explain why it is the case in their setting? - I encourage authors to show why assumption 1 implies the boundedness of the dual variables iterates. it is not obvious !!  - Also I am curious about the convergence rate of the algorithm without variance reduction i.e using vanilla stochastic gradient method.    Clarity:  The paper is pretty readable.   Originality:  The paper builds on many previous works: minimizing mean square projected bellman error, convex conjugate trick, SAGA for non convex smooth optimization. But the theoretical result is still novel and interesting.  Significance:   The paper would be stronger if it includes discussion on the algorithm solution in term of value function error and on  practical implementation as the algorithm involves computing a Hessian matrix. Besides, empirical results would be very appreciated.
