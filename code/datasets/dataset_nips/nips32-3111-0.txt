========= I have read the author rebuttal and the other reviews. I maintain my rating however as I pointed out in my review I would request the authors to add more clarity to the method section. ========= This paper presents a label tree and deep learning based method for solving extreme classification problems. Proposed method essentially learns a Parabel like label tree (but shallow and wide) and then instead of using linear classifiers it uses attention based neural network to send training points to the respective nodes. In terms of clarity the paper could certainly be improved, particularly the method section. From the current text it is very hard to figure out what exactly the proposed method is doing. Nevertheless the proposed method outperforms a very hard to beat baseline and hence would be an important contribution to the extreme classification community. Another area where I felt paper could be improved is the explanation of why the method works so well? Is it because the linear classifiers used in parabel weren't powerful enough to correctly classify the points or is it that they simply used bag-of-words features and ignored the semantic meaning of the sentence. Finally it is also not clear to me why the proposed method performs well on tail labels.
