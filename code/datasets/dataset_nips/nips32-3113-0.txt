Originality:  There is no prior work that attempts HER in visual domains without explicit goal conditioning. This work is the first one to do this. The designing and training on HALGAN seem rather standard and similar to InfoGAN.   Quality: This paper is technically sound and the performance of HALGAN + HER is validated in two environments.   Clarity: This paper is well written and easy to follow. The details are adequate for readers to understand and reproduce the paper.  Significance: While the authors hope this method could be a step to reducing the sample complexity of training RL and eventually training agents in the real world. The environments shown in the paper are primitive. It is easy to synthesize images in these two environments while it is not clear how HALGAN will perform in diverse and realistic 3D indoor scenes.
