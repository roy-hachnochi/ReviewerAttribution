The proposed architecture is novel but limited to the benchmarks. The curriculum learning has been already explored. Moreover, in terms of significance, how improving the performance in this task would be beneficial to real-world problems remains unclear. The presentation and clarity can be also improved please consider followings.   - The description of the target task is unclear.  - The definition of X_k at L151 is wrong. It confused me a lot and I thought that X_k is a set containing everything. I think the union operation should be replaced with a Cartesian product.  - How can you be sure that the performance gain is from mitigating the effects of distracting features (L55)? The use of the curriculum does not directly mean mitigating the effects of distracting features. Please justify this argument as your paper is based on this argument.
