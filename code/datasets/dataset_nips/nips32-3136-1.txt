1.    This paper is clearly written. The methodology section covers dense information. However, the subtitles before each paragraph make it easy to read. 2.    This paper formulates a regularization scheme for the negative transfer problem. The arguments in this paper follow rigorous mathï¼Œwhich makes the main idea convincing. 3.    The figures in this paper are nicely plotted. Fig.1 demonstrates the structure recovery properties of their proposed regularization term. Fig.2 shows that the spectral embedding does has a strong semantic power as promised in the paper. 4.  A minor issue is that some details of the optimization process are missing. More elaborations should be provided to improve clarity. (see also the Improvements part)
