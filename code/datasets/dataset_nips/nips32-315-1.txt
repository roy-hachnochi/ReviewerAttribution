The paper presents the problem meticulously by defining the different components affecting the freshness of the crawler.  In order to maximize the freshness, the problem is modeled as minimizing the cost of tracking defined through a harmonic staleness penalty function, where the authors elaborate on the choice of this harmonic function with sound reasons. The cost function is optimized according to how the change is observed in the source, whether complete or incomplete. The authors present two algorithms for each change type, supplemented with prepositions and their proof. These algorithms are cast into a model-based Reinforcement learning problem that tries to automatically learn the change/update rate of each source.         The paper lacks organization and proper presentation.  It relies on several details that are only presented in the supplement (extra ~15 pages).  As is, the paper is only a problem description and presentation of a proposed approach.   Hence, it is missing a conclusion, description of the dataset, details of the experiment and proper analysis.
