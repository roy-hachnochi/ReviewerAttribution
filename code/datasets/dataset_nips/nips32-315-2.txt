In this article, the authors propose methodology for scheduling a web crawler. They frame their scheduler as characterized by the solution to an optimization problem (that characterizes the cost of staleness). They show how to determine parameters of the scheduler when parameters of the environment are known. In addition, they extend their algorithm to learn parameters of the environment, and optimize against them when they are unknown. The authors additionally provide optimality guarantees for their methodology.  The article is generally very clear. The introduction and problem formulation do a great job of clearly presenting the problem. Near the end of the paper, I struggled with the exposition a bit more in the reinforcement learning section, though perhaps this section is necessarily dense (given space constraints of the paper, and the additional complexity of the section).  It wasn't clear to me in the case of complete change observations if the method proposed was optimal, or if was only that the optimal p_w were selected for strategies within that class. Some clarification here would be great.  It is noted that the first two problems are convex. The algorithms given solve each problem in O(|W|^2) [and it is stated that practically the run time is closer to linear]. It would be worth noting the run-time of a general interior point solver --- I imagine this is O(|W|^3).  The empirical experiments seemed well thought out, and fairly illustrative.
