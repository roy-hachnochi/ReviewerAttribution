The authors propose a double robust bandit algorithm for solving the contextual linear bandit problem. In particular, their algorithm is independent of N, the number of arms and instead depends on  the sparsity of the context. This is achieved by dipping into the missing data literature and adapting the doubly robust technique (Bang and Robbins 2005).  Experimental results are shown on synthetic datasets with varying correlation patterns between the context vectors.   Comments: Overall, the paper is well-motivated and written in a clear manner. Contextual settings are of vital interest in many real-world problems such as advertising and recommender systems. Reducing the dependence of regret to the sparsity of the context vector is of immense value since side information is usually very high-dimensional and sparse.
