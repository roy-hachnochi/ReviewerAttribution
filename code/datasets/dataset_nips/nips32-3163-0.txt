The authors tackle the clustering problem in the setting where each sample is only characterized by one of multiple modalities. They present an adversarial deep model with cycle consistency concerned to learn translations across modal spaces for unifying the representations. This model is evaluated on two datasets and shows the improvement over baselines.  Pros: - The paper is well-organized, especially the way the authors motivate the problem and present the solution. - The key problem being solved is novel and interesting to me. It seems to be the first work trying to deal with totally unpaired ‘multi-modal’ data without any other constraints to my best of knowledge. - The proposed method is capable of improving the clustering performance supported by empirical results. And, it seems to be a fresh perspective to interpret the learned cross-modal translations as the optimal transport plan between modal spaces.  Cons: - Further discussions about the proposed model should be made to complete my understanding, e.g., the relationship between generators. - Some technical details are not very clear or intuitive.  Typos: - Line 139: it may be more precise to use ‘parameter sets’ instead of ‘parameters’. - Line 157: there should be a ‘the’ before ‘discriminators’.
