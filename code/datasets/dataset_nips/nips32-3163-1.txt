This paper proposes a novel and challenging task that clusters data in multiple modalities without any pairing information, with a simple and reasonably workable approach to solve it.   The idea of cycle consistency is not novel since it has been already shown to be effective in addressing data with multiple modalities in the supervised setting. However, this work is the first trial to use this idea to solve the unpaired data clustering problem. Moreover, the authors demonstrate the connection between the proposed method and optimal transport, which may inspire the future work.  In general, this paper is well written and easy to follow.  The experimental results seem good. But the experiments are not that thoroughly executed for me. Some details should be elaborated and ablation study should be carried out.  As an application paper, for me, its most valuable part lies in the task it proposes. As I mentioned in the former part, our community could benefit from such a novel task which will bring forth various innovative work.  Typos: In Eq.(1), it seems that the summation symbol is missed. In line 170, ‘must be transport’ should be ‘must be transported’. In line 179, ‘are feed’ should be ‘are fed’.
