his paper aims at solving the clustering problem on mixed-modal data. Unlike traditional settings, the modalities involved in this paper are represented in the total absence of pairing information, thus are very hard to be aligned. So it is very natural to learn the transformation functions between modalities based on the cycle consistency principle. Moreover, the experimental results indicate that this idea indeed improves the unification of mixed-modal data representations and bridges the semantic gap. Overall, the presentation of this paper is detailed. However, some of the statements are not very clear so they should be re-organized. Also, there are few typos to be corrected. 1. Line 119, divided -> split. 2. Line 129, set -> sets.
