         1. Recent parallel work by Haurilet et al. "It’s not about the Journey; It’s about the Destination: Following Soft Paths under Question-Guidance for Visual Reasoning", CVPR 2019 is quite related as it also builds reasoning on scene graphs. However, this was published after NIPS deadline and deals mostly with synthetic images.          2. The supp. material provides ablation studies. In particular, it is good to see a 4% point difference between using region features vs. region concept labels -- highlighting that the symbolic approach is indeed useful. A few additional ablation experiments:         (a) Analyze the impact of errors in scene graph prediction. This seems like an important backbone especially as concept labels are being used rather than features. Is there any chance for recovery if the visual prediction makes mistakes?         (b) Bias in image question answering is well known where answering works well even without looking at the image. While VQA-CP does limit this to some extent, the proposed method uses a concatenation of the question and the "answer vector" m. What would be the performance without this concatenation? With multiple steps of reasoning, one could hope that this may not be as required as other models.          3. Overall the paper is well written and clear to understand. Code will be released. It might be nice to include one of the qualitative results from the supp. material as it highlights how the proposed approach works.         -------------------- Post-rebuttal: I'm happy to recommend accepting this paper. The rebuttal clarifies some of the additional questions raised by all reviewers.
