Summary:  This paper proposes black-box reduction methods from online learning with experts to that of tracking best shifting experts. In particular, the paper considers two settings, full information, and adversarial bandit setting, where the latter gives only feedbacks of chosen experts. The proposed algorithms achieve better bounds than previous work, as well as adaptive algorithms. For the bandit tracking problems, the paper also shows a lower bound of the regret.   Comments: The proposed black-box reduction from tracking experts to competing with a static optimal expert is new (as far as I know) and a breakthrough in the theory.   The algorithms are new but simple. The results looks feasible while I have not checked the details.   The technical contribution is substantial and I recommend this paper for acceptance.
