Originality: This is a nice combination using the vMF model and Hungarian matching. I really like the ideas here and the performance is great  Quality and Clarity: The basics are ok: citing related work, using those ideas to make your point, etc. But I feel that you miss some opportunities to make the work more accessible. You gave Algorithm 1, but it is hardly worth it, I needed more detail. Also, if you are going to give an algorithm block, why not for SDDM? Please clearly link the mathematical ideas to the algorithm? Likewise, the math jumps in hard to follow ways. You may laugh but I am not sure where the cost (164, 214 and 244) are coming from and how the ideas are represented in those formulas. The body of the paper reference nice mathematical ideas but I found it difficult to get the ideas. Significance: as I said above, the speed of this approach seems very valuable.
