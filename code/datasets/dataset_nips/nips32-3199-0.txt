This paper provides an active learning approach that targets both the selection of examples and the most suitable architecture to learn an image recognition classifier. The model searches for effective architectures while applying active learning. The authors apply three query techniques: softmax response, MC-dropout, and coresets. The authors show that the model outperforms a traditional active learning approach based on static architecture.  The paper is well-written and presented. The general idea of architecture learning is clearly not novel but what really matters is an instantiation of the idea. The authors present a concrete approach, which is reasonable and supported by some theoretical considerations.  However, I have some doubts on the generality of the results. The baseline architecture is included in the set of networks the model can generate this means that: (i) the approach cannot be claimed to improve a standard model for image classification as there are more powerful architectures; and (ii) the paper just shows that the proposed approach can select a richer architecture than the baseline.
