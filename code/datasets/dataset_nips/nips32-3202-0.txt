========================================================== After reading response, I do agree that getting the clean results and analysis is even nicer (compared to complicated analysis). It is also an important contribution to get the results for escaping saddle points for manifold. I will vote for acceptance. ==========================================================  The result is very nice. It's only slightly unsatisfactory that smooth assumption 3.2 and 3.3 are in terms of function dot retractions, which make these assumptions a bit indirect and hard to verify. It also hides interesting information about the geometry of manifold there.
