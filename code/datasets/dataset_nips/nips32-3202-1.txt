This paper is a nice extension on Jin et al's work. However, I have two concerns. First, the analysis is very similar to Jin et al's except a few steps that are needed to connect the gradient/Hessian of the original function and those of the pullback function. This reduces the novelty of this paper in its technical analysis a little bit.   Second, I am not sure how b can be estimated. Although in practice, many parameters can be tuned but I am not sure where to start when I have to tune b. Although in the examples in the paper b=+infinity, I believe there are cases where b is finite and unknown. For other parameters such as L and rho, we can at least give some estimation (may be conservative) but, for b, it is not clear how. Are there any examples where b<+infty and some conservative estimation of b are possible? ============================================== I have read the authors' response and I am satisfied with that. I will slightly increase my score.
