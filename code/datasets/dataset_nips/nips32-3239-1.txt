The authors attempt to imitate human cognition, allowing MAC attention to have continuous reasoning. This is achieved by incorporating neural ODEs  into the logits calculations per time stamp. This is original idea.  I find the writing facaniting, and the overall quality high. I was really excited to hear the paper inspiration is human cognition and continuous reasoning. It is important research goal to take inspiration from human behaviour. The issue with this work is the significance. The model and evaluation relies on a single model(MAC), and  not  used in other  types of  attention (e.g., Glimpses, Transformer Heads). This also limits the impact to a specific task (CLEVER), and the overall CLEVER accuracy stays the same.  The paper also discuss a new evaluation  method(TLT), which finds the amount of attention shifts. But this evaluation can only be tested with MAC-like models, which is not likely to remain a state-of-the-art model.
