This paper is a good survey paper that introduces unsupervised word translation methods, especially GAN based methods.  However, this is not a paper that proposes a new method of technique.  This could be a good workshop paper related with unsupervised translation lexicon acquisition, but is not enough for a full NeurIPS paper.
