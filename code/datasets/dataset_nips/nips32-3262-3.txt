The paper has provided an interesting approach to conduct learning from crap training data. Different from existing three-player works that lie in semi-supervised setting, this paper aims to investigate the underlying data generating scheme with the help of generator, and thus a different three-player game has been established to learn from crap data.   The authors have clearly illustrated the proposed algorithm. Beginning with a general optimization problem over probability distributions in the ambiguity set, the authors derived a tractable solution by introducing a generator to approximate the worst-case distribution and Wasserstein distance as the measure of distributions.   With the help of a generator network, the proposed algorithm actually implies a robust solution that can deal with the worst-case data distribution. Experimental results on real world dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of exploring the generation and classification tasks in a unified framework. Most importantly, the paper provided some theoretical analysis to better understand the properties and optimization of the proposed algorithm.
