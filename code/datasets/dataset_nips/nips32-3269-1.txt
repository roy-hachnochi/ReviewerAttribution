Update: I have read the authors' response and I am satisfied with the answers it provided.  ===========================================  This paper considers the problem of mixed linear regression, where training data comes from multiple ground truth signals. They establish nontrivial performance guarantees for the simple iterative trimmed least squares (ITLS) approach, which alternates between fitting a subset of the data and greedily re-choosing the subset of the data to fit on. First, they show that under certain moderately strong assumption, this procedure convergence linearly to one of the ground truth signals. Second, they show that by starting this procedure with exponentially (in the number of of ground truth signals) many initializations, the entire model can be recovered. This apparently improves upon and extends the best known guarantees for this setting.   I find the paper generally well-written and convincing; I believe it would make a nice contribution to NeurIPS. However, I am not sufficiently familiar with the related work to confidently estimate the significance of the results. I also did not carefully check the (technically involved) proofs in the supplementary material. Hence my low confidence score. Below are some additional comments and questions.  1) The main result is rather difficult to sparse and requires reading a number of technically dense pages. I believe that additional informal statements of Theorems 7 and 11 will significantly improve readability.  2) What is c_0 in Theorem 7? I could not find its definition.  3) Theorem 7 does not say anything about the probability 1-delta with which the results holds and how it factors into the complexity (does it affect n? \kappa?). I would appreciate explicit dependence on delta in the theorem statement. A similar comment holds for Lemma 5. Alternatively, you may fix delta to be poly(1/d) (the large parameter in the problem), but this would probably add an additional factor of log d to the expression for n.  4) The notation tau_{(j)} in Definition 3 is confusing, as by the previous notation tau_{(j)} should mean the fraction of examples belonging to signal j (similarly to S_{(j)} vs. S_{(j)}^\star), but you use is it to denote something else. Please use another notation.  5) What do you mean by "centered sphere" in line 5 of Algorithm 2?  6) The "Mixed linear regression" paragraph in page 3 features some overly long and difficult to parse sentences, for example in lines 105--108.  6) Some typos: - Line 144: size subset -> "" - Line 157: literatures -> literature - Line 173: "with size \tau_{(j)}^\star" -> "with size n \tau_{(j)}^\star" - Line 204: Affine -> The affine
