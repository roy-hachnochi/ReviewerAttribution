Originality: The task is new to me. Adding noise for GAN training is not new. The guess discriminator seems new to me.  Quality: The paper's claim is supported by its experiment results. I think this is a complete piece of work.  Clarity: The paper is ok with clarity. I'd like to see a detailed model structure, especially for the guess discriminator.  Significance: The paper proposed a few metrics to evaluate the quality of the model, which could be very useful for comparing different methods. Unfortunately, in this paper there were no other methods to compare with. So it is hard to say if their method is much better than existing methods.
