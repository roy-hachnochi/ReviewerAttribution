Originality: the methods per se are not new, but their combination is new, thus resulting in a new model. The authors describe that the state of the art is kalman filters to estimate trajectories from neural signals. KF is not a proper model for changing signals. However, I miss a specific state of the art description of models for non-stationary signals. I performed a very fast search of possible related papers and this topic has been previously addressed. Because these are not reported, comparison to other methods is not performed. Quality: i like the approach proposed by the authors because it can deal with noise as well as changing discriminative neurones. Their results support this claim. Clarity: this paper is clearly written. Significance: this approach is complete because it deals with noise and changing discriminative signals. Significance is difficult to evaluate due to lack of comparison to other techniques dealing with the same  problem.
