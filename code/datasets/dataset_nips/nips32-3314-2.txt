Originality: low The proposed method looks the variant of Cycle-WAGN [7] that changes the consistency loss to class-wise loss.  Quality: middle The proposed method shows better performance by a large margin and ablation study shows that proposed loss works well. One question is the result that apply Cycle-WGAN [7] in the proposed setting because the proposed method is similar to [7]. Another question is that the high performance of the proposed method arises from ts that is the accuracy for unseen class. Therefore I think the contribution is for zero-shot learning part more than generalized zero-shot learning part. If it is true, I am curious about the comparison of the methods in the standard zero-shot learning setting with the state-of-the-art zero-shot learning methods.  Clarity: high The paper is easy to follow and the proposed algorithm is well described.  Significance: middle Though the proposed method experimentally works well, it is not clear if the performance gain comes from the success of generalized zero-shot learning or simply the success of zero-shot learning. Also, given Cycle-WGAN, the technical contribution seems small.  After Rebuttal I increase the score because the rebuttal address my concerns about the difference to Cycle-WGAN and the implication of the score ts.
