Section 2, line 62 - what is c) , what method groups does it refer to?  Sect. 3.2 line 129-131 are written unclear, a better explanation might help for the intuition of the equation (5).  "CGAN WITH PROJECTION DISCRIMINATOR", Miyato 2018, are another type of conditional GAN, which is different than the (a) and (b) types from Section 2. They also decompose the loss of a GAN into marginal and conditional ratios, which is part of the GOLD motivator definition.   A recent paper "Metropolis-Hastings (MH) Generative Adversarial Networks",Turner2018 uses the discriminator values to create a sampling procedure for better inference in GANs. Since the current paper uses rejection sampling (which can be inferior to MH) it can be good to discuss whether GOLD can work with MH and what performance to expect -- e.g. put this in Figure 2 in the experiments. Discriminator calibration is also a relevant concept from that paper.  Sec. 3.2 equation (7) -- please discuss in more detail why the entropy is used to estimate unknown classes, and how this related to uncertainty in the prediction of the most probable class.  Experiments 4, line 180 - why are 3 different GAN architectures used, one can do every experiment with ALL 3 of the chosen architectures? Or are there some limitations for data  and model?  Sec. 4.3 line 245 -- the G and D training scheme re-initialization seems heuristic, the intuition can be better explained  line 255 -- it is unclear what is shown in column 2 and 3 in Figure 4. please clarify
