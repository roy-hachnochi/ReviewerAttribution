The authors propose to apply attribution maps to quantify the transferability of deep models, and achieves reasonably accurate results with much faster estimation speed.   The approach is, despite simple, quite novel and reasonable. Unlike the taskonomy one that relies on training pairwise or higher-order transfers using annotations, the approach raised here requires no labels and runs very fast. Extensive results demonstrate the validity of the proposed approach.   The manuscript is written well; the approach is well motivated, interesting, and practical, as it finds its application in scenarios where pre-trained models are available yet no annotations are provided. The approach could be potentially inspiring to a large audience.  ___ After rebuttal After reading all the review comments and the author feedback, I keep my original score. I think this paper makes a good contribution to NeurIPS.
