Reparameterization of VAE with continuous random variables has been developed well, no matter from theory or application views. In this paper, the authors provide an optimization technique that propagates (biased) gradients through the reparameterized argmax. Based on it, the authors develop discrete VAE. The manuscript is full of theoretical analysis and experimental results to help readers understand their method and motivation. I have some small suggestions. 1) The size of legend in third subfigure in Fig.3 should be consistent with that in other subfigures. 2) In figure 5, the authors choose 8 discrete attributes of CelebA to learn the model. They only exhibit three simple semantics turned on/off. Could you give more results in the Supplementary material? 3) The providing code is good. Could you provide an algorithm of the method in the paper to help the readers, who do not have time to read the code, understand the work?
