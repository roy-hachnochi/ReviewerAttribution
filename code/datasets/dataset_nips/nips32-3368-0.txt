# After rebuttal  Thank you very much for the response. I will try to further elaborate my comments below.  Proposition 4.2 This result is actually the key to unlocking the contributions of the paper and not Lemma 3.2. Apologies if my review was not clear on this.  I have checked the updated proof and your arguments are mathematically correct. However, I still have problems with the constants. In particular, a minor issue is that for n >= n_0 and cases with c_5 > 1 the bound is not tight. A problematic part is the case with n < n_0 and c_4 > 1. Observe that c_4 = c_3 exp ((c_1 / c_2) n_0^{1\d}) and that in the latter case k_{X_n}(x, x) <= c_3 exp ((c_1 / c_2) (n_0^{1\d} - n^{1/d})) with n_0^{1\d} - n^{1/d} > 0, which implies that exp ((c_1 / c_2) (n_0^{1\d} - n^{1/d})) > 1. The bound is worse than c_3 alone which holds for all x, irrespective of n. Thus, the updated bound does not really guarantee that for n < n_0 one will observe decay of exp (-n^{1/d}). In my understanding, the result only guarantees _asymptotic_ decay of exp(-n^{1/d}).  Lemma 3.2 In my view, this result follows from Lemma 3.1 directly. Observe that Lemma 3.1 tells you that k_{X_l}(x, x) is the squared distance from the evaluation functional k(x, *) in RKHS to its projection onto the span of the evaluation functionals centered at instances from X_l (I am omitting q(x) because that can be considered as an importance weight and does not change anything). If all the evaluation functionals define a linearly independent set of vectors the kernel matrix is non-singular (n instances with n >= l). If the set is linearly dependent then there exists an evaluation functional (i.e., vector) in the span of others. For that particular vector, the distance to its projection onto the span will be zero. So, Lemma 3.2 says the set of evaluation functionals is either linearly independent or linearly dependent.  #  The paper studies convergence properties of adaptive Bayesian quadrature methods. This class of quadrature methods deals with an integrand for which it is known beforehand that it satisfies a certain constraint such as being positive. The main idea is to introduce a link function and apply it to the output of a latent function such that the resulting composition of the two functions satisfies the desired constraint. The latent function is modeled with a Gaussian process and the so called design points are selected deterministically by optimizing an acquisition function. The paper considers a generic acquisition function that covers several of the previously proposed strategies for selecting design points in the context of adaptive Bayesian quadrature methods.  The first theoretical result provides an upper bound on the approximation error of adaptive Bayesian quadrature methods in terms of posterior variance under fairly standard assumptions (Proposition 2.1).  Following this, the upper bound based on the posterior variance is related to [1] where a weak greedy algorithm is considered with an asymptotic convergence guarantee. The greedy algorithm [1] restricted to a Hilbert space deals with an approximation of the inner product on that space using the inner product defined on a subspace spanned by some landmarks. The landmarks are selected iteratively so that they are at least \gamma-fraction of the optimal choice. The quality of the approximation is measured by first projecting the original space to the subspace spanned by the landmarks and then taking the distance between a point from the original space that is furthest away from the span. This link from Proposition 2.1 to the weak greedy algorithm from [1] hinges on Lemmas 3.1 and 3.2. These two lemmas are fairly well-known results and follow directly from [2, 3] (the results can also be found in some derivations of the Nyström method). In my opinion, these two lemmas are not entirely novel and should be credited to previous work.  Theorem 3.3 gives an asymptotic convergence guarantee for adaptive Bayesian quadrature methods. For the purpose of deriving convergence rates, the paper introduces the notion of Kolmogorov n-width (Section 4). In essence, it is the worst case approximation error for the best possible choice of the landmarks. Denoting the Kolmogorov n-width with d_n and the weak greedy approximation error with e_n, the following inequality can be established d_n <= e_n.  Given that d_n <= e_n, it is not entirely clear from the paper itself how an upper bound on d_n implies an upper bound on e_n (Lemma 4.1). It would be nice to provide a clarification of this claim in any future version of the paper (appending part (i) from [1, Corollary 3.3]).  Section 4.1 goes beyond asymptotic convergence and provides explicit convergence rates for adaptive Bayesian quadrature methods. I have some concerns regarding the proofs from this section and will try to clarify them below.    # Section 4.1 (Convergence rates) & Appendix C  I fail to see why the proof of Proposition 4.2 holds and will try to clarify my concerns (Appendix C, lines 480--488).  i) k_{X_n} (x, x) <= exp (-c_1 / h_{X_n, \Omega}) holds for some constant c_1 and sufficiently small h_{X_n, \Omega} ii) h_{X_n, \Omega} = c_2 n^{-1 / d} holds for some constant c_2 and {x_i} selected so that they are equally-spaced grid points of \Omega  iii) (i) and (ii) ==> k_{X_n} (x, x) <= exp (- (c_1 / c_2) n^{1 / d} ) for large enough n  iv) there exists a constant c_3 such that k_{X_n} (x, x) <= c_3 for all n and for all x \in \Omega  ----- ??? ----- v) k_{X_n} (x, x) <= c_3 exp (- (c_1 / c_2) n^{1 / d} ) for all n and for all x subject to {x_i} being equally spaced. ----- ??? -----  I can follow the reasoning in (i)-(iii) and have no problems with any of the claims in (i)-(iv). However, I cannot see why the upper bound in (v) would hold for all n. In particular, we have that (iii) holds only for large enough n which can be so large that we will never select that many points in adaptive Bayesian quadrature methods. The claim in (iv) holds for all n and for all x but as n gets larger the term exp (- (c_1 / c_2) n^{1 / d} ) << 1 and, thus, the right-hand side of (v) can fail the upper bound from (iv) for some n. Such n might also not be sufficiently large for (iii) to hold.  Now, this is an important result and failure to demonstrate a convergence rate in Proposition 4.2 implies that Theorem 4.3 does not hold either. This further implies that Corollary 4.4 does not hold and there are no explicit convergence rates for adaptive Bayesian quadrature methods. Please provide clarification for this in the rebuttal, as a mistake would take away the claimed contribution. I think there is a similar problem in Appendix C.4.1 with polynomial decay rates.
