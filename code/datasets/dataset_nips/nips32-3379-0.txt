originality: I don't know of any other results of this form, although the non-adaptive problem has been solved previously, and the unconstrained problem has been solved up to logs. minor nit: I don't think the version of lemma 1 in cutkosky2019 has log dependencies - it looks like lemma 1 is a special case of theorem 1 in cutkosky2019.  quality: This paper presents a clean solution to an important open problem in adaptive convex optimization. The techniques seem interesting and may be useful for other analyses.  I liked the use of optimism here and I think this in particular is an under-utilized type of guarantee that might have more applications.  clarity: the paper is clearly written. I found even the proofs in the appendices to be fairly painless to follow!  significance: This is paper solves an interesting open problem in adaptive stochastic convex optimization and so I believe its results to be significant.  -------------- I have read the author response and maintain my score.
