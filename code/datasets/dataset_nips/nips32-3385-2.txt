After rebuttal: The discussion of the method applicability in the rebuttal is convinced for me. I upgrade my score to 7.  This paper proposes a learning-based approach for combinatorial optimization problems. Starting from an initial complete solution of the problem, several local rewriting updates are applied to the solution iteratively. In each rewriting step, a local region and an updating rule are picked to update the solution and two networks are trained by reinforcement learning to pick local regions and updating rules. Experiments on expression simplification, job scheduling and vehicle routing problems are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.   The main concern of this paper is the applicable range of the proposed method is unclear. I think the local rewriting approach stands under several assumptions, the complete and legal solution is easily initialized, the reasonable local regions and updating rules can be manually defined, the rewards are densely distributed for solutions. It seems this approach may not work in the problem where we need to find a specific target and therefore the state transition is important. For example, in the problem of theorem proving, I don't think it could work to rewrite the proofs directly if we think proofs are the expected solutions, as stated in line 63. Also, how to design local regions and updating rules may be important and ambiguous in specific problems.   I agree that local rewriting should be applicable to a wide range of problems, but I think this range and underlying assumptions should be formally and explicitly clarified in the paper. For example, to demonstrate the targeted problems in the introduction. It could help to clarify the contributions of this work and explain the choices of tasks in experiments.
