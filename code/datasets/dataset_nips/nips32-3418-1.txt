- The paper is based on the similar motivation of previous studies on NMT with prototypes. The actual method, that uses extra encoders for additional information, looks also a usual way of the multi-source NMT settings. Though the originality is limited, the whole construction of the model looks well. In the formulation of the method, they discusses the difference between the proposed method and existing studies. - No enough analysis of the results found. The "Case Study" section does not distinguish their improvement against random changes. - The method is enough simple to reproduce in any existing toolkits, and readers may be able to implement the same method by reading the paper (though there are some formulation mistakes). - The translation quality improvement looks quite good, though they tested the methods by only syntactically similar language pairs.
