This paper proposes copula multi-label learning to explain the statistical properties of multi-label dependency. Copula has been widely used for multivariate data in many areas. To use copula in multi-label learning, the paper first leverages the kernel trick to estimate the multi-label distribution. The proposed model is estimated semiparametrically. Theoretical analysis is provided, and the error bound of the estimator is also given. The experiment validates the proposed method is better than existing methods.  Originality: The paper is original. Quality: The paper appears to be of high quality and contains a substantial theoretical advance. Clarity: The exposition is clear. Significance: This work is likely of significance to the community. I suggest acceptance of the paper.
