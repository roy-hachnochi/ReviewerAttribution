Due to wide applications, multi-label learning has become one of the most important research area in machine learning. However, the statistical properties of existing multi-label dependency modelings are not well understood. To provide the statistical understandings for multi-label learning, this paper proposes a new copula multi-label learning paradigm for modeling label and feature dependencies. The continuous distribution in the output space is first constructed by leveraging the kernel trick in this paper, and then the proposed model is estimated semi-parametrically. Moreover, this paper shows that the proposed estimator is an unbiased and consistent estimator and follows asymptotically a normal distribution, and they further provide the bound for the mean squared error of estimator. The experiment validates the performance of the proposed method.
