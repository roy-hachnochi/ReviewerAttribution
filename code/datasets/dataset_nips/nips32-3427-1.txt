**************** Thanks for the detailed response, which addressed most of my concerns (based on some promise). Given the space constraint of the rebuttal, I will trust the authors to indeed incorporate the changes as promised, and given this I increased my score. *****************  This paper proposes a novel method to do structure learning for SPNs. However, at several places in this paper, it is too dense to follow. More detailed comments are as follows. First, this paper lacks a dedicated related work section. There is some brief discussion about how this work differs from existing literature, in the introduction, yet it is not enough. Section 2 is called "Background & Related works". However, I would say 95% of this section is just background knowledge on SPNs. More importantly, this paper lacks coverage about related works that are not about SPNs but on some other dialects of tractable graphical models (for example, cutset networks and probabilistic sentential decision diagrams, etc.) Second, it is not easy to follow exactly how a computation graph is constructed from a region graph. Here, having an example figure would be of great help. Furthermore, it seems Figure 1 never gets mentioned in the paper. And I am also not sure how to exactly interpret Figure 1 given no explanations accompany it. Third, this point is related to my first point. In experiments, I also encourage the authors to include results from structure learning methods on other dialects of tractable graphical models to form a real SOTA baselines. Also I encourage the authors to drop the arrows in the tables. They dilute the focus of the tables, which should be the bold/underlined numbers. Fourth, I am not quite convinced by the results on missing data. Mean imputation, the arguably most popular imputation method, is missing from the results. More importantly, I believe the baselines may be too weak. One natural way to deal with missing data is to run EM + MPE inferences. Fifth, in some sense, I am not quite convinced that the method proposed in this paper is a complete structure learning algorithm, as the region graph and hence the computation graph is predefined. In other words, this paper’s structure learning is solely on learning the scope functions. Perhaps learning the scope functions alone is enough? If so, can the authors provide a compelling for it?
