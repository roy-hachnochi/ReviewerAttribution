Originality: The proposed compression scheme involves significant novelty. The paper clearly cites the prior work and contrast its contribution from the prior work. As claimed in the paper, this paper proposes the first compression scheme (along with tight up to constants) that characterizes the effect of underlying sparsity on the communication-cost and MSE trade-off for the DME problem across all sparsity regimes.  Quality: As far as the reviewer can tell, the results presented in the paper are correct. The paper is well organized and it definitely constitutes as a complete piece of work.  Clarity: The paper is well written and clearly conveys the main ideas. In fact, the paper is able to nicely summarize all the main ingredients of the proofs in the main text. (Please see below for some minor typos.)  Significance: The DME problems is of great importance in distributed computing setups as it arises in many tasks as a subroutine, e.g., distributed gradient descent, distributed k-means. The paper makes significant contributions towards this problem when the underlying vectors are sparse (which is also quite prevalent in the practice). Given the number of recent research efforts in the domain, the reviewer believes that this work is certainly going to receive the attention of other researchers.  ########## Post-rebuttal #############  I have gone through the response of the authors and other reviewers' comments. I think I am comfortable with my previous score.
