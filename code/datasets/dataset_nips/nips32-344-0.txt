-- Post author-feedback comments --  I appreciate the authors taking the time to address the optional improvements I suggested. I think the addition of UMAP will improve the paper, and I would like to the encourage the authors to keep exploring the other discussed aspects in future work.  In my initial review I already strongly recommended to accept this paper, as I still do now, so my overall score remains unchanged.  -- Initial review -- This work aims to alleviate the sensitivity of popular dimensionality reduction approaches such as SNE and tSNE to initialization and local minima in the optimization of low dimensional coordinates to fit the neighborhood structure of the original (high dimensional) data. In particular, the authors focus on identifying points that get stuck in suboptimal positions due to the inability of the optimization to find a low dimensional path that will ultimately improve the placement of the points, even though in the short term it might incur higher penalty due to the way attractive and repulsive forces interact in the optimization loss (hence the local minima). To address such cases, the authors define a notion of pressure applied to data points by the dimensionality of the embedded coordinates, and propose to release such pressure by temporarily allowing the optimization process to use an additional auxiliary dimension for identified pressured points. Then, as the optimization progresses, a regularization is applied to gradually restrict the use of such auxiliary dimensions.  The manuscript is well written, well motivated, and convincingly establishes the reasoning behind the proposed approach as well as its effectiveness. Further, the problem dealt with here is indeed timely and crucial for the reliability of visualization methods based on SNE, tSNE, and other variations. Therefore, I recommend this paper be accepted and look forward to seeing it presented at NeurIPS.  Optional improvements appear in a separate part of the review.
