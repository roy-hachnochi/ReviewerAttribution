Originality: The framework is in general novel. A similar method exists for discrete utilities but not continuous ones. The paper contributes to the loss of calibrated VI for continuous utility.  Quality: The work has comparability high-quality.  Clarity: In general, the wring is clear. Each step of the work is well-motivated explained.  a) However, it would be great to have an explicitly related work section. Due to lack of related work section, related work is either briefly cited such as [14] or not event mentioned, I believe that more related work in approximate inference needs to be mentioned (such as much recent work from Tom Rainforth).  b) The linearization in 3.2 should be described to make the paper self-contained. c) The estimation of M_1 using VI should be expaned as well.  d) Small things, such as Figure 1 should be put earlier and the caption should be more informative if it is used in the introduction. e) The tasks in the experiments also need more description. Also the recommended one also need to motivate why a continuous utility is needed. For this task, I believe that discrete unity can be used as well.  Significance: The technical contribution is incremental but I believe the whole framework can be very useful and significant for many applications.
