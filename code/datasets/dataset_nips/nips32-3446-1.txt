This paper proposes to adapt the variational inference process to better capture the posterior regions relevant to decision-making with continuous utilities (when enumeration is no longer tractable). The result is an importance-weighted ELBO.  Using nested Monte Carlo integration and double reparametrization the authors are able to provide the tools to convert continuous unbounded losses into utilities that guarantee optimal calibration.  By formulating the problem as a joint optimization procedure of decisions and approximation parameters, the authors showcase how this procedure can be straightforwardly carried out by automatic variational inference. This adds to the significance of his work.  Overall, while this paper might lack in originality, it is clear and well written. The proposed tools are sound and were thoroughly studied in terms of calibration.  Question: why can we assume smoothness / differentiability of the expected utility ?
