Originality: This work shows that a family of distributions (fractal distribution) can be used for having a separation argument between shallow and deep networks. Moreover, based on a notion of the approximation curve, we can study the dynamics of training deep neural networks. Quality: It seems that the submission is technically sound but I did not go through the proofs. Clarity: The submission is well written. Significance: The authors proposed an interesting depth separation argument based on fractal distributions. More importantly, they related this argument to the success of training deep neural networks by gradient-based algorithms.   =================== Post-rebuttal comments: ===================  Thanks for providing new experimental result. It might be good to add this result to the paper to support your conjecture.
