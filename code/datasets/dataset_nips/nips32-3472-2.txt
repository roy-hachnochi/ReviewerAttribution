[After the author response] Thank you for reporting the performance of global alignment on JiGen as a baseline, which shows consistent performance boost. I intended to check whether the proposed method only works with DeepAll or not. I conjecture that the proposed method works well with the other methods not only JiGen. Also, it would be better if the performances of local loss are also reported in a future version of the paper.  ==============================================================  Iâ€™m positive to this paper because I believe that episodic training is an important topic for learning scheme. The proposed algorithm consists of three parts; Episodic training, global alignment, and local objective. The main contribution of this paper is that global alignment and local objective are adopted in the episodic training procedure. While each component seems to be closely related to the other methods, the combination of all components as the name of episodic training is plausible to solve domain generalization problem.  While the proposed algorithm is validated on several benchmarks, there exists only a single baseline algorithm. I think that validating the proposed components, such as global alignment and local objective, on the other baseline algorithms strengthens the proposed algorithm.
