1. Grid saliency can produce spatially coherent explanations for dense prediction networks firstly. This work seems to be sufficiently innovative and meaningful. 2. Experiment results are clear in the context biases research on synthesis dataset. However, a comparative analysis should be more detailed. The grid saliency is based on perturbation saliency method, while other contrast methods are belong to gradient-based saliency methods. I have doubts about the relationship between these methods.  ------------------------------------ The author responses provided a comparative analysis of two methods.  3. For the real-world dataset cityscapes, more quantitative results are expected to be provided in the submission like the numerical results in supplementary material.  I am also interested in how to use context explanations of erroneous predictions to improve the performance.  --------------------------- The author responses provided quantitative experiment results and more details about the practice.
