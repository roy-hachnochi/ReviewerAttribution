1. The major concern with this works is that the impact of the work seems to be limited, and I am not sure if the practitioners would be interested in grid saliency and how would this be useful for them.  2. The explanation of how to obtain grid saliency map is not clear. For example, in equation 2, the M*_grid is not clear how to obtain from the optimization. How would the size of R affect the M? Would we always be able to obtain an optimal M*_grid given any request mask R? It is also not very clear how to twist the lambda to make this works.
