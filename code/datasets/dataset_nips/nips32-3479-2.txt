ORIGINALITY To the best of my knowledge, there has been no previous study on deep neural networks about explaining pixel-wise predictions in image segmentation.   QUALITY The reported results indicate the superiority of this perturbation-based method with respect to three gradient-based methods. Results seem convincing.  CLARITY The text is clearly written, with the necessary visualizations and results, all of them commented to guide the reader's understanding.  SIGNIFICANCE TRhe work makes an interesting and necessary step that will help the community working on this task, and any other pixel-wise one.
