Update: I thank the authors for their responses to my fellow reviewers. My opinion remains unchanged and I still recommend acceptance.    Significance: The problem investigated is important to the development of secure and private differential privacy in practice  Clarity: The writing contains some grammatical mistakes and typos but they are small. Overall it is clear. Originality: They consider the new problem of designing oblivious versions of sampling without replacement and poisson sampling. This seems like a unique and important problem, but I am unfamiliar with the area.
