Clarity  I think that both the structure and readability of the paper are quite nice. The authors define very well their objective function based on the information provided for the Semi-Supervised Variational Auto-Encoders. They also support the presentation of the approach with figures illustrating the general outline of the methodology and the graphical model of the proposed method. Here, I would like to point out to some inconsistencies related to the notation used: - First of all, the paper does not contain line numbers since the authors did not omit the final and preprint options.  - In the line just before Equation 1, it is stated that $N_1$ is the number of unlabeled data points, but in Equation 1, the upper bound of the summation containing the labeled data points is also $N_1$. I think the upper bounds of the summation terms should be replaced.  - In Section 2, the word “generates” should be replaced with “generate” in the sentence starting with “More recently, a semi-supervised deep ...”.  - In Subsection 4.1, the authors may replace the expression $\textbf{A} \in \mathbb{R}^{N\times N}$ with  \textbf{A} \in \{0,1\}^{N\times N}$ to avoid the confusion since $\textbf{A}$ is the adjacency matrix.  Originality The number of node representation learning approaches have been significantly increased in recent years but there are only a few semi-supervised methods targeting to attributed networks. As the authors in Subsection 3.1 claim,  the paper might be the first approach to learn node representations along with the attribute embeddings in a semi-supervised manner.   Quality From the technical point of view, the paper seems to be well-prepared. In particular, the authors present their approach with detailed mathematical derivations based on the Semi-Supervised Variational Auto-Encoders and they extensively evaluate the performance of the method in various downstream tasks.  In the experiments, they report the results only for a chosen training size --- it could also be nice to examine the performance of the method for varying training set sizes.  Significance As it was stated above, although there are many different types of approaches that learn node embeddings, this method seems to be the first one that learns representations of nodes and attributes in a semi-supervised manner.
