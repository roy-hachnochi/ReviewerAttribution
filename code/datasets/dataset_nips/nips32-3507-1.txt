- The authors present a semi-supervised graph embedding procedure that simultaneously embeds nodes and attributes into the same semantic space.  The procedure leverages SVAE on heterogeneous data and several variational inference tricks for efficient implementation.  Moreover, the node/attribute representations (being modeled via Gaussians in the SVAE) naturally have measures of uncertainty built their representations  - Details in Section 3.2 are a bit confusing as presented.  I believe you want  $$\mathcal{O}=\mathcal{X}\times\mathcal{X}\times\mathcal{R}\times\mathcal{Y},$$ as you want observations to have two entities, a relation between the two entities, and possible class labels for the entities. As written, the definitions of $\mathcal{R}$ and $\mathcal{O}$ do not quite make sense. In addition, are the relations entity or class dependent; i.e., for $x_i\in X^g$ and $x_i\in X^h$ does $r_{ij}$ depend only on $g$ and $h$ or on the entities as well?  Finally, I am unsure how you derived (4)?  - How scalable is SCAN?  It would be helpful to know the orders of the 3 data sets in the experiments and what the runtime of SCAN was in each setting.  - How are you choosing D?    - In the Attribute Inference experiment section, is SCAN making use of label semi-supervision?  Are the algorithms being compared to unsupervised?  The experiments would benefit from more experiments on topologically diverse networks to show the effectiveness of your approach in a variety of real data settings.  - The ellipsoids in Figure 4 are too small to be easily observed.  - There are a number of grammatical errors/quirks in the manuscript which impact overall readability.  For example:  Abstract, line 2: offers -> offer Abstract, line 7: remove "the" Page 1, line -3: A number of work has -> A number of works have Page 2, line 6: has -> have Page 2, line 6: profound probability theoretical basis -> profound basis in theoretic probability Page 2, line 8: offers -> offer Page 2, line 9: has -> have Page 2, 2nd full paragraph, line 5: consisted -> consisting etc...
