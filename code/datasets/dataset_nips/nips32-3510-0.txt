- Introduction: the way to the argument why copulas are a useful object for building AE architecture appears somewhat convoluted and indirect; please try to streamline the way towards the 'why' and 'why now' behind the project  - this AE specification exploits that copulas allow to decompose a joint density into a product between the marginal densities and the dependence structure represented by the copula density  - one aspect that may lead to misunderstanding: the approach is advertised as free of assumptions at the beginning, but then Gaussian copulas are implicated later...please clarify
