The paper is well-motivated especially the delay at action/observation time settings. These are real settings one must consider in practice and no previous works sufficiently studies them.   My only real consider is the assumptions needed in this work. How reasonable are these in practice? Though, since this seems to be the first work in this area, I guess assumptions are OK to show initial results. The authors do acknowledge this and are able to come up with a refinement which removes assumptions.  One compliant I have about the paper is that the authors do not provide an empirical results. The theoretical results are nice but this paper's quality would benefit from even the most rudimentary experimental section. I'm disappointed the authors did not include this section.   ********** I have read the author's response and am not satisfied.  The first point they make about not running experiments because it's not possible to cover all scenarios is a disappointing. Experiments do not have to cover all scenarios, that's kind of their empirical nature. There are plenty of scenarios the authors could experiment with to at least provide some additional evidence the algorithm works. The second point is even more disappointing. One always has something to compare against, otherwise how do you know your method has any merit? For example, compare against an algorithm which picks random arms. This is the minimum baseline and is always available to compare against. One can also compare against algorithms not designed for delays. If the proposed algorithm is worth publishing then it should beat these algorithms.   I expect more from authors when submitting to a venue of this caliber.
