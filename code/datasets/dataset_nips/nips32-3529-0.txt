Originality: the techniques used in the methods seem to be incremental but it is exciting to see that a very deep latent variable model can solve some problems that the shallow ones do not.  Contribution&significance: the method is evaluated on a wide range of tasks and the results are excellent both quantitatively and qualitatively, compared with a large family of deep generative models. However, I worry about the reproducibility since most of the results are run by only once.  Clarity: the organization and writing of the paper are good and the related work is clearly discussed.
