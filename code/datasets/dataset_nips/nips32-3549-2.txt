I know little about time series, but the approach seems sound to me. In line with recent approaches for images and shape analysis. I think the authors should actually look at the recent approaches in 3D shape analysis to perform alignment via predicted deformations, such as Groueix, T., Fisher, M., Kim, V. G., Russell, B. C., & Aubry, M. (2018). 3d-coded: 3d correspondences by deep deformation. In Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV) (pp. 230-246). The philosophy of this type of approaches is very similar to the one of the paper, but the parametric deformation family T_\theta is learned by a neural network (an MLP), and thus could be better adapted to the signals. This would provide a nice comparison (i.e. CPAB performance v.s. MLP performance)  I was a bit disappointed by the evaluations which is only on NN classification performance for the real data. I am not sure if there are better datasets that could be used. Anyhow, I think it would be good to analyse the results in much more details, for example correlating the performance/improvement of the proposed approach with the amount of data available for training or the variety of the data.  === post-rebuttal I was quite disappointed by the rebuttal, which didn't address my comments for reasons I didn't agree with. I strongly encourage the authors to improve their experiments. However, I still think the paper is sound and quite original, so I do not oppose acceptance but don't strongly support it either.
