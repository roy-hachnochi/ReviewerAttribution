This paper is well-organized and the presentation is nice. The ideas are interesting, which I believe could be helpful for future research in weakly-supervised segmentation. The results are also good and convinving. Overall speaking, this paper is well-writen. However, I still have the following questions. 1) The authors use max pooling with respect to each bag to get the probability of each bag belonging to some category. I want to know how the results change when the avg pooling is used. We know that recent classification networks mostly exploit 2D avg pooling to map a 3D tensor to a 1D feature vector. According to attention models (like CAM, CVPR'16), avg pooling is more effective than max pooling to capture large-range object attentions. 2) For objects with middle or large size (defined in COCO), this work may work well. My question is how is the result of the proposed approach when processing small objects.
