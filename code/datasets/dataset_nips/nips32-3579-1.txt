- The existing algorithms need \log^\star(n) rounds. Given the slow growth of $\log^\star(n)$, trying to further reduce this number does not seem that interesting in practice. This number is smaller than 5 for $n \le 2^{65536}$.  - While there might exist differences in the setting, the authors of [4] claim that minimal round complexity scales at least as $\Omega( \log^\star(n))$, so that the authors should clarify how their setting differs from [4], as otherwise their results would simply prove that [4] contains a mistake. - As a minor remark, it could be good for clarity to explicity define the $\log^\star(n)$ function for an arbitrary base (other than 2). - Also, the authors mention that the algorithm proposed in [4] requires the knowledge of a number $\Delta$, such that $\Delta_k > \Delta$. Therefore, a straightforward approch to extend it to the present setting (where $\Delta$ is unknown) would be to apply the algorithm of [4] for \Delta = 1, then check that $\Delta_k > \Delta$ by sampling. It is noted that one can always estimate $\Delta_k$ by sampling all arms enough time (and this takes one "round") If the test fails, do the same for $\Delta = \gamma$, $\Delta = \gamma^2$ (where $\gamma < 1$) and so on and so forth until the test succeeds. Would such an approach fail and if not why ?
