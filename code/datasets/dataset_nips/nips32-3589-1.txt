# originality: The paper is novel in improving AIR with parametric prior distribution for generative model and re-discovering VAE-type of objective for structured generative models. Human knowledge are formulated as regularization term in this objective.  # quality & significance: The paper is in high presentation quality with clear formulation and extensive experiments. The problem is significant since more and more researchers aim to embed human knowledge or physical constraints into unsupervised learning. This paper presents a good working example.   # clarity: the paper is well written.
