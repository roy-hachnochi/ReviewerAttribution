The article is indicative of solid work and it is well written. The state of the art is covered well. The evaluation does not elaborate on the computational complexity and memory requirements of the proposed algorithm compared to the state of the art systems.   It is not fully clear how the Simultaneously Generating And Learning (SGAL) strategy generates the missing datapoints by using class embeddings and the model itself.  Elaborating this mechanism would help the reader.  The multi-modal prior plays a crucial role in providing information for supporting the learning of the unseen cases.  Please elaborate the number of iterations that the algorithm requires for the benchmark datasets.    Reviewer comment to author response: the authors have provided more details on the above points and addressed the mentioned presentation related issues.
