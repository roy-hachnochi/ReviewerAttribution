 Strengths: 1. This paper first proposes a framework for object detection backbone search. 2. The experiments show improvement between DetNAS and hand-crafted networks on COCO and VOC detection datasets. 3. Code is available.  Weaknesses: 1. The comparison between DetNAS and ResNet is unfair since ShuffleNetv2 block is more efficient than the Residual block in ResNet.  I suggest the authors provide more comparison between DetNas and other networks constructed by effitive block. For example, the author should provide the result of a 3.8G FLOPs ShuffleNetv2 in Table 2.  2. The novelty of this paper is limited. The one-shot search mothod is first proposed by [1].   An interesting result is that the improvement between DetNAS and Random structure is minor. It seems a carefully designed search space is more important than the search method. The authors shold provide the mmAP curve of parents network during EA search.  Ref: [1] Zichao Guo, Xiangyu Zhang, Haoyuan Mu, Wen Heng, Zechun Liu, Yichen Wei, and Jian Sun.
