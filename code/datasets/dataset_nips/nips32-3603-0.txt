Update: I have read the reports from the other referees and the response from authors. The authors have done a good job addressing the overall concerns, and with the addition of comparisons to the baseline truth, I have changed my assessment to an 8.  Originality: It is clear that the method is inspired from the the Passty algorithm, including the proofs therein. The originality is in using a Langevin dynamics over the usual Passty algorithm.  Quality: The results are clear and well explained, and the example demonstrates the theoretical results as well.  Significance: Overall, the article seems useful, particularly due to the possibility of sequential implementation.
