Quality: I found the basic idea and result interesting, but also found the understanding of this behavior to be somewhat lacking. For example, while the timing of the agent is well fit by a Bayesian model, it is not clear why the agent would arrive at this strategy and whether it arrives at this strategy for the same reasons as biological systems.   Clarity: I found this paper fairly clear and easy to understand. The basic results are clearly presented, and the authors are making their code available online.   Originality and Significance: I would classify this work as original, although I’m undecided as to its significance. While it is fairly intuitive that less powerful architectures would display biases away from the optimum strategy, it is interesting to see how these biases agree with those found in biological systems. I do, however, have questions about the underlying mechanisms for these biases emerging. For example, does there not exist a set of network weights that works for the simple strategy, or does the strategy emerge and become frozen from the learning dynamics. If so, how is this strategy learned?  Miscellaneous:The PDF file seems to be broken. My computer crashed several times due to looking at either page 3 or page 4 of the PDF (Perhaps figure 3), and I was not able to print these pages either. I don’t know why this is.
