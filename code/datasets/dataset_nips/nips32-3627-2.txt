This is an impressive amount of work, and an interesting example of how artificial neural networks are now being studied with ideas analogous to how biological networks are treated. As with such networks though it is important to choose the right experiments to make results generalisable (see below).  The paper is well written and an enjoyable read.  I would have enjoyed a little more discussion of how general the results are, are they just specific to this network architecture? What has been learned about recurrent networks? Does this tell us anything about the biological brain? Training of machine very different to animal learning surely, limiting how much can be learned about animal intelligence? This is not mean a criticism, just an observation for discussion.  ’Stigmergy’ solution is very specific to the details of the task, i.e. changing the location of the fixation target completely invalidates the strategy. Is the LSTM trained to be generalised across locations? Please discuss.  Minor: References 19 and 20 look identical Incomplete references
