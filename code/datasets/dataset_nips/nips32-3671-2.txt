The paper was expertly written which introduces an interesting discriminative variant of LDA. I think this work will be a nice addition to the crowded literature of topic modeling. Here are some of my additional thoughts:  - One of the many advantages of LDA is that it is a building block for many topic modeling extensions, as described Section 2.2 “A zoo of topic models” in the paper. I wondering with this discriminative variant, how easy/difficult it is to modify Logistic LDA to achieve these extensions.  - It also would be helpful if the paper discusses the scalability of the two algorithms proposed to train Logistic LDA
