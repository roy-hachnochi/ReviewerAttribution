The paper is very well written in clear English. The proposed framework is methodologically sound and sufficient details are given to make it fully reproducible and extendable. The experiments are convincing, with a relevant choice of comparative methods and an insightful ablation study. The bibliography and litterature review are adequate.  Minor remarks and typos: -line 96: "albeit these may be-not be as expressive" -> may not be as expressive -Sec; 4.2.: it is not obvious how the proposed architecture yields a receptive field of 12500, since the total squeezing is 2^8. Some more details on this would be appreciated, as well as on the final dimension of z (which should be 4096, but this is implicit and hard to deduce). -In Sec. 4.5, the authors refer to "network g", but this does not appear in Figure 1. Although one may deduce that this corresponds to the "embedding" green block, this could be made more clear. -In Sec. 4.7, more details would be appreciated on how btaches are built . In particular, do they contain a mix of frames from all speakers, from a subset of speakers or from a single speaker? -The authors do not provide error bars for any of their results. Some standard deviations would be appreciated.
