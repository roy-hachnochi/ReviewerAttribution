Pros: 1. Using the invertibility(forward-backward) of flow-based model to do voice conversion is an overall clever idea. 2. End-to-end training of voice conversion system directly on raw waveform is elegant.  Cons: 1. The novelty in machine learning/deep learning is limited. The session 4 is more like an architecture tuning summary of Glow/WaveGlow. Also the quality of posted audio samples and subjective evaluation(both naturalness and similarity) need to be improved. 2. For flow-based model, the mapping between latent `z` and data `x` has to be bijective. So there is no information bottleneck like auto-encoder based models(e.g. VQ-VAE). Thus, it's hard to convince others that `z` is in condition-neutral space like the author proposed in session 4.3, especially when the speaker embeddings are not powerful enough. Further experiments, like latent space analysis in VQ-VAE, will be necessary to prove `z` is condition/identity-neutral. 3. Missing important comparison with some state-of-the-art many-to-many non-parallel voice conversion work, like AUTOVC: Zero-Shot Voice Style Transfer with Only Autoencoder Loss(ICML 2019). It seems AUTOVC has better reported MOS and higher quality audio samples, although it performs on spectrogram not waveform.
