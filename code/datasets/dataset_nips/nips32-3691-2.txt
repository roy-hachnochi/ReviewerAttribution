The paper makes an original contribution to the field of generative modelling that is backed by a strong theoretical analysis. It is generally written in a readable way, even though some parts could be smoothed out a little. The experiments conducted are sufficient to prove the merits of the proposed method. I think the contributions will have some significance in the field of generative modelling, even though some practical problems (i.e. runtime) are not discussed in much detail.
