This paper proposed a global and local combination method to forecast the multivariate time series. From a global perspective, the authors used the Gaussian Copula function to characterize dependency between multivariate time series. This results in low-rank estimation. From a local perspective, several local RNN-based TSF models are combined to estimate the sparse parameters. The motivations and working mechanism are lucid.  However, there are some weaknesses. 1. Experimental contrast is not enough. In Table 1 and Table 2, the conventional models, such as VAR and GARCH are weaker here. It is more significant to validate that the model in this paper with the same settings can improve the performance of several state-of-the-art deep learning models. 2. The number of Monte Carlo sampling for sparse estimation is unspecified since random sampling does not seem to formalize the temporal evolution of time series. In other words, the temporal dependency and time-varying distribution of each individual time series also should be considered; otherwise, the number of samples may be a core parameter which influences the effectiveness of this model. Besides, in the case of independent random sampling, simply using RNNs and LSTMs to fit the underlying forecasting functions is not convincing. Furthermore, excessive sampling may increase the complexity of the entire model, which is not explicitly mentioned in this paper.
