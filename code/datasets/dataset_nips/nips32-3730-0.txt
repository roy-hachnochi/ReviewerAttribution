Post-response comments:  In light of great enthusiasm from other reviewers, I see no reason to stand in the way of acceptance. I was already leaning positive on this paper, so will bump my rating to a 7.  I was glad that the authors provided more convincing experimental results in their response, and that they agreed to provide more examples to accompany their verbal descriptions and equations. These will help to prevent obfuscation of the simple and attractive generalization that they present in the paper.   Related to this: I think they misinterpreted my point here, and suggested a change to the introduction that I don't think is necessary. I was fine with their introduction as is. I think that grasping the basic idea of their generalization is well within the capability of the average NIPS reader, if presented in a concrete manner.   Lastly, I might suggest that they briefly add notational notes on their use of \circ for elementwise multiplication and vector notation for permutations.   =============================================  I found the paper to be a nice theoretical discussion of generalized sorting, quantiles, and CDFs. It includes some experiments that show its applicability, but it was not clear to me that these were effective uses of the concepts constructed in the first part of the work. I'm interested to hear other opinions on this. As such, I tend very slightly towards acceptance, with a recommendation to work on finding more effective uses for the tools presented, if rejection is the result. More below:  Originality: I think the basic idea of generalizing sorting is quite fundamental and interesting to consider, so I quite liked this part. As acknowledged by the authors, there seem to be a few other works that have targeted differentiability of related concepts via Sinkhorn, so I'm less certain on the degree of novelty for this portion. The applications did not seem overly original. Lastly, I look forward to hearing the perspective of others since I'm not intimately familiar with works [1,11,15,16].  Quality: The theoretical portion is quite complete, but I did not feel like the experimental results were terribly supportive of its efficacy in the suggested uses.  Clarity: The paper was mostly clear, but I found the notation to be a little confounding. The use of function composition as elementwise product in Def. 1 was a particularly unfortunate use, IMO. The greatest contribution to my understanding of the concept was given by the single example of Fig. 1, so I applaud its inclusion. Further small notes in the Improvements section later.  Significance: As noted, high on the theoretical front, low on the experimental front, as far as I can tell.
