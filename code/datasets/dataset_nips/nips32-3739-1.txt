Independent component analysis (ICA) is a tool for statistical data analysis and signal processing that is able to decompose multivariate signals into their underlying source components. A particularly interesting variant of the classical ICA is obtained by assuming more sources than sensors, that is the overcomplete ICA paradigm. In that case the sources can not be uniquely recovered even if the mixing matrix is known. The overcomplete ICA problem has been solved by assuming some parametric probabilistic models.  In that work, a methodology that does not require any parametric assumption on the distribution of the independent sources is proposed. The idea is to learn the mixing matrix by using a generator that allow to draw sample easily. A MLP generator model with standard Gaussian input is learned by minimizing the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD).   That is very relevant and offers quite a lot of promising perspectives.  The proposed methodology and its application in causal discovery will have an important impact and should be published in NeurIPS 2019 proceedings.  UPDATE AFTER THE REBUTTAL  After reading all the reviews and the authors' feedback, I maintain my opinion:  that contribution is very convincing and deserves to be accepted.
