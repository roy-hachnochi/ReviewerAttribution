The paper proposes an embedding of data in a non-vectorial metric space, a weighted graph with shortest path distance.  I think the paper is original. I find it well-written and the methodology, described in section 3, sound.  The experimental results are not always impressive, though.  The experiments in section 4.1 show that PRODIGE, the proposed technique, reaches good performance with low memory budget, but corresponding methods almost catch up with 8-dimensional embeddings only. Since nowadays we tend to work with much larger embeddings than 8-dimensional ones, I wonder in practice how important is this result. A similar reasoning applies to the experiments in section 4.3, in this case in addition I would suggest to compare PRODIGE with state-of-the-art embedding techniques such as BERT or ELMO. The experiments in section 4.2 looks more convincing. I appreciated the comparison with Metric Learning, the same technique using euclidean embeddings
