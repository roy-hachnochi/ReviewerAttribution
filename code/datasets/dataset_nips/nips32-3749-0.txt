Post-response comments (from discussion):  "I feel the response did a good job of answering points of confusion, and also added an interesting example application of color transfer. This last example/experiment is heartening, because they finally use one of their maps (MK) in an application instead of just using the distances. I would be quite interested to see a more comprehensive exploration of this, as well as further applications of the MI and MK maps (perhaps in domain adaptation or Waddington-OT, which they mention elsewhere?).  It's also important to note that they included a new algorithm for subspace selection which performs projected gradient descent on the basis vectors of the subspace, which outperforms their old method in the synthetic cases. This is a nice discovery, but I think will necessitate more than a minor structural change to the paper. One would expect a more complete presentation of the algorithm, including discussion of convergence (to local optima at least?) and runtime. It would also be nice to find a non-synthetic use case for this subspace selection, if possible.  In light of their response, I feel that this paper is on the right track, but could use another iteration to better argue for applicability of their maps, and to update their algorithm for subspace selection."  =====================================================  This paper presents an interesting fundamental concept that naturally arises when one considers subspace-restricted transport problems. I was not able to check line-by-line all the mathematics, but I feel it performs a careful basic exploration of these concepts. However, as hinted at above, the main weakness of the paper is its applied facet. It presents a subspace selection algorithm without any real analysis or experimental exploration. The applications presented seem fairly esoteric and don't seem to really demonstrate the utility of the full transports obtained (they explore mainly the distances obtained).
