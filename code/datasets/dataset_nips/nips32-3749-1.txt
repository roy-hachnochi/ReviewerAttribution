Comments:  1: A minor critique: is E introduced before line 44? It is clear from later reading and after studying the context that E denotes a particular subspace, but the notation section follows after this.  2: Line 337, is this counter-example demonstrating something other than the analogy that performing PCA with a (random) subset other than the first k components leads to sub-optimal outcomes?  3: Line 333: what does ‘underestimated’ mean in this context? Moreover, in this setting, does the number of samples used to estimate the covariance matrices (n) equal the dimensionality (p) (i.e., does p = n)? If so, would one expect the covariance matrices estimated to be reliable or of any decent quality? For example, in the low-rank-plus-noise setting, one can end up with estimated principal components that are asymptotically orthogonal to the true components when p/n does not go to 0. See (for example) Johnstone and Lu, 2009 4: Continuing from (3), more generally, what is the value of d_2 in the simulations shown in Figure 4? Have you investigated the role of d_2 in this context?
