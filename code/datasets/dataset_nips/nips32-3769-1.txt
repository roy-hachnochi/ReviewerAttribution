This paper solves an open problem in the analysis of some variants of extragradient.   On the positive side, I found the paper to be clear and well written. I particularly appreciated the  review of single-call variants of extragradient in Section 3. I reviewed some key results that are proven in the appendix (Lemma 2), which seemed correct.  On the negative side, I found their results on non-monotone operators (Theorem 4.) to be rather disappointing, since it only applies when the iterates are already in a neighborhood of the solution and the operator to be (basically) strongly monotone in that region. It is nothing more than a localized version of previous results.   # Post rebuttal  I read te autors rebuttal and the other reviewer's review. My score remains unchanged.
