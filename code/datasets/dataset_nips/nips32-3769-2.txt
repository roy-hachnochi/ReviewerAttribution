In this paper, the authors study the EG algorithm and its variants in the optimization of VI with single oracle. In the convergence analysis, a unified way is proposed. Then the ergodic and last-iterate convergences are discussed with monotone and non-monotone operators in both deterministic and stochastic cases. The authors mentioned their motivation clearly.  Some related works were discussed in detail and the paper is well written.
