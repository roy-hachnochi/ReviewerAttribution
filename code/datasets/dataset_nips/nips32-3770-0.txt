Originality:  The tasks or methods are not new exactly, as they have been applied in electrophysiology (reference 8 in the manuscript), but they are new as applied to fMRI.  This is therefore important. Quality:  Experiments and application of methods are entirely sound, gpfa method is compared to other PCA methods and is applied to large datasets.  Authors acknowledge prospective work needs to be done to draw conclusions in their AD results. Clarity:  The submission is well written and organized. Significance:  The significance is perhaps the weakest area judged because authors take a known method from a different modality (GPFA has been used extensively in electrophysiology which the authors acknowledge) and apply it to fMRI.  To my knowledge the authors have been able to reach conclusions not previously reachable with other dimensionality reduction methods in fMRI datasets.  It is important to apply methods from other complementary fields to reach broader conclusions about brain dynamics even if not inventing an entirely new algorithm to do so.
