[Review update 08/07] In light of the authors response and discussion with the other reviewers, my opinion about the paper and the score remain the same   Originality. The paper is quite interesting and it's main contribution is algorithmic; it provides a very practical algorithm for PCA which tackles outliers.   Clarity. The paper is extremely well and clearly written. A couple of minors things I noticed: * Was the the title of the paper meant to say "adaptive weights" instead of "adaptive neighbors"? I don't think the word neighbors is mentioned anywhere in the paper.  * The spacing of the Conclusions sections seems to be smaller than 1; please fix for the final version.  * Lines 161-163: a very brief description of these other methods and how they differ from the proposed method would be appropriate to include here.  Quality. The paper provides sufficient detail on the algorithm and how the update rules were derived, which makes the paper easy to follow and understand. The work is extensively tested using several different metrics and datasets (in fact, this was the most well tested among the papers I reviewed).    Significance. The paper addressed a well (and exhaustively) studied area of PCA and low rank approximations. Yet it provides a new perspective for tackling global vs local outliers/noise. As a side observation, it might be interesting to see if the steerable parameter k can be made adaptive as well (i.e. k needs not be the same for each point), which is akin to some of the multi-level/scale PCA methods.
