Please see comments in item 1 above.  Some other comments:  The statement of Thm 1.1. can be greatly improved. I suggest separating the assumptions in a previous statement, in an itemized manner. Then start the statement of the theorem with: Under Assumptions?, let $T > 0$ and $\alpha > 0$. Then, the macroscopic state ... Also, just say "where $m(\alpha)$ is the unique solution of ..." (you don't need the "deterministic function") Furthermore, is $f$ Lipschitz continous? If not, the ODE (8) is not guaranteed to have a unique solution.  The approximation in Eq. (10) is for SCM. Does this provide any insights into more general settings? I believe this situation is unrealistic in general NN, for instance the results of Sec. 3 points out to the complete opposite when training both layers.  Line 149: It is being mentioned that the ODE is going to be integrated numerically. So how this gives analytical predictions?   Minor comments:  Please proof read the paper (there were quite some english mistakes and poorly formed phrases). For instance: Line 16: I find "behind" a little weird here. Maybe besides? Line 36: too -> to Line 39: oft-used -> often used Line 46: particular -> particularly Line 48: a a -> a Line 72: coupled ODE -> coupled ODEs Line 82: this last phrase seems quite weird to me. There are solutions of SGD dynamics that SGD does not find?? I don't know what is implied here. If a dynamical system has a set of admissable solutions, how it does not "find" it? Eqn. (1): Write the sum correctly: \sum_{m=1}^M Lines 118-119: I don't understand the "overlap" ... measure of the overlap Line 123: "we give write full expression"? Line: 124: What is a closed set of ODEs? Do you mean a set of coupled ODEs with closed form solutions? Line 147: "... SGD finds solutions with drastically different performance..."  =========  post rebuttal. I read the author's response and I keep my score. I think it's a good paper.
