The goal of this work is to compute descriptors for image keypoints that are invariant to a group of transforms -- yet retain distinctiveness. The authors attain this in a novel way, by treating image pixel descriptors as functions over the transform group. The effect is that when a transform is applied to an image, the function values at corresponding keypoints are simply permuted. The authors then apply group convolutions to the function values to aggregate local structure in these values over group neighborhoods in a way that retains equivariance, and finally they use two CNNs and group bi-linear blending to produce an invariant but discriminative descriptor that is sensitive to second-order statistics of the features.  Overall this is a very nice generalization of the traditional CNN image pipeline, where equivariant convolutions over the translation group are then made invariant through max pooling.  The paper does not describe at all (1) how edge effects are handled (e.g., padding rotated and down-scaled images), (2) how to guarantee that the group of transformations can be made compact so as to enforce the permutation property (otherwise function values can fall of the ends), and (3) limitations from the restriction that the group structure must itself be a regular grid, so that traditional convolutions can be applied (e.g., the authors consider only a discrete set of scales and rotations and their compositions).  The discussion of prior work evaluation of the method, and ablation study, are good.  This reviewer has read the authors' rebuttal. After the ensuing discussion, the final score assigned remains unchanged.
