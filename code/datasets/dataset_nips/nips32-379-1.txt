My main concerns regarding the paper are the follows:  1) the main part of the paper is really hard to follow. There are four main building blocks of the proposed algorithm: UCRL, Frank-Wolf,  EVI and GTP. Based on Algorithm 1, I believe that I could figure out how the Frank-Wolf and EVI are used in the UCRL framework, but I could not find out how GTP is implemented and what its role is. I guess it a mechanism to avoid the low gradient states, but I don't see how   2) The aggregation function is not well-motivated. I don't see that it would preserve the Pareto dominance relation which is a key notion in multi-objective optimization.  3) Can you please explain me any real-world problem which might be modeled by the proposed setup. Only synthetic experiments are presented in the experimental study.  4) The technical contribution seems marginal. Tremendous work is presented in the appendix, but if I look at Lemma 4.1, it seems that, thanks to the concavity of the aggregation function, the optimization problem can be handled quite similar way to the single objective case. In Eq. (11), the regret basically boils down to the error in value estimation which is very similar to the single objective case.
