The authors introduce a practical O(log n) per step online algorithm for predicting graph labelings by a novel combination/appropriate adaptation of online learning techniques and provide a mistake bound analysis and some experimental support. The paper is well written and clearly presented, and does a good job of surveying related work and putting their method into context. A clear accept.  Minor comments: - line 239: earlier work [Partition Tree Weighting, Veness, White, Bowling, Gyogy, DCC, 2013] also used a similar binary temporal discretization to provide a O(log n) algorithm for non-stationary time series modelling.
