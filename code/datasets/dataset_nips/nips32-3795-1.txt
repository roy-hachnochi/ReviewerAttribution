I think this paper is well prepared. I have the following comments. (1) I think one important contribution is in theoretical aspect. Nevertheless, I cannot judge the proposed results is based on the previous works or these results in developed by the authors themselves. Thus, I suggest the authors to highlight their unique contributions. (2) I am concerned about the compiutational complexity of the proposed algorithm.  Thus, I suggest the authors to analyze it. (3) The paper assumed that r_i follows a Bernoulli distribution, how about other distributions?
