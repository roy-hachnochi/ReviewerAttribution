Inference under non-ignorable missing response variables is considered for graph embedding setting. Ignoring these missing variables leads to biased estimation under MNAR, so it is important to consider the missing mechanism explicitly. This paper focuses on missingness of response variables only. So, missingness of graph embedding is not considered. In fact, graph embedding is implemented as the ordinary GCN in the experiments. Therefore, the novelty is basically for handling the missingness of the response variables only, and such method is not quite novel in statistics.
