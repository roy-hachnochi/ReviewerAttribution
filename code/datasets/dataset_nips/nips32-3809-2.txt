Originality Although the theoretical framework and method in the paper are not new, the paper derives novel theoretical results and supports them with empirical experiments. Related work is clearly cited and discussed, and the authors make clear how the current work differs from previous ones.   Quality and clarity The work seems to me sound, with adequate theoretical and empirical analyses. The paper is clear and very readable, and I appreciate the choice of the authors to clearly present and elaborate on the approach in section 3, despite space limitation. I have only text-correction comments, - typo in footnote 1 ('under') - typo in line 179. - Figure 1, consider adding a scale and move it to eg page 3. - Ref [14] is not complete. - type in line 242: 'show' --> 'shows'  Significance I find that the main contribution of the paper is the derivation of a relation between the maximal trainable depth of a network and the desired quantization level, which was further supported by simulations. This seems an important result for future studies that aim to train deep networks in low-resource setups.
