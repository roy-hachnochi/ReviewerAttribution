Originality: To the best of my knowledge, constructing ambiguity sets beyond confidence bounds and credible regions is new to this work. However, there might be sampling based heuristic techniques that closely resemble such methods.  Significance: It is hard to assess the significance of this work without a generalization bound or further empirical evaluation. As the paper mentions, the resulting solution is only guaranteed to be safe, and not necessarily accurate. The computational complexity is also not established, pushing the analysis further into speculations.  Quality and correctness: The analysis presented in the paper look correct to me. I did not fully check the proofs in the appendix.  Clarity: The paper is dense in parts and the language is sometimes confusing. The notation is not easy to follow (a notation table could help).
