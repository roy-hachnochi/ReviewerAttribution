This work proves that any continuous equivariant function of graphs can be approximated by a one hidden layer graph neural network that uses higher-order tensorization and an arbitrary squashing function. One of the main contributions of the paper is the introduction of the framework based on the Stone-Weierstrass theorem, which can be used to reprove a version of a previously known equivalent for invariant graph neural networks. On the negative side, this framework seems to lead to fewer insights such as the required order of tensorization and whether the underlying permutation group can be different from the set of all permutations.  Personally, I have found the mathematical part interesting and this result can be accepted to NeurIPS but given what we have already known about invariant functions, it is not as exciting and general as it could be.
