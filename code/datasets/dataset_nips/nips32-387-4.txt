Originality - The work nicely combines two methods to calculate an estimator with good prediction. However, it is not clear from the paper why this combination of methods provides the optimal performance.  Quality - The claimes are well suported by theoritical analysis and experimntal results. Clarity - The submission is clearly written. Significance - This paper offers an interesting approach for feature selecting for knn regression, based on weighted metric.  This is an interesting research direction, on the theoretical and applicative  areas.
