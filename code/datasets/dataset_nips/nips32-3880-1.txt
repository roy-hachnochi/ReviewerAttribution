1. I wonder how does the behavior change if the morphology of the agent (motor configurations) is made more complex. If I understand correctly the agent only has 3 degrees of freedom (Figure 3 (left))? What would happen if the agent were much more complex, say with very many degrees of freedom. Will we still see the same behavior as in the current experiments in the paper?
