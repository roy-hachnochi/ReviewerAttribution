1) the paper motivates that the current network pruning approaches try the same architectural design whereas a more efficient approach could be found with new architecture. 2) paper organization was good and easy to follow 3) the approach is a bit non-intuitive: example why combine the different feature maps at all? why only depth and width search? It took some time to understand but the solution seems to be out-of-the-box like thinking. 4) the results are solid i.e. less FLOPs and better accuracy on imagenet compared to the previous approaches on network pruning
