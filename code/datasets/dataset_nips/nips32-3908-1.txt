The context of this work is derivative-free optimization (DFO). The proposed method is an adaptation of the AdaMM first-order algorithm.  However, the DFO literature has been ignored. Many existing algorithms may be applied to solve the blackbox optimization problem.  It is not clear to what the proposed method is compared to. It seems that all competitors fall into the same category and may have been recoded by the authors. However many DFO solvers are available. In these conditions, it is not possible to assess the quality of the proposed algorithm.  UPDATE: The authors responded very positively to my comments. They are eager to include au augmented literature review on DFO methods.
