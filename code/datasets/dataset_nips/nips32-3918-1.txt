Summary: This paper addresses the problem of non-stationary MDPs where the MDP continuously and smoothly changes over time even though this evolution is unknown (only the current MDP is known).  More precisely, the non-stationary transition probability p_t is assumed to be Lipschitz-continuous in t w.r.t. the Wasserstein distance and the non-stationary reward is also assumed to be Lipschtz-continuous in t.  To solve this problem, a new algorithm called RATS (Risk Averse Tree Search) is introduced. RATS assumes a worst-case evolution of the MDP and implements a minimax procedure. RATS is empirically evaluated on a toy domain. It performs similarly to an oracle that explicitly knows the evolution of p_t and r_t and clearly outperforms dynamic programming approaches that do not take into account non-stationarities.   Clarity: The paper is well-written and all assumptions and claims are properly justified. The proofs are easy to follow and the algorithm is well-explained.   Correctness: I only noticed a small typo in the proof of property 3: between lines 64 and 65, I think \lambda = C/ W_1(...) (the / is missing). This typo is also present in property 3 where I think that \lambda = L_p |t-t_0| / W_1(...) which seems more plausible. I think everything else is correct.   Significance: The setting considered in this paper is new and relevant.  The algorithm is also new and solves the problem. The authors acknowledge the weaknesses of their approach (e.g., lack of scalability of the algorithm). The paper may be borderline in terms of contributions for a conference like NeurIPS but I think overall it is good enough. When you mention the case where indices do not coincide with time (lines97 & 98), do you have in minds Semi-Markov Decision Processes? It would be worth mentionning the connection between the set of admissible snapshots and bounded-parameter MDPs ("Bounded Parameter Markov Decision Processes", R. Givan, S. Leach and T. Dean, 1997).
