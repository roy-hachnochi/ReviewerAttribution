This reviewer really enjoyed reading this paper. PNS is a very interesting search algorithm which fell a bit behind MCTS after the introduction of progressive bias/PUCT.   The difficulty of combining PNS with heuristics is a problem that also this reviewer worked on without much success, which is why this reviewer particularly appreciates this contribution.  The manuscript is overall well written, and well motivated, however, a few question remain, which should be addressed before accepting the paper.  Quality: In their MCTS baseline, did the authors phrase it as in Winands et al. "MCTS Solver", and Segler et al. Nature 2018, where a high or even infinite reward is given for proved states (solved and within tree) and a standard reward of 1 is given for states which are solved in the rollout? Did they consider giving partial rewards for partially solved states which is hinted at but not very well described in this 2018 Nature paper? This will likely accelerate MCTS convergence. Along these lines, do the authors stop PNS when a proof has been found, or do they continue to find more/better solutions?  Is search speed the most important criterion, or are there other criteria which can be more important? How easy is it to incorporate other costs into PNS, e.g. cost of starting materials?
