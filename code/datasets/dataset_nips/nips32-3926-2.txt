This paper proposes a variant of DFPN to solve the lopsided search space by applying simple heuristics. DFPN-E estimates the difficulty of finding a proof and utilizes it as the edge cost from the OR node to the AND node. Besides, two thresholds are used as constraints to the size of the search tree.  The paper is well-written, especially the comprehensive overview of retrosynthetic analysis. The logic is clear and notations are clean. Nice work.  Generally, I think the story is well-motivated and conclusions are well supported by the empirical experiments, but the contribution is a little incremental and engineering. It may not attract that many audience in the ML community, and personally, I would expect more explorations on the algorithm, not just two simple heuristics. Since the current model can reach the state-of-the-art performance, it would make a more interesting story by considering the more advanced strategies (like mentioned in the Conclusion Section).  Other comments: (1) In line 72, should use “lose” instead of “loss”. (similarly to the remaining ones)
