I've read the authors' response and my score remain the same. The mistake in the comments is corrected, thanks for the remind.   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  This paper uses a new trick on the Poisson Gamma Dynamic Systems to achieve tractable and more expressive models. Experimental results verify the advantages of the newly proposed model and look to be promising.  The poisson-gamma-poisson motif proposed in this paper contains substantial originality. In my rough understanding, this technique can be readily applied to other models (e.g. Gamma Belief Networks, maybe Dirichlet Belief Networks) and circumvent the complex data augmentation techniques usually required. Thus, this paper will have impact on the community.   Since this trick introduces an "auxiliary" discrete variable to the standard PGDS, I am interested in the sampling efficiency with comparison to the standard PGDS. I think should be ok, just to confirm.  I like this paper, especially the poisson-gamma-poisson trick. Maybe the only pity is that this trick only applies on the rate parameter of Gamma distribution.
