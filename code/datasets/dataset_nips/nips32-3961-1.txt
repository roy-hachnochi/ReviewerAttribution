In this paper the authors propose an algorithm for optimization over manifolds, capable of converging to second-order stationary points, with a rate of convergence of 1/eps^2  The presentation of the paper in general, and the results in particular, is quite clear. I particularly really liked the introduction (despite some typos), and the review of existing work and results.  The proofs seem to be correct, although I didn't follow carefully the supplementary material.   I appreciate the presence of examples, but the analysis there is somehow poor. What about the complexity of each manifold? How does this affect the constants in your results?  What about the rate of convergence?  In the Reproducibility Checklist answers, the authors say that the code is available for dowloading. However, I couldn't find it in the paper.  Minor comments: There are some typos and weird sentences, specially in the introduction. For instance   - "Riemnnian manifolds, but not clear about the complexity..."  - escapes (an approximate) saddle pointS   Also in the footnote 2, it doesn't specify that \lambda_min is the eigenvalue of the Hessian.  I think that the enumeration in page 5 (after Lemma 1) is not necessary.
