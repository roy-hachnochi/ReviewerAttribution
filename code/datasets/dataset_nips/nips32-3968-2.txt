Originality ------------ The authors propose a new setting for structured prediction, and relates it well to the state of the art. By developing their new framework, the authors are also able to explain the efficiency of some existing structured prediction method (restriction kernel).  Quality --------- Although I didn't go through all the proofs in the appendix, the paper looks technically sound. All the claims presented are proven in detail. The authors provide a very complete piece of work, and the appendix extend even more the proposed framework.  Clarity -------- The paper is clearly written and organized. The authors provide all the elements to understand the paper, and it should be enough to reproduce the results.  Figure 3, the Left plot is very difficult to read in black and white.  Significance ---------------. The presented results are significant as it address a difficult task by exploiting structure in the data, and improve over existing methods. The proposed algorithm is proven to be consistent and the authors provide and study generalization rates, justifying the usefulness of the method.  I have read the author response and my opinion remains the same.
