The strengths of the paper besides the above contributions:  - The paper is clearly written. - The systematic comparisons are thorough and convincing. - The theoretic analysis is useful for understanding the problem and provides the justification for the solutions.  - Code is provided for reproducibility.  The weaknesses that could be further improved:  - The approach used in the theoretic analysis in the paper isn't able to give a necessary or a sufficient condition for the exploding gradient problem for LSTM since lambda_2 in Proposition 2.1 is typically not zero. The analyses of the various normalization approaches are also only made on the upper bound of the gradient magnitude, but on the gradient itself. It would be great to have a more direct proof for the effectiveness of the solutions.  - In the analysis in Section 3, it only studies that the increased scaling of the weight matrices does not affect the upper bound of the gradient magnitude due to \sigma. It would be good to also analyze the effect of all the normalization scaling parameters 'g' w.r.t. the exploding gradient problem.  - It would make the paper even stronger if it can show the normalization techniques still make 1-bit or 2-bit quantized LSTM achieve comparable performance to a full-precision counterpart on a much larger network consisting of multiple LSTM layers, e.g. for machine translation or speech recognition, where there is a strong practical need for compressing the models especially for the embedded/mobile use case.
