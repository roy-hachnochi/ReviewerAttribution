There are a great many papers written on the ADMM algorithm, and it is often very difficult to see and gauge the novelty of the submission. Thankfully, this paper actually does make a very nice contribution, which is clearly articulated, so I am happy to be able to support this work. The paper is well written and organised. The key observation is highlighted immediately so that the reader can see what the contribution (and therefore value) of the work is. A new algorithm naturally arises, theoretical results are stated to support the observation and algorithm, and there is a good number of numerical experiments to support the paper. I think this paper will be of wide interest to the community.
