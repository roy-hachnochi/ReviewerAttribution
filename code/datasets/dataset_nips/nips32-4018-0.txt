Originality: In this paper, the authors propose the GRU-ODE-Bayes method to continuously model the sporadically-observed time series. The proposed method is a novel combination of the GRU-ODE and the GRU-Bayes. The authors change the classical GRU into the difference equation version so that it can deal with continuous time. Moreover, the proposed GRU-Bayes can handle sporadical observations.  Clarity: The paper is well written. And it would be better if the authors can put Section 3 related research just after the introduction section so that the readers can have a better understanding of the field after reading the introduction.   Significance: The authors show the experiment on both synthetic and real-world datasets and the experimental results of the proposed method are much better than the baseline methods.   # Feedback The authors' feedback solved some of my concerns.
