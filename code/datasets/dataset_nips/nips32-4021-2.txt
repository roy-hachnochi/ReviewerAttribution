Strength  - A crisply-written paper, targeting an important problem: assessing the convergence of MCMC methods.  - The proposed algorithm provides practical bounds on the distance between the marginal distribution of Markov chains and the target distribution. Estimating such bounds is a challenging research problem in computational statistics, and this paper proposes a useful method based on L-Lag couplings.  - Empirical evaluation verifies the theoretical claims and demonstrates the practicality of the proposed method on several common sampling algorithms.   - A fair assessment of the proposed method, with experiments demonstrating both efficacy and the failure case (sec 2.2.2), It is worth pointing out the failure case should not be considered as a weakness of this paper as it is beneficial for understanding the proposed method.   Weakness  - Convergence estimates from the proposed method could be incorrect when the underlying MCMC sampler does not mix well, e.g. in high-dimensional and/or multimodal target distribution settings. This issue is pointed out by the authors through numerical experiments and deserves more investigation.
