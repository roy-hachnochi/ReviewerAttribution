This paper studies an interesting problem of using machine learned advice to speed up low rank approximation. Rigorous theoretical analysis and sound experimental results over proposed method are provided. This work is a generalized work of ‘Learning-Based Frequency Estimation Algorithms’. Besides, low rank approximation is generally mixed with other problems, such as RPCA, where iteration optimization method is used to solve the involved model. Hence, the proposed learning based method, an iteration method, may limits the efficiency of entire optimization procedure. The author should compare the time computations of SVD、proposed method、sketch method.
