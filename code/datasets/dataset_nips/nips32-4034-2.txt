OVERVIEW.  The algorithm is obtained using the sum-of-squares (SoS) approach, where the constraints of the algorithm are expressed as polynomial inequalities, and the algorithm finds a "pseudo-distribution" satisfying those inequalities  using convex programming. The solution is then extracted from the pseudo-distribution by a randomized rounding procedure based on voting. The total running  time  in this approach is exponential in the degree of the polynomials.    One of the main novel ideas introduced in the paper is how to reason about anticoncentration (i.e., upper bounding the probability that a random sample falls into a small neighborhood) in the SoS framework. The approach here is to approximate the indicator function of the neighborhood by a low-degree polynomial.  The overall submission is somewhat technical, but less so than a typical paper using the SoS approach, which is a plus. In any case, the main ideas are well explained in the first 7 pages.   EVALUATION. The result is quite  interesting. There are relatively few algorithms for robust estimation where the fraction of outliers alpha is arbitrarily  close to 1 (notably for mean estimation), so a new algorithm in this regime is somewhat of a rarity. Furthermore, obtaining the result required several novel ideas.    At  the same time, given the high runtime bound of the algorithm, the result seems only of theoretical interest (and there is no experimental evaluation showing otherwise). So the potential audience for this paper at NeurIPS is probably  small.
