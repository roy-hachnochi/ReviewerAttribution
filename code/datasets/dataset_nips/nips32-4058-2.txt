This work by considering different efficiceny aspects of robust learning is new and brings important contributions to an important field of research. The positionning  to recent related works is very clear stressing the limits of the state-of-the-art when integrating computational efficiency and sample complexity in the metrics of designing robust learning models.  The article is theoretically sound and well written.  I think this article is important in the field of robust learning by focusing on the efficiency of solutions and on what problems are then achievable when efficiency has to be considered. Their contributions open new directions to see whether this result can be generalised to other classes of functions than the simple monotone conjunctions addressed here and how state-of-the-art recent results hold when adding constraints on sample complexity and computational efficiency.
