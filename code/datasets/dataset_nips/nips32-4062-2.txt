This paper is original and solves an important and interesting problem. It is also very well written and I loved reading it. However I have the following questions:  1) In Theorem 1, exact conditions on \Delta/ \sigma is provided which is improved in the subsequent theorems. However, the necessary conditions on \Delta/ \sigma are not provided in the subsequent theorems explicitly. Is it possible to provide a table/plot for comparison?  2) Can you provide an intuition behind why average linkage performs better? Why not try something else besides these popular linkage algorithms such as median linkage? Median will definitely be more robust to outliers. Is it known that average linkage is the best someone can do in these settings?  3) Are each comparisons sampled multiple times in the algorithm to smooth the noise? Note that asking the same query multiple times might not be good in practice although it will work in theory.
