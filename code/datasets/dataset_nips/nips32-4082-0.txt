The setting of binary classification with class-conditional data being Gaussians with identical covariance matrices gives interesting results but is too simple in terms of any novel technical challenges. Their setting ensures (needs a short proof) that optimizing over only linear classifiers and translate-and-pair transportation plans or couplings is sufficient to lower bound the adversarial robustness. It helps improve the clarity of their main message but brings the submission down a little bit on originality and significance metrics, in my opinion.
