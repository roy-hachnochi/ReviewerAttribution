This paper proposes a dual approach for the constrained reinforcement learning (CRL) problem. The authors show that the CRL problem has zero duality gap and thus can be solved by solving its dual problem which is convex. The optimality results of parametrized policies and primal-dual algorithms are also given in the paper. The constrained reinforcement learning problem is interesting and important in practice. This paper gives a good theoretical result on this problem. It would be better if the authors could add an experimental section in the paper.  UPDATE：After reading the author’s rebuttal, I have chosen to increase my score for the following reason: The authors provide a numerical section in the rebuttal.
