The authors extend the existing SchNet architecture to a generative framework, called G-SchNet, which can generate rotational invariant 3d point sets. The auxiliary tokens introduced by the authors are very interesting, which can give some constraints on the generated points. The paper is a complete work with enough experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. In all, the paper would have some practical impact on research.
