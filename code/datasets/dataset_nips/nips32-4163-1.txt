Originality ------------ The paper present a very novel Newton method algorithm adapted to large-scale ill-conditioned problems. The authors clearly state how their algorithm differ and relates to the literature.  Quality --------- The authors present a very complete study of an optimization algorithm and provide a. Due to the (over)length of the appendix, it is difficult to carefully check all the proofs. Maybe a journal would be a more appropriate submission track. Nevertheless all claims in the paper are justified and the proofs look technically sound. For completeness and transparency, the experiment against FALKON should be included in the main paper, as it is a directly related work.  Clarity -------- The paper is very dense in information, but well written and organized. All the elements required for the understanding of the paper are provided. There is some formatting issue line 211: the box is too big. No conclusion is provided.  Significance --------------- Even tough a detailed pseudo-code is given in the appendix, the impact and significance of the paper could be improved a lot by providing a functional piece of code, as this algorithm could interest and impact a large community. I have read the author response and my opinion remains the same.  I have read the author response and my opinion remains the same.
