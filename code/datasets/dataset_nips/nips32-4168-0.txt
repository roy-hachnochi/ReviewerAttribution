This paper proposes a less principled but more successful alternative routing mechanism for capsule networks.  It replaces the EM or dynamic algorithm with a simple perceptron model for predicting routing coefficients.  This routing mechanism is thoroughly explored for its test performance, transformation robustness, as well as parameter and computational requirements.   The results are convincing. The mechanism they propose improves test performance and robustness to adversarial attacks and view point transformations without significantly increasing parameters or computational cost.  the paper is original. The routing procedure they propose is simple and somewhat self evident, but the improved performance they find as a result of the mechanism is impressive. And i know of no other work that has attempted to replace the routing mechanism with such a technique.   The paper is well written though some elements could be made more clear (detailed in the improvements section)    The paper is fairly significant as it explores a baseline for routing that i believe many researchers may have written off for being to simple, but demonstrates its success convincingly.
