Post rebuttal : The authors addressed the concerns I raised regarding error bars in the experiments. I am happy to update my rating to 7. -------------- This paper proposes a self-routing mechanism in which each capsule's pose goes through a little neural net which outputs the routing coefficients to each potential parent capsule. This is in contrast to previous work, where a key component of the model design was that routing of parts to wholes should be determined based on agreement of the pose of the whole across parts. The obvious drawback seems to be that if a part can reasonably belong to multiple wholes, it does not get the chance to choose one based on what other parts are agreeing on. Instead it must make a choice a-priori or just spread its vote across the many choices. However, it turns out that this is not detrimental, and in fact is advantageous, at least on tasks such as classification, adversarial robustness, and generalization to novel view points.  Pros - The paper questions an important idea behind capsule networks. This helps answer the question whether it is routing by agreement that is important or just routing. - Experiments cover 3 different tasks.  Cons - The results don't have error bars and based on all the numbers it seems that the improvement in the results may not be very significant. However, even matching the results is enough to make the point.  Overall, the paper is interesting since it provides evidence that strong gating alone is an important factor that the community should pay attention to when designing variants of capsule networks. Alternatively, this suggests that the tasks that are being used for evaluating capsule networks are not making use of the agreement aspect of the routing. Either way the conclusions are interesting.
