The core training method in the paper builds closely off of Vinyals (2016), but with a substantially different model and applying it to much larger and more realistic tasks. The paper provides experiments with several different modeling choices and ablations for comparison.  The experiments would be better if they had a direct comparison to the evaluation numbers in prior work such as Gu rather than their own implementation which may differ in the details. The analysis of insertion order by part of speech was interesting. The method does have some speed disadvantages, but it is not prohibitively expensive and the paper provides a clear comparison of runtime.
