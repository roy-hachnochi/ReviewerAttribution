In terms of related work: are there any results on approximating a function by a convex function -- that seems like a simpler question and looks somewhat relevant.  It would help to give some one/two sentence intuition for the definition of the tent function.  In the related work you mention a lower bound of (1/eps)^O(d) for *any* estimator -- I didn't quite understand the exact difference from your formulation that allows a poly time upper bound.  I understand that there is much prior work on this problem and the result seems interesting and significant -- but it would be nice to point out any specific applications or directions that could potentially be enabled by this finding.
