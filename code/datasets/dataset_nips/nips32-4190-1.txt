The paper proposes the first polynomial time algorithm for computing the MLE of log-concave distributions in high dimensions. The proposed approach leverages the fact that log-concave MLE is contained in “tent densities”. Based on this observation, they propose a stochastic convex optimization algorithm for computing MLE. The main subroutine of the algorithm is an algorithm to sample from tent densities.   The paper is theoretically interesting and provides a polynomial time algorithm, however, the degree of the polynomial is quite high. For example, step 1 of the Algorithm 2 takes time O(d^5) for d dimensional data. Further, given the sample complexity of the algorithm itself is exponential in d, the advantage of the polynomial time algorithm is not clear.  In lemma 1, tent poles are defined as points X_i, but in line 184 it is defined as pairs (X_i, y_i)  Is the epsilon in the sample complexity discussion (lines 156 - 170) different than the epsilon in Definition 2? If so, please clarify.  Update: Thanks for answering my questions.
