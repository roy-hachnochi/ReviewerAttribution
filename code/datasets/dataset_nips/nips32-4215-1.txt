I believe that the paper contains extremely interesting material. It is very interesting from a theoretical and practical point of view. Quadrature techniques  (deterministic or stochastic) are fundamental  tools for several applications.  However, in my opinion, the key- underlying point of the ideas contained in the paper is the procedure (an efficient one) for drawing from DPPs. If there is one sampling scheme described in the  current version of the paper, it must be explained  better and explicitly remarked with a table, for instance. If the authors consider that is just a background part contained in other previous papers, I disagree. I believe this is the core, the key point, in order to use DPPs then it should appear in a background section at least. Moreover, this part should be very clean and clear in order to guide and motivate the reader inside the more complex and theoretical parts of your contribution. If the reader acquires the ability of generating a realization of a DPP, surely your paper increases its impact.  This is also true that the provided code helps substantially in this sense.
