Determinantal point processes (DPP) are currently a very active research topic. They provide a law on point processes that favors repulsion. The use of DPP in Monte Carlo methods is tempting, but rather difficult because simulation algorithms are not obvious. The present paper studies two Monte Carlo algorithms based on DPP: Ermakov & Zolotukhin (EZ, 1960) and Bardenet & Hardy (2016, BH). The latter paper provides a fast CLT of the estimator, while there is no such results about the EZ estimate in the literature.  After proving the consistency of the EZ estimate via DPP, the paper discusses the possibility of a normal asymptotic behavior on simulation.  DPP based Monte Carlo algorithms are certainly new and might represent a major improvement in this domain, since repulsion induces a faster speed of convergence than iid sampling or importance sampling or Markov chain Monte Carlo. The present paper highlights the key features of the EZ and BH estimators based on DPP.
