This paper is well written and easy to follow. The experimental settings looks convincing to me, and the analysis and results are interesting. To me, this is a good piece of work on understanding stochastic models for sequence modeling. I do not fully understand section 3.4. From Eq(2), the auxiliary posterior is q_\phi(z_t | z_{<t}, x_{<t}), which does not include element in x_t. So why you are arguing there is leaking information from x_t? This is important as this is basis for the following experiments. Also, after you split x_t into x_t^a and x_t^b, how do you feed the two sequence into RNN. Are they fed into RNN separately, or you only feed x_t into RNN and take the corresponding outputs as the outputs of a and b sequences. This will make a difference what kind of correlation the RNN states are going capture. When you investigated the high volatility assumption, have you considered  experiments with different values of L to evaluate its impact for SRNN?
