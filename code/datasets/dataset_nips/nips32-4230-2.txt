Update: Thanks for the response. I've increased my score to 7. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- This work studies the well-known DS model for aggregating crowdsourced labels. Two SPA-based algorithms are proposed to estimate the parameters in the DS model. The first algorithm MultiSPA assumes that every worker has co-labelled some items with another worker whose confusion matrix is diagonal-dominant. The second algorithm MultiSPA-KL has theoretic guarantees on its performance under a more relaxed geometric assumption on the worker confusion matrices and the overall true label distribution. The authors conduct thorough experiments to compare the proposed algorithms with existing benchmarks on both synthetic and real-world datasets.  The paper is well-organized. The identifiability problem is interesting and relevant. The proposed SPA-based algorithms are novel and have theoretic guarantees but only use second-order statistics unlike other tensor-based algorithms which requires three-order statistics. The experimental settings are described in full details. But the proposed algorithms don’t outperform existing methods significantly on real-world datasets.  Some questions: The goal is inferring the true labels. Does the proposed MultiSPA algorithm have any theoretic guarantees on its performance, just like what Spectral-DS has in Zhang et al. (2014)? How well can the MultiSPA algorithm identify confusion matrices that are not diagonal-dominant? The name of minmax-entropy should be minimax-entropy, and it’s surprising that it achieves 91.61% error rate on TREC as shown Table 1 because TREC is a binary dataset. Could the authors check this or do the authors have any ideas why it fails?
