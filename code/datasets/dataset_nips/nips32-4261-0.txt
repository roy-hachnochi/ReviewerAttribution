5) Originality: This work generalizes a number of previous work that combines RL and information-theoretic methods.  Quality:   6) The algorithm and the theoretical results are sound.  7) In certain environments, the results reported for SAC are much lower than the ones in the original paper e.g. Half-Cheetah ~4000 vs ~8000. I would recommend investigating the source of this discrepancy.   8) Clarity: The paper is clear and the results could be replicated from the information provided. I think some of the derivations could have been made clearer, see improvements.  9) Significance: The work generalizes a number of past works and I thus think it is likely that other researchers will build on this work.  Conclusion:  10) The method and the theoretical contributions are sound, but given certain anomalies in the experiments, I do not recommend acceptance at this time.
