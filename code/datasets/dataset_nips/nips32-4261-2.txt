This is a simple paper with a straightforward proposal, execution, and presentation of results. The idea of combining rewards and empowerment has been up for grabs for some time, and thus it is by itself not particularly surprising nor controversial. (Ironically, the idea is actually conceptually at odds with the original, explicit proposal to do away altogether with rewards and to replace it with a universal objectiveâ€”that's why empowerment got invented in the first place.)  I don't have many remarks, just some minor details.  - Section 2.2. (``Empowerment'') could be simpler (mainly in notation). Equation (2) is slightly confusing at first, as \pi_empower appears explicitly in the denominator inside the log, but only implicitly in the numerator. The lemmas that follow are trivial.  - Similarly, section 4.1. (``Existence of Unique...'') could also be simpler. In fact, I was surprised that this hadn't been shown before. It's nice to see it spelled out.  - Section 4.3 with the grid-world example. This example is not very illuminating.  - Section 5.2 (``Experiments with Deep Function Approximators''): The experimental results did not look very convincing to me. Empowerment either seems to add little or even deteriorates the policies found by SAC. Perhaps the MuJoCo domains were not great for showcasing the method.  In general, while I did enjoy the paper, I felt that the significance of the results were modest, firstly because the ideas are not surprising, and secondly because I did not feel that they made much of a difference to the state of the art.   PS: The bibliography is surprisingly complete. Were all the references woven into the text? I felt they weren't.   *** POST REBUTTAL COMMENTS ***  I would like to thank the authors for addressing all the comments. I went through the experimental results again, and decided to increase the score.
