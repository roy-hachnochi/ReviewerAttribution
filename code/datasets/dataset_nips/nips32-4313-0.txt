Originality: The methods described in the paper have been studied vigorously over the past few years. The main contribution made by the paper is directly stated in the paper in the form of theorem 2. The paper highlight related work in the area that recognizes the problem statement i.e "GD gets trapped in spurious local minima in specific networks with shortcut connections " but is rather very brief in stating the line of work that aims to answer the question.   Clarity: The methods and results described in the paper are extremely well written and easy to follow. The organization of different sections in the paper can be greatly improved. The related work is stated sporadically in various sections and there is only a small paragraph that is completely dedicated to related work. Such form of writing may be confusing for first-time readers to draw a connection between related work and methods presented in the paper. Additionally, It may be a better choice to split the last section into two sections future work and discussions.  Significance: The main result of the paper is only applicable to small networks with average pooling shortcut connection, very specific weight initialization, specific step size etc. These results may not be directly extended to other shortcut connection based architectures. Thus, it may be helpful to have in-depth discussions on the extension of the presented work to other cases e.g would SGD show similar 2-stage convergence behavior? Will the convergence behavior extend to deeper networks? How to perform initialization, choose step size for deep networks?
