This paper proposes a new algorithm â€“ Interaction Hard Thresholding (IntHT) for the quadratic regression problem, a variant of Iterative Hard Thresholding that uses the special quadratic structure to devise a new way to (approx.) extract the top elements of a $p^2$ size gradient in sub-$p^2$ time and space. Then the authors show that  IntHT linearly converges to a consistent estimate under standard high-dimensional sparse recovery assumptions.   Perhaps, the algorithm is the first one to provably accurately solve quadratic regression problem in sub-quadratic time and space.  Overall I find the results and the algorithms are quite interesting although the main idea of the new algorithm is quite simple: It mainly combines the existing technique from [20] with IHT to compute the top elements of the full gradient. The paper is well organized and presented.  Minor comments: -As also noted in the paper, the quadratic regression problem has a strong background in real applications. Could you give a real example that $\Theta$ is sparse?  - I am quite curious about the proof novelty. What is the key novel of the proof?    ------After rebuttal----------------------- The authors have addressed my concerns well.
