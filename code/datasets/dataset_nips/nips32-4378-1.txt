This paper introduces a local regret for non-convex models in a dynamic environment. The authors present an update rule incurring a cost that is sublinear in time T. It evaluates its performance on a real world dataset and shows improved performance compared with baselines.   I am outside of the area and could not comment on the significance of the theoretical results. The experiments look reasonable to me.
