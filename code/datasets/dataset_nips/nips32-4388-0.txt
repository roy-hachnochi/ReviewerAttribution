Originality: The notion of the "local switching cost" is novel. The algorithm for obtaining low-switching cost and low regret is rather straightforward -- a delayed update to the policy will do. The proof is also similar to that of [15]. The lower bound is simple but the message is clear.  Quality & Clarity: The paper is well-written and clearly delivers the message.   Significance: The notion of "local switching cost" makes a lot of sense in many real applications.  Although the algorithm is rather straightforward, it also shows that a low switching cost algorithm can be achieved by a simple modification to some other low-regret algorithms. (In fact, I conjecture that every low-regret algorithm can be converted to a lower switching cost algorithm.)  Line 36: "closed related" ==> "closely related"
