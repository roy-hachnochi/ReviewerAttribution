Since Pytorch has been used and tested by the community for years, the validity of the paper is without a doubt. The reviewer finds the paper easy to read and learns a few new things about PyTorch. It is very certain that this paper has high originality, quality, clarity, and significance, though it might come a bit late.  In lines 37 - 38, maybe it is better to reorder Python, C++, Lisp, and Lua, such that they match with Numpy, Torch, Eigen, and Lush.  ===== After authors responses ====== Thanks for addressing the question.
