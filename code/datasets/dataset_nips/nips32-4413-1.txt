I read your feedback. I understood that your main contribution is theoretical (and always thought it is interesting). I increased my overall score though still believe that within the eight page limit your paper could benefit from focusing on the Ising case and only briefly mention the extension to larger alphabets. But of course I know that this means a major change that is probably not feasible.    This paper makes an interesting contribution. The problem formulation as l1-regularized logistic regression (in the binary case) and regularized l(2,1)-regularized softmax regression problem (in the general) is, as the authors also acknowledge, well known. The consistency (parametric and structural/sparsistency) analysis is new and improves in certain (small) aspects over previous work.  Formally, the improvement over previous work is a slightly better sample complexity (the dependency on the size k of the sample spaces of the variables is only k^4 instead the previously known bound of k^5). Unfortunately, I am lacking the time to check the technical soundness of the paper. All proofs are given in an appendix that I did not read. The presentation, although the proofs are deferred to an appendix, is quite technical. The given outline of the proof is too short (at least for me) to get the underlying ideas.  Experiments are only presented for rather small examples (up to 14 variables, up to k=6). Still, it is demonstrated the presented approach does indeed not need the incoherence assumption.
