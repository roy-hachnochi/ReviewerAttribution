Summary:  Authors study the convergence of unadjusted Langevin algorithm (ULA) which is Euler discretization of overdamped Langevin dynamics. They establish rates in KL divergence and Renyi divergence by only assuming a log-Sobolev inequality and smoothness. The results are significant and paper is well-written. My main concern is that there is no practical demonstration (examples or experiments) of the usefulness of the established results. See my further questions/comments below.  ** Major comments:  - Authors start their algorithm at N(x_*, . ) where x_* is a first order critical point of the potential function. They claim that x_* can be found via gradient descent. However, in practice they can only find a point that is arbitrarily close to a first-order critical point x_*. Would your final bound change after taking this into account? Same question for line 187.  - The class of distributions that satisfy LSI is larger than class of logconcave distributions. However, authors do not provide an example of such a distribution that is used in practice (satisfies LSI but not strong convexity). An example of this sort would further motivate the reader and demonstrate the significance of the established results.  - What happens to the upper bounds when you start the algorithm at a deterministic point?  - LSI implies (by Talagrand inequality) exponential decay in Wasserstein-2 metric. In the case of exponential contraction in W2, this implies back strong convexity.  Is it because you only have exponential decay rather than contraction that your results are more general than strong convexity?   ** Minor comments:  - I haven't noticed a single typo in the paper.    -- I would like to thank the authors for answering my questions. I like the results of this paper; however, I will keep my score (see major concerns above).
