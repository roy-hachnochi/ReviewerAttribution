Originality:  I think in the context of MAC problems the idea of learning a scoring model, and then using it as input to a quadratic or linear program to perform task assingment, may be origional.  Quality:  Results are adequately presented and analyzed. Clarity:  The paper is fairly well written.  I think enough information is provided in the paper and supplementary material to allow for reproducibility of results. Significance:  The work presented is limited in scope to muti-agent collaboration  (MAC) types of problems, but has some useful real world applications.
