         This paper extends the DiCE objective in a way that allows automatic differentiation to produce low-variance unbiased estimators of derivatives of any order. This is done in a way that can incorporate any advantage estimator, and shown to be accurate and valuble in practice through two experiments.          As someone who knows little about this field, I found the paper well-written, with sufficient references to and background of existing literature. What's known and what's novel is clearly pointed out, and the motivation for Loaded DiCE is well justified. The extension from DiCE appears efficient to compute, even though much more powerful. Figures 3 and 4 show substantial improvement over the previous state of the art.          The work seems to be of high quality and is presented clearly enough to be read by non-RL researchers.                  Given my limited knowledge of the area, I'll defer a careful assessment of the significance and originality of the work to other reviewers.
