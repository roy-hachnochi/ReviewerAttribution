The paper sets out to derive an arbitrary order score function estimator that can balance variance and bias. With this in mind, I think that the strenghts and weaknesses of the paper are: + well written, clear presentation + clear derivation of new algorithm - the empirical analysis is somewhat weak   Other minor comments - the subfigures in Figure 2 are nearly unreadable, expecially in b&w - the authors might want to consider "conjugate MDPs" and how they relate to their work  UPDATE: While I still do not feel perfectly confident in my assessment, I find the author's rebuttal to be satisfying. I increase my score.
