This paper can be considered as the first to apply chirality into the network structure design and has proved its effectiveness in some tasks that are related to chirality transform. It may inspire a set of work utilizing this property in the field, which potentially has large impact.   The empirical experiments mostly indicates the effectiveness of the new network structure. It would be better if it can show the performance for the entire human pose estimation pipeline, i.e., 2D pose estimation and 2D to 3D mapping. It can be achieved by modifying the state-of-the-art network, i.e. hourly-glass, into its chiral form. Besides, the network runtime and memory consumption can be revealed by quantitative results. It would be better if the experiments could be more complete.  Overall, I think this is a good paper with strong potential to benefit the readers. It has well-organized structure and good clarification, which worths a clear accept.
