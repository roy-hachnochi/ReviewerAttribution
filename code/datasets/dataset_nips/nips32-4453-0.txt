The paper is written well and quite easy to follow. The proof idea is relatively straightforward (one can learn a subnetwork for each corresponding chart and an indicator to determine to determine which charts are "active"). The main idea, as in Yarotsky (2017) is to approximate the functions by a Taylor series. As Yarotsky showed, this can be done efficiently by neural network. However, there are still some technical challenges and the main technical contribution of the paper is to overcome these challenges.  Edit: I have read the author response and other reviews. My opinion is still that this paper is well-motivated and is one direction to theoretically understand why neural networks are able to efficiently fit the data well. As another reviewer mentioned, the technical details are quite hard to follow so it would be great if this could be addressed (perhaps by making the body less dense). Nonetheless, for someone who is somewhat familiar with the arguments in Yarotsky, the bird's eye view of the argument is somewhat clear.
