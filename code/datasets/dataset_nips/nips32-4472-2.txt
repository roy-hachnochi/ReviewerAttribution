The paper extends previous Hyperbolic network (embedding and attention) idea in GNN. It provides a direct formulation of Hyperbolic method in the Graph Neural Network setup. The derivation and utilization of Hyperbolic space in Riemannian manifolds are largely similar to previous Hyperbolic approaches in word embeddings and attention mechanisms. Experiments on syntactic data as well as several real-word datasets are provided.  The current form of this paper is not ready for publishing because of several weaknesses.  The first is that the techniques used to incorporate hyperbolic geometry are mostly the same with previous approaches---the main difference is that previous work applied the same set of techniques in embeddings and attentions, while this work put it in GNN. Technical wise the contribution is not significant. The second is that the proposed method does not show convincing results on the syntactic dataset constructed for hyperbolic GNN methods. There is not much insight to learn from the syntactic experiments. The effectiveness of the proposed method on real-world datasets are also not significantly better than GCN, which is already a weak baseline, consider the rapid process in GNN research.
