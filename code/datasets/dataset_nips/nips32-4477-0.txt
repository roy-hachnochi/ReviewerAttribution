The technical innovation of the paper is quite limited, with the exploration of an observation about the resolution discrepancy between training and testing images when performing standard data augmentation. The paper is technically sound, but the contribution is also technically very simple. The paper is clear, but it can be improved.  For instance, Figures 1 and 2 are not being referred in the text.  On line 42, it is not clear what the paper means by "better results".  On line 74, the paper could have explained p-pooling. The results presented by the paper do not seem quite significant because just one dataset (ImageNet-2012) and two models (ResNet and PNASNet) are used.  In addition, are the results shown significant?  I just read authors' rebuttal for this paper and checked other reviewers' comments. Re: my review, the authors addressed them partially -- they showed results with more models, but they were vague about the significance of the results (I was expecting more formal stats significance results here). Therefore, I'm keeping my current score.
