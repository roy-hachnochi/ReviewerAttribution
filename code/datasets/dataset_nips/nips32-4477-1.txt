Clarity: The paper is clearly written and easy to follow.  Significance: The results in the paper are significant for the practitioners and existing deployments as they shed light on the train-test resolution discrepancy and suggest method to improve test performance for existing trained models.  Novelty: The analysis in this paper is novel (though improved performance on higher resolution images has been observed earlier).  Questions: While the focus is on fixing discrepancy after the model has been initially trained, why not just fix the training such that there is no discrepancy, as opposed to changing the size for test and finetuning? Line 110-111 derives f = sqrt(HW), which does not seem to be right since k doesnâ€™t include the sensor size. Typically, sqrt(hw) = 2f tan(theta_fov/2) where h, w are sensor size and not resolution, which is independent of the size. Please clarify or state what additional assumptions are made.   ---  After reading the author rebuttal and other reviews, I would maintain my previous rating of 8 ( a very good submission). Follow provides the key reasons  1) I like the fact that authors study and analyze an observed phenomenon that has been mentioned in passing in earlier works but never been looked at in detail. I have wondered about this myself and feel that the insights provided by this work are beneficial.  2) Authors provide a method based on their analysis that leads to test time improvements on pre-trained models. That itself is a major contribution and validation of their analysis.
