This paper devises a new approach to dynamic functional connectivity modeling in a Gaussian process framework. One major novelty of the work is to formulate in a fully Bayesian framework by exploiting log matrix representation, using latent factor representation, and kernel representation jointly.  There are several issues that should be clarified: - It is not clear how the loading factor matrix B is estimated. What type of prior distribution was used? Did the authors use conjugate distributions?  - There are many hyperparameters in the model. But there is no information about those values used in the experiments.  - Why did the authors focus on only trials of odor B and C, while there were 5 different odors in the data set?  - The learned or estimated loading factor matrix B is not presented and analyzed at all.
