The idea makes completely sense, the paper introduces a couple of techniques to make it work. The results are far better than the state-of-the-art in other representations. The paper is well-written.   Other comments: 1) Would it be better to use some anisotropic kernels to capture shape structures? 2) Can we make the implicit representation hierarchical? 3) It would be also interesting to see how the results change when changing the viewpoints of the input image? 4) What does equation (6) approximate in the limit? Curvature?
