Originality -  The idea of evolving core-sets in order to improve running time of linear solvers is new to me. The paper introduce the idea of core-sets, which by the review has been studied before, but on relatively small scales. The work boost the performance of existing linear solvers using new methods  Clarity - The submission is very well written and organized.  there are some typo's (lines 47 , 68 , 84 , 185 )  some of them are important for the consistency of the math in the paper. The review and the motivation is clear and helpful. proofs are well written. The paper provides enough details to reproduce the results.  Section 1.3 is exceptional. It suppose to give a good intuition for the framework but this part is not formal, and harder to understand. e.g. line 117 "a pair of coreset and sketch construction scheme" did not understand what type of input to expect , line 119 "faster", compare to what? it was unclear. Section 2 made everything clear and well defined. So maybe section 1.3 could be left out.  Quality - Claims are supported. The paper misses mentioning the ratio needed between sample size n , a sample dimension d, and parameter k, so the reader could completely understand the running time of algorithm 2. Empirical evaluation demonstrate the practical potential of their method.  Significant - This work has practical importance. practitioners are likely to easily implement suggested method to improve existing tools.   Theoretical aspect could be motivated to other boosting method for improving running time for linear solvers. Or investigate the importance of Coresets for other use.  ===  After reading authors feedback  and other reviews indicating this work is first to offer an accurate solution to the problem and a, I tend to put even higher score on this paper. The paper has great significant. Clear accept.
