Originality: The problem the paper study is innovative and interesting. However, the techniques the paper relies are variation and combination of existing methods.  Quality: The paper is technically sound with proofs for all the claims. The paper is reproducible as the authors provide code and detailed description of experiments.  Clarity: The paper is well written and very easy to follow.  Significance: The applicability of the method is kind of limited. The method and analysis are limited to a very specific type of GNN. On the contrary, the most widely applied GNN method are based on message-passing and convolution like GraphSage. The techniques in this paper is very hard to generalize beyond the PPNP model.
