This paper presents and assesses the compatibility of three geometric interpretations of equalized odds and commonly-known existing axioms of fairness within fair division literature: resource monotonicity, consistency, and population monotonicity. Compatibility in this case is measured related to how much efficiency is sacrificed to guarantee the properties in question simultaneously. The paper shows that equalized-odds allocations satisfy resource monotonicity while also retaining maximum efficiency. This is not the case for the other two axioms presented. The authors show that uniform allocation is the only rule for which consistency and equalized odds are both satisfied. Similarly, population monotonicity and equalized odds generally incurs high loss in efficiency over the optimum allocation on inputs. Notably, the findings also show that fair division axioms are not inherently costly for efficiency (as they are with punctual axioms).   The paper is significant in that it addresses previously-unaddressed definitions of fairness and attempts to operationalize them empirically. As of yet, there is not much literature relating machine learning with methodology from fair division. The authors provide a fair amount of clarity by providing clear objectives, definitions, and theorems. However, the paper is limited in that cardinality constraints are generalized to binary decisions, which may not always be the case in applied settings. Financial aid or loan settings may qualify various amounts of financial resources to applicants, but the algorithm assumes that allocations are equally spread across members.  EDIT: Thanks to the authors for responding to a misunderstanding in my review. After reading the response, my vote to accept remains unchanged.
