The paper is very well written and I believe is of substantial significance for the emerging field of fairness in machine learning. The axiomatisation of desiderata for machine learning models is a lofty goal, and I believe the field would benefit from more approaches of this flavour.  My main criticism is regarding the notation and technical definitions. There are a lot of subscripts and superscripts and used extensively. Likewise there is an extensive set of jargon that seems to be introduced at various points throughout the paper. For example encountering the sentence "...satisfies resource monotonicity if increasing $k$ does not...", the variable k is not defined anywhere in that subsection, or section, and I had to read over from the beginning to find its definition (in the introduction).
