This paper investigates the matrix decomposition under the assumption that the spiked vector comes from a generated model. In particular, a single layer generating model with a linear/non-linear activation is considered.  The authors study the phase transition on when the underlying spiked vector can be recovered, and shows that there is no algorithmic gap with generative-model priors, which is different from the sparse model.  In addition, a new spectral method based on approximate messaging is proposed. The authors shows that this algorithm can reach the statistically optimal threshold.   In general, this manuscript is well-written. The contribution is sufficiently significant. I recommend publication.   On the other hand, I feel the 1-layer generative model may be overly simple. Some discussion on  multi-layer networks as a prior is expected.  Update after reading the rebuttal letter:   The authors well addressed my question on how to generalize the model to the multi-layers case by providing additional experimental results. On the other hand, I do expect more interesting results on how this Bayes settings can give us more insight on practical problems that beyond information theoretical bound and algorithmic gap. My score is the same and I recommend publication.
