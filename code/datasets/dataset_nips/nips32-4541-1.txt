The paper provides interesting and technically sound results that extend results for sparse models to ones where the spikes are generated with a (random) generative neural network: - The paper finds that contrary to sparse models, known algorithms obtain asymptotically optimal performance even if k is small. - The paper designs a spectral method, an approximate message passing algorithm, that reaches the statistical optimal threshold. - The paper provides information theoretic results on the estimation of the spikes, for a multilayer network, extending previous results for the single layer network.    The paper writes in Section 3 that the AMP algorithm asymptotically reaches optimal performance, and that the analysis from the previous section on fixpoints applies. In the previous section the fix points are determined numerically in Figure 1. How can the paper conclude that the AMP reaches optimal performance in general, would that not only apply to the regime studied numerically?  For the
