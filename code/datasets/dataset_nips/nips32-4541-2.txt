This paper is well-written and well cited. In terms of techniques, the techniques used in this paper is mostly established tools developed in recent years. Though, for this complicated model, applying these established tools is already challenging. In terms of contribution, this model provides another example towards understanding the statistical-computational gap in teacher-student scenario: the behavior of this model is different from sparse PCA. Though, it is arguable that this different phenomenon is interesting enough. Overall, this is a good paper, so I vote for acceptance.   --  The question was that, whether this result is interesting enough. The authors' reply sounds reasonable.
