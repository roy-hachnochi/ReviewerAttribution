I have read the authorsâ€™ response. Overall, I think that this is a solid paper with significant theoretical and algorithmic contribution, and it is also well-written. A minor concern is that this paper established the convergence results under strongly convex and non-convex settings, whether the result can be directly derived for convex setting, i.e., the case of \mu=0 in Section 4.1. I hope that the results for convex setting can be added in the final version.
