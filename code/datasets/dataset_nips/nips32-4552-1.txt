AFTER REBUTTAL  This is an interesting problem setting. The paper covers a large amount of highly technical material and some proofs contain interesting original ideas. Furthermore, many experiments were run and I have the rare feeling that contrary to many submissions, the results were truly honestly reported rather than cherry picked.  Overall, it is clear that the authors worked very hard on this paper and are mathematically competent.  However, more work is needed to make the paper meet NeurIPS's standards in terms of exposition: the paper is sloppily written, both in terms of grammar and in terms of mathematical accuracy. Most proofs and mathematical statements are littered with typos and the formulae are often awkward. Although I believe the proofs to be correct (in the sense that the flaws are not fatal) and it is in most cases possible to understand the proof after thinking about it for a long time, the mistakes severely impede understanding. The significance of the results in the experiments section does not appear to be very clearly explained either.    In conclusion, the topic and the amount of material covered are amply enough for an excellent submission. However, the work would definitely benefit from substantial revision. Taking everything into account, this is a borderline submission.  I am also concerned that the authors did not seem to acknowledge the need for revision in the rebuttal phase. For the good of the community, I hope they will consider making improvements for the camera-ready version.
