The authors work on the distributed low-rank matrix factorization problem, while the performance of the proposed method on distributed systems is not validated by experiments.  The novelty of this work is not clear. For example, the Proposition 2.1, Definition 2.1. Theorem 2.1, Theorem 2.2 and Theorem 2.3 are copied from existing works. The results in Theorem 2.4 are easy to derive and do not spell out the implication to the main result.   In Theorem 2.5, the objective function will converge under the assumption that the sequence ${z(k)}$ is bounded. However, the authors do not prove when this condition will be satisfied.  In the literature of MF, there have been a number of works showing that under the incoherence condition, alternating minimization applied to the factors recovers the true matrix. Such kind of statistical guarantee is missing in the work.
