I've read the response and remain my score.  ==============================================================  1. Originality: This paper improved the general distributed gradient descent for matrix factorization under suitable conditions. 2. Quality: The proposed algorithm is simple and easy to implement, and its analysis is comprehensive and beautiful. 3. Clarity: The statements of theorem and its preliminaries are clear. Even though I am not familiar with the technical details in this paper the main idea can be understood. 4. Significance: This paper gives a good point to generalize the standard DGD algorithm.
