Originality: This paper takes the next step for stochastic computing with LSTMs, quantizing all operations. It thus follows the obvious path to go and applies standard stochastic computing methods to get there. The novelity comes through the experimental analysis.   Quality: There are no technical flaws. However, the evaluation metrics were defined in a way that they are skewed to show extraordinary benefits by neglecting some important contributions to the overall cost. Also, relevant newly introduced hyperparameters are arbitrarily chosen instead of evaluated.   Clarity: The evaluations assume a hardware architecture for the baseline as well as their own work which is not described, thereby making some parts of the comparisons impossible to undestand in-depth. The required space for this could be obtained by shortening the 2-page primer on stochastic computing to a minimum. Some parameters (e.g. l) were chosen arbitrarily.   Significance: Hard to say, because the presentation of the results does not allow for a comparison to non-stochastic computing methods. In the points compared, the results seem very promising.
