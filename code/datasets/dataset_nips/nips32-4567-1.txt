This paper proposes an implementation of LSTMs that is believed to be more compatible with hardware chips by replacing the continuous non-linear operations of RNNs with logical operators based on XNOR gates and stochastic computation.  The proposed WIStanh seems to be doing much better jobs in terms of approximating hyperbolic tangent function compared to IStanh function (baseline).  I am a bit concerned by the binarization procedure and the trick that the authors used to flow the gradients : Eq. (19). Did the authors experience saturation issue by using this trick?
