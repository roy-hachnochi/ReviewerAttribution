Among the positive aspects of this paper is that it' well written, the theoretical results are clearly explained and the related work review is fair and engaging.  Among the negative aspects:    1. It's unclear what is the dual norm in (4.2b), since all previous definitions refer to the local norm || ||_x . If this is not a local norm, then the claims that this analysis extends to an arbitrary domain are void since this variance is typically unbounded for simple functions like quadratics.     2. Part of the contributions of this paper are shared with paper ID #4247, who uses the same framework based on local norms applied to the mirror descent algorithm. While there are differences between both settings, this significantly reduces the novelty of the analysis.   Minor comments:    3. In Theorem 1, D is severely overloaded. It means both the arbitrary constant D as well as the Bregman distance, making for example the definition of C_D confusing. I encourage the authors to choose a different name for D.    4.  In Eq. (4.7), it's unclear if the sum of \gamma_i^2 is in the numerator or denominator. Please use parenthesis to make this clear.    5. Below Eq. (5.2), is rho = theta? Otherwise I don't see any \rho in the formula.  # Post-rebuttal  I have read the author's rebuttal and the other reviewer's comments. The author have clarified the relationship with paper ID #4247 which was my main criticism. I have increased my score accordingly.
