*** Update: The authors have addressed my comments. But I also agree certain points brought by Reviewer 4 (e.g. the writing can be more focused on TD), so I decided to keep the same score. ***   I like the linear system perspective on the update rule of temporal difference learning. Although similar ideas have been applied in the background in proofs here and there, it is good to have a comprehensive treatment based on control theory. Overall I like the perspective provided by paper. However, I'm also worried that, while one can definitely formulate that as a linear system and then apply known results in control theory. It doesn't seem to provide strong insights to temporal difference learning per se, if it introduces additional warranted assumptions to characterize the system behaviors. Below I list some concerns about certain technical points which I wish the authors can clarify.   1. Assumption on E[b(z^k)] = 0.   I am wondering whether this is assumption is reasonable in practice. For example, is it true for the b(z^k) of the classic rule (13)? It seems that it depends on the distribution that determines \theta^* and whether the problem is discounted. Also, do we need still this assumption in Theorem 2? It is not clear, though it seems to be according to line 259.  2. The stability of linear systems.  The authors provide analyses based on perturbation to show that the system can be stable when the step size is small enough. Nonetheless, at the end, the argument still hinge on \bar{A} is Hurwitz. How can this be ensured?. For example, under what assumption, can this be true for the simple update rule in (13)?  Minor questions:  Why is there a minus sign in line 213? Is it due to the Hurwtiz assumption?  Typos:  In (9) shouldn't it be q_i^k?  A parenthesis is missing in line 142 line 167, x^k -> s^k
