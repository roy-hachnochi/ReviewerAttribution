originality: novel use of HST metric embedding and algorithm specialized to HST metrics.   clarity: The overall thrust of the paper is clear. however, the grammar and writing is consistently slightly wrong throughout.   significance: these results significantly improve SOTA for the facility location problem under the constraint of differential privacy.   comment:  * why frame this problem as the super output setting instead of framing it as an allocation problem subject to Joint Differential Privacy (JDP), since that is how the solution is framed.
