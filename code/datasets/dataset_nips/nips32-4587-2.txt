The paper improves the approximation ratio of an important problem. The algorithm, however, is largely identical to the previous one, except that it keeps only a frontier of marked vertices as facilities rather than all of them. The change does make the analysis more challenging but not overly so. In any case, given that facility location is such a fundamental problem in computer science and it improves to ratio to almost tight (to this end, I'd appreciate the paper much more if the lower bound is proved to be 1/eps), it is a viable acceptance to NeurIPS.
