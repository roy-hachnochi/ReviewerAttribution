The paper was a pleasure to read. The contribution was stated clearly and the literature reviewed extensively, with interesting links being drawn to multiple techniques.   To the best of my knowledge this general view of auxiliary variables, and of embedding samplers in latent space to obtain generative models is a novel contribution (at least in this generalised form, special cases were known, cf. HMC and SMC) that has both a didactic and, potentially, a practical use.  Unfortunately the empirical results seem inconclusive, and no fundamentally new algorithm is put forward: in the paper well-known sampling methods (SNIS and HIS) hitherto used for inference have been applied as generative models. This alone does not, in my opinion, constitute a sufficiently original contribution, especially since the resulting methods marginally under or over-perform compared with existing methods.   Despite this, given the useful insights and unification this paper provides, I would recommend it for acceptance, provided the points below are addressed.  ########### POST REBUTTAL ###############  I'd like to thank the authors for addressing the reviewers' concerns. In particular for running the experiments requested in the short amount of time available. The consensus that emerged from discussing with the other reviewers, however, is that the main contribution of the paper is of a "didactic" nature, rather than a practical one. I must admit fault for not emphasising this point enough before the rebuttal, but I feel that while this work could potentially be very useful and exciting, this potential has not yet been borne out.  I think the main way to address this would be to show how this framework allows us to study various choices of conditional distributions on the auxiliary variables and to classify the resulting tightness of the bound (for fixed model parameters) as well as the quality of the resulting samples (or predictive accuracy/calibration in the case of a predictive downstream task).  I do remain of the opinion that this paper is well written and deserves to be shared. So I keep my score a 6 and recommend that this paper be accepted.
