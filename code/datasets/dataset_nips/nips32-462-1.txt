The paper proposed a strategy which guides the model logits toward more ‘question biased’ logits. The effect of this is that when the prediction is the same as the label, the loss is smaller. If the prediction is not the same, then the loss is larger.   The model achieves this by merging the normal VQA model logits with the logits that is generated based on question only. During testing, the path from the question-only side is removed so that only the VQA logits will be used during prediction.   The experiments show the method outperforms existing methods in the VQA CP data.   The paper is well written and easy to follow.   The role of the c’_q classifier is a bit unclear. Since the outputs of c_q are already the logits, why is it necessary to feed c_q logits into another classifier? What if the logits of c’_q and c_q do not match each other? Is there any way to enforce the consistency of the outputs of c’_q and c_q?   The way of combining question-only model is not unique. Why choosing this model? Have you tried any other candidates?   The method seems to perform well in the VQA CP data. However, its use case may be very limited. It is only applicable in VQA where question biases are present. It cannot be adapted to other applications. It also does not address other robustness issues of VQA, for example, the circle consistency. Therefore, although this idea seems novel and valid for this application, its impact may be low.  *** After reading the author feedback *** I appreciate the additional experiments and clarifications wrt the role of c'_q and the ablation wrt the combination of the q-model. This clarifications and the additional results add strength to the paper.
