Summary - The authors address the task of VQA with a specific interest in minimizing unimodal bias (specifically, language bias). For that they propose a general approach that can be combined with different VQA architectures. The main idea is to make use of a question-only model to VQA (no image input), and reduce/increase the loss of the data points that are correctly/incorrectly answered by the question-only model.  - The experiments are carried out on the VQA-CP v2 dataset. A direct comparison with the prior state-of-the-art [25] (with the same underlying VQA architecture) shows a superior performance of the proposed method. The authors also show that their method only leads to a small drop in performance on the standard VQA v2 dataset. - The qualitative results in Fig 4 are interesting and informative.  Originality - The proposed is overall novel, to the best of my knowledge. Nevertheless, it resembles the method of [25], which while mentioned, could be compared to the proposed approach more thoroughly. E.g. [25] also contains a question-only branch to “unbias” the VQA models. It would help if the authors illustrate the two approaches side by side in Fig 2 and provide a detailed comparison. - There are other recent works exposing unimodal bias in tasks such as embodied QA [A,B], vision-and-language navigation [B] and image captioning [C].

Quality - It is not entirely clear how the classifier c_q is trained; L150 mentions a cross-entropy loss, but it does not seem to be visualized in the approach overview Fig 2? (I assume that the classifier c_q represents the question-only VQA model?) - Later another loss, L_QO, is introduced in L184 for the classifier c_q’; it is supposed to “further improve the unimodal branch ability to capture biases”; what is the connection of this loss to the one mentioned above? What is the role of the classifier c_q’? - The experiments are only carried out on VQA-CP v2, not on VQA-CP, as done in [25]. - There is no discussion of why the proposed baseline benefits from the proposed approach much more than e.g. the UpDn model (Table 1 vs. Table 2). - It would be informative to include the detailed evaluation breakdown (by answer type) for the experiments in Table 2 (similar to Table 1), for a more complete “apples-to-apples” comparison to [25].  Clarity - The authors title the paper/approach “Reducing Unimodal Biases”, while they specifically focus on language biases (question/answer statistics). Some prior work has analyzed unimodal biases, considering both language-only and vision-only baselines, e.g. [B]. It seems more appropriate to say “language biases” here. - It is not clear from Fig 2 where the backpropagation is or is not happening (it becomes more clear from Fig 3). - L215 makes a reference to GVQA [10] performance, but it is not included in Table 1. - The prior approaches in Table 1 are not introduced/discussed. - Writing: L61: from => by, L73: about => the, L196 merge => merges  Significance - There is a great need to address bias in deep learning models, in particular in vision-and-language domain, making this work rather relevant. While the proposed method does not appear groundbreakingly novel, it is nevertheless quite effective. The main issues of the submission are listed above (e.g. comparison to [25], confusing parts in the approach description, somewhat limited evaluation).  Other The authors have checked "Yes" for all questions in the Reproducibility checklist, although not all are even relevant.  UPDATE I appreciate the new baselines/ablations that the authors provided upon R2’s and R3’s request. Besides, they included convincing results on VQA-CP v1 and promise to address some of my other concerns in the final version. I thus keep my original score “7”.
