 The paper investigates the complexity of learning a ReLU with noise and under the Gaussian distribution, which arguably is a more interesting case than at least some of the previously considered ones (in which there was no noise or on the lower bound side of things, the hardness steamed from the underlying distribution).   Assuming the hardness of learning sparse parities with noise, the paper shows that getting an additive epsilon approximation requires n^Omega(log(1/eps)) time. The reduction also proves that a gradient descent algorithm cannot converge in polynomial time. The second main result is an efficient algorithm for learning an ReLU with polynomially larger error than optimal (opt^(2/3) instead of opt). This result is obtained by exploiting a connection to learning halfspaces.  I think both the considered setting (learning ReLUs in the Gaussian setting with noise) and connections to learning parities and halfspaces are very appealing. I therefore vote for accepting the paper.
