The paper is extremely well written, very nice read!  Still, the connection to hiring is a bit tenuous.  I understand motivating this as related to the secretary problem, but with types / multiple open positions, but the abstract/intro are really application-focused for what quickly becomes an entirely theory matching paper.  I'm positive on the matching results, but perhaps the connection to real hiring is a bit oversold.  Some more in-depth comments/questions follow in the Improvements section.
