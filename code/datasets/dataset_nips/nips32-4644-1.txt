The paper presents very solid theoretical result. It is also related to a classical problem in online algorithm (the online secretary problem). Overall, the paper is nicely written. There is a couple of suggestions that I have, but nothing major.  Line 43 and 44 could be clarified a bit. First, it is said that they consider "algorithms" (plural), but on line 44 is used only "algorithm" (singular). Also, in either case, what are those algorithms considered there? I would suggest rewriting that entire paragraph.  "As we shall see in the next section, learning from the training set allows one to retain exponentially less items than is implied by the theorem above" -- I don't see how is this the case. Both of the results are linear in k. Was is the idea to say that there is an exponential improvement in 1/delta?  The paper does not study a pure online question. In online settings, one is supposed to commit to a decision immediately, while here it is not the case that a candidate should be assigned/hired immediately. The studied setting in this paper falls more into streaming setting, where one makes a pass over the stream, collects a small number of elements and at the end of the stream performs final computation. Moreover, there has been a number of papers studied streaming with random arrivals (submodular maximization, computing matching and estimating their size, randomized greedy for maximal independent set ...). It would be nice to mention this in the paper.  I find this paper as a good fit for the program of NeurIPS. As discussed already, it would be beneficial to comment about fallback options.  --- Updated review --- Thank you for the feedback. The feedback addresses my "fallback" question, so I increased the score. It still would be nice to be more careful in which way is this problem addressed -- as already discussed, this problem does not fall into the standard category of online problems, so I hope that this will be addressed/discussed in a revised version.
