Originality: to play the devil's advocate, the key message of this paper is "outside their working hypothesis, mainstream defense mechanisms do not work", is not that somehow a tautology ?  Clarity: the paper is fairly well written, my concern is more with what is missing, rather than the clarity of what is already there.  Precisely, what is missing is a thorough analysis of what is really wrong in the aforementioned hypothesis.  Significance: The main point of this paper is to show that the prerequisite hypothesis of previously published defenses might not always hold. In particular, the empirical variance of the correct workers might be too high to enable robust statistics methods to work. This paper would gain significance by elaborating more on that. I was surprised to see this question mentioned in the abstract but not that much elaborated in the main paper.
