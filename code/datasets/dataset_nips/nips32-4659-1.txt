This paper studies the problem of a revenue maximizing seller setting prices in a repeated dynamic contextual setting for a utility maximizing buyer.  The core of the mechanism starts with the NonClairvoyantBalance mechanism in [Mirrokni et al 2018], which is a mixture of 3 auctions: free, Myerson pricing, and posted price w/ fee. In that work, the mechanism is run in each stage based off of the seller's knowledge of buyers distributions, and is parameterized by a "bank balance" that keeps track of the utility accrued over time. One auction is added here - a random posted price, and this auction is used to get the robust non-clairvoyant dynamic mechanism. More discussion would be helpful surrounding the exact benefit from adding the additional auction into the mix.  The paper then tackles the contextual dynamic auctions problem in non-clairvoyant environments, combining a variant of the first 4-auction mechanism with a learning policy from Golrezaei et al 2018. In the process, the posted price auction becomes much more intricate (Def D.1, Hybrid Posted Price w/ Extra fee). The exposition covers directly what is happening, but lacks motivation for why things are happening. This combination of approaches builds very materially on prior work. [After response: Thank you, please include in final version].   The paper is generally well written, though more motivation throughout for decisions would be helpful (e.g., the choices of auctions constituting the mechanism - why these four, and why can't we drop any?).
