Based on structured SVM, the authors combine the structured prediction and the learning using hinge loss, the results is a novel model, Graph Structured Prediction Energy Networks. Overall the model is novel and the theory is mostly solid. However, I have some concerns about the inference part.    1. Marginal Polytope. The relaxation of the marginal polytope is always tricky for structured prediction. A loose relaxation might result in an efficient algorithm, but the bad quality of the solution. Tight relaxation is often unaffordable in terms of complexity. In the Inference algorithm, it is not clear what kind of relaxation of M is used.  2. Running time. The inference of a structured prediction model can always be slow. Can the authors provide a detailed running time of the proposed model on each application?   ====== After Rebuttal ====== In the rebuttal, the authors still fail to give a detailed description of the local marginal polytope. It is true that GSPEN allows the practitioner to select a structured prediction algorithm (associated with some relaxation of M). However, in practice the choice of relaxation is tricky. The authors claim that they are using the local marginal polytope in [43]. However, there are also different versions of local marginal polytope in [43], e.g. Bethe approximation and Kikuchi approximation. It is also important that different approximation may result in different time complexity of inference algorithms. A tighter relaxation (e.g. Kikuchi approximation) may have a large complexity for each iteration but requires fewer iterations to reach a higher accuracy than a looser relaxation (e.g. Bethe approximation). Based on this, the complexity provided in the rebuttal might be too rough.
