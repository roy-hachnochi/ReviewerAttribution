+ This paper is clearly motivated. The paper aims to address the limitation of structured output prediction methods, which struggle with explicitly modeling correlations between a large number of output variables. To this aim, the paper makes an incremental methodological contribution by extending a recent approach, Structured Prediction Energy Networks, by Belanger and McCallum (refs. [4,5]).   + The paper demonstrably advances state of the art. Authors compare inference and learning settings and report results on the tasks of optical character recognition, image tagging, multilabel classification, and named entity recognition.  - While empirical results support the claims of this paper, they are not supported by theoretical analysis. The GSPEN model description in section 3.1 seems rather ad-hoc; no intuition or theoretical insights are given.   - Strengths and weaknesses of GSPEN model are not evaluated. Since GSPEN is an extension of SPEN model, it would be great to understand better the settings in which GSPEN is preferred over SPEN and vice-versa.
