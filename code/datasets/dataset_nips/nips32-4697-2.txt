Originality: This work resolves an open question. The approach is based on a characterization of private learning as well as recent progress in online learning and boosting.  Quality: The technical claims in the paper are supported by valid proofs. While there might be slight inaccuracy/typo in the statement of lemmas and theorems (see Part 5 (1) and (2)), these issues can be easily fixed and do not affect the validity of results.  Clarity: The paper is beautifully written and very easy to understand. In particular, Section 1.1 gives a clear overview of their proof and also suggests some technical issues that have to be addressed. The full proof is very structured and easy to follow.  Significance: This work resolves an open question regarding the relation between online learning and differential privacy. While I am not an expert on these topics, this result seems solid and significant to me.  *** added after author feedback *** I have read the author feedback and thank the authors for answering the questions.
