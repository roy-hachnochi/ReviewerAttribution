Originality  The paper seems fairly original. The idea of leveraging known facts about linear eigenfunctions to obtain a relation between the underlying Gram matrix and the spectrum of the adjacency matrix is nice. Based on my reading of the supplement, the analysis rests heavily on prior work which bounds the error between the spectrum of T_W and T_n, in the case where W is Sobolev smooth.  Quality  From a limited reading of the supplement, the proof techniques make nice use of a variety of facts in operator perturbation theory, and seem interesting independent of this application.   Simulations could be improved. For instance, the left plot in figure 1 could include a slope, to demonstrate the error is obeying the stated rate in Theorem 4.   The probability of event E holding ‘for n large enough’ seems weak, particularly since Theorem 4 claims an asymptotic rate of estimation. Could a sense be given of how P(E) depends on n and W?  Some typos, including [line number]: [32]: ‘mane’ [58]: ‘though as’ [76]: ‘nonassymptotic’ [81]: ‘UVST’ [148]: ‘need precise eigenvalue...’ [208]: ‘versin’ [224]:  [Algorithm 1]: Lambda_1 is initialized to depend on lambda_i before i is defined. Should this be lambda_1?  Clarity  The role various elements play in the analysis could be more explicitly untangled. For instance, if I understand correctly, the Sobolev rate comes from the estimation of the spectrum of the operator T_W by the (unobserved) operator T_n, which dominates the rate of estimation of the spectrum of the operator T_n by \hat{T})_n.   Similarly, given the primarily theoretical nature of this paper, more detail should be given regarding the techniques used for novel aspects of proof.  For instance, on lines [78-80], the authors mention “adaption of perturbation theorems for matrix projection… to the ‘nearly orthogonal’ case.” It might have been nice to expound on this in the main text.   Significance  The setup is limited to the case where latent variables are sampled uniformly over the sphere. This seems unrealistic in practice and is additionally unverifiable, considering the variables are latent. The discussion section mentions extensions, but they are still restrictive, as in general the analysis critically rests on the ‘addition theorem’. Overall, this work therefore is of theoretical interest but seems unlikely to have practical impact.  Particularly in light of these practical limitations, more motivation for the specific problem of latent distance estimation should have been given.
