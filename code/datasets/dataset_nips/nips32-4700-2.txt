The authors consider the problem of estimating the latent variables of graphon defined on a sphere. They introduce a spectral algorithm to estimate the pairwise distances between the latent points and prove its rate of convergence.  Originality. ============ The paper contains original results about the estimation of the underlying pairwise distancaes oof the latent points of a graphon (defined on a sphere). A lot of the mathematical machinery developed draws from the existing literature, but given the technical nature of the topic this is to be expected. The results are supported by theory and a set of numerical experiments.  Clarity. ======== The paper is written in a clear and coherent manner.  One question I have about the numerical experiments is why the score function appears to be peak not only at dimension three, but seems to have some further local maxima at 7, 11, etc. Is there an intuitive reason for this?   Significance ============ Graphon estimation and latent variable models for graphs are of great relevance for learning from graphical data. Hence the contribution of the authors is certainly relevant.  Where the authors could have done a better job is in pointing out potential applications of this kind of model. A brief brief example application to a real-world data set would also have strengthened the paper in my opinion.   Quality ======= The quality of the paper is good, overall.  There are a few statements discussion items, however, which I find could be improved.  The authors state thet the usual embedding space is a sphere or the unit cube in the introduction -- I would think that for geometric graphs the cube is far more common. Are they referring to random dot-product models here? Could they provide some further reference for geometric graphs on the sphere?  The authors state that random dot product are more restrictive than the model they consider here, but do not discuss how/why this is the case, so the reader is left hanging. To improve the paper I suggest adding a discussion to make the relationships clear. Are they claiming that their model is a strict superset of RDPGs? If yes please elaborate.  Given that their model is based on 'relatively sparse' graphs, but many real-world networks are, in fact, very sparse, I think this aspect (which is a common sticking point with the graphon model) should be discussed in a bit more detail.  Do the authors have an idea of how to make their results applicable for sparse graphs (e.g. using graphex or other constructions)? Would there be a problem with the spherical embedding space in this case?  Typos:  l.208 versin -> version Supplementary information l.226  -- there is a sentence starting with "In Figure.." that does not have an end.  Conclusion ========== Overall I think this is a good contribution that would merit publication.  [post discussion] After reading the authors' responses and the discussion, I feel this would make an interesting contribution, provided the authors improve the paper along the lines indicated in the response letter.
