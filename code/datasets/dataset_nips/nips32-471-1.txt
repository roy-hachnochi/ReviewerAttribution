In this paper, the authors proposed a conic convolution operation for vanishing point scanning, my comments toward this paper are shown as follows: 1) The writing of this paper needs improvement. In section 1 and 2, the motivation and relationship with previous methods have not been introduced clearly. The English usage is also not good. 2) After sampling v in 3D space, how the direction vector calculated in the 2D space? 3) In the inference phase, the network need to forward many times, which will lead to a huge computational burden. Can the authors report more details about their coarse to fine algorithm, e.g. how many samples have been generated in the coarsely, how many samples have been selected to the next stage of processing, in the next stage of processing, how many samples will be generated around the seed samples? At the finest scale, in order to get pixel level accuracy, do you need to scan a large amount of pixels one by one? I think the speed of this algorithm should be very slow. 4) Although the authors argue their proposed metric is better than the previous ones, I think it will be better if the authors could also report conventional metrics on the competing datasets. 5) The authors tested the proposed algorithm on four datasets, but only compared with the proposed baseline methods, I  think the authors should also report the baseline results provided by the dataset papers.   Comments after rebuttal: The authors have addressed my questions on the efficiency and implementation details issues, but I still think the writing of this paper needs some improvement. Due to the above reasons, I raise my rating to 6.
