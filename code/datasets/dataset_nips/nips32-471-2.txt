Originality: The problem to solve in this paper is an existing topic, but the method is novel. They propose a novel framework as well as a novel operator to exact the geometric feature for vanishing points.  Quality: The quality of this paper is good.  - Although the loss for training the network is clearly described, I recommend the loss function should also be written in the paper. - The formula (3) is kind of confusing: e.g., delta x and delta y are not clearly defined.  Clarity: The paper is clear.  Significance: This work is relatively significant.
