Overall I think this is very nice work. The idea is clear and interesting. The mathematics are well formulated. The only drawback here is it seems the comparison experiments are somehow insufficient and therefore readers may not know the performance comparison with other more recent methods such as [4,5]. Also, I think the authors should release the code as an additional contribution.  But overall I think the idea of step-wise alignment is interesting enough for this paper to be considered as a good submission.
