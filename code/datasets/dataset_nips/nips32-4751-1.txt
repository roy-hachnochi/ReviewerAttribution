This is a very interesting paper, and its demonstration that iterative key-point methods can be learned will likely spur new research in this space. The paper provides a convincing motivation for the algorithmic approach, and strong benchmark evaluations. While the paper addresses one very specific problem in computer vision, I think the general approach to adaptive, iterative refinement of this constrained optimization problem may be of broader interest to the community. POST-REBUTTAL: Thank you for providing the ablation studies and particularly the computation speed figures. They significantly strengthen the paper.
