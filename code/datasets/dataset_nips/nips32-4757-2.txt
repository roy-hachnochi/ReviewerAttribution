Originality: The proposed UMAL is novel. It combines and extends the ideas of mixture density network and quantil regression, which treats each quantile level as a single component. It also draws connections to other quantil models.  Quality: The technique used in this paper seems to be valid. The synthetic dataset experiment demonstrates the claimed advantages of UMAL. Clarity: When I first read the paper, I got stuck at the quantil regression section. So it would be great to include a brief review of the properties of quantil regression in the appendix. Also I am still a bit confused about the differences between Independent QR (IQR) model and Independent ALD, could you make it more clearer (such as the training objective function/training algorithm for IQR)? Significance: The proposed model empirically demonstrates the better modelling performance for the hetergeneous distribution. This might be a useful tool for modelling aleatoric uncertainties.
