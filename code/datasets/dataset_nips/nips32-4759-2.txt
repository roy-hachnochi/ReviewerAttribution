In overall, I think this paper is both significant and practically useful for estimating the partition function. I enjoyed reading the paper and think it is novel enough to be accepted. Experiments are convincing and well designed.   However, I am slightly concerned about the generality of the algorithm. Although the algorithm was written in a general way, i.e., not tied to the permanent problem and particular choice of bound, only a single choice of upper bound from Soules is considered for the permanent problem. This is potentially problematic since the algorithm might result in too many refinements and inapplicable for other upper bounds, unlike the claims that the authors made.   I also think the writing can be improved. The term "upper bound" and "nested upper bound" was confusing when I was first reading the paper. Specifically,  I would like to suggest clarifying that "it is provided that Z_{w}^{UB} is always an upper bound for Z_{w}", while "it is non-trivial to see that Z_{w}^{UB} is nesting upper bound". Also, I think Figure 1 is slightly confusing since we are discarding the unused partitions as we go down the node hierarchy, but the figure seems to require 2^{n} choice of partitions.  minor:  - I think it would be empirically interesting to see how much the upper bound is likely to fail in nesting (for a single partition). I suspect there might be extreme cases where nesting the upper bound is quite hard than others.
