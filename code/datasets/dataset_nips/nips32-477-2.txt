This paper is a natural next step to differentiable architecture search or ENAS like methods. The motivation is to bridge the gap between architectures during search time and validation time. As such, instead of sampling or taking the argmax on each edge, a collection of up to M>1 edges are selected.  The results are very good, especially that the proposed method has very low computational cost, while still achieving SOTA or near SOTA results. Especially, if we control for computational efficiency, it achieves superior results over existing baselines.  The paper is clearly written and the experiments are on some of the most popular benchmarks.
