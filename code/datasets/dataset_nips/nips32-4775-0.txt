Originality: The paper provides a novel extension of the Structured Procrastination (SP) algorithm together with a novel theoretical analysis. The algorithm seems to be a clear improvement over previous work.  Quality: The authors describe and analyze their approach in detail. I would have like to see Figure 2 discussed in more detail, as it is the main empirical evaluation of the approach. I was surprised to see the deep dip around 10 CPU days that is not reached again until much later. Is there an explanation or interpretation of this?  Clarity: The paper is written clearly and the algorithm, though somewhat complex, is described in approachable terms.  Significance: The proposed algorithm improves over existing work in that it is both anytime and adaptive. In contrast to LB, it does not require specifying additional parameters, which makes the algorithm more practical and easier to use.  This looks like very solid work, but I'm not very familiar with the area and did not attempt to follow the proofs.  I have read the author response.
