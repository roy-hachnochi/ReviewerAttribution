The template-based prediction is novel, the writing is clear and the overall performance is significant. Other detailed comments:  (1) It's better to clarify the design details of the perspective templates. Are templates in the same class have different pose?  If so, what are the poses?  (2) Sec. 5.2 heatmaps vs templates. The authors compares with the keypoint prediction baseline of Mask-RCNN, which uses the same backbone as the proposed method. I'm wondering if the worse performance of heat map based approach is due to the backbone network design. E.g., use hourglass network [A] (which is commonly used for heat map prediction) instead and see the performance? [A] Newell, Alejandro, Kaiyu Yang, and Jia Deng.
