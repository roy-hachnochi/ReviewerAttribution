The paper introduces several novel variants of existing approaches that seem to be of high relevance to me. The description of the novel approaches is generally very clear.  The paper is of high quality and I highly appreciate that the authors looked into short-comings of their approach. I would be nice to extend the evaluation with more large models and on more datasets, which should be rather easy as the implementation is done in a PPL. Further, I would appreciate if the authors would also compare the running times.  However, the paper sometimes lacks a good explanation of the math used. In particular,  (1) Before equation 3 the authors state that the unnormalized target density can be factorized. However, the index k never appears in the equation. I suppose the is a typo.  (2) Equation 5 lacks sufficient details to understand it well. (At least in my case). What is h, theta, s, A and r? It would be good if the authors would improve this paragraph.  (2) In Equation 8 the weight tilde(w) is not introduced.   Further, the paper states that several times that a certain property is illustrated in Figure 1. I was missing a proper explanation of what I should be able to see in Figure 1. I would suggest improving those parts.  And last but not least, the authors write that PGAS is not affected by path degeneracy (line 81). However, according to  F. Lindsten, P. Bunch, S.S. Singh and T.B. Sch√∂n (2015) Particle ancestor sampling for near-degenerate or intractable state transition models  this doesn't seem to be 100% correct.  ----  I want to thank the authors for their response letter.
