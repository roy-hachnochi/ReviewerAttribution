Originality: The work is moderately novel â€” the idea of ACT has been modified to propose a recurrent attention ahead.  Quality: The paper is technically sound and is grounded in previous work.  Clarity: The paper is well-written and easy to follow.  Significance: While the approach itself is reasonably straight-forward, the empirical analysis and experimental results show the merit of using adaptive attention, that maybe of interest to the sequence modeling community in general.
