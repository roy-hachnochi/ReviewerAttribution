 The authors should discuss connections of the density regression approach in Section 5 of http://www3.stat.sinica.edu.tw/ss_newpaper/SS-2018-0231_na.pdf.  The cited paper operates on the conditional density  instead of the cdf by expressing   f(y | x, \mu) = phi( \gamma(y);  \mu(x), \sigma^2) \gamma(y)  where \gamma is assumed to be a diffeomorphism.  I think the two models are inherently very similar as the cdf transform that the authors proposed can be linked to \gamma.  I do think there are certain advantages of operating on the density rather than on the cdf, the primary reason being computational convenience.  The constrained Gaussian process that the authors propose seems to be complicated to implement; the HMC approach that the authors alluded to is not automated requiring to choose carefully the step sizes.    Moreover, no comparisons are provided with the fully flexible classical methods.   The authors should at least consider some of the off the shelf conditional density estimators, e.g. the np-package as a point of comparison.   Also, flexibility in the mean function is not discussed, does the approach have a natural extension to include moderately high dimensional predictors?
