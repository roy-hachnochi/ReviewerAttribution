### 1) Content: ###  The paper proposes a Bayesian Nonparametric Ensemble (BNE) approach that augments an existing (deterministic) ensemble with nonparametric models to account for different sources of uncertainty in the data. The augmented model is specifically designed to allow for the disambiguation between aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty as well as between different sources of epistemic uncertainty (parametric vs. structural). The model design is well-motivated and described in great detail with additional details and derivation included in the appendix. Additionally, the authors provide a proof that the BNE posterior distribution will concentrate around the true data-generating distribution as the number of training samples is being increased. The paper also includes an illustrative toy example and an empirical comparison between BNE and related models.   ### 2) Empirical evaluation: ###  The empirical evaluation is insightful, and the plots are clear and complement the main text well. However, the empirical evaluation is also very limited in its scope. I am convinced that BNE outperforms the three other methods on the toy dataset as well on the PM2.5 exposure dataset, but note that BNE is by construction more expressive than BAE. Furthermore, we note that the RMSE results included in the Appendix H2 show that the loo RMSEs of BNE and BME are within one anothers standard deviations.  The empirical comparison could be made more convincing (see under improvements below).  That being said, the empirical evaluation presented in the paper is limited but, within its scope, thorough and insightful, and I believe it is borderline sufficient. I would urge the authors to extend the empirical comparisons before publication in line with the suggested improvements below.   ### 3) Presentation ###  The paper is superbly written. The presentation is clean and the writing is extremely clear. The submission is accompanied by a detailed appendix with easy-to-follow and detailed derivations and additional experimental results. The plots could be improved (see under improvements below).
