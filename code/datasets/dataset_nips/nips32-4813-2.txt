This paper presents a method for structural learning of a BN given observational data. The work is mainly theoretical, and for the proposal some assumptions are taken. A great effort is also given in presenting and develop theoretically the complexity of the algorithm.  One of the key points in the proposed algorithm is the use of Fourier basis vectors  (coefficients) and how they are applied in the compressed sensing step.  I haven't checked thoroughly all the mathematical part, which is the core of the paper. Being familiarised with BNs but not with the Fourier transformation, this part seems hard to be evaluated from my side. However, the theory seems to have shown and extensively stated (also in the supplementary material).   My biggest concern is the restriction of only two parents for a node. I am aware that authors indicate it wouldn't be a problem to make this number (rank) larger, but then one wonders why not using a more realistic approach.  I can see that the paper is mainly theoretical and I wouldn't say this is not enough if the methodology is correctly presented, as this is the case. Anyway, in a so practical issue as learning BNs one would expect some empirical evaluation with at least a classical benchmark of datasets. You could have used some 'simulation' for the black-box solved queries.  All in all, I like the idea, the way the work is presented, and I think this paper could generate interesting debate in the NeurIPS community.  Minor comments:  There are some places were English could be improved, so I suggested further checking. For instance:  - Introduction, motivation:  Bayesian networks are one of the most important classES of probabilistic graphical models - Introduction, related work: "... data is a well known but AN incredibly difficult problem to solve in the machine learning community"
