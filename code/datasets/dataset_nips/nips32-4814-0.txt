Originality: I think the task at hand is challenging and has important applications. The proposed method is a combination of two well known techniques with a necessary modification of support size to facilitate the theoretical guarantees of regret bounds. The proposed method is well motivated and has solid theoretical analysis.  Quality: I think the paper is a work in progress. There is no experimental results provided! The paper ends abruptly with no conclusion. There is clearly missing comparisons to other methods or a proposed baseline, and also discussing any weaknesses.  Clarity: The paper is well-written however it ends unfinished, with no experimental section and/or conclusion.  Significance: Since the empirical results are missing it's hard to judge the significance of the method. However the idea is an interesting follow up to the previous works [1,2], with good theoretical support.
