I'm very concerned with the clarity of the paper. Many notations are used without definition and the method is not clearly described. For example, w(s) in L98 and phi(s') in L101 are used without definition, and the same notation \alpha seems to be used to refer two distinct variables (L101 and L148). Figure 1 includes notations such as CR_3 and H, but their definition is missing in the main document. While the paper provides a generative model for the successor map very briefly, the detailed method for the inference and the reasoning behind it is missing. Because of this insufficient description, it is very challenging to correctly understand the algorithm and assessing the novelty or significance of the proposed method.  Is \alpha in L101 identical to the \alpha in L148  conditioning reward only on the arrival state s' seems unrealistic.  w(s) in L98 and phi(s') in L101 are used without definition  The main algorithm is in Appendix  * After author response * I appreciate authors for addressing the clarity issues in the author response. The additional description in the author response was helpful in understanding the notations and algorithms. I hope the authors revise the final version to include the details that are missing in the current version. Now I understood the method and increased my rating. I agree with other reviewers that the proposed method is intuitive and not studied before, so worth being presented in NeurIPS.
