This paper leverages additional assumptions in learning low-dimensional manifolds based motivated by structures seen in cry-EM microscopy imaging and computer vision which involve projections of 3D objects. Specifically, the authors assume a smooth manifold admitting the action of a Lie group G. Using principles from fibre bundles, and defining a  invariant moment affinity, they present an optimal alignment algorithm.  The paper is well-written, the model is properly motivated and the theory is sound. The design of the algorithm is neat with spectral denoising followed by checking consistency across irreps and moment matching.  However, I am not fully convinced with the the improvement in performance especially in cryoEM data.   It would be great if the authors could also show examples of classified objects in images and show additional metrics such as F-statistics for evaluating the classification. Comparisons to other manifold learning methods would also strengthen the results.
