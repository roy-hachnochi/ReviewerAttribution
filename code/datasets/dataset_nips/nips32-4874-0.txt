The paper is of interest firstly by its technical results. Non parametric estimation with adversarial losses as well as Gans are clearly the focus of numerous current ML research and in my opinion this work is a significant contribution on these subjects. Their rates unify/improve a lot of existing results of the literature and cover a wide variety of settings, thanks to the generality of Besov spaces.   The paper is also very well written, clearly introducing to the reader the substantial mathematical content needed on wavelets/Besov spaces and discussing the results in a honest way.Then it provides very interesting interpretation of the results as well as an advanced discussion on the different regimes of smoothness. Generally this paper provides a deeper understanding on this problem. I really appreciated the investment of the authors in the writing and I enjoyed reading this paper.  The proofs are also detailed and clearly written. They use classic tools from statistics (Fano's lemma, concentration bounds, wavelet estimators) and look correct - I did not find any flaw.
