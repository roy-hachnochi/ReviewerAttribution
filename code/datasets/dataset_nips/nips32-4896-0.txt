Originality: I really liked the idea of modeling MAML-like approaches using nonparametric Bayesian priors and I am not familiar with other work that does that. Thus, I consider the proposed method novel. More specifically, I consider it a novel combination of existing methods, that exploits an interesting connection between them.  Quality: The paper is of good quality both in terms of key contributions and in terms of how the contributions. are presented.  Clarity: The paper is well-written and organized, and very easy to follow, given a bit of background in Bayesian methods.  Significance: As mentioned in my earlier comments, I consider this work significant.  One other comment is that I really like the extensive discussion of related work, both in the paper and in the supplementary material. I always find that very useful and often ignored so I was positively surprised in your case.
