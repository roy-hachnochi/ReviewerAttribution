This is an "emergency review" therefore it might be shorter than the norm.   There is a substantial literature on steerability in the classical image processing domain. Recently, it has become clear that generalizing steerability to the action groups other than SE(2) is important for constructing certain classes of neural networks. Steerability can be described in different ways, some more abstract than others. This paper uses the language of fiber bundles, which is beautiful and enlightening but somewhat abstract.  The paper makes no apologies about being abstract. I can understand that to somebody who comes more from the applications side of ML rather than the mathematical side it might be difficult to digest. On the other hand, it also states that "This paper does not contain fundamentally new mathematics (in the sense that a professional mathematician with expertise in the relevant subjects would not be surprised by our results)." I like this honesty.  In actual fact, I don't think that either of the above detract from the value of the paper. This paper forms an important bridge between the neural nets literature and certain branches of algebra. I found it very enlightening.  I appreciate the effort that the authors have made to show how a wide range of other works fit in their framework. I also think that the exposition is very straight forward. It does not attempt to gloss over or hide any of the underlying mathematical concepts. At the same time, it avoids getting bogged down with mathematical minutiae or a long list of definitions. The authors clearly made an attempt to say things in a way that is "as simple as possible but not simpler." It is quite an achievement to expose all the concepts that they need in 8 pages.
