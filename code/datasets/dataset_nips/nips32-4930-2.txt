This is an interesting paper on a timely topic. As far as I understood, the results are valid in the dens case (i.e. average degree of the order n^\delta) and for fixed values of \gamma. It seems that recent works like: Efficient random graph matching via degree profiles by Ding et al (https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.07821) allows to get better theoretical results.  -------------- Post feedback:   I've read the feedback of the authors. I think that the main contribution of the paper is theory and the experiment section could be removed.
