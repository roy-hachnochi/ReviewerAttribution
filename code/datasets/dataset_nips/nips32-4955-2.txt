***Originality and Significance***  It is the first time I heard of the concept of EFCE, and it strikes me as a reasonable solution concept which deserves more study. The proposed formulation as bilinear saddle-point problem should be a novel contribution, and even without the experimental simulations I can easily convince myself that it will lead to faster computations of EFCE. I think this contribution itself is sufficient to get the paper accepted in NeurIPS.   ***Clarity***  The paper is nicely written.  ***Other Major Comments***  As a theoretical researcher, I think the authors should provide a comparison between the LP formulation and the saddle-point formulation. For instance, I would love to see the LP formulation of von Stengel and Forges presented here, so that I can see the structure (e.g., number of variables and constraints; sparse or not) of the LP, which will provide readers more intuition why the saddle-point formulation is more efficient in practice.  Also, a very natural question that the author needs to clarify is: does the LP formulation of von Stengel and Forges permit a purely-mathematical reduction to the saddle-point formulation? I ask this because it is known that Nash equilibrium of two-person zero-sum game permits the von-Neumann LP formulation and a saddle-point formulation, for which the LP duality theory establishes the linkage between them. It appears plausible to me this analog to zero-sum game might hint at something more interesting.  I am a bit skeptical about the proposed benchmark games. As we see in the experimental results, the run-time becomes very long even when the Battleship game size is raised slightly (and still nowhere close to the real Battleship game we use to play), suggesting the possibility that this benchmark game can hardly be scalable computationally.  ======  *** Comments after Rebuttal ***  The discussion about (conversion between) LP and saddle-point formulation sounds more interesting to me than the benchmark games and experiments (which took up 3 pages out of 8), so I suggest moving Appendix A to the main paper --- and if the paper is accepted, there will be an extra page available, so no sacrifice on other materials will be needed.  I understood that the game states and actions increase rapidly (probably super-exponentially?) in the benchmark games of Battleship, and this is exactly the (more theoretical) reason why I think the benchmark game can hardly be scalable computationally. Abstraction and approximation techniques coming into play might be plausible; since I am not expert on these techniques, I can't gauge how likely these improvements will happen in the future.
