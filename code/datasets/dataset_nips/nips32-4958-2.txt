This paper studied the linear bandit problem with safety constraints. The authors proposed a 2-stage algorithm for the problem and provided theoretical guarantees on the sample complexity of proposed algorithm. The performances of proposed algorithms were evaluated in simulation experiments.  The paper is well written and easy to understand. The reviewer quickly went through the proofs and hasn't found obvious flaws. Experimental results showed the proposed algorithms can converge. More comparisons with existing methods would be appriciated.   The 2-phase algorithm is closely related to the algorithm proposed in: Stagewise Safe Bayesian Optimization with Gaussian Processes (ICML'18). The reviewer would like to suggest the authors to read it and decide whether it should be cited.
