The authors present novel work regarding the ability of coupled autoencoders to analyse multi-modal profiles of neurons.  Previous work is well cited and the work is technically sound with well supported and clear claims.  This work is highly significant as neuroscience labs around the world grapple with defining neuronal cell types; the problem has become especially acute given the explosion of high-throughput ‘big data’ transcriptomic datasets.
