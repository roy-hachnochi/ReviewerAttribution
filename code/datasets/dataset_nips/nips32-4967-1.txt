The paper is clear, well written and addresses an important problem in ML research, specially for black-box models such DNNs. The authors propose a set of desiderata for concept-based explanation models and  novel method to produce global explanations for vision DNNs. The proposed method accomplish all the criteria by replicating the manual process of finding relevant concepts byt replace humans with automated methods. The techniques used to implement the method are not novel but they were  combined in a novel and relevant way. The works was thoroughly evaluated with appropriate methodologies, including an intrusion task to measure coherency, SSC and SDC to measure saliency and inspection of the learned model.
