Although building heavily on previous work (Boutilier and Lu, 2016), this paper makes a novel effort in proposing the BMDP framework as a concrete solution to safe RL. This includes theoretical results (both positive and negative) and practical algorithms.  The paper is well written, but could be organized better (e.g., page 3 is just a sequence of formal statements without any cohesive text). Clarity could be improved: since the notation is particularly heavy, important quantities should be called by their name more often.  My main issue is with the presentation of the results on the optimality operator. The fact that T is, in general, not a contraction, should be discussed in more depth in the paper, since it determines the legitimacy of the later proposed algorithms. In fact, it is shown in the appendix that T is a contraction when restricted to "smooth" value functions. Unfortunately, this is presented in the paper as a mere conjecture, for reasons I do not understand.  Other issues: 1. The exploration strategy from Section 3.2 is merely described, without enough intuition on why it is needed and how it is expected to solve the problem 2. The implementation proposed in Section 4 seems to rely heavily on results from Boutilier and Lu, 2016, but a lot of the necessary context is missing. Moreover, a high-level description of Algorithm 3 would be useful.  --- After discussion: given the new theorem, I raised the score. I expect the authors to improve the presentation of the proposed algorithm.
