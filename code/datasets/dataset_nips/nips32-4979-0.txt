1. Overall, I like this work. I checked the proofs and believed that the proposed FW algorithm is solid. It would be better if authors can compare the proposed method with existing Wasserstein/Sinkhorn barycenter learning methods, e.g., [10, 12, 18, 48] and Ye, Jianbo, et al. "Fast discrete distribution clustering using Wasserstein barycenter with sparse support." IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing 65.9 (2017): 2317-2332.   2. In each iteration, the FW algorithm needs to solve a MINIMIZE problem in continuous or discrete domain and obtain x_{k+1} accordingly. Could authors provide more details about how to derive x_{k+1}? Is it based on finding a stationary point making the gradient of objective function zero? Or sampling some candidate points and finding that corresponding to the smallest objective value?
