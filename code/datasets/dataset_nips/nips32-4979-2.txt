Pros:  - This is a nice algorithm, as it doesn't require the support of the barycenter to be fixed beforehand and provides a simple way to control the number of support points.   - The theorems proved might be useful in the other settings where optimal transport is used. The proofs in the appendix seem fine, although I should be honest that I have essentially just glanced over them.   - The paper is well organized and is mostly easy to read.  Cons: - What is the regularisation constant (epsilon) used for the experiments? It seems that the convergence essentially slows down exponentially as epsilon is decreased.   - The rate of convergence seems to be independent of the number (m) of input distributions which you are averaging. Is this the case? Or probably it is hidden in the constants?   - Besides the convergence analysis, it would be useful to compare the runtime of your algorithm with existing algorithms. Right now, nothing is said about the practical efficiency and how much it can be scaled.    - What is the initialization strategy used for the barycenter in the experimental section?   ---- UPDATE -----  Thanks for the rebuttal and doing the additional experiments. It addresses most of the concerns except for scalability, but I think that can hopefully be worked around in the future.
