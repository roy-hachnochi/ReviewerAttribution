The results above are achieved in a very modular way. Particularly, the core of their algorithm for Theorem 1.1 is an algorithm for decomposing metric spaces into pieces of small diameter. This is then used by first defining a metric space on the graph according to the optimal solution of a convex relaxation of the problem.  Overall, Correlation Clustering is an important problem which is of special interest to the NeurIPS community. This is a strong paper that presents improved algorithms for many natural variants of the problem which were mostly studied before. The paper is also very well-written and uses many interesting ideas here and there. I would highly suggest acceptance.
