This is a solid paper in the line of work that provides sharp results for linear estimation problems with random iid matrices/designs. It extends the approximate message passing algorithm and the proof of its state evolution to the non-separable penalty called SLOPE. At the same time as the author note, AMP has already been extended to non-separable penalties, e.g. [7], and the performance of the SLOPE penalty was already analysed using other methods recently (ref. [20].). This together with the results on [12] that show limitations of SLOPE common to all convex penalties, limits somewhat the originality and significance of the work.   Suggestions:  ** It could be useful to the readers if the authors discuss in related work the main results of ref. [12] to highlight the gap that is obtained between optimal estimators and any convex penalty.  ** The discussion of AMP applied to non-separable penalties could be extended, including for instance Manoel, Krzakala, Varoquaux, Thirion, Zdeborova, "Approximate message-passing for convex optimization with non-separable penalties"  ---------  Post-feedback:  I have read the feedback and the other reviews. I maintain my score. The paper presents theoretical contributions of interest towards analysis of AMP with non-separable convex penalties. But I do not consider the theoretical contribution groundbreaking and I consider the algorithm limited in applicability because of the convexity of the penalty and the assumptions on the matrix.
