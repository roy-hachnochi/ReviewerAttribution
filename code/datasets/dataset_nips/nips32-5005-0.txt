The manuscript if very well written. The problem of "error-guarantees on a stream of decisions" is of great interest.   Conservative p-values mean that the data "surprised" the researcher. In my experience, this rarely happens.  It seems, however, that the price of protection from such a scenario is not high.  This, in my view, is the best feature of ADDIS.
