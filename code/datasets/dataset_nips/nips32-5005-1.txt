The paper is very well written. Itâ€™s a pleasure to read. Online FDR control for conservative nulls is an important problem and the method is novel. The numerical studies show superior power performance compared to existing methods when the null p-values are conservative. However there is no real-data experiments in the paper. It would be interesting to see if the new method can give better discoveries in practical problems.  Minor points: Line 120: FDP_LORD++ -> \hat{FDP}_LORD++ Line 158: Do you mean \lambda*\tau <= \alpha or > \alpha?
