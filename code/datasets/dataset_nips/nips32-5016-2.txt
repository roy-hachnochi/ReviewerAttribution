*** Originality *** This work belongs to the line of theoretical developments of linear autoencoder and proposes to study linear VAEs in the context of posterior collapse. I do not know the area enough to be sure all the work is referenced. However, the related work section is clear and well-written. As a side note, the title can be misleading as the theoretical developments are not enough to "understand" posterior collapse extensively. There might be some other aspects when working with more complex models, mismatch between the true posterior and the approximate posterior etc..   *** Quality *** To my understanding, the analysis of pPCA (which probably has been observed before) and Theorem 1 are rather interesting findings. I appreciate the idea that if a behavior is symptomatic in a simple model (pPCA with Gaussian noise), then it shall not work on more complex scenarios as well.   Regarding the experiments, I have a couple remarks: + There is probably no need to point "bad" implementations in this manuscript. However, I never actually saw an open source implementation for a VAE with sigma^2 = 1 and this looks like a bad idea to start with. Can the authors provide more insight on why people would do this in the first place ?  + The main experimental results are in Table 1. In particular, they simply suggest that there might be some challenges on initializing the VAEs ? Unfortunately, the theory does not provide much more insight on this ?  + Figure 4 suggests that KL annealing might still be useful to "help" the VAE initializing its sigma towards low values. To my understanding, KL annealing was not studied in this manuscript and this is something that was not predicted by the theory ? + "This is strong evidence that the observation noise controls the stability of the stationary points in the non-linear model as in the linear case" -> are two datasets enough to claim strong evidence ?  All in all, my concern is that there are some additional claims in the experimental section that might not have a corresponding theory. I think the paper could make it clearer what is expected, or analyzed (in this manuscript or in any other of the related work) and what is not.   *** Clarity *** The manuscript is well-written and clear, I appreciated reviewing it.  *** Significance *** My main criticism is about the link between the experiments and the theory, which could be made more rigorous or explicit.  *** Minor remarks *** 1) Figure 4 and 5 should be permuted 2) Notation for the Encoder E_\psi is not used in the paper  3) Table 1 could have a clearer caption "trained on XX on the training set" ? 4) Figure 4 and 5 are not the easiest to read. Why not indicate to the reader exactly where it is best to see the mass ?   ===== After rebuttal ===== The reviewers answere my comments. I still believe there is a mismatch between experiments and theory but this is a good contribution.
