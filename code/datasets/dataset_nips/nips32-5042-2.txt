This paper has studied theoretical property of existing  Tensorized Random Projection. It has also provided a study of theoretical property of sketching method by combining tensorized Random Projection with a CountSketch. Theoretical bound improvement is marginal. More over  no experimental comparison has been done to compare the performance of combine method and existing Tensorized Random Projection.   Paper is technically sound and has theoretical significance.  But is not well written and it needs improvement.  Major comments: Authors have provided proof of having an exponentially better embedding dimension for a particular selection of S in Theorem 2.2. It is not clear if that particular choice of S is a contribution to this paper. If so, then it is better to provide a clear introduction of the proposed S before theorem 2.2.   What is T is in Theorem 2.4 is not clear to me?  It is not clear if experiments have been done with existing Tensorized Random Projection which has been proposed by [29] or some new version of it which is different than the existing [29] one. If it is the Tensorized Random Projection from [29] then motivation behind the experiments is not clear to me. If it is something different than Tensorized Random Projection from [29] then it is better to have a comparison with Tensorized Random Projection from [29]. Figure1 is not legible. What happens if m=n for both the methods?  Minor comments: The required definition of few notations has not been provided. For example, in line 48 the definition of sketching matrix is not clear.   Why all experiments have been provided for a polynomial kernel of degree 2? What happens if we use higher-order kernels?   ---After Rebuttal--- the author has replied my comments. Inclusion required definitions have been promised. I would like to increase my score to 6 provided they update the manuscript as promised in rebuttal.
