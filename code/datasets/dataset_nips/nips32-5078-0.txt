This paper studies how to test the stationarity of stochastic gradient with momentum using some advanced testing statistics that take the time correlations into accounts. Extensive experiments are run to demonstrate the advantage of the proposed method over existing approaches.  Originality: The paper is based on extending a recent paper by Yaida. It does not seem that original to me but the authors do combine the condition by Yaida with some more advanced testing statistics in a new way. Overall I think the extension is quite natural, so the conceptual novelty is not that high. But to be fair, the paper still has presented some solid new results.  Quality: I like the extensive experiments in this paper. It seems to me the quality of the experiments are reasonably good. On theoretical side, I like the intuitions in this paper: the time correlations have to be taken into accounts. However, it seems there is a gap between the assumptions in the theory and practice. The authors assume the gradient estimate is Markov in theory but in simulations they just run many different epochs. If I understand correctly, the data are reused when running different epochs. Then clearly there are time correlations between the reused data at different steps. It seems the Markov assumption is just too strong. If all the data are only used once and the gradient is sampled in an online manner, then the Markov assumption seems reasonable. But clearly the authors are not considering this case, since the online setting where the data is only used once just does not make sense for the overparameterized regions. Overall I don't think the proposed method in this paper has a solid theoretical foundation, although intuitively the Markov assumption is better than the IID assumption. The Markov assumption is not precise for the case where data is reused in multiple epochs. Another possibility is that fixing the data set and only considering the randomness in sampling. For this case, the Markov assumption seems fine but how to prove the time homogeneity here?  Clarity: The paper is well written and quite clear.  Significance: It is possible that the proposed testing statistics or some variants may be useful for practical problems although there are many other heuristics that can also be used to determine whether the SGD iterations have reached plateau or not.  In addition, the authors' approach require setting another hyperparameter delta. This may introduce some extra difficulty in applying their approach for practical problems. Overall I think the overall significance is at the moderate level.   =============================================== ============================================================ AFTER REBUTTAL: Thanks for the further explanations. The authors have addressed all concerns. I have increased my score.
