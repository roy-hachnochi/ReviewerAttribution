The paper proposes an algorithm for distilling a teacher into a student without any data or metadata. The main idea is to train a generator to feed “hard examples” (where teacher and student disagree) to the student. The dynamics of this algorithm in Fig. 1 leads to an analysis that probes the difference between the predictions of the two networks near the decision boundaries in $4.4. Experiments are done on SVHN and CIFAR-10.  1. The paper is clear, concise, and generally well-written. One thing that could be improved is $4.1. The title does not reflect all the content. Also, can we highlight what the baselines are? Especially KD(+AT) (L172) as this is used many times. It would also be nice to remind the reader from time to time when discussing the results.  2. The paper is well-motivated (L27-39).  3. The approach is sound and intuitive. Possible conceptual concerns are explicitly mentioned ($3.4). I also appreciate that the authors mention the loss terms that have been tried but did not work (L112-117).  4. The paper gives the right context on the relevant work, helping the reader to quantify the significance of the proposed approach and experimental results. For instance, it makes sure to point out the concurrent work of Nayak et al. 2019 in L81-84 and then highlight that again in L218-221.  5. Solid experiments and analysis. Main results are shown in Fig. 2 and Table 1. Overall, I like that the experiments do not only attempt to showcase the effectiveness of the proposed approach but also to provide further insights including toy experiments ($3.3 and Fig. 1), the transition error in $4.4, and qualitative results ($4.3 and Fig. 3).  ### Updated Reviews ### While the authors' statement regarding large-scale experiments seems fair, the rebuttal does not attempt to change my opinion regarding the paper's level of significance. I am happy to remain at a 7. Obviously, I would still recommend acceptance.
