I like the overall setup and the analysis from the statistical point of view. The theoretical results are sound, though I think obtained mostly with standard methods.  What I am missing most is motivation and empirical validation which is crucial for NeurIPS submission in my opinion. First of all, I am not aware of serious practical interest in accurate computation of mean ratings for recommender systems. That might be important in some biological applications but seems not to be on agenda for recommender systems. Furthermore, the experimental comparison is 1) Very limited: one synthetic example and one real-world dataset 2) Standard deviations are not provided in all the experiments. It is thus not clear, whether the experimental benefits of the proposed method are statistically significant.
