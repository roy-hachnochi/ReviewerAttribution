This paper shows a lot of theoretical work related to empirical Bayes estimates using covariates. It also proposes EBCF estimate by splitting the sample into two parts, one of which is used for mean estimation and the other of which is for variance estimations. Many theoretical proofs have been provided and robustness has been shown. Experiments on both synthetic and real data demonstrate better prediction accuracy of EBCF compared to other related methods. I am not familiar with Empirical Bayes theories, so I cannot evaluate the originality, the technical quality and the significance. My review is focused on the experiment results. Concretely, can the authors quantify to what degree EBCF dominates the methods compared by showing standard errors of MSE? In addition, what does EBCF stand for?
