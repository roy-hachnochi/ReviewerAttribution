In this paper, the authors use a general formulation of QHM and derive a unified analysis for several popular methods.  Originality: The topic of the paper, in my opinion, is interesting. The paper presents analysis and insights for several methods that are used in practice without theoretical guarantees.   Quality: The overall quality of the paper is very good. The paper is a purely theoretical paper. Some parts of the paper are hard to follow and some of the theoretical results are hard to parse (e.g., Theorem 3).  Clarity: The paper is well-written and motivated.   Significance: In my opinion, even though the paper is purely theoretical, it does provide some insights that may aid in the use of stochastic momentum methods in practice.  Issues/Questions/Comments/Suggestions: - Contributions: This section can be written more clearly. And the importance of the results can be better explained. - Contributions: “stochastic noise” what do the authors mean by this? Stochastic noise in the gradient approximations? - Theorem 2: The bounded noise assumption seems like a very strong assumption. The authors should comment about this. On a similar note, it appears that the result that \vu_k \beta_k -> 1 is derived under this strong assumption, whereas the \beta_k -> 0 result is not. The authors should comment about this in the paper. Moreover, why is the \vu_k \beta_k -> 1 result interesting? The authors should comment about this. - Theorem 3: 0<, \mu \leq … Is this correct? - Theorem 3: What is \epsilon_k? - Theorem 3: This result excludes the case of \beta = 1. The authors should comment about this in the paper. - Figures 1, 2 and 3 are very interesting. The authors, in my opinion, should expand the discussion about the results shown in these figures (e.g., the three regimes shown in 1c).
