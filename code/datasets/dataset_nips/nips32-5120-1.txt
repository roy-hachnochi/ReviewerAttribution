When contexts are adversarial, a UCB-style algorithm that operates pointwise achieves good regret, especially in the partial cross-learning case where the average clique size in the reward elicitation graph is the relevant quantity.  This algorithm is computationally viable when rewards have a convenient parametric form eliding the need to enumerate contexts.  This algorithm seems likely to find practical application.  The EXP3 variant is more of theoretical interest and is unlikely to be practically applied without additional research, e.g., eliminating the need to know the context distribution.
