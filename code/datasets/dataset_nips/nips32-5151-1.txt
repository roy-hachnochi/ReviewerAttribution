This work considers a revenue maximizing seller trying to set personalized reserve prices for a contextual repeated single-item auction among a number of strategic bidders. Importantly, the bidders must have a lower time discount factor than the seller, as this is used to balance the incentive to influence learning from the buyers.  The paper proposes two pricing schemes: CORP and SCORP, for the cases that there is known and unknown noise in the bidders value functions respectively. Both schemes are explore/exploit schemes that balance the number of periods of explore vs exploit to curtail the revenue impact from misreports as well as the number of periods in which there could be an incentive to misreport.  Importantly, in the explore phase the auction presents one random bidder with a random take it or leave it price and only leverages whether or not the item was purchased for its learning of valuations. This is critical to the analysis as it ensures that the utility penalty due to over or underreporting is high relative to the amount to gain from misreporting in the future.  Significance - This work is really the first to tackle learning contextual reserve pricing with multiple strategic bidders and it's approaches should be useful for future research in the space. [Added in discussion period]  The paper is very well written, particularly for each pricing policy. The core proofs are very involved - I followed the sketches, but am not able to verify the full proofs.  Minor notes: - 327, 468: COPR - 842: over-bided
