This paper proposes a unifying objective function for the effectiveness of a data poisoning attack to graph-based semi-supervised learning (G-SSL). Different than the other works in the literature, the attack is considered to take place during training, so the training data is poisoned. Although the problem is discussed in a fair level of generality in terms of the components of the trained data to be changed, the authors restrict the attention to cases where the ‘outcome’ component of the training data is changed.  The authors then propose two different algorithms to find the best attack under given constraints according to the objective function — one algorithm for regression where real-valued outcomes are assumed and the other algorithm for classification where the outcomes are discrete (in particular, binary for this work). While the first algorithm guarantees convergence and has a linear converge rate, the second algorithm is shown to perform well empirically.  The paper is well written. As a non-expert, the motivation, the problem definition, the proposed methods, and the discussion along the presentation of the results were clear to me as a non-expert reader. Taking granted the authors’ claim that the a new problem is studied, the extent of experiments is satisfying. The unifying approach to formulate the problem of finding the best attach is also an important contribution.
