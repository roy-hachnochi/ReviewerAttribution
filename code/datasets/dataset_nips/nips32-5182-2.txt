In this paper, the authors propose a framework for data poisoning attack to graph-based semi-supervised problems. The novelty of this paper is that the data poisoning attack is introduced during training time. For label poisoning to regression task, the authors propose a gradient based algorithm to solve this nonconvex trust region problem, which can converge to a global minimum in linear rate. For label poisoning attack to classification task, which is an NP-hard integer programming problem, the authors adopt stochastic gradient decent optimization algorithm by leveraging Monte Carlo sampling to get gradient estimator. The authors conducted the experiments quite thoroughly, which show the effectiveness of the proposed methods.  In general, the proposed algorithm is well motivated and mathematically convincing, and the paper is sufficiently well written. The authors give detailed theoretical analysis, and the proof is neat.
