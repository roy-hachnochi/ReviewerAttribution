I thank the authors for the response. My score remains unchanged after reading all reviews and the response.  Significance: The problem of data poisoning is important and inherently tied with algorithmic robustness. The paper initiates a new line of research by studying data poisoning in the context of semi-supervised learning. The work is significant from this perspective, and some follow-up works on this topic are expected. However, the authors fail to provide real scenarios, where a study on data poisoning in a semi-supervised setup would be useful.  Originality: Although the problem is somewhat new, the novelty of the methods / theory is not clear. The unified optimisation problem in eqn (2) is certainly interesting, and so is its extension to regularised semi-supervised formulation in the appendix. Two algorithms are proposed: - for regression, it is shown that the problem is non-convex and a trust region solver is presented along with convergence guarantees. There exist several other methods to solve similar non-convex problems. It is not clear how the analysis is different / more challenging when compared to existing theory. - for classification, there is no theory and the proposed approach is simply greedy / epsilon-greedy.  The challenges, if any, for extending such methods to the poisoning scenario is not clear   Quality and Clarity: Apart from concerns related to originality, the quality of the work (both theory and numerics) is good. The paper is clearly written in most parts, but contains several typos throughout (see below)  Minor comments: - line167: IF H = - K'K, shouldn't it be negative definite (all eigenvalues non-positive) instead of indefinite? - line168: M, epsilon undefined variables - Thm 2 statement: reference to Thm 1 missing - line236: "for classification" - Fig 4: There are 2 algorithms, not 3
