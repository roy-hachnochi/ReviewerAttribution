The writing of this paper is clear. The motivations of each designed loss function and the term are explained well. There are some questions I would like the authors to answer:  1. As far as I know, this submission is not the first work to introduce GCN for taking advantages of prior knowledge in Action Units.  Please refer to this work "Semantic Relationships Guided Representation Learning for Facial Action Unit Recognition". I would appreciate it if there is a comparison with this work in the rebuttal, which can highlight the contributions.  2. This work achieves a 59.8 Avg on BP4D, but "Semantic Relationships Guided Representation Learning for Facial Action Unit Recognition" achieves  62.9. The performance gap seems a little large, doesn't it?  3. In the submission, it said that "dependency matrix" is utilized and therefore it gives me a feeling that only dependency relation is considered here. The mutually exclusive relations between Action Units are not considered here? But from Equation 8, it seems mutual exclusive relations are also considered. (Please correct me if I am wrong at this place.)  4. Lmv term, which orthogonalizes the weights between different classifiers, is not proposed in this work for the first time. As far as I know, the work "Taking A Closer Look at Domain Shift: Category-level Adversaries for Semantics Consistent Domain Adaptation" already proposes to use this. Please check equation 4 of that work.
