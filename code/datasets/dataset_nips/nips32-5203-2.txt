This paper proposes a Bayesian group regularization method to jointly estimate the multiple graphical models. The method is based on the spike-and-slab lasso prior. The convergence rate and structure recovery guarantee are provided. Experimental results show the advantage of the proposed method.   Overall, the work is solid and interesting. However, I have a few concerns and questions. (1) Why does the training of the model use an EM procedure? Why not optimize the objective at (2.4)? (2) The paper claims the proposed approach is Bayesian. Then why does the paper not compare with other Bayesian approaches to learn multiple CGMs, such as the work [8] and [12] cited in the paper? If there are no special reasons, I strongly recommend the authors to supplement the experiments.
