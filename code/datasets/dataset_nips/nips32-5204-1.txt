Summary:          This paper proposes a new acquisition function for Bayesian optimization that considers not only one step in the future, but two. This is expected to be more accurate. However, taking into account that there are 2 evaluations remaining is a challenging task. The required computations are intractable and approximations need to be made. The authors suggest using a Monte Carlo approximation of the objective, which is then combined with stochastic gradient optimization. Some theoretical results about the convergence of the proposed approach are given. The method is also evaluated and compared with other non-myopic approaches for BO alongside with standard myopic approaches. These experiments show some gains.  Comments:          I believe that the problem addressed by the paper is interesting and relevant for the community. The problem is, however, that the proposed approach seems to be a slight variation of the already known methods. In particular, the only contribution seems to be the optimization of the acquisition function which is done using stochastic gradient algorithms. This seems to be a rather weak contribution.          The experimental setting seems to be limited in the sense that only a few real datasets are provided, and in those (HPOlib) the proposed approach does not seem to give significantly better results.          The authors only compare with related methods only on a set of synthetic problems extracted from another reference. I wonder why the did not compare on each problem with those techniques.          The authors also claim that the proposed approach is faster than competing methods. However, no experiments showing this are provided.          The authors also say that their approach supports using a batch evaluation setting for the first step. However, in the experiments, it is not clear what batch size they use.          There are also some typos in the paper: E.g. line 110, line 125, line 143 (what is Q?), line 154 (what is EI_2?), and line 152 (K(X_1,x) is missing a subindex).          From my point of view the paper rather weak and marginally below the acceptance threshold.          The reproducibility checklist is wrongly completed by the authors.          Summing up, I believe that this paper needs more work. In particular, the experimental section needs to be improved and to actually show the benefits of the proposed approach.
