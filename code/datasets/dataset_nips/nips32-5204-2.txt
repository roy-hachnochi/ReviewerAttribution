Originality: This problem has been studied before. However, this paper proposes a method for estimating the gradients of the acquisition functions. Quality: The paper has some theoretical analysis. However, more experimental results are required. Clarity: The paper can be understood. However, some of the text requires rewriting to make it easier to understand. Significance: With more empirical results, more researchers can use the proposed method.
