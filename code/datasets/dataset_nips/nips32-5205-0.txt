Without rehashing the "contributions," the authors have done a great job of justifying their approach theoretically, and I enjoyed reading the paper.  It is very clearly written, and the approach is well introduced.  There are a couple small concerns.  First, the paper is extremely dependent upon the supplemental material, and it's difficult to sufficiently understand the approach without reading it.  Second, the experiments are not actually that overwhelming in practical performance; they are only slightly better or merely comparable to other approaches.  Finally, I don't think "Vol" is defined in Theorem 6, so I don't know what's going on there.  There is a great deal of intuitive justification for the approach based on the idea that averaging between workers can result in pulling the worker out of a minimum.  This seems just as likely to happen to the non-leader workers in this approach.  Is this indicated in the schedule of the leader switching?  Does it tend to stick with a single leader for a long time, while the other workers are stranded in averaged locations?
