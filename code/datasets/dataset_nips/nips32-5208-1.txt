This paper makes a notable extension to the Neural ODE work, by amending the continuous ODE with discontinuities introduced by discrete events. The technically difficulty is that in the presence of the discontinuity, the left and right limit of the adjoint vectors are different. The authors propose to handle the jumps of the adjoint vectors by lifting them from their right limit to the left. In terms of the model structure, both the dynamics function and the jump function are parameterized by MLP, which is also used to model the conditional intensity, and the emission. Various methods are compared empirically, showing the advantages of the proposed approach in accuracy, parsimonious of the model, and the capability of handling events with real-valued features. This paper is nicely written, well motivated, the relevant background and is presented clearly. I quite enjoyed reading the paper. Significance wise, I can see the proposed model having applications in a wide range of time series prediction tasks, such as financial, or retail demand time series where the spikes are triggered by certain events. Overall, a very good paper.   Detailed comments and questions.  1. In section 3.1, it would be good to spell out the full generative model. For example, it would make it more clear how different marks are generated, and similarly with "events with real-valued features."  2. The original neural ODE can also be used to model inhomogeneous Poisson processes, I'm wondering how this method compares empirically to it?   3. For the experiments, it would be good to repeat multiple times and report the stds associated with the results. Also how's the running time, comparing to, for example, baseline RNN network, and RMTPP [20]?
