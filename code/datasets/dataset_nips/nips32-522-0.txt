Originality & Clarity & significance  The technique presented in the paper is quite novel. The paper is generally well written and easy to read. The method will potentially improve a lot of existing algorithms.  Quality   I am satisfied with the methodology sections. However, I have quite a few questions regarding the experimental part:  1. The experimental settings are not clear to me. For the label-conditioned branch, which I believe as one of the most important parts (e.g., the problem is raised in l-101?), there seems only one experiment in Table 4 is performed. Is it true? Does it mean all the other evaluations and ablation studies are conducted with a single branch, rather than the full network shown in Figure 2? 2. What is the actual difference between simple-2D and full? 3. I found the evaluation choices are random. E.g., (a) Table 1 shows only the performance of full model (this is fine), but there is not full model performance for 8 stacks. (b) There is a +gt only for the full model in Table 4. (c). Table 5 does not report the simple-2D and full, and the 1 cm and 2 cm. It is better to provide either consistent or full results.
