Originality and significance: It is clear that this work makes substantial contributions to understanding worst-case behavior of transfer learning.   Clarity: Given the heavily theoretical nature of the work, the submission's clarity can be improved in a few ways.  A few comments on writing and structure:  - From reading the introduction, it is unclear what the marginal transfer exponent is, and why it's needed. - Clearly state that the paper only studies binary classification problems with 0-1 losses. From the first two pages, it is unclear that the paper only deals with purely theoretical topics. This is not to say the paper adds meaningful contributions to learning theory. Introduction is somewhat misleading, and makes it hard to place the true contributions (and limitations) of this paper. - Throughout the paper, the use of "\gamma" and "\rho" as pronouns for transfer exponents is confusing, as these are not uniquely defined concepts. (e.g. Line 123 or Example 3) - Examples 2-4 would be better served if presented after Theorem 3. The forward referencing is confusing at best. - A brief explanation of why Theorem 2 is stated in terms of expectations would be helpful. - I'm guessing \epsilon_U = \epsilon_H in Remark 1.  - Line 179: Define the VC dimension notation first before using it. - Line 57: "first first", Line 70: "does the", Line 74: "efforst", Line 200: second \epsilon_1 should be \epsilon_2
