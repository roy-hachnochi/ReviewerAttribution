This paper proposes a new method for empirical composition optimization problems to which the vanilla SGD is not applicable because of a finite-sum structure inside non-linear loss functions. The method is a type of primal-dual methods with variance reduction for saddle-point problems which is a reformulation of the original problem. In a theoretical analysis part, a linear convergence rate of the method is provided under the strong convexity. In experiments, the superior performance of the method is verified empirically over competitors on portfolio management optimization problems.  Clarity: The paper is clear and well written.  Quality: The work is of good quality and is technically sound.  Originality and significance: The problem (1) treated in this paper is important and contains several applications as mentioned in the paper. However, there seems to be no method that can converge at the linear rate for this problem. As for sub-problems (2), SCGD with SVRG [8] exhibits the linear convergence, but there are some important machine learning tasks not to be covered by (2) as explained in the paper. In addition, it is confirmed in experiments that the proposed method can significantly outperform existing methods including SCGD with SVRG. Hence, this paper makes certain contributions to both theorists and practitioners. If the authors can show a theoretical advantage of the proposed method over SCGD with SVRG [8] on the problem (2) besides the empirical performance, it will make the paper stronger.  Minor comments: A regularization term $g$ should be added to equation (10).  ----- I have read the author's response and I keep the score.
