The paper gives the first analyses of the PCR under models that are commonly encountered in practice. It would be good that the relevant community know about this work. The proofs look serious though I did not check all of them.  The paper is written well in general. The following are some minor points: Line 43: ‘cf.’ does not mean ‘see’ but ‘compare’. Hence it is better to say ‘see [36]’. There are more occurrences of misuse of ‘cf.’ in the paper Line 49: what does ‘faster’ mean? Please be clearer. There are more occurrences of unclear meaning of ‘faster’. Line 93: better to say ‘than the Frobenius norm’ or ‘the average of …’ Line 120: do not use citation as the subject of a sentence Line 156: covariates matrix -> covariate matrix Line 179: better to say explicitly that gamma depends on both alpha and p Line 216: there is no ‘orthonormal matrix’, only ‘orthogonal matrix’. This mistake also occurs on Line 362. Line 245: rth -> r-th Line 364: need a full stop after ‘<= C/(1-theta)’. Line 935: insert an \in between A and R^{N\times p} A style comment: Why is the text all italic in the proofs?
