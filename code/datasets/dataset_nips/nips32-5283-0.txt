Originality: The three ways proposed in the paper to deal with domain shift in the transductive setting is new as far as I know (although I have not got a deep knowledge of the literature). Quality: The paper is mainly an empirical one, and as such the claims are supported by the results reported in the experimental section. Clarity: The paper reads well in general, although some parts can be improved: in particular I did not understand step 3 of Sec. 3.5, what does it mean to select a reliable image? and why a new target domain?. Also the introduction is too focused on comparing this work with that of [34], while barely describing that paper. I have the impression that in order to understand all this the reader needs to go through that paper. Significance: results reported are state of the art in common ZSL benchmarks, and the implementation of the approach is likely doable by external researchers by following descriptions of the paper. Regarding table 3: why results are not reported on the SUN dataset like in the other tables? Also the approach in [29] reports better results on CUB accuracy on unseen (43.7), it would be fair to add it.
