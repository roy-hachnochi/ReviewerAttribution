I feel like I have little to say about the paper.  It tackles a reasonable problem variation, is well written, and contains some clearly interesting ideas in handling the problem.  I enjoyed reading the paper and felt I learned something from it.    If there is a possible negative comment it might be that the paper seems  arguably "safe" or "incremental" -- it's not going to break open a new area.  But it's well written, it covers a natural collection of variations, it has a number of good ideas, and it gets good  theoretical results.   Good ideas include there being a smaller number of "effective experts", that is not all K! orderings are important.    The background is well explained.  There is a nicely proven new lower bound.    The Hedge-based algorithms are clearly presented as well.    The proofs are clearly given in the appendix and are also well presented.
