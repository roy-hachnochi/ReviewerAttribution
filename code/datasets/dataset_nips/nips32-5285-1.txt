The paper investigates an interesting special case of the specialist experts protocol, namely, the case where the experts can sleep from some point on, i.e., die. An algorithm is constructed and upper and lower bounds are provided.  The paper appears to have thoroughly studied the question. A particularly strong point of the paper is some non-asymptotic lower bounds for the hedge algorithm. I think this is really interesting work.
