The dying expert setting is interesting, it would be appreciated to give more examples. The overall writing is good and easy to follow.  I have a simple question on the performance measure, ranking regret. In the definition of (1), authors claim \sigma^t(\pi) is the first alive expert of ordering \pi in round t. So why do we need to specify the "first" alive expert, rather than the alive expert with the optimal performance?   Meanwhile, a contrary setting -- growing expert -- should be mentioned in the related work. [1] Mourtada, Jaouad, and Odalric-Ambrym Maillard. "Efficient tracking of a growing number of experts." ALT (2017).  Both upper bound and lower bound for dying expert setting are established, and this paper distinguishes the hardness of known versus unknown dying order.  Minor issues:  I would like to mention paper of [2] gives the non-asymptotic lower bound for expert advice problem, though the form is not as neat as Thm 4.1.  [2] Orabona, Francesco, and Dávid Pál. "Optimal non-asymptotic lower bound on the minimax regret of learning with expert advice." arXiv preprint arXiv:1511.02176 (2015).  line 222: missing one ")"
