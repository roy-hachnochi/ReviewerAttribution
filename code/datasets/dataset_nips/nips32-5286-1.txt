The writing focuses on mathematical analysis of the case where all model predictions tend to be correlated as well as on empirical analysis of how correlated the model predictions are in practice. The math looks OK, but,it is the straightforward empirical analysis that is most valuable, and it seems to me that all of the theoretical conclusions could be made without theory, simply through simulation instead of work on deriving bounds. Thus, it is hard for me to see value in large parts of the paper.
