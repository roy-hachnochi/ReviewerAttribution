Originality:  This is a highly original manuscript which goes beyond using known algorithms to study technically challenging problems and instead attempts to explain mechanisms of fundamental neuro-systems in the MEC and HCF. Quality: The claims, while profound, appear to be well built upon the 3 main figures in the article.  The authors acknowledge that further study could be done along the lines of quantitatively how grid cell solutions change when the environment is deformed, rewards or obstacles are incorporated, or place cells are lesioned, although few limitations are actually noted and overall strengths are highlighted in the article. Clarity: The article is well written and easy to understand even supposing the readers have little knowledge of place/grid cells. Significance: The article attempts to advance science in a theoretical sense which could have impact on future work both theoretical and applied given the current neuromodulation attempts to restore/improve human memory (and subservient to those navigation) systems
