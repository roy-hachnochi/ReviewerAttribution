-The paper is clearly written. The figures are well-thought-out and nicely complement the explanations provided in the text.  I find the presentation of some of the material in the SI slightly odd. Some of them are standard results in linear algebra (or follow directly from standard results), but they read like they are "new results". I assume the intent is to make the paper as self-contained as possible but please make this clear.   -The findings appear to be technically sound. The analytical results are supported by appropriate simulations.  - While the normative framework utilized in the work is not new, the analysis that establishes the conditions under which hexagonal grid cells emerge is original and interesting and I believe relevant to NeurIPS.   -In the introduction, it is claimed that there is no theoretical clarity on when and why grid cells emerge (l42-43). This is not quite true. [a] (and relatedly reference [17] ) has shown that hexagonal grid cells are optimal because they maximize spatial resolution. Please discuss. In your experiments, do you find that hexagonal lattices provide better reconstruction (e.g relative to square)?
