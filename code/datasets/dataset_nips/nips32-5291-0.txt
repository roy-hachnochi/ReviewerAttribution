The paper is not well written. The ideas are not clearly presented. The paper adapts the previous algorithm to extend it from PAC to instance optimal guarantees which has been previously studied for maximum but not ranking. The paper proved the results theoretically and provided experiments evaluating their algorithm with previous works. The paper also doesn't mention the precise applications where this method will be more useful compared to that of PAC one.  Post Rebuttal : I am happy with Author's feedback
