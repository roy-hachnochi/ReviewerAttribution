The paper is of high quality and is well written. It is fairly dense in the number of results and contains strong empirical results to support their theory which makes a good paper for NeurIPS in my humble opinion. I did not fully check the proofs but they seem sound. I am also not very familiar with the ranking literature so my next questions are mostly to help me better understand the results and will guide me to adjust my score.  * How realistic is to assume that comparisons are independent across items, sets and time? Is this a widely used assumption in the ranking community? From a layman point of view, this may seem a strong assumption as it is not the same as assuming the typical iid sampling, no? If the assumption, as stated, is required to have a well defined problem, then the question translates to whether or not aiming for exact ranking in general is realistic.  * I am not fully clear about the notation in line 49. Why is p_{i, j} disregarding "j" and defined as p_{i, S}? This was a bit confusing to me as later we see \Delta_{i, j} but it is not clear to me the role of j in this case.  * It seems that the focus is in having a small number of comparisons. However, what is the computational complexity for m-wise comparison in contrast to pairwise? And, how realistic is the worst case scenario? Where it is claimed that the number of m-wise comparisons is of the same order as number of pairwise comparisons.  On a minor note: the shorthand MNL in line 76 is not introduced properly.
