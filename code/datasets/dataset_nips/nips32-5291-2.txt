 Originality: The paper solves a previously unsolved problem and the methods seem novel.  Quality: The paper is technically sound. I still have some questions:  1. What is the purpose of Section 3.1? Since section 3.2 provides a lower bound for MNL model and MNL is a special case of SST, isn't eqn (2) immediately follows from Theorem 3? Theorem 2 is better in eqn(1), but in what case can it be larger than (2)?  2. Why do the 3 plots in Figure 2 have different number of baselines?        Significance: Active ranking under few assumptions is an important question, and previous works only solves this under the PAC setting. I think the results are significant.  Clarity: Some small typos:  1. It would be good to clarify the implications of the assumptions on line 50-58: for pairwise comparisons, this just means p_{ij}>1/2 for i>j.  2. Line 87: the square is probably inside the parenthesis?
