This work introduces a dataset built on top of MiniRTS which aims to use “natural language” as the communication paradigm for providing and following instructions.  Agents can also choose to ignore the instruction and act based on the environment.  A large scale dataset based on human instructions is collected to fascilitate training and collected based on play against a rule based agent.  There are a series of architectural choices that are than made for each of the actions and a series of encoder/decoder network choices which are compared for the communication protocol.
