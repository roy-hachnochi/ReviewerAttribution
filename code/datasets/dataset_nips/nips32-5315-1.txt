ORIGINALITY & CLARITY: The paper picks out interesting direction and clearly motivates the idea in the introduction. The figures are helpful to understand the paper.  QUALITY & SIGNIFICANCE: The main concern that I have with this paper is that it doesn't have head-to-head comparison with the existing literature, notably Lei et al EMNLP 16. Ideally, they should have performed evaluation that could be compared to the previous paper. From what I understand, Table 2 from EMNLP 16 paper could have been compared to Table 2 in this manuscript. I'm not convinced why the numbers are so different here.   The subjective evaluation should have done more thoroughly. What was inter annotator agreement between different crowd workers? Given such a small sample size (100), strong agreement is necessary for the results to be meaningful.   ==== AFTER THE AUTHOR RESPONSE: Thank you for clarification.
