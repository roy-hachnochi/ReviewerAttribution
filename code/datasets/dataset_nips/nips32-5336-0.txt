The main problem of the paper is that the contributions are somewhat incremental and the details of one of the main contributions in Section 3.2 are not as clear as they should be. For example, it is unclear to me what is the operation denoted by <.,.> in Equation 2. Is it elementwise multiplication or something else? Apparently there can be several "embedding maps M" but it is not clear to me how they differ.
