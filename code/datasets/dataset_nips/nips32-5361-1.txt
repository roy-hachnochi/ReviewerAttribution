The model seems quite novel but it is potentially too large. To handle realistic data inputs consisting of varied k-way partial orders, one needs potentially as many as min(#partial orders, m choose k) mixture components which is rather unrealistic for MLE. Perhaps investigate other models that do not require such combinatorial explosion in no. of mixture components?  Theoretical results appear correct, but as mentioned above the authors should try to more fully characterize identifiability beyond the provided corner cases.  It is nice to have algorithm with consistency guarantee for 2-PL. How does one extend the algorithm beyond just the data structures stated in theorem 2?  Experiments and paper motivation can have more significance if tested on real partial orders. Such public datasets are readily available, so I was scratching my head as to why this isnâ€™t used.  The paper is well-organized and clear, although the notation regarding structure mixture can be slightly confusing. Related work coverage is good.
