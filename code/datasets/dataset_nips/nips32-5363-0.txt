1. Originality: The paper considers standard control setting in LQR and LQG with unknown dynamics, and standard algorithm---certainty equivalence. A key part of the analysis is based on perturbation bounds for discrete Riccati equations, which uses an existing results from Konstantinov et al (the authors provided a new analysis but at the cost of a stronger assumption).  Finite sample analysis of certainty equivalence method is not new in RL literature, especially for tabular MDPs. In my perspective, the survey on related works on sample complexity of certainty equivalence methods for different models other than LQR should be included in related work for discussion.    2. Quality: the submission is technically sound and the results are well supported by theoretical statements. The authors also carefully compared their results to previous results using a robust control approach to account model uncertainty. The result is that certainty equivalence method could perform better under the regime of small model estimation error, but could be more sensitive to model error. Would it be possible to conduct experiments to verify and to better illustrate the tradeoff between these two?   3. clarity: I think the paper is well written and organized.   4. Significance: The finite sample analysis of certainty equivalence in LQR and LQG was missing previously and the paper fills this gaps. While the analysis techniques used in paper existed before (e.g., Riccati Perturbation Theory), the final result is new to me.
