The result of theorems 1, 2 and 3 hold when the error in the parameter estimation is “sufficiently” small. However, the regime that these theorems allow for estimation error is almost never practical. For example, Theorem 2 holds as long as the right hand side is smaller than \sigma^2_w. Consider a system with d=l=4 and \beta = \Gamma^* = \tau=2. This requires \varepsilon=2^{-23} which is not possible for most practical purposes.  As the comparison in Section 2.1 suggests, the constants behind the main results of this paper are significantly larger than that of Theorem 4.1 of Dean et. al (2017). Despite the faster rate on , the price paid for the constants is too much to call it an improvement upon Dean et. al (2017). In the online control setting, it seems that the idea of using the offline algorithm with \epsilon-greedy exploration should work, it would be nice if the authors can provide a more rigorous statement and proof for Corollary 1. It would also have been useful to see some numerical results to get a better sense of the theoretical results.   Minor Comments: I couldn’t find the proof of Theorem 2. Also, I suggest to write the exact universal constant for Theorem 2 and 3 rather than using O(1) notation.  Page 2, line 72: \underline{\sigma} is not defined upto this point. I think the first time it is defined is line 105. In Assumption 2, it is assumed that the system is (l,\vartheta)-controllable. but what are (l,\vartheta)? Page 6, line 232: What is “dare”? I don’t think this is defined before.
