This paper proposes a new efficient accelerated decentralized stochastic algorithm (called ADFS) to tackle large-scale finite-sum optimization. The proposed algorithm uses local stochastic proximal updates and randomized pairwise communication between nodes. Some experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms. Although the paper is theoretically sound, the current version can be improved in the following aspects: 1. The probability $p_kl$ is a very important parameter, and thus the authors should elaborate on this issue. 2. Does the topology of the network have great influence on the algorithm? If possible, more experiments need to analyze this issue. 3. The two data sets used in the paper are relatively small for distributed stochastic optimization. In particular, it is interested that whether the algorithm is effective for high-dimensional data sets, e.g., RCV1 and KDD2010. 4. Point-SAGA [8] was used to compare with the proposed distributed algorithm, but it is a serial algorithm for stochastic optimization.
