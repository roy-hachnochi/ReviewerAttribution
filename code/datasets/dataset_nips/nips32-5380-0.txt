The paper is very well written and easy to follow. The question the authors are trying to solve is interesting: are there mechanisms that can achieve (eps, 0) differential privacy in general linear spaces. While the answer provided by the authors is still not conclusive they show that a very general class of mechanisms (which  achieve (eps, 0) differential privacy in finite dimensions) is in fact only (eps, delta) DP in infinite dimensions.  The ideas and proofs in the paper are very insightful. I have two comments that I believe need to be addressed before approving the paper for publication:  1. I believe Lemma 1 assumes the existence of regular conditional probability measure. Otherwise, the decomposition of P^1 as a an integral wouldn't hold. However the existence of a regular conditional measure is not guaranteed specially in such a high dimensional setting. Can the authors show that the conditional measure exists for the proposed process?  2. In the proof of Theorem 2. The authors say that because v (mu_1 - mu_2) is in the Cameron-Martin space for all v then it follows that the conditional distributions must be equivalent. I assume this is the case because v mu_1 and v_mu2 are gaussian measures and according to the authors two Gaussian measures are either equivalent or orthogonal. However, the authors fail to provide the conditions for them to be equivalent. Therefore, the proof doesn't quite follow.
