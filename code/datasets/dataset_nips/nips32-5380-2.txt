The paper studies random perturbation mechanisms for private query release in abstract topological vector spaces. The notion of elliptical perturbations, defined by the mean, a positive definite kernel and a scaling function, is studied with several results in both finite and infinite-dimensional spaces.  The basic rationale behind elliptical perturbations is that: for infinite-dimensional spaces, add isotropic noise will usually result in a point outside the space. So elliptical perturbations are introduced. This is not the first time such idea being explored: Gaussian process noises has been utilized in Hilbert spaces. However, it is still worthwhile to characterize the possibilities and impossibilities for infinite-dimensional spaces in a precise way, which is the main contribution of the paper.  On the other hand, the author did not show how the abstract results can benefit any particular examples. In differential privacy research, it is important to compare the utility of the mechanism, instead of only analyzing the privacy guarantees. The author did not show why the mechanisms constructed from the abstract conditions could lead to possibly more accurate private answers.  Minor comments: The remark following Theorem 4 at page 8 is based on incorrect understanding of differential privacy. The statement "One is achieving a random level of privacy which average out to the desired level. In fact, the actual level of DP can be determined once the output is released" makes no sense. DP is a property of a randomized algorithm which takes into account all the randomization. An algorithm either satisfies DP or not.
