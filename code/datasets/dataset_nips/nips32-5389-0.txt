Originality: the proposed method in this paper is original. It focuses on vulnerability identification in software systems.   Quality: this work is almost technological sound. Honestly, I have no research experience on vulnerability identification but the problem is well-defined and is modeled as a machine learning problem in this paper. The whole process is clear and the motivation is clearly described. I prefer to see this work in the application section of NeurIPS.   Clarity: This paper is well organized.   Significance: It is clear that other researchers can use the ideas of Devign, especially the graph embedding approach of this paper. It considers the semantics of nodes and structural features in vulnerability identification.
