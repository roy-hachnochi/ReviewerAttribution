  Pros: * Paper is well-written and easy to understand * Analysis of memory inefficiency of existing work is very thorough * Proposed solution is technically sound.  * Solid experimental setting * Very strong results on multiple tasks   Cons: * There is a lack of comparison study over state-of-the-art 3D detectors (voxel based) on KITTI test benchmark.  * Other memory efficient convolution operators for sparse data, such as sparse-conv and SBNet should also be discussed / compared against [A, B].

It would be great if the could also discuss how to extend other local operators under this two-stream setting, such as how we conduct local pooling, deconvolution, dilated convs, etc.
