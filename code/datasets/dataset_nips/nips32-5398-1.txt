This work presents and motivates the KNG mechanism, which stands somewhat as hybrid of the exponential mechanism and objective perturbation. It relies somewhat on assumptions about the task, but with much simpler assumptions than those needed by objective perturbation. This proposed method is also grounded in terms of an existing K-norm mechanism.  Originality: the proposed KNG and its theoretical properties are novel.  Quality: This work is exceptionally complete, with theory, empirical studies, case study applications, and relations to other approaches.  Clarity: the work is clear and structured  Significance: The work provides a significant algorithm, with compelling asymptotic behaviors on tasks without requiring as onerous assumptions as other methods.
