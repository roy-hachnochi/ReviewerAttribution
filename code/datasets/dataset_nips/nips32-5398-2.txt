 I thank the authors for shedding some light on the separation between exponential mechanism and the proposed K-norm mechanism based on the lower bounds from Awan et al. ICML 2019. Please include a proper discussion on this topic in the updated version. ------- The paper introduces the K-norm gradient (KNG) mechanism as a way of achieving differential privacy. It is similar in spirit to the exponential mechanism; with the key difference is that the loss function in the exponential sampling is replaced by an appropriate norm of the gradient of the loss function. The authors analyze the asymptotic error of this KNG mechanism under some assumptions on the loss function, and argue that it could be better that the asymptotic error of the exponential mechanism in some cases. The paper also discusses specific instantiation of this KNG mechanism on statistical problems such as mean estimation, linear regression, and quantile estimation/regression.  The results look correct and are well-presented. The paper however does not seem to have a standout technical idea or contribution. The results feel incremental and for a theoretical paper lacks the required technical novelty expected for NeurIPS.
