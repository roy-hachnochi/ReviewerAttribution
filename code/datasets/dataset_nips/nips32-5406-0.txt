In general, the article is very well written, although at certain places the readers will be easily lost because of some convoluted explanations of technical details, e.g.; - why edges are divided in two types: internal and external? - Are them used differently in benchmarking?  - Are those non-recurring traffic-related incidents collected used in benchmarking? - What can they be used for and how?  - etc.  On the other hand, the paper is well introduced and motivated, raising very challenging problems which may be studied using STREETS. Also, it is very well connected with the literature: section two is a fine and complete summary of existing literature on traffic and vehicle datasets.  However, experiments (benchmark evaluation) are not so convincing. The experimental section should be improved, as there is a clear lack of insight as to how “STREET” may be useful to validate and develop new ML models in the area, or how it could be used to guide future work using the dataset. Authors only show two simple baselines addressing one task, which is clearly insufficient to draw any conclusions. Much more tasks and SOTA baselines should have been included to demonstrate the potential of the dataset. Authors argue that this is due to the lack of space, however they could have reduced the description of the procedures and algorithms for data collection, or they could have used the appendix.  -------------------  I am changing from "an OK submission, but not good enough" to "marginally above acceptance threshold" after reading the response an the rest of reviews.   I appreciate the additional results provided by the authors.
