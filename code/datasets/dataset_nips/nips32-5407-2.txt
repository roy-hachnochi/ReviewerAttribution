             This is an interesting paper, combining the features of NPs with dynamic latent-variable modelling through RSSMs.              [Originality] The precise combination of NPs with RSSMs (or similar) models appears to be novel. As is the application to a dynamic 3D data domain.              [Quality] The formulation and algorithmic model appears to be sound.             I do have one particular concern to do with the characterisation of the posterior dropout elbo---while its use for TGQNs might be apposite, the idea of sampling from the prior to prevent the posterior from overfitting is not new, especially for ELBOs. It is usually referred to as defensive importance sampling [1]. Extending this temporally is relatively trivial given that the application is conditionally independent given the (presumably global) choice of which time steps to apply it to.             Also, while the model allows for change of query viewpoint, within a temporal sequence, at least going by the examples shown in the experiments, there does not appear to be change in viewpoint within a sequence. Is this by design? To what extent does the TGQN learn a general scene representation that can queried in the spirit of GQNs? At test time, for a fixed scene setting (fixed context C that is) do new query viewpoints produce consistent scenes as GQN purports to do?              [Clarity] The paper is well written and well organised. The experiments we also well structured.              [Significance] I do believe the results shown here, along with the algorithmic contributions will help in pushing the state of the art in learning dynamic scene representations forward. I hope that source code for the model and data will be made publicly available for the community to build on.              [1] Weighted Average Importance Sampling and Defensive Mixture Distributions, Hesterberg, Technometrics 1995  **Update** I have read the authors' response and am happy with the comments. Having perhaps one example of non-fixed viewpoints would definitely help showcase the features of the proposed method better. And I'm glad the authors are committed to releasing source code for this work. The additional results presented to analyse posterior collapse also helped answer some questions I subsequently had, thanks to the thorough work done by the other reviewers.
