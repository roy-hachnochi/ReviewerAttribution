Overall, the paper is clearly written. The theory and methods are well developed. And the results are discussed in details with ablation study.    However, I do have a question about the significance of the approach. If I understand correctly, the proposed method, policy-continuation + hindsight inverse dynamics (PCHID) is a continuous version of dynamic programming. The difference is that the table is replaced with a function approximator so PCHID can handle continuous state-action space. Have the authors tried to solve the GridWorld task using simple dynamic programming as a comparison?   I also have a concern regarding the algorithm part. The proposed algorithm validates whether a state is k-step reachable using a TEST algorithm. Because a function approximator has been used, we cannot guarantee that the given state is not k-step reachable even if the function approximator yields no solution. I think additional theoretical analysis is needed to address this issue.    Update:  The authors have replied and addressed my main comments: the DP perspective of the PCHID, and the false negatives in the TEST routine.
