My main comment is on the applicability of such robust algorithms in real world scenarios. Can or should the adversarial cases listed in the paper, e.g., power outages and communication failures be modeled as *worst* case attacks? In the seminal work by Lamport the motivation for such worst case attacks are clear. Can the authors show simulations practical cases failures in distributed nodes can be modeled as Byzantine attacks or elaborate more to this point in the paper?
