Originality/significance: The idea of hierarchy in workers (majority vote, then aggregation, then robust aggregation) as detailed in figure 1 is attractive as it only adds a linera (in the number of base nodes) overhead. However, the use of a majority vote in the base layer might lead to a big loss in terms of variance reduction, compared to performing robust aggregation straight from the base layer.   Quality/clarity: the paper is fairly well-written and is well suited for the larger audience of NeurIPS
