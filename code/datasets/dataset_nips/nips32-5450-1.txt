Originality: The methods used in this work are simple and for the most part standard in the literature of learning theory. The idea of learning \alpha-coverings is nice, and to the best of my knowledge, new.  Quality: The statements of the Theorems and Lemma are careful and make sense. Every proof I checked seems correct. I would prefer though if the authors mention more clearly that their results are significant only in the agnostic setting; in the realizable setting I think VC(H)/\alpha sample size is sufficient and the private sample size can be ignored.   Clarity:  I consider the paper very well written and the exposure sufficiently clear.  Significance: The paper seems significant and I can see future research to cite this work and be using their techniques.
