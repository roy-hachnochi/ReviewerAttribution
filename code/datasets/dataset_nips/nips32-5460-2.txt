The question addressed in this paper is interesting and the results non trivial in my opinion. The mathematical methods seem quite standard - Bernstein inequalities and Le Cam's method.  Experiments are also provided to validate the results on real data sets. But I did not look at this part. I have not looked at this part and my feeling is that much more investigation would be needed to really validate the modeling on real datta sets.  The paper is clearly written. The introduction gives a detailed review of the  literature.   Review update: in their answers to the reviewers the authors have essentially clarified technical concerns. The question of the relevance of the theory to experimental situations has come up. I am happy to support the paper even if the applicability of the theory is questionable since there seem to be new serious theoretical results w.r.t the literature. However if the experiments show that the theory has unclear applicability the authors should honestly state it, and underline that the main value of the paper is its theoretical contribution.
