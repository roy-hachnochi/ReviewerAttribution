This work considers nonstochastic bandits with feedback graphs and switching cost. This is the combination of two settings that were previously studied. The regret of bandit learning with a known static feedback graph over K actions scales with sqrt{alpha*T} (ignoring log(K) factors), where alpha is the independent set of the graph, and this is provably tight. In the case of bandits with switching costs, the regret is K^{1/3}*T^{2/3}, which is also provably tight.   In earlier work [RF2019], an upper bound of alpha^{1/3}*T^{2/3} was proven for the setting studied in this work. This bound holds even when the graph changes with time and is only revealed to the algorithm after each play (the so-called "uninformed" setting). This work fixes a mistake in the lower bound proven in [RF2019] and shows that alpha^{1/3}*T^{2/3} cannot be improved in the uninformed setting when the adversary controls both the loss sequence and the graph sequence.  In the informed setting this works shows that the regret can be improved to \sqrt{beta}*T^{2/3}, where beta is the dominating set of the feedback graph. This is obtained by performing a star decomposition of the graph, running a bandit instance on each star, and combining these instances via a mini-batched version of the corraling algorithm of Agarwal et. al. A lower bound of beta^{1/3} T^{2/3} (as usual ignoring log factors) is proven for the class of disjoint union of stars in the informed setting.  A further scenario considers policy regret with losses that depend of the past m actions, where m is fixed, and feedback graphs. The feedback model is peculiar: the loss of adjacent actions is only available when the same action was played in the last m steps. In this setting an upper bound of m^{1/3}*sqrt{b}*T^{2/3} is proven again using the minibatched version of the corraling algorithm.  The motivation for combining switched regret with feedback graphs is a bit weak. The paper contains some interesting and clever ideas, especially in the design of the lower bounds. The use of the corraling technique feels suboptimal, and leaves indeed a gap between upper and lower bound. The feedback assumption for the policy regret feels quite arbitrary. Why restricting the feedback graph is needed to prove an upper bound on the regret?  In summary, this submission provides suboptimal bounds in a weakly motivated setting. On the other hand, the techniques are nontrivial and there are some clever ideas in the proofs.  AFTER AUTHOR FEEDBACK: After reading the author feedback, and after going through the other reviewers' comments, I decided to increase my score by 1 in recognition of the technical contributions.
