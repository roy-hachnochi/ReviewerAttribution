This reads a long paper that is shortened to fit the 8-page limit of NeuIPS. Such manipulation hurts the reading pace a lot since many materials are moved to supplement, and discussions are not thorough.   However, I overall still find it an interesting read. My comments are minor in this regard: (1) It should be highlighted throughout that you are studying a simple single index model with a design known to the practitioner (BTW, is "design known" equivalent to saying "design known to be standard multivariate normal"?).  (2) For the main results, I noticed that only lower bounds are discussed, and the matching upper bounds are moved to the supplement? I recommend the authors to at least comment in Section 3 that these lower bounds can be matched by the corresponding upper bounds, and point the readers to the exact locations where these results are put.
