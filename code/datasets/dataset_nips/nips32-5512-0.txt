1) What is the relationship of pseudo-ensemble to some classical ensemble methods, e.g., bagging or boosting? 2) For the semi-supervised experiment, the proposal needed to be compared with state-of-the-art methods. 3) It would be better to do experiments on more datasets because MNIST is a very simple dataset.
