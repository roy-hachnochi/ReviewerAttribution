I do believe the paper makes a strong contribution to the understanding of gradient dynamics in games. The proof technique looks original to me and the work is of good quality.  I have checked in detail the proof of the two action case and went through the N-action case.  The renaming of the theorems in appendix is very confusing but could be fixed if the author would consider that part as an appendix and not as an extended version of the full paper.
