The paper is of great quality, both in terms of the writing style and the technical content. One question I have, which is not very well address in the paper, is if the sample complexity upper bound of 1/\gamma^2 \epsilon^2 is optimal especially under the restricted approximation factor considered in Theorem 3.2 and Theorem 3.3, and would appreciate if the authors can shed some light on the same.   There are some technical typos in the paper, which I am sure the authors will fix in the final version. Some of them are listed below: 1. Line 110, should be w^{i} in the RHS instead of w^{i+1}. 2. Like 256, incomplete parenthesis. 3. Like 268, should be 1/gamma^2 instead of 1/\gamma.  4. Line 254, by the standard arguments, it seems that the \epsilon term should contain a multiplicative factor of 1/\gamma.   __________________  Post Author Feedback: Thanks for the feedback.
