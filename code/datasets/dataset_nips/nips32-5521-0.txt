This is a well-written theory paper about a novel problem that has not been addressed in this form in earlier literature. The main novelty is the combination of pairwise queries and overlapping clusters. The results are solid.  A summary (table, etc) of the main complexity results for different oracle types would make a nice addition.  About related work: The authors might also be interested in an earlier HCOMP 2015 paper by Zou et al where a very similar problem using relative comparison queries is considered. Also, Bonchi et al (2013) discuss ideas to combine correlation clustering with overlapping clusters that may also be of interest to the authors.  (Note that I am *not* asking to cite these papers, but merely pointing them out as potentially interesting related work.)

I have nothing to add at this point.
