The main argument, that predictions should not be too focused on local patches was a little counter-intuitive.  There are many counter examples for the points they made, e.g. a local patch around a person's face may be enough to classify the image as a person.  This was a little distracting while reading their paper, but the examples presented were satisfactory to make their points, and the extensive results help alleviate most of my concerns about this.  Otherwise, I was happy with the paper, felt it provided an interesting approach for domain adaptation.
