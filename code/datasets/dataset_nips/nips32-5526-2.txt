we posit that classifiers that are required to (in some sense) discard this local signal (i.e., patches of an images correlated to the label within a data collection), basing predictions instead on global concepts (i.e., concepts that can only be derived by combining information intelligently across regions), may better mimic the robustness that humans demonstrate in visual recognition. I believe the work, together with the work in Wang et al. (2019) in reference, provide a very insight in domain adaptation. The writing is clear, the extensive experimental results make it a solid work.  The new dataset provided in the manuscript further benefit the cross-dataset recognition via UDA in computer vision area.
