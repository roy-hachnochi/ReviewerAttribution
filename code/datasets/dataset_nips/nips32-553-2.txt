Getting rid of weight transport is an important step towards biologically plausible deep learning algorithms and both proposed mechanisms seem to be valid contributions towards this goal. While not entirely surprising, the empirical results show the effectiveness of the proposed methods. The biggest criticism to be brought forward is perhaps the fact that both methods rely on one-to-one mappings between y and delta nodes. This assumption can probably hardly be met in biological systems, and it is not obvious how this can be circumvented. It would be good if the authors could comment on the plausibility of this assumption and possibly discuss alternative scenarios (e.g. is there a way to have a linear mapping between delta and y, rather than the identity? Are there known circuits which somewhat resemble this direct correspondence?)  -- The authors have addressed my concerns in the rebuttal. I'm updating my score.
