This work clearly describes their method, as well as contrasts it against a similar approach (DIAYN). In short, they use a data driven method to learn and approximate salient visual features along trajectories as tasks using the DeepCluster method to aggregate new tasks level information. This is additionally important as it avoids GAN style problems that other methods employ, which should, in theory, result in more stable and potentially interpretable results.  This work is significant in its simultaneous contributions along unsupervised meta learning as well as vision based clustering in an RL setting, as the authors discuss in section 3.4.
