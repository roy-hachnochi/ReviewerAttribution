The authors study the problem of online learning with subset-wise preferences with relative feedback information under the Multinomial logit choice model. More speci_x000C_cally, they study two regret minimisation problems over subsets of a fi_x000C_nite ground set [n]. In the fi_x000C_rst setting, the learner can play subsets of size bounded by a maximum size and receives top-m rank-ordered feedback. For this setting, they give a lower bound and an instance-dependent and order-optimal winner-regret algorithm with regret O( n/m \ln T) based on the well-known upper-con_x000C_dence bound (UCB) strategy. In the second setting the learner can play subsets of a _x000C_xed size k with a full subset ranking observed as feedback, they also derive a regret lower bound, and then give a UCB-based algorithm, along with a matching upper bound regret of O(n/k \ln T). The authors also provide an experimental study with synthetically generated data to validate their _x000C_findings. The authors give a thorough study of interesting extensions of the dueling bandit problem, including deriving lower bounds, and giving algorithms with theoretical guarantees. The paper has a good quality and is written in a good way, and should be signifi_x000C_cant for the preference- based learning community.
