Originality: The paper relies on techniques similar to "Sampling Signals With Finite Rate of Innovation" by Martin Vetterli, Pina Marziliano and Thierry Blu as well as "Sketching for Large-Scale Learning of Mixture Models" by Nicolas Keriven, Anthony Bourrier, Rémi Gribonval, Patrick Pérez. This type of algorithms should be mentioned in the state of the art part. The Finite Rate of Innovation theory highly relies on the so called "annihilating filters" form error correction coding, which is highly relevant for the submitted publication. The submitted paper tries to remove the assumption on common support of sparse vectors. Quality: The paper is well written. Clarity: Structure of the paper is clear. Due to lack of experiments and conclusion, the reader might have a feeling as if a paragraph or a page is missing. Significance: The problem at hand is of great interest for the scientific community and has a broad range of applications.
