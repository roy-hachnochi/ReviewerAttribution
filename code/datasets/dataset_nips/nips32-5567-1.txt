Originality: This work is a novel combination of two well-known models, namely BiGAN and BigGAN. The main novelty lies in demonstrating the effectiveness of additional unary terms for x and z that were not studied in BiGAN. The related work is well-cited.   Quality: The submission is technically sound. The claims are well-supported by extensive and well-considered empirical analysis. There are no theoretical contributions. The authors are careful and honest in their evaluation.  Clarity: The writing is very clear. Pedagogically, it would be helpful to readers who are not already familiar with BiGAN to read an intuitive explanation of how the forms of L_EG and L_D implement their cross-purposes.  Significance: BigBiGAN the natural pushout of the BiGAN <- GAN -> BigGAN triad, so this work is more inevitable than it is surprising. However, the work remains a significant contribution as the investigation is exemplary in its clarity and thoroughness, the methodology is advanced by unary terms, and the performance is SOTA with respect to standard benchmarks in the community. The semantic learning apparent in the images, hypothesized to result from an implicit form of reconstruction error,  is especially exciting as an area of future research.
