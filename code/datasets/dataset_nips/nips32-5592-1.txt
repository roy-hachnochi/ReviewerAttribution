This paper reads well with clear math notations and has sufficient originality. The paper provides the first comprehensive analysis of metric dimensionality reduction under various distortion measurement criteria and fills the gap between the theoretical perspective and practical viewpoint on metric dimensionality reduction. The paper provides a clean line of related works and highlights the contributions of the paper in a reasonable and fair way. This paper as it states might provide useful practical guidance on metric dimensionality reduction.
