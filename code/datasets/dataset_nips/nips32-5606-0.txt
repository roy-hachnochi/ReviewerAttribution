The paper considers the online linear optimization problem with bandit feedback in both adversarial and stochastic settings. The paper aims at constructing algorithms with $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret guarantee and low oracle-complexity, where the considered oracle solves linear optimization problems on the set of actions. The proposed algorithms achieve $\tilde{O}(T)$ oracle-complexity in the non-stochastic case and $\tilde{O}(\operatorname{poly}(d,\log T))$ in the stochastic case.  These results are a significant progress with respect to existing work. Besides, the construction and analysis of the algorithms are highly non-trivial.  I was not able to check all the details of the proofs, but I have no reason to doubt their correctness.  Such a strong focus on the complexity of the algorithms in this problem is novel (as far as I know) and very interesting.  Overall, I feel that this paper is high quality work.
