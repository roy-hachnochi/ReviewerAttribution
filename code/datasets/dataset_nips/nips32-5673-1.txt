1. Originality. The authors propose a novel measure to evaluate domain discrepancy; the idea is interesting and novel.  2. Quality. The manuscript is well-written. 3. Clarity. The manuscript provides methods and detail analysis. However, as the experimental settings are semi-supervised based, and the baseline methods are a little out-of-date.  I suggest the authors add more baselines to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. An example is listed as follows. Zhang L, Zuo W, Zhang D. LSDT: Latent sparse domain transfer learning for visual adaptation[J]. IEEE Transactions on Image Processing, 2016, 25(3): 1177-1191.  ================ After rebuttal  Although the baseline methods are all boosting-based, I think the performance is an important factor for a good manuscript. ================  4. Significance. The quality is good, and the technical significance is high.
