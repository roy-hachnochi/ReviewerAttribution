As far as I know, this is the first paper I have met on progressive training of NN with both nice theoretical backup and empirical performance. I did not check all the proofs in the appendix, but they appear reasonable to me.   For the experimental part, I think it lacks the training efficiency comparison between splitting GD and existing pruning methods, where in the paper only the accuracy comparison is given.
