Before beginning, I need to underline that I am not very much familiar with the related work, so my assessment about the novelty of this work is primarily based on the author's own claims in the paper, although I have made some additional reading on the related literature for evaluating this submission.  I enjoyed reading the paper. It is technically sound, all claims are supported by both theoretical analysis and empirical experiments. It is clearly written and well organized.  Easy to read and understand, even for someone outside of the field. Results of the numerical experiments are very well illustrated. The new approach is expected to have a practical impact, especially for learning lightweight neural architectures.  Some minor comments / typos: Figure 1 (a): f(x) is difficult to see even from a colored print-out Line 102: can be derive - can be derived Line 447: Nesterove - Nesterov  ========== After author feedback ========== I read the author feedback carefully. During the discussions, I realized that I have misinterpreted some of the reported results as if the proposed approach outperforms the retraining of the final architecture from scratch. As a result, I overrated the practical significance of the proposed approach in my initial comments. To reflect this, I slightly decrease my score. Nevertheless, the proposed approach still has an adequate level of practical interest, and I vote and argue for the acceptance of the manuscript.
