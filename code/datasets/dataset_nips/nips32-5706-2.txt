This paper is applying the existing filtering idea to a new problem, so the bar should be raised higher. I think it has good ideas, but there are a few issues the authors should address in order to increase the competitiveness of this work.   1. Theorem 1.2 talks about sparse mean estimation for Gaussian with identity cov. However, if k = d, which means that we have no sparsity assumption, the sample complexity the authors get is d^2 log d, which is way worse than the optimal d. Why do the authors claim it is optimal?  2. In general, the filtering idea and the ellipsoid idea are very similar: the ellipsoid idea relies on an unknown parameter, and the filtering idea is trying new parameters again and again. Hence, it would be very important to explain how the authors' test statistic compare with the ellipsoid algorithm approach. Are they the same or similar? If so, the value of this paper is watered down significantly.   I read the rebuttal, and decided to increase my score since the authors have clearly demonstrated what their concrete contributions are.
