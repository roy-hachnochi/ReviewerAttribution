Clarity: There exists some typos, e.g.,  ''graph convolutional neural network (GCRN)'' in line 34. Please proofread the paper.  Originality: Though RNN with stochastic latent variables and GRNN has been studied extensively, there is little work combing these two ideas to the best of my knowledge.    Quality: This paper claims that high level latent random variables of VGRNN are vital (i.e., interpretability and uncertainty) for modeling complex dynamic graph. Experiment results of AUC and AP support the claim partially. However, there are no experiments discussing the interpretability of latent variables.   Significance: VGRNN does contribute to understanding and solving dynamic graph modeling compared to previous methods.  ---------------------------------- After Rebuttal: Thanks for your response. The visualization of latent space addresses my question partially.
