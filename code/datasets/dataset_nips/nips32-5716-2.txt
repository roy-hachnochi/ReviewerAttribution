The paper is incremental work compared to the Semi-Implicit VAE [38]. The general idea of the SIVAE is to model the parameters of the VAE model ($\psi$) as a random variable that one can sample from but does not necessarily have an explicit form which results into a mixture like behavior for the VAE. In this work, the authors propose to use that framework for Graph data. The idea is to sample from $\psi$ and concatenate with each layer of graph VAE. The rest follows [38]. They also propose another variant based on the normalized flow which read a bit out of sync (afterthought/add-on) with the rest of the paper.
