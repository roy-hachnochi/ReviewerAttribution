The paper is very well written, making the sometimes dry topic of losses easy to follow and engaging. I want to specially mention that the authors did a great job of providing intuitive interpretations of most definitions, which will surely be appreciated by many readers. However I think that there's room for improvement in further clarifying terms like "reports" and "properties" which will most likely be new for a significant part of the audience.  In terms of the technical contribution, it provides a fresh look at the construction of surrogate losses from the point of view of embeddings, proving the interesting result that every discrete loss can be embedded into a polyhedral loss as well as the converse. On top of the conceptual appeal, the power of this idea is exemplified by reworking or deriving new results on consistency and calibration of surrogate losses. Proofs are solid and generally the paper is a valuable addition to the literature on losses and surrogates.
