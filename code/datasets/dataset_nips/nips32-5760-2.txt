********After author response*********************** I thank the authors for answering my questions. I keep my evaluation and vote for accepting the paper. **********************************************************  Originality: This work provided a novel approach for designing convex loss surrogates for general discrete losses and analyzing their consistency. Using the new analysis framework, the authors gave a negative answer to the open question of the consistency of the Lovasz hinge. The authors also gave original understandings of the top-k loss, showing that the convex loss by [LHS15] is consistent with a discrete loss that is slightly different from the discrete top-k loss.  Quality: I haven't gone through the appendix, but the proofs and arguments in the main paper are sound and clear.  Clarity: The paper is very clearly written and easy to understand.  Significance: Convex loss surrogates are broadly used in machine learning, so understanding how to design such surrogates systematically is meaningful. The analysis of top-k losses and Lovasz hinge helps practitioners understand these losses better and gives them insights for choosing the right loss.
