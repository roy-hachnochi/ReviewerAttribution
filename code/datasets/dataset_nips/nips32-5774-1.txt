The paper is written well and easy to follow. Interesting iand novel idea to use code-idioms for program synthesis tasks. Mining the idioms use existing bayesian non-paaraa The paper highlights its advantage over other sketch generation works, due to its capability to generalize with few code fragments instead of grammatically correct complete intermediate template. Experimental analysis comparing the two would have provided more insights. The time complexity especially of idiom miner step should be added.
