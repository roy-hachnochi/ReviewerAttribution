This paper proposes a new framework which utilizes idiom mining to improve existing models for semantic parsing. The authors argument that one of the main challenges of synthesizing a program is the insufficient separation between the high-level and low-level reasoning, which forces the model having to learn both the common high-level abstractions and the low-level details that specify the semantic meaning of the generated program. They propose to frame idiom mining as a nonparametric Baysian problem and first learn a set of code idioms, which are AST fragments of the programs, from the training set. The mined idioms are then used to train the generation model which teaches the model to make use of common code snippets and not just generating the program by predicting the AST node by node. The main idea presented in the paper appears to be interesting and insightful, particularly for semantic parsing where access to parallel corpus is often limited. The paper is clearly presented and relatively easy to follow. Experiment results on two benchmark datasets Hearthstone and Spider show noticeable improvements over the selected baselines when the proposed method is used. Although no results on the current state-of-the-art were mentioned in the paper.
