This is a tricky article to review. It clearly makes some significant contributions, especially when it comes with a methodology for obtaining a quantization scheme that minimizes debiased variance. On the other hand it is very hard to read with multiple grammatical and syntactic mistakes. The main topic of the paper, asymmetric quantization, is not formally defined until page 6 and then is discussed for less than half a page. Meanwhile other results, mostly having to do with debiased estimator variance for the symmetric case, cover the lion's share of the paper. As far as I can tell these results end up having no connection with the asymmetric case.  In the end this paper feels like a collection of cool results that were rushed into a paper with no common thread. In the end it doesn’t form a cohesive unit. I don’t like the idea of turning down a valuable paper for structure alone but in the end this paper just lacks the necessary polish to be published (which it ultimatly should be).
