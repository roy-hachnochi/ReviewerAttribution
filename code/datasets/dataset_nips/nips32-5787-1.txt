Overall an interesting paper, with useful results. I would consider the ordering question to be the most interesting contribution. However, the ordering matters when the nearest neighbors are of different classes (i.e., if the ordering of distances changes after quantization, it doesn't matter if both neighbors are in the same class). It is not clear how to properly model and analyze that, but it is worth some discussion in the paper. ==== I've seen and taken into account the author's response, and it does not change my score.
