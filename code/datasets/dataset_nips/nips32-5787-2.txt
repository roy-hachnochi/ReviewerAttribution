I think this paper is in good quality. The problem is not very complicated, but the authors studied the problem thoroughly, from theoretic analysis of mean and variance in different scenarios, to proposed refined method and experimental studies. I think this paper meets the standard of NeurIPS. Here are some minor suggestions.  1. I wish to see more discussions about previous work on quantized random projections, especially for cosine-similarity or inner-product estimation. The authors provide some references in the introduction, but I wish to see more detailed comparisons of results of the previous work and the current work. This will make the main contribution of this work more clear.  2. In Figure 1, please make the y-axis of the first two figures aligned. Also for Figure 2.  3. In the supplemental materials, the section numbers are wrong. (should be Section 3 in the title of Section A, etc.)   ============================================================== I'm satisfied with the authors' feedback and I would like to increase my score from 6 to 7. I vote to accept this paper because of its high technical quality. I wish the authors could improve the paper's organization and presentation to match the technical quality of this paper.
