Written clearly. Perhaps would benefit from some empirical examples demonstrating the difference in error rate for a two-sample test, as a result of privatizing the test statistic.  Comments on notation:  Line 120: Laplace distribution has an extra e? Line 157: The reference in [25] indicates that "To begin with, we note that it suffices that only one of ||p||2 and ||q||2 is small. This is essentially because if there is a large difference between the two, this is easy to detect." ... If both are small, might that still make it hard to detect?
