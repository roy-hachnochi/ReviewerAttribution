The submission provides an interesting framework coupled with Lyapunov-based methods to build a unified framework for IAG methods. The idea is interesting and appealing. However, the submission suffers from a lack of clarity that is damaging these ideas:    - many definitions are lacking (e.g., the semi-algebraic property and the distance used at l. 154 should be at least commented);   - results are commented but I feel some assumptions should be discussed (e.g., l. 192, is this assumption realistic when \sigma_k = k^{-\eta}?);   - plots are hard to read and would benefit from additional comments.  Overall, the submission seems like it brings valuable ideas but needs additional work around the results and assumptions discussions (the related work sections are nicely written to that regard).  Updated review: It appears that I did not understand well the novelty of some points of the paper. I intend to increase my score, but I still think the paper severely lacks clean statement and discussions about the results and their comparison to existing work.
