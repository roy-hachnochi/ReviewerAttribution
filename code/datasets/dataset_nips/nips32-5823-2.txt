This is a solid paper which addresses an important problem in a novel way. It is very well written, as the Authors guide the reader through the presentation of novel concepts, and they do a good job at easing the reader into the subject with a good review of existing works. The results are very interesting and they should have significant impact. While I haven't checked all the proofs, the reasoning seems correct, and the results are in line with the intuition.
