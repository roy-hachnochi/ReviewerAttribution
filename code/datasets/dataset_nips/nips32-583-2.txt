The paper first introduces the concept of cycle-consistency basis, and then presents a three-step algorithm that effectively samples a subset of weighted cycles to enforce the cycle-consistency constraint for optimizing maps among a collection of related objects/domains. Some novel techniques such as condition number are applied to compute the cycle-consistency basis. It is hypothesized that the proposed approach for cycle selection is superior to others in that it takes the convergence behavior of the induced joint optimization problem into account. The experiments on two settings, including consistent shape correspondences and consistent neural networks among multiple domains, demonstrate the strength of the algorithm in map quality.  Pros: - The applied methods are straightforward and appropriate.  - The proposed condition-number-based technique for stability scoring is well motivated.  - On a variety of settings, the approach outperforms state-of-the-art techniques. And it is suitable for diverse map representations. Hence, the present work may exhibit broad impact. - Detailed mathematical proofs are provided for every proposition and theorem, which makes it theoretically sound. - The paper is overall well written (with a few caveats detailed below).  Cons/comments: - The algorithm needs to be summarized more explicitly. I would prefer adding some pseudocode for better explanation. - More details should be included in experiments. For example, the hyperparameters in line 217 are unexplained, and necessary comparison in terms of running time is missing. - There are some ambiguous expressions, such as “s” in Theorem 4.1. - It is recommended to change the title so that highlights of the work could be well reflected. - It would be better to give a brief introduction to path-invariance bases before Remark 3. - Some grammatical mistakes (line 8, line 219).
