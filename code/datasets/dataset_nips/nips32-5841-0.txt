Originality Although other papers might have noted undesirability of randomness, it seems to be the first paper to formulate the question by providing a metric as to how close a deterministic classifier is to a stochastic classifier.   Quality The proofs are generally written very clearly, and even when they are not in the main body, enough explanations are given to make the results pretty intuitive.  Overall, approaches themselves and the presentation of the results seem very clean.   Clarity The general flow of the paper was smooth: starting with motivating reasons, sketching the extent as to how the problem can be solved, and providing different methods that complement each other, going through the underlying tension in the problem, ... . Also, the presentation of the experiments (e.g. the figures) were very easy to read.  Significance: As described above, the paper has studied an interesting problem that is well motivated and provided clean approaches for the problem. Along with theoretical guarantees, the experimental results validate the usefulness of the methods.  Typos: -137: there seems to be an extra parenthesis in the equation -490 (Theorem 4 statement): instead of Pr( ...], it should be Pr( ....) or Pr[ ...], right?   **** POST REBUTTAL **** The authors have clarified the issues, and I think the paper is still interesting so I will still keep my evaluation the same.
