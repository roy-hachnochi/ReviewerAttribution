This is a well-written and thoughtful paper that introduces the formal study of how best to turn stochastic classifiers into deterministic classifiers.  In addition to providing and justifying relevant definitions, it establishes important initial theoretical results and presents new algorithms.  This is an excellent paper on an important topic.
