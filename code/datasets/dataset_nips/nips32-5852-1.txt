The main contributions of this paper are described in the previous section. The presented empirical study follows the steps of others (as cited by the authors), but studying the DTM-based models is original. The paper is generally well-written, presenting the results clearly. It is somewhat confusing that Table1 shows failure rates (lower is better), while Table2 shows performance (higher is better). The empirical study is comprehensive, and the theoretical analysis is definitely non-trivial.   The significance of the paper is mainly in suggesting the use of DTM2 for anomaly detection and pointing out the possible advantage of nearest neighbor based methods for anomaly detection in high dimensional data. While this is probably not a breakthrough in the field, it is of significant interest to data science practitioners. I would grade this paper as a "good submission".
