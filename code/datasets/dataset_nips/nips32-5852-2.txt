This paper proposes a new outlierness measure, called DTM, for outlier detection, and theoretically analyze its performance. In addition, the paper performs experiments on various real-world datasets to examine the effectiveness of outlier detection methods. Although the theoretical analysis of the paper is interesting, I have the following concerns.  - This paper provides several theoretical results for NN-based outlier detection, which is an interesting contribution.   However, empirical evaluation does not directly support the obtained theoretical results.   For example, how are the assumptions (A0-A2) natural in real-world datasets? How is the result in Proposition 3.6 realistic? - An important empirical result is that an ensemble method is the most effective. However, theoretical comparison between an ensemble method and the proposed method is not performed. - The proposed method includes several parameters. However, the sensitivity is not examined, which is crucial to show the usefulness of the proposed method. - Important references about NN-based outlier detection are missing. In particular, [1] and [2] are known to be the state-of-the-art NN-based methods using sampling with rigorous theoretical analyses. Moreover, [3] also performs more detailed theoretical analysis of [1]. Please refer and discuss the relationship between the proposed method and such methods.   [1] Sugiyama, M. Borgwardt, K.
