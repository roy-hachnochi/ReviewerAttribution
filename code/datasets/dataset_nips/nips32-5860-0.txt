 Originality: Although there is a previous work [17] talking about the same setting, the paper have a more theoretical and general analysis, which is very good in the originality.  Quality: The overall paper quality is good. However, I have a comment on the experiments on performance of gradient estimation.  The average cosine similarity is so low and it seems not very useful. I would suggest to make another experiments to show the effectiveness. See the improvements. Clarity: The paper is well-written and easy to follow.   Significance: It could be very useful combine the transfer-based attack with blackbox attack in the practice. Although the performance is not significantly better than the previous STOA bandit attack, it would be a good supplement. However, I have some concerns regarding the experiment results. The RGF method should be very similar or exactly same with NES. However, the results show the RGF methods always outperforms NES, which doesnâ€™t make sense.
