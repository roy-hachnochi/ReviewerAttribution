### Post response comments  I would like to thank the authors for addressing my concerns carefully, especially on validating advantages of setting lambda adaptively over a fixed value.   A regret is about estimation for cosine similarity (my concern 2). Although the response adds the specific value of S, it is still not explained **when** and **how often** to estimate cosine similarity (see line 197–198). It should have an important impact on query complexity but ignored in experiments. It is suggested to make similarity estimation clear in a final version.  ***  Transfer-based attack and query-based attack are two common types of black-box adversarial attack. The idea is OK to combine transfer-based attack and query-based attack. The paper proposes a simple method where the gradient of the surrogate model is used as a prior of the true gradient.  My concerns are as follows.  **Concern 1** My main concern lies on the novelty of the idea. It is clearly discussed in the previous paper *Guessing smart: Biased sampling for efﬁcient black-box adversarial attacks* that the gradient of the surrogate model. The formats are almost the same except the paper proposes an "adaptive" way to set the weight $\lambda^*$.   **Concern 2** To set the weight $\lambda^*$, the proposed method has to solve another esitmation problem for cosine similarity between the surrogate gradient and the true gradient (or gradient norm). The esitmiation is quite hearistic and lacks necessary analysis. It is nececessary to analyze how the estimation influences the resulted true gradient estimate. More importantly, the estimation between the surrogate gradient and the true gradient is completely neglected in the experiement section. It is necessary to empirically investigate how to estimate the gradient norm, e.g., how to set $S$.  **Concern 3** When investigating whether setting $\lambda^*$ adaptively is necessary, $\lambda=0.5$ is not a good choice. As Figure 2(b) shows (it would be better to plot the distribution of $\lambda^*$.), to get a higher cosine similarity, $\lambda$ should be much smaller than $0.5$. It would be better to compare P-RGF ($\lambda=0.05 (?)$) rather than P-RGF ($\lambda=0.5 (?)$).
