Update:  I thank the authors for their responses and think they did a good job to address the concerns raised by the reviewers. Therefore, I'll hold my original score and believe the paper makes a strong contribution for estimating exponential family models and should be accepted by NeurIPS.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Overall: This paper proposes a novel Adversarial Dynamics Embedding (ADE) that directly  approximates the MLE of general exponential family distributions while achieving computational and statistical efficiency. It not only provides theoretical justification for the proposed dynamics embeddings, but also show how other estimators can be framed as special case in the proposed framework.   Quality: The overall approach proposed by the paper seems to be technically sound. The paper did a good job in comparing the proposed method to other estimators and show how the proposed method overcome the limitations of other estimators. The results on both synthetic and real-data (MNIST and CIFAR-10) show the flexibility of the proposed dynamics embeddings without introducing extra parameters.   Clarity: The paper is well-written.   Originality: The proposed Adversarial Dynamics Embedding is entirely novel to my knowledge.   Significance: This paper makes a good contribution to algorithms/methods for estimating general exponential family distributions. It overcomes the shortcomings of existing estimators, and can directly approximate the MLE while improving computational and statistical efficiency.
