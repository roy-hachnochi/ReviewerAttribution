The article is well-written and easy to read.  The article addresses an important challenge: achieving model parallelism without being architecture and task specific. The solution is simple and straightforward. The key contribution pertains to the implementation and empirical evaluation of the system.     The scheduling algorithm should be elaborated. It is not clear how the load imbalance is addressed and how possible node failures are taken into account.   The minibatching algorithm details are not presented in the paper. The evaluation does not include a benchmark system.  The major limitations of the article pertain to the missing algorithm detail pertaining to the scheduling/microbatching and the lack of empirical benchmark system. The system configuration parameters are explored with the empirical setup.  The system has been contributed to Open Source.   Author response: the authors have addressed the above points by providing more explanation of the scheduler that is also open sourced and more details on the micro batching algorithm.
