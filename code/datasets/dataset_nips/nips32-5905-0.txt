========================================================= After response, I maintain my evaluation. I agree the technical contribution might be a bit incremental comparing with previous works, but I do see the value of this paper. I think it would also be good if this paper is getting accepted. =========================================================  Although results look solid and quite interesting compared to previous work, I'm a bit concerned with the writing qualities of this paper.  Main theorem (Theorem 1) and Corollary 2 and Corollary 3 are stated without settings/assumptions/preconditions. The statement of Theorem 1 has a notion of subGaussian norm, which is claimed to be described in the preliminaries while this paper does not has a preliminary.  (I eventually realize this notion is defined in footnote 1 without mentioning its name...) Section 2.1 is almost just filled with theorems and corollaries without too much explanations. Even though section 1.2 informally stated the results and their implications, there is still a big gap when stating the formal theorems without much explanations.  In sum, I think the results are interesting, and have reasonable significance especially when compared to [6]. However, I feel authors could possibly polish the paper a bit more. The current version looks a bit rough.
