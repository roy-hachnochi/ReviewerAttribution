This paper considers property estimation for discrete distributions: given a "smooth enough" functional f of distributions, assumed further to be "additive" (i.e., f(p) = sum_i f_i(p_i), where p=(p_i)_i is the distribution identified to its pmf), the authors derive a general approach, based on polynomial approximation, to obtain optimal or near-optimal rates, with estimators that are easy to construct and can be computed in time nearly linear in the sample size.  The main result is Theorem 1, which provides the general upper bound statement. Overall, I find the results and approach of this paper nice, but somewhat incremental; and far from the "novelty" and "strong implications" claimed.  (Also, the privacy part doesn't really seem to fit with the rest... basically, you get Lipscitz estimators, so can get privacy almost for free; maybe make that a distinct section, instead of putting it in the middle, as I'd argue it's not really the meat of your work?)  Comments: - line 73: distance estimation to a fixed distribution or between two unknown distributions is known as well by the techniques of Valiant-Valiant; see https://theory.stanford.edu/~valiant/papers/VV_LinEst.pdf ***- ll.93-96: This is one of my main criticisms. You claim a novel approach, departing conceptually from the two extisting methods you described before. However, what you described here does not seem really novel: it is, unless I misunderstood what you describe, a refinement of the "approximation" technique, so sounds a lot more incremental than what you suggest. - ll 127-133 on high probability: this is really misleading. As far as I can tell, the lack of high-probability statements from previous work is not that the approaches do not yield the "good" (additive) dependence on log(1/\delta): for all we know, they might (using McDiarmid, or even direct arguments?), or might not -- it's just that it wasn't *considered* in those works. Thus, claiming that your work significantly improves on those wrt delta by comparing your results with the previous one *using the median trick* is not something of a misrepresentation. - ll. 140-141: so you need subconstant approximation parameter eps for support size? That's a *big* restriction. - l.150: how "conventional" is that? Is it actually common (I don't recall seeing this assumption). Also, do you assume knowledge of that constant c by the algorithm? - l.154-155: you should compare with the upper bound of [2]! They have a result on this, and your upper bounds are nearly the same (you improve by basically a (log k)^2 factor in the middle term). You cannot not mention it! (also, please remove the constants 2 in 2eps, 2alpha, they are not meaningful and obscure the statement, since you use \lesssim afterwards) - l.234: "liner" -> "linear"  UPDATE: I have read the authors' response, and taken it into account in my assessment.
