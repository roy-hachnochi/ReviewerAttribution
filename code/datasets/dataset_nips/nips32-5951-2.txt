The paper considers the problem of distribution property estimation, where you observe n i.i.d samples from a distribution discrete distribution p over [k]  = {1, 2, ...,k} and you want to estimate a certain property f(p) of the distribution. The problem is a fundamental problem in statistics and machine learning with an increasing interest in the finite sample regime where you consider the sample complexity during the recent decade.  The paper considers all distributions that can be expressed in an additive form with f(p) = \sum_i f_i(p_i) and provides a unified algorithm by approximating each f_i by a piece-wise polynomial function f'_i and the final estimation is the sum of unbiased estimators for f'_i(p_i)'s. The proposed estimator: 1) achieves a sublinear sample complexity of (k/\log k) for all Lipschitz properties in near-linear time. 2) achieve optimal sample complexity for various symmetric properties including Shannon entropy, support size, support cover, distance to a certain distribution and etc.  Although sample optimal estimators for the aforementioned properties already exist in the literature. But it is not clear whether they can be extended to other all additive properties.  The idea of using best polynomial approximation to estimate additive properties is not new (See [Wu, Yang, 2016] for entropy estimation).   This paper extends the idea to a more general class of distribution properties by applying best polynomial approximation in multiple intervals. And this extension might be of independent interest.  Cons:  1. The writing of the paper needs to be improved. It might be good to write what the final estimator will be in Section 2 to give an overall view of the whole algorithm before going into math details in the following sections.  2. Detailed commentsï¼š     1) The abbreviation PML is used without defining.     2) Line 81: belongs to     3) The bounds for power sum seem not matching. Can you elaborate more on this?     4) The equation between 154 and 155 is missing a term \frac{\log^2{\min{n,k}}}{\alpha^2}.     5) Line 214. The statement may not be correct without proper assumption on the posterior of p although I believe lien 213 is correct.     6) Line 237. Should be bias instead of error.     7)  The proof for theorem 3 is missing in the appendix.  Overall, I would recommend the paper for acceptance.
