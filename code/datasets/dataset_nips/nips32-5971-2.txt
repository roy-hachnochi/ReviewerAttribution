- Experimental section does not compare the results of the suggested algorithms with the other known algorithms using other techniques such as local search. A more elaborate experimental section will help.   - Even though the theoretical results are nice, the main selling point of the paper from a usability viewpoint is the simple algorithms that are fast and easy to implement (and hence debug). However, the running time analysis and comparison with other known methods are missing. Such an analysis will help see the results of this paper in the right perspective.  - On the theoretical front, are there lower bounds arguments of the form: for fixed  c=1 and a=2 is there an (a,b,c) algorithm with b = O(1)? There are many such combinations possible. Do the authors know about such lower bounds? It would be nice to include this in the discussion to be able to evaluate the nice upper bounds given in this work.
