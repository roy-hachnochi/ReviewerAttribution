The paper considers an important problem that has also been mentioned in the literature. The algorithms proposed are non-trivial and the paper is overall very well-written and gives a clear exposition of the concepts and the ideas used throughout with many intuitive discussions which were useful. However, some parts could be improved. Specifically, I suggest adding a related work section wherein more details about the previous work and their relation to the current work are discussed.  This would also help non-experts learn more about the true contribution of this paper and the concepts introduced. Nonetheless, I believe the considered problem could of interest to many people at NeurIPS and would like to see the paper accepted if there is room.
