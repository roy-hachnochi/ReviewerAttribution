Logical circuits, are  DAG structures used to represent functions. Specific structural properties of these DAG structures and the corresponding logic circuit representations are used to demonstrate ways of efficient computation of higher order expectations. If the logic circuit representations of the probabilities and discriminative function satisdy specific properties, these moments are efficiently computed.   The proofs of propositions provided in Section 4 (1 & 2) seem to reasonably check out. However that of Theorem 2 & 3 need more elaborate description that seems missing.   Overall the paper seems to be extending results of [10]. The results are an interesting application of very old methods (logical circuit representations) to the problem of calculating expectations.   The paper is clearly written and organized well barring minor typos.   I am not really convinced of the significance of this work given the negative results provided in Theorems 2&3, which suggest that seemingly for simple classes of discriminative functions calculating moments using this framework is #P-hard.
