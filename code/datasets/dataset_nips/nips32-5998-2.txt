Originality:  The paper presents an MDP model of the machine teaching problem and builds a framework around this to improve learning with a teacher.  Quality:  Good quality work (idea, presentation, empirical studies).  Clarity:  Except for the abstract, I found the paper well written and easy to follow.    Significance:  A relevant contribution to machine teaching.    Below I list some comments that provide further details on my review and might be helpful in improving the manuscript.  Main comments:  1) From the abstract, I was not able to tell what the paper is about and what its main ideas and contributions are.  Some examples of what did not become clear: - novelty and benefit of MDP model of teacher - key goal of using a model of the teacher to improve learning performance - point (1) is unclear I suggest rewording the abstract.  2) l. 98:  Why is a deterministic learning algorithm considered?  I suppose this is because otherwise, capturing the learner’s dynamics might be more challenging.  But could one not also consider stochastic learning in the same framework?  Maybe this could be an aspect to discuss.  3) Is the teaching MDP formulation of Sec. 3.2 a novel contribution (the review of related work seems to suggest this)?  If yes, I suggest to explicitly state this somewhere in Sec. 3.  4) l. 139: Is the teacher’s reward the same as the reward previously defined for the learner?  Specifically, is R_t(h_t) = R_t as in l. 110?  Or does the teacher follow a different goal?  This should be discussed and made explicit.  If it's not the same, different letters should be used for the variables to avoid confusion.  5) l. 160: The choice of the reward function as the scalar product between next sample location and true parameters is unclear to me.  Can you elaborate on why this choice?  6) Why is the model in (3) chosen?  Specifically, the exponential terms with temperature parameter.  Is this a common model in inverse RL?   Minor:  7) ll. 49-50: It would be helpful if the authors added to this sentence, what exactly they do differently.  How is another agent than the teacher involved in designing the learning data?  8) ll. 96-100: I find it slightly confusing that (1), (2), (3) are used for enumeration here, as parentheses usually denote equation references.  Consider changing to, e.g., (i), (ii), ...  Similarly, in other parts of the paper.  9) l. 101: T should be math font  10) Unless I missed this, "boundedly optimal teachers" is never explained in the paper.  I suggest doing this.  11) ll. 200-206: This is a nice illustrative example and discussion.   ============================================================ AFTER REBUTTAL: I have read the authors’ response.  I appreciate the authors’ explanations, which address my questions and concerns in a satisfactory manner.  I will thus keep my original score.
