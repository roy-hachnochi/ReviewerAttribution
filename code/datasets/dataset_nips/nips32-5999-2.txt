Originality: The proposed pooling function is novel. The authors show the result of their pooling function with several network architectures on several datasets including ImageNet dataset.  Quality: The submission is technically sound. The authors showed that their pooling function outperforms existing pooling functions like max or average pooling. The section 3.3 shows how change the estimated parameters \mu_0 and \sigma_0 of the pooling function during training.   Clarity: The paper is well written and well organized.  Significance: The experiments show that the proposed pooling function is better than standard pooling functions like max and average pooling. The improvement is about 1% on ImageNet dataset.  --------------------------------------- The rebuttal addresses my concerns and I think it is a good paper.
