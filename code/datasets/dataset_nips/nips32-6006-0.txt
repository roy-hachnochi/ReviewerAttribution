* Originality: the method is novel. The idea of sampling based on upper layers is itself interesting.   * Quality: the work is based on solid arguments and theoretical proofs. The experiments are thoughtful, although lack analysis.   * Clarity: the paper is in general easy to read (thought I didn't check the maths carefully).   - Table 3: Isn't that LADIES should be an approximation of original GCN? If that's true, why is Full-Batch outperformed (in terms of F1) by LADIES?  * significance: this work will have a high impact because of its simplicity, solidity, and high performances.
