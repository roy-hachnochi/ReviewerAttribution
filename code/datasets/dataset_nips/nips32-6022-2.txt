This paper proposes an algorithm for the multi-armed bandit, where the goal is to identify the arm that has the minimum value of the conditional value at risk (CVaR) of the reward, which may be heavy-tailed.  The proposed algorithm is enabled by the new truncation-based estimator for the CVaR, for which new concentration bound is established.  The new truncation-based estimator is of interest in its own right and may find applications beyond multi-armed bandit.  Overall, the paper makes solid contributions primarily from mathematical perspectives.  The proposed algorithm has limited applicability for the following reasons (please explain if there are misunderstandings): - The total number of arm-pulls needs to be known in advance to determine the number of arm-pulls in each stage. - To compute the estimator, all of the observed reward needs to be stored. I also wonder what real applications involve heavy-tailed reward.  I would like to see experimental comparisons of the new truncation-based estimator against existing estimators of CVaR.  ---  I have read the responses from the authors. I am not completely sure exactly how the "doubling trick" and "summary statistics" can be used. I hope the authors explain them in more detail in the final version. Also, I understand that heavy-tailed distributions are ubiquitous but not sure exactly what applications would benefit from optimization via bandit. In any case, this paper makes sufficient contributions to be accepted.
