 Strengths  All the contributions mentioned above.   Very clearly written complete work which proves the optimal convergence rate for various different settings.  Weaknesses/comments  In the abstract it says that "... in the parameter regime most common in practice." Yet, in Algorithm 1 there are the restrictions epsilon \leq 1 and delta \leq 1/n^2. Especially the restriction on delta seems crude. I cannot see where these restrictions come from. The DP result is based here on the reference Abadi et al., and I do not see such restrictions in the results of the reference article.  The privacy analysis (and therefor also the convergence bound) of Algorithm 1 seems to be ultimately based on Lemma 3 of [ACG+16] and on the correct asymptotics that its accurate bounds provide. There seems to be an assumption \sigma \geq 1 in Lemma 3 of [ACG+16], however I do not see this appearing in the article. Could you comment on this?   Some comment about how the coefficients c_1 and c_2 of Theorem 1 of the reference [ACG+ 16] are determined would be in order. I assume the authors have worked out the result of that Thm. 1 of [ACG+16] in detail and that is where the choices of variance and mini-batch size in Algorithm 1 come from.   To be precise, the results of [ACG+16] hold in the case, where the datasets S and S' are such neighbours that one of them is obtained from the other one by removing one element (see e.g. the proof of Lemma 3 of [ACG+16]). Therefore, is it not entirely correct to say (as in Definition 1) "...for any pair of datasets S and Sâ€² differ in exactly one data point..". This gives the impression that one could replace one element in S by another one to obtain S'. Then the results of [ACG+16] would not hold. Perhaps you could comment on the the neighbouring relation of S and S'.  Originality   Regarding the breadth of the analysis, this is highly original.  Quality and clarity  Very clearly structured and easy to read, of highest quality.   EDIT: Thank you for the response. The authors have answered my comments. I still slightly disagree with one point: I think that from (eps,delta)-DP with "remove"-relation it does not follow (2*eps,2*delta)-DP for the "replace"-relation DP. Using a triangle-like argument, one gets (2*eps,(1+exp(eps))*delta)-DP. Of course that can be bounded with your bound for eps. I suggest you either comment the relation or change the constants in step 1 of Alg. 1 and step 1 of Alg. 2. Moreover, I am still slightly puzzled why specifically \delta \leq 1/n^2, why not e.g. \delta << 1/n. Anyhow that is ok as it is I think. I will keep my score and I vote for accept.
