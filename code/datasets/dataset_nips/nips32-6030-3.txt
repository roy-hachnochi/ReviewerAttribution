Clarity: This work is clearly written and easy to follow.   Quality: The experimental section is very thorough and all steps are explained very clearly. The figures comparing against the Cohen paper is familiar, and therefore easy to parse, and seemingly very fair.   Significance + Originality:  (theory) While I feel that the thread on randomized smoothing is an incredibly promising and interesting research direction towards certifiably robust classifiers, this work hardly serves as a standalone result, instead reading like a sequel to the Cohen paper. Keeping in mind that the primary contribution of Cohen's work was the tighter analysis leveraging Neymon-Pearson (indeed, Lecuyer + Li both incorporated AWGN into their smoothed classifiers), this work provides no such analysis or new theoretical insight. Caveat: appendix B does provide an alternative perspective for deriving smoothAdv, but it does not seem to be utilized anywhere. Further, it is natural to apply randomized smoothing to soft classifiers and the corrected objective function (equation (S)) seems simply like correcting a bug from Cohen's work. The application of Stein's lemma to derive an unbiased estimator and the alternative derivation presented in appendix B is perhaps promising, but ultimately not useful.   (practice): the main contribution of this work is that it provides state of the art empirical results for robustness against L2 perturbations smoothed classifiers, substantially improving upon the numbers put forth by Cohen et al. The numerical improvements are undeniable, yet not particularly interesting. The objective used in creating adversarial examples is very natural, and certainly it stands to reason that adversarial training will improve the robust accuracy (and certifiable radius) of a classifier.  (some minor typos): - the middle term in eq. (7) is lacking a subscript y - pseudocode 2 defines counts twice (the first counts should be counts0 if the authors desire to be faithful to Cohen et al). This may be confusing to readers unfamiliar with the original work.     ################################################################## UPDATE AFTER REBUTTAL: I've changed my score to 7 after reading the authors' response. I feel an alternate proof of the key result of Cohen et. al that argues for stronger robustness via reduction of the lipschitz constant provides a nice intuition towards how and why this technique works. This is the primary reason why I've chosen to increase my score.
