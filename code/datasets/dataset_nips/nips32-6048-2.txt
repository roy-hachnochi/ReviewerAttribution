1. The definition of two neighboring reward functions is provided in Theorem 5. The authors did not explain the motivation of the guarantee of privacy for reward function clearly. It would be better if the authors could interpret the necessities of the privacy of reward function in some real application situations. 2.  The description of Algorithm 1 is section 3  is difficult to follow. How about adding noise to the reward function r(.) directly? What is the reason for adding noise like line 19-20 of the Algorithm 1?  The definitions of g^_k[B][2] in line 4 and g^_a[:][1] in line 15 are not given. The method to insert s to g^_a[:][1] such that the list remains monotonically increasing in line 15 is also not provided. In line 5 the definition of C(.), k is not given. Proposition 10 is a little confusing. It means with the increasing of the number of iteration rounds,  the error also becomes large. The interpretation of proposition 10 should be offered in Section 3.  3. It would be much better if the formal proof of Theorem 5 in page 6 is removed to the appendix, then more words can be used to explain the algorithm thoroughly in the main body. 4. The technique of the paper is based on Gaussian process mechanism.
