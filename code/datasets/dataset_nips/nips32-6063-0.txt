i. Novelty: The paper addressed the similar problem setups introduced in [1], [3], [10], [11] in an adversarial bandit feedback setup and showed that the classical EXP3 algorithm is robust enough to be applied in the delayed feedback setup as well. However I have a major issue with their proposed algorithms which seems erroneous due to the choice of the learning rate (\eta) which requires the knowledge of the delays (d_t) -- but according to the problem formulation this is unknown to the learner. Then the whole technique seems to be pointless!  ii: Choice of learning rate (\eta): How to select the learning rate \eta? The optimal learning rate seem to depend on the delays (d_t), e.g. Thm 1, Line-146 etc., but those are unknown to the learner. The claims of the paper stands vacuous if the proposed technique requires the knowledge of delays, where lies the major challenge of the problem addressed.  iii. Writing: Overall, the paper is well structured and as easy to follow. However there are some minor issues which could be taken care of:  a) In Eqn. (1) and (4), it is better and least confusing to use just \min_i \sum_{t}l_t^{(i)}. b) Line 91: Unexpected occurrence of "," c) How is p_1 initialized in Alg-1 and 2 (uniformly I presume)? d) Introducing the notation \lamda^* in Thm 2 is unnecessary e) \eta_e expression incorrect in Eqn (9). etc.  iv. Clarity of the results and comparison with earlier works:   a) Overall, the paper does not draw a clear picture of how their result improves over the existing work, which would have been very useful to understand their precise contributions. b) Some intuition behind ergodic average (Eqn. 15) would be appreciated. c) Dependence of delay is somewhat unclear in the second setting (of two player game). In my understanding the statement "the delays do not have to be bounded (in t) for the convergence to NE to hold" (Line-186) is tad confusing, e.g. is there a way to set \eta_t, \gamma_t if d_t = e^t, and still achieve "ergodic convergence"? Does Thm-2 yield back the classical NE convergence result of no-regret algorithm [14] when there is no delay, i.e. d_t = 0 \forall t --- explain how?  v. Experiments: Its disappointing that the paper does not provide any empirical studies to validate the theoretical guarantees/ comparative performances with existing works.
