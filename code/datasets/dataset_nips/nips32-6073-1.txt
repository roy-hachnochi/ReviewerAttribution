######################################################## Having read the author's response, I maintain my comments and score. The added comparison with previous work will be a useful addition to the paper. ########################################################  This paper was a very nice read. The ideas were clearly presented, the proofs were communicated both at a high, intuitive level and in detail in the appendix, and the algorithms are a substantial improvement over previous work in certain regimes. The paper is, to my knowledge, original and the technical details are correct. In particular, the formalization in Definition 2 is quite interesting, and leads to interesting gradient estimators which, unlike in typical variance reduction methods, are constructed in a different way depending on the query point.  Overall, this paper clearly presents an interesting and seemingly quite practical algorithm for solving an important class of optimization problems.
