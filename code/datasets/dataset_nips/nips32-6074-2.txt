This paper introduces a new learning algorithm that can be used to train neural networks with adaptive regularization. The authors show that the weights in each layer are correlated and then define a prior distribution over the weight to reflect this correlation (reducing the search space basically). The authors propose to use block coordinate descent algorithm to optimize the hyper parameters of this distribution and the weight of the network. The authors show that the proposed method outperforms the existing regularizers. Overall, this paper is well-written, very novel and introduces a very practical way to adaptively regularize a neural network. The following are some minor problems: 1- The authors do not study or talk about the running time of their algorithms compared to the baselines.  2- Figure 3 shows that the proposed algorithm oscillates and it is not well behaved. It would be nice if the authors could talk about this behavior.
