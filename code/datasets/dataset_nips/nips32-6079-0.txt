Quality & Clarity. This paper is well-written. Te exposition throughout the text is clear and appropriated. Section 2 is particularly neat!  Originality: The paper tackles a central problem in distributed optimization and numerical linear algebra: estimating the inverse Hessian matrix from local machines. This paper shows an elegant solution (a weighted average) to solve the bias problem faced when one is estimating the inverse Hessian using a simple average of the local estimators.  Significance: The two discussed applications are very relevant to ML, Newtonâ€™s method and uncertainty quantification. In fact, the sole contribution to distributed Newton's method would probably be of significant impact to the community; and the method could also generalize to other settings/applications.   ----  I acknowledge that I have read the author's response, as well as the other reviewers. Thanks for the response: I have read the paper again and changed my original review and score.
