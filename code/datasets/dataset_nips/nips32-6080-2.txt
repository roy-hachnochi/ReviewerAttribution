# Summary The paper proposes an efficient method, near-linear time algorithm, for smoothing a circuit, focusing on structured decomposable circuits, thus improving the naive quadratic algorithm.  # Quality  The authors analytically prove the complexity of the proposed algorithm in Theorem 3.  The the prove the lower bound of the same complexity.  Due to the result reported in Lemma 1 the authors show how to apply the semigroup range-sum leading to a method for smoothing the AC with a low time complexity (see Theorem 3).  Another linear time algorithm is proposed for the All-Marginals inference task avoiding the need of smoothing.  A final experimental evaluation prove the validity of the proposed methods.   # Clarity  The paper is well written, the concepts are well defined and the proofs correctly prove the reported statements.  A suggestion could be to better explain the backgrouds on AC to make the paper more self-contained.  Definition 8 could be splitted into two definitions, one for smoothness and the other for the task of smoothing.  # Originality  The idea is quite very simple, however the reported results in terms of theorems and experiments prove the validity of the proposed approach.  # Significance  The reported approach presented in the paper make able to solve inference tasks in linear time on non smoothed AC. This is a very important result.
