*** Comments after feedback *** thanks for the clarifications. with the proposed minor improvements I feel the paper is solid so I will raise to 8. However I stress it would be good to remark that the parallelisation scheme is not exclusive to your method.  *** Original review *** Originality. Even though other optimization-based certification of Lipschitz constants have been proposed before, the theoretical result leading to the SDP formulation (Theorem 1) is novel. The multiple variants of the main algorithm aim to provide a more scalable method and in part succeeds at doing so (evaluated networks are still relatively simple), and despite the loss in accuracy the less-complex version of the methodology can achieve better or competitive estimation of the constant.  On the other hand the authors overplay the fact that any method that estimates a Lipschitz constant on a multilayer network can be trivially parallelized by splitting the network into "chunks". This is not a particular advantage of their method and so I think the claims about the parallel version should be toned down. Even from the trivial upper bound on the Lipschitz constant, given by the product of the layer-wise constants, it is clear that such methods can be easily parallelized.  Quality. The proofs are well written and after checking the supplementary material I found no issues on the results leading to theorem 1 (theorem 2 looks like a simple extension of theorem 1 and so I didn't check). The derived bounds are then theoretically justified.  On the other hand I find there is a mismatch between theory and practice in the experimental section. Even though the method certifies a Lipschitz constant with respect to the L2 metric, the adversarial perturbations studied are constrained with the L_infinity metric. So the authors should explain or remark that this is the case. Ideally if we certify an L2 Lipschitz constant, this would provide robustness w.r.t the L2 metric.  This is a general drawback of the work where there is no discussion as to how to compute the Lipschitz constant with respect to other norms (apart from the trivial bounds), or if there is a general limitation of the method that allows it to only work with the L2 metric. Authors should comment a bit more on this.   Clarity. The paper was read easily, and statements are in general clear. On the miscellaneous side I feel the bibliography style is not consistent, it is typeset with [1][2][3] style of citations but sometimes also the names of authors are present e.g. page 2 third paragraph: "in [30], Virmaux and Scaman ...". I found this confusing.  Also there appears to be a typo following theorem 1: "Theorem 1 provides us with a sufficient condition for the constant L2..." I think it should read "for the constant \sqrt{\rho}..."   Significance. Accurate estimation of Lipschitz constant has a broad range of applications, and the empirical observation that the obtained constants are tighter compared to other methods make the contribution significant. On the other hand the underlying problem is an SDP which is still difficult to scale, and the fact that the experiments are only presented on MNIST makes one wonder how would such methods work with larger and more complex network architectures.
