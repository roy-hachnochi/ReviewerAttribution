Originality: The results of this paper include some clever use of existing results and techniques along with some novel algorithmic elements.   Quality: The technical results of the paper are stated precisely and are accompanied with rigorous proofs. The formal statements are also complemented by the descriptions of their underlying intuition, which helps in understanding the results.   Clarity: The paper is very well written, and while the technical content is  dense, it was reasonably easy to follow.   Significance: I feel that the algorithmic ideas presented for achieving the optimal adaptive rates are important, and can have potential applications in related problems.   ------------------------- AFTER AUTHOR RESPONSE: I have read the author response, and I thank the authors for their clarifications.
