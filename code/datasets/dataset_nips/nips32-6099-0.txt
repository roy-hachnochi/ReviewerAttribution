The paper is clearly written, and the method seems to be working very nicely. The authors compare their method only to signSGD and signum, which as it seems lose a lot of accuracy compared to plain SGD and SGDM.  However, looking at the QSGD paper, it looks like there isn't such a loss in accuracy against pure SGD. Can the authors compare their method to QSGD?  The error feedback mechanism also appeared in [14] for a distributed setting. There is also the recent work below that applies very similar error-correction mechanism for QSGD:  J.Wu, W. Huang, J. Huang, and T. Zhang. Error compensated quantized sgd and its applications to large-scale distributed optimization. In ICML, 2018. These works seem to apply the same error correction mechanisms. Can the authors distinguish their work from this one? Compare to it?  Post rebuttal: the authors have addressed most of my concerns. In light of the rebuttal and the other reviews, I upgrade my score to 7.
