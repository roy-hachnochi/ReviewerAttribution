# Strengths  - Clear motivation and structure of the derivations.  The paper and the introduced method are clearly motivated. The structure of the paper and the individual derivations is well structured and presented.  - Some theoretic results from an information geometric viewpoint.  The authors are able to show how their approach can be not only motivated by itself (Section 3), but also show how their approach can be nicels interpreted from an information gometry standpoint where they are able to show the nice result that the method optimizes a bound on the a symmetric version of the KL divergence.   # Weaknesses  - Seems more incremental than novel  While the proposed model gives a new, clean approach on how to construct coresets, that is well motivated if we regard it in isolation, that benefit becomes a lot less clear if we take prior work on coresets into consideration. In that case it looks rather incremental and is lacking a strong motivation as to why it should be used compared to prior work in the area of coreset construction.  - A weak experimental evaluation  The method is only evaluated on a small set of datasets that are either synthetic or very low dimensional (D=10). Yet even there the authors can only demonstrate roughly similar performance to prior work, however at greatly increased cost.     # Minor Typo  In Equation (24), it should be \Sigma_w instead of \Sigma_p in the \mu_w computation unless I am mistaken.   # Recommendation  The work has potential, but there are still some weaknesses that should be addressed during the rebuttal, before I can recommend a clear accept  POST-REBUTTAL:   Having read the author response, I am convinced further about the significance of the contribution. Hence, I increase my score to 7.
