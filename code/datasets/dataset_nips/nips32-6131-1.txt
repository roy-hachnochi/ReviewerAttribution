This submission studies the MAB in high dimension case with the low-rank structure and proposes an algorithm with a scale of regret r^2*(k+d).  Comments: -add related references (1-3) whose cluster size is equivalent to the rank and sharing the same spirit which should be discussed at least, and (1) is also like a way in alternating minimization. References: (1) Collaborative Filtering Bandits, (2) On Context-Dependent Clustering of Bandits, (3) Distributed Clustering of Linear Bandits in Peer to Peer Networks -add a section to describe to your main assumptions and motivate them -add a section to articular what's the main theoretical difference with (6,15) as well as suggested advances -section 3 needs to significantly shrink to save some spaces for the experimental part which is also crucial to the success of this draft -section 4 seems incomplete, add a proof sketch would be sufficient for readers to get the main view -change your name from REAL to RELR, etc, that better represents proposed algorithm -move two-phase bandit algorithm from appendix to main text -add an experimental section to verify the proposed claims -add an explanation regarding lemma 5 and 6 and their relationship  Overall, I went through the whole submission, and found that your theoretical contribution is expected, though needs a better organization and polish, whereas currently your empirical contribution is none, which is hard to go through at this venue, this you are highly encouraged to provide, and there are some jobs need to be done to improve the quality of this draft, in short, my recommendation is this submission with current content is slightly below the acceptance bar, but I am open to change my score when I see their response.  %%%updated comments I read all comments and the response from the authors, my concern has been addressed, and my overall recommendation is an acceptance.
