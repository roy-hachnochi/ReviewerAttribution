Originality: The paper mixes ordinal embedding with Landmark MDS idea, which allow to provide a fast algorithm. This seems new to me and is rather effectice.  Quality: The main theoretical result is the Theorem 4 on sample complexity of the method. It states that the algorithm is consistant with high probability given that more than $d^7n\log n$ queries on the ordinal information are done, in the BTL model.  Clarity: The paper is very clearly written and insights that generated the idea are well introduced and explained.   Significance: The method itself being the most effective given the experiment results, it is certainly significant.
