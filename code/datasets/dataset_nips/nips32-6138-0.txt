The research is carried out in the problem of identification of causal effects in the frame of probabilistic causality established by Pearl, Spirtes, Glymour and Scheines. The current manuscript expands from current work on unconditional causal effects to conditional causal effects. The main rationale of the solution (alike a previous related one) is to reach the computation of the post-interventional causal effect Q using in the denominator a summatory over the elements of a partition of the causal graph, as long as such partition complies with some condition. As from here, my understanding of the paper I must accept was very limited. The rationale of the idea seems ok, but I’ve been unable to follow the details of the maths (this is sharply different from not having check them! I simply did not fully understood them despite making several attempts at understanding them!). In this sense, I can only apologize to the authors for not having been able to give a more thorough feedback (I have lowered my confidence to the minimum).  STRONG POINTS + Given my limited understanding, but as far as I can confirm, the demonstrations of the propositions and lemmas are correct. This is concentrated in the supplementary material.•   WEAK POINTS + To help contextualizing, the draft contains a lot of material already available in other papers (likely from the same authors) leaving little room for the new material. In fact, most of the real innovation is what it is given in the supplementary material. Although I found this useful in a really difficult topic, but to an experienced reader (not me!), it may left him with a bit of a deja-vu impression.
