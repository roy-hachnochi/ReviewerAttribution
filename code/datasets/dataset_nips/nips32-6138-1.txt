Originality; in my humble opinion the paper is moderately original but it addresses and solves a relevant and difficult problem of inference and decision making under partial knowledge and when only observational data are made available.  Quality; the technical quality of the paper is excellent, it is well written and structured. However, it is extremely difficult to review a paper like this one in so few days (we have to keep in mind that 5 papers to review in 3 weeks is really an incredible overhead in the case where technical papers like this one have to be judged. Clarity; the paper is well structured and reads well. However, I would stress that is more examples could be inserted to present and discuss the paper this will help the interested reader to grab the many innovations and contributions of the paper. Significance; the paper is highly significant. Indeed, the developed theory and the designed algorithm will help to analyze complex situations, i.e. real world situations where the available knowledge and data are limited and in particular they are of observational nature.  I also have few questions for the authors/s; Pag. 2; line five from Structural Causal Models, it is assumed that no U elements can be can be parents of V? Pag. 2; would you please clarify what small pai means in formula (1), is it the specific value of Pai? If so then I do not understand well formula (1), could you please help me understand it?
