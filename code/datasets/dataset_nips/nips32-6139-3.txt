The paper introduces the use of termodynamic integration for the training of variational autoencoders.  The new connection between TI and the ELBO is insightful and the derivation of new lower bounds as Riemann discretization of the TI formulation of the log model evidence is clever. However, the suggested gradient estimator is quite unoriginal as it is simply a reinforce estimator with importance sampling weights. The paper is clearly written, albeit the notation is sometimes slightly confusing and some symbols are introduced before being properly defined. The experiments are good enough.  Comments: 1) In line 84, the authors claim that their gradient estimator does not involve the REINFORCE estimator. However, their gradient estimation method IS the reinforce estimator with the addition of importance sampling and an extra term coming from the fact that their distribution is not normalized.  2)  Eq. 2 contains several undefined symbols. It is useless and confusing to give an equation if its meaning cannot be understood in that section in which it is presented.  3) The authors claim that the performance of the method does not monotonically increases as the number of partition increases because the importance sampling scheme introduces a bias. This claim makes intuitive sense but it should be backed up by either theoretical or experimental analysis. I suggest to study a case where p(x|z) p(z) is tractable and the importance samples are unbiased.
