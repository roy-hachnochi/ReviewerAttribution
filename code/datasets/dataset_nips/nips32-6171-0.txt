Weakness: My doubt mainly lies in the experiments section.  1. There is not enough quantitative evaluation of the model. As the authors claim, the proposed framework should be able to capture long-term temporal dependencies. This ability would result in higher generative likelihood. However, there is not enough quantitative evaluation and comparison to back up this statement.  2. The latent space, especially the temporal abstraction level is not investigated enough. Since the proposed framework should be able to learn high-hierarchical temporal structures, it would be interesting to traverse the temporal abstraction latent variable and visualize what happens. Does it encode different information with the observation abstraction or are they somehow entangled together? Such investigation would provide more insights into the hierarchical latent space learned. 3. Although it is not a big issue, the use of binary indicator with Gumbel-softmax relaxation has been utilized in a lot of previous works. But since it works, and it only serves as part of the contribution, I do not see it as a big issue.
