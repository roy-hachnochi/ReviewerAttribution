The paper considers the problem of learning optimal auctions in repeated interaction with bidders where bidders are not myopic (and they may misreport in an early auction to get a better outcome in a later auction). The authors use tools from differential privacy to learn nearly-optimal auctions of the historical bids. A necessary assumption is that bidders don’t show up ``too often’’; prior results have ruled out positive results if that’s the case. The authors present 2 algorithms in this case, based on two notions of approximately truthful: the first guarantees that bidding the true value yields approximately optimal utility, while the other guarantees an equilibrium where the bids of all agents are close to their true values.  Overall I really like the paper. The setting is well-motivated: it builds on an increasingly large literature on learning optimal auctions, but with the reasonable restriction that the method should still be incentive compatible for non-myopic bidders. The algorithms that are proposed make use of tools from differential privacy, but the analysis is thorough and non-trivial.  Small remarks:  The authors may be interested in the work by Lehaie et al. “Testing Incentive Compatibility in Display Ad Auctions” and follow-ups which deals with the complementary problem for an advertiser to determine whether their bid is used to set a reserve price in later auctions.
