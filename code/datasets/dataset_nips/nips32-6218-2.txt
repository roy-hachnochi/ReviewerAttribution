This paper presents a learning framework based on Dynamic Time Warping. DTW kernel is applied in neural networks with stochastic backpropagation. Both end-ot-end DTW and streaming version are implemented in this work. The method has been tested on both synthetic and real data. This work applies learnable DTW kernels in neural networks to represent Doppler invariance in the data. In instead of using DTW as a loss function, DTW kernel is employed obtain a better feature extraction and generates interpretable representation. DTW loss and convergence is theoretically analysed. The proposed technique can be further improved. For example, it will be helpful to know how to decide the number of DTW layers. In algorithm 1â€™s INPUT part, kernels are initially set as input. However the kernels are randomly initialised in OUTPUT part, which should be clarified. Also, in the experiment, it will be helpful if the proposed method can be tested with more real datasets for the application part.
