The problem seems closely related to online algorithms for weighted bipartite matching, such as  Kesselheim, Thomas, Klaus Radke, Andreas Tönnis, and Berthold Vöcking. "An optimal online algorithm for weighted bipartite matching and extensions to combinatorial auctions." In European Symposium on Algorithms, pp. 589-600. Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg, 2013.  This seems to be more general than the problem considered in the submission, but potentially encompasses the secretary ranking problem.  Thus, the novelty of the paper may be somewhat marginal.  Overall, the paper is clear and well-written.  I didn’t read the proofs carefully, but the proof sketches were helpful and convincing.
