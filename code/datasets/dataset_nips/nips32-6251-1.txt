1. originality The theoretical results seem to be an improvement over existing results, however, the assumption still seems strong to me. For example, it requires  log n * d_max = o(d^2_min) and d_min = w(log n) which does not hold if d_max=log^2 n  and d_min = log_n. It means the result only apply on dense graph and not allowing heterogeneous degrees  2. quality  The submission seems technically sound, but I did not check the detailed proofs  3. clarity The paper is clearly written, however, a written algorithm (in supplementary if there is no enough space in main paper) on the proposed seed expansion method will make the paper easier to be referenced  4. significance This paper could help practitioners to better understand pagerank, the concentration result can inspire future work which may relax the assumptions
