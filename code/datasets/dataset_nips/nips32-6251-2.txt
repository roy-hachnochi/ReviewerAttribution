This paper is well written with theoretical and methodological improvements on GPR.   (1) They derived non-asymptotic bounds for LPs and GPRs, which helps understand previous GPR-based methods.  They also generalize the analysis of standard PR methods with fewer assumptions.   (2) The proposed IPR method, where they take into account the variance of LPs when selecting weights in the first several steps of RW.  They showed IPR has better performance for SE community detection, by simulations and real data on networks with different settings.
