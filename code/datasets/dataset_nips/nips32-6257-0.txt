Originality: The idea of quantization and the analysis of quantized SGD is not new. The authors provide a novel dimension independent bound which does seem novel. The work seems complete and the authors seem to cite properly.  Quality: The quality of the is overall fine. It is a reasonably solid paper. The result is not amazing but it seems correct and there are also simulations. Overall, the authors have a nice result.  Clarity: The paper is clear.  Significance: This is where the authors could have done a better job. I am not convinced of the significance of this paper. My main issue is that the dimension dependent bound is tight so why does the re-parameterization that removes the dimension dependence help. A clear explanation of when the authors results are better and when they do not improve previous results would have been really useful. Also, a clear statement of how the authors helped improve SGD algorithms would also have helped.
