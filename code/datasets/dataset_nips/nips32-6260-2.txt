The key insight of the proposed method is to put the estimation of the error in relation to the distance between the empirical and the true distribution, where the distance is the Wasserstein distance. This is a pretty original approach, as far as this reviewer knows.  The page limit of NeurIPS puts highly-theoretical papers such as this one at a serious disadvantage. As a result, it is quite hard for someone not expert in the area to grasp what is going on in the paper because very little guidance is given (as there is no space for it), and very little intuition is successfully communicated to the reader. While it is very hard to achieve given the space limitation, perhaps some nuggets of intuition can be made evident here and there.   The contribution of the paper seem quite significant, and the technique very novel, although there seems to be a very strong reliance on existing concentration bounds. It would be helpful to clarify how much of the proposed results are more than an application of existing bounds (which would still make the work an interesting contribution, but this clarification would help better assessing its significance).
