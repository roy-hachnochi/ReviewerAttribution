The proposal to restrict the learned policy to lie within the support of the data distribution instead of mimicking the data distribution is very good. Proposing this, and especially making it work is in my understanding novel (I will have to defer to the other reviewers who are hopefully deeper experts on Q-learning to comment on past work). The theoretical analysis that supports the idea is also well made: there is an appropriate balance between complexity and usefulness in the analysis. The empirical results are convincing and support the theory, and are in line with what one would expect. Overall, the paper seems solid and well written, the method relevant, and the results are good.  Edit: Thank you for your response, and for adding the humanoid experiments, they add value to the paper. Although I am happy with the response and believe the paper got even stronger, I would say that my score pre- and post-update would round to the same fairly favorable number.
