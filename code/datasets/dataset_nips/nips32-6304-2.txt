The current version provides limited explanation and analysis of its empirical results and feels a bit preliminary now. The assumptions and implications of the bounds are not discussed. The theoretical choice of {beta_t} in Theorem 5.1 is typically overly conservative and thus, the practical schedule is used. This is common to GP-UCB based algorithms and should be criticized more because the theoretical analysis and the practical usage is different. In particular, it is more important to select the schedule of beta_t.  My main concern is the experimental results. You only analyzed the low-dimensional case (d=2-3) in real problems with the small number of iterations. Optimization should be inefficient if you expand space. Extending the search space seems to need more trails of optimization.  When you use the high-dimensional case (d=10) and more iterations case, e.g., 100 iterations, the existing method can outperform your method.  Using warped Gaussian process in input space is an approach to reconstruct search space, which is a limited input search space but warped by bijective transformations.
