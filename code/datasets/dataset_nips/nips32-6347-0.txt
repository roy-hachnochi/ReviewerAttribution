In this paper the authors propose a confidence estimation method which relies feature perturbation. However this method avoids perturbation in high dimensional feature space by selecting a subset of features through an attribution method. They provide theoretical justification for using input gradients as a substitute for attribution.  The paper provides a rich literature survey which can aid readers newly approaching this area of research. Further they span their survey over different classes of approaches which provides a better understanding to the readers.  Empirical evaluations are provided for out-of-distribution detection, adversarial example detection. Further they also provided evaluations for both digital and physically realizable adversarial patch attacks.
