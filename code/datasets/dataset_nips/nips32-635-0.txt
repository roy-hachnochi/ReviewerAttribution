The authors propose a criterion and method for selecting independent diffusion coordinates to capture the structure of a manifold with a large aspect ratio. The ideas presented in the paper are original, and the paper is clearly written, well organized and scientifically sound. The theoretical background and new analysis are provided in a clear and well-written form. The authors provide sufficient information to allow reproducibility of the method. Simulations are provided to support the success of the method, furthermore, the method is compared to an alternative approach. The paper indeed addresses a real problem in manifold learning, and the proposed method might be used by others in the future.  I have a few minor concerns: the authors do not relate to: "Non-Redundant Spectral Dimensionality Reduction", Michaeli et al. probably unintentionally. However, I believe that this method provides a true alternative to the proposed method and this should be addressed. -The choice of the kernel bandwidth ($\epsilon$) is not addressed, this parameter could dramatically affect the results. Moreover, in some cases, if $\epsilon$ is chosen as a diag matrix (i.e. different number for each coordinate), the aspect ratio problem could be fixed (see for example "Kernel Scaling for Manifold Learning and Classification").  To summarize, I think the paper should be accepted and hope that these minor changes could be easily addressed to improve this manuscript.  Respond to rebuttal:  The authors have addressed all my comments in the rebuttal, my opinion is unchanged, I think that the paper should be accepted with the appropriate edits included in the final version.
