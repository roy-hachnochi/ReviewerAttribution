This paper studies the problem of selecting coordinates of a map into a high-dimensional Euclidean space (assumed to be a smooth embedding) to produce a smooth immersion into a lower-dimensional Euclidean space. As the original map is composed of the eigenfunctions of a Laplacian, the authors call this the Independent Eigencoordinate Selection problem.  The main contribution of the paper is to design an objective function to encourage the projected map to be locally injective and a regularization term encouraging use of slowly-varying lower eigenvalues. The IES problem is naturally phrased as a subset selection problem given these choices. The paper does not focus on how to optimize this objective function; rather, the authors study the behavior of the exact solution (found via exhaustive search of small subsets) under changes in the regularization parameter as a *regularization path*.  I would have liked to see more discussion of the particular objective function chosen. Section 5 of the paper states that in the limit of infinitely many samples, the objective function converges to a K-L divergence between two Riemannian volume forms, one of them a pullback and the other cooked up to rescale the pullback. It seems like this limit is intended to motivate the choice of objective function. In that case, it would have been helpful to introduce it earlier and to discuss it more: e.g, why is K-L between these two volume forms a good way to encourage local injectivity.  More fundamentally, the IES problem chooses a composition of the original map with a very specific Euclidean projection: a projection along coordinate axes. Searching over subsets of coordinates seems hard in general (this paper mainly uses exhaustive search). Why is it better to search among subsets of the coordinates than to search over all projections, which would be more amenable to continuous optimization techniques (e.g. manifold optimization on the Grassmannian)?  I found the section on the regularization path and choosing $\zeta$ hard to follow. It seems to use notation introduced in the supplementary material without referring to it.  Some of the mathematical terminology and notation in the paper is non-standard. For example, the pullback of a metric is normally denoted $\phi^*g$, not $g_{*\phi}$. The paper refers to the pushforward of the metric, which is really the pullback by the inverse map, $(\phi^{-1})^*g$. Of course this only makes sense where the inverse is well-defined.  Similarly, the classification of functional dependencies/knots and crossings may be standard in machine learning, but as far as I know mathematicians would call these failures of local injectivity and failures of injectivity, respectively. A map that is locally (infinitesimally) injective but not necessarily globally injective is an immersion. It would be helpful to use this standard term as this is what the paper is seeking.  In Section 5, some notation is used without being introduced. For example, I do not see where $p$ is defined, nor what $\sigma_k(y)$ is. The jacobian determinant is defined as the volume of a matrix, which seems like a typo.  The characterization of the regularization parameter $\zeta$ is inconsistent. For example, section 5 states that "a smaller value for the regularization term encourages the use of slow varying coordinate functions." In fact, increasing $\zeta$ should put more emphasis on low-frequency modes.  The paper states that "The rescaling of $\zeta$ [in equation(10)] in comparison with equation (2) aims to make $\zeta$ adimensional." But it is also stated that the objective function $\mathfrak{L}$ from equation (2) converges to that in equation (10). In that case, the scaling should be consistent between the two equations. If adimensionality is desirable, why not aim for that in the original definition of the objective function?
