i. Novelty: While the idea of combining TD and MC methods is novel, the entire paper mostly provides only empirical results but falls short in terms of the theoretical contribution which seems to be not very well suited for this particular venue.  ii. Writing: The paper is overall well written although I would suggest to state the proposed algorithm (Alg-1) in the main paper, moving description of the MC (Sec 2.2) and TD (Sec 2.3) policy evaluation method to the appendix.
