============ Update: In response to the authors' response, I've raised my score to 8.  ============ Significance: The paper achieves a generative model capable of generating samples comparable to GANs, without a difficult adversarial training process or massive amounts of compute and data. I think that the potential impact of such a thing is very large.   Quality: The paper makes a careful analysis of problems with score matching for generative modeling. The claims are specific, and each claim is backed up with a carefully done toy experiment. The method is well-motivated and few choices seem ad-hoc. The image generation experiments aren't fantastic, but they're more than sufficient to support the claim that the model performs comparably to GANs and better than any other non-GAN-related method I've seen (I'm counting MoLM and https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.08689 both as GAN-related methods).  Originality: I don't have a deep background on score matching or energy models, but to my knowledge the ideas presented are novel. Even if they weren't, I would argue that putting them together into an algorithm which achieves competitive performance is a novel contribution in its own right.  Clarity: The paper is well-written, with enough background and detail to be easily understood.  I do have substantial criticisms which I think should be addressed before this paper is published (see the 'improvements' section of the review), but if these are addressed I recommend acceptance.
