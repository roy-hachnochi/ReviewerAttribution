the paper discusses a new learning principle of score-matching in the context of generative models. while score-matching is a pretty classical idea, the paper nicely demonstrates its power on large scale generative models and addresses the unique challenges posed up modern images.  I have only one major comment. it is nice to see how score matching is able to generate non-blurry image examples. however, it came as unintuitive specifically because the learning algorithm adds gaussian noise --- gaussian noise in VAE is known to be the culprit of image blurriness. on the other hand, https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.05789 has shown that if we get the dimensionality of the manifold correct, we are also able to get non-blurry images. so I wonder how to reconcile the intuition of non-blurry generated images in the presence of gaussian noise? or is the generated images non-blurry because it gets the manifold dimension correct? if so, is the gain of the proposed algorithm coming from the new learning principle or getting the manifold dimension correct?
