The material of this submission is substantial. Unfortunately, the NeurIPS template is short and the author have postponed many details in the appendix. Splitting the paper in two part has a drawback: it makes the reading not as smooth as it could be in a single file as the Appendix now contains large technical blocks (with few text) making it tedious to read.   The paper contains few typos and the proof seems to me correct even if I don't check everything line by line. Here are the minor typos I found:  Paper - lines 4-8 (Abstract): The sentence is too long. Please consider to split it in two. - page 2 (caption Fig 1): t=0 -> $t=0$ and t=1 -> $t=1$ - line 92: missing a space after w.r.t. - lines 107 and 372: Is it possible to find a better notation than $K = \sum_i w_i K w_i$?  - equation 3.5: Please introduce notation \frac{\delta}{\delta I(1)}.   supplementary material  - Equation 7.1 : there is an extra | (vert) in LHS. - Equation 7.5:  the dependence on $t$ is implicit in RHS. Please make it explicit. - line 421: euqation -> equation
