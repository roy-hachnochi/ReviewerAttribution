The paper is however hard on notation, possibly restricting a clear reading. One example is a lack of formal definition of used term, such as Reg(), cramping many notation in single lines (eq 2.1-2.4), heavy wording ("regularize the regularizer").   For this reason, perhaps, I missed an important step in the paper: How are the initial momenta exactly learned? Is this from ground truth momenta, if so, are they commuted via a conventional gradient-descent optimization? If so, (a) how does the learning method compares with the learned method, and (b) how does using the conventional optimization method compares with non-spatially-varying methods (LDDMMs, SVFs). In the experiment, the proposed learning method is directly compared with conventional non-spatially-varying method, which prevents the reader to appreciate the contribution from (a) the learning approach, and (b) the spatially-varying regularization. In other word, is deep learning really adding value to the registration regularization (the contribution)?   Spatially-varying method has been studied in the medical imaging community, notably with the work on "Probabilistic non-linear registration with spatially adaptive regularization", MICCAI'13, MedIA'15. Other follow up work should be mentioned and studied if the spatially-varying aspect is promoted in the submission.
