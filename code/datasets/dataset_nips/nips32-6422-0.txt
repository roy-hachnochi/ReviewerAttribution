The paper under review introduces a new inference methodology for the estimation of spatial point processes intensity for which the authors derive confidence interval with guaranteed out-of-sample performance. The approach combines a discretised Poisson process with the conformal prediction framework to obtain point-wise confidence intervals. The authors propose an efficient inference procedure based on a majorization-minimization algorithm. The approach is illustrated by simulations and applied to two different data sets.  The paper is very well written but some imprecisions in the notations make the exposition sometime difficult to follow, for instance it is a good practice to denote random variables with upper case letters. This work is original and of good quality, the reviewer has the following comments:  Minor points: - l.3-4: the authors mention a tuning-free regularized criterion, but the choice of $\gamma$ is never discussed and chosen arbitrarily. Remove this point or give further explanations. - l.27: `a spatially varying intensity interval' the formulation is awkward. Maybe, develop `an inference procedure for the spatial intensity of a point process'. Inference imply directly that you derive not only a point estimate but also confidence intervals.  - l.29-35: the choice a bullet list is strange as only the first bullet is a contribution, the other three are precisions/details on this contribution. - l.39: NotationS - Figure 1 is really misleading as it shows an example where the estimator does not rely on discretization of the space, which make the presentation confusing. Should be changed. - l.44: the index $r$ is missing the union. Isn't $\lambda(x)$ the expected number of event? Is $y$ an event or the number of events? $Y$ is not defined (maximum number of events?). - l.47: Further details about the motivation for partitioning should be given (more than `it is usual practice'). - Equation (3): I don't really understand the notation. Shouldn't be $Pr\{y \in \Lambda(x) \} > 1 - \alpha$ for all $x \in \chi$ as suggested by Algorithm 1? - l.64: $r$ is an index and not a region. - l.65: what do you mean by `free to vary $\tilde{y}$'? - Algorithm 1: In 3, shouldn't be find the $r$ corresponding to $x$? In 5, do you accumulate the score the ones of previous value of $\tilde{y}$? - Equation 5: in KL, there is no $n$. The empirical estimator of the KL should be introduced later. Or replace be the log-likelihood function ($p(y|r)$ is not accessible in practice). - l.88-89: $\Phi$ is not defined in the equation. - Equation 6: now it should be the log-likelihood function. - Equation 7: $\gamma$ is not defined. - l.102: why do you restrict $\gamma$ to $[(0,1/2)$? Can you comment on it? - l.107+: `we then obtain..` is it the estimator you obtain with this particular choice of weights? Then the new $\hat{\theta}$ might benefit from a new notation to stress the difference. - l.110: $p(y|r)$ is not known and it is not possible to compute the empirical divergence. - Algorithm 2: why not using `while' and specify the exact criteria for convergence? - Section 4.1: Might be worth mentioning that $Y = 10$. - Section 4.1: would it be possible to have (in Appendix) the empirical coverage rate? As this is a simulation study, that can be easily computed and would be highly pertinent. Indeed, your methodology might have reach $100\%$ easily (too conservative) while the likelihood approach might have a lower but still good coverage. Those tables would help to understand the differences. - Figure 2. a): Can you explain why the likelihood approach yields wider confidence interval on the left side on the interval? This sounds conter-intuitive as your method ought to be more conservative. - Figure 2. b): The bad performance of the likelihood seems caused here by a not strong enough regularization/bad choice of priori. - Section 4.2: what is the value of $Y$ and how did you choose it? Does it impact the results?  - l. 204-205: from the simulation study we cannot say that your methodology yields more informative intervals. Indeed an interval with $100\%$ coverage is not informative. So either you give the empirical coverage numbers of the simulation study to illustrate that it is the case in this setting, or you just re-formulate with `leads to intervals with guaranteed out-of-sample coverage level'.
