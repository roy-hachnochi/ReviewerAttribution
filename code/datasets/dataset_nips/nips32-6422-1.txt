This paper presents a regularized method of spatial point process to infer predictive intensity intervals. The intensity interval is constructed using a spatial Poisson model with provable out of sample accuracy. The method is demonstrated using both synthetic and real spatial data. In this work, the intensity interval is developed using the conformal prediction framework. The intensity interval exhibits provable out of sample prediction performance guarantee. My major concern is the practicality of the proposed method. For the intensity interval where there is missing data, the estimator is relatively useful in the interpolated area. It is not surprising that the intensity interval grows drastically in the extrapolated area (see the right side of Figure 1). Also regarding the learning criterion (7), the first term (log-likelihood) is proportional to n^-1, and the second term (regularization) is proportional to n^-gamma, where gamma is close to 0.5. Hence the two terms look a bit imbalanced. It will be helpful if the proposed method can be further tested with more datasets and clarified in details. Also, it will be helpful if the proposed method can be compared with the state of the art methods besides LCGP. Moreover, it will be useful to discuss the computation complexity of the proposed method.
