I think the application of conformal prediction to spatial point processes within the ML community is interesting, particularly as most recent work in this area has taken on a Bayesian flavor, and we lack sufficient rigor in evaluating accuracy of uncertainty quantification. I do think that it could be made a little more clear that the intervals require a partitioning of the domain, and I would be interested to understand how this partitioning affects the performance (and bound)---is improper discretization covered under the model-misspecification guarantee?  In general, I think the submission is reasonably well written, novel (to the best of my knowledge), and would be of interest to those in the community who work on point processes.
