Originality: the proposed idea is inspired from the spatial transformer networks. Clarity: the notations of this paper are a bit confusing, especially for Sec 3.1 when describing heterogeneous graph and meta-paths. Significance: the proposed method provides a good way to interpret the generation of meta-paths and helps to understand the problem.
