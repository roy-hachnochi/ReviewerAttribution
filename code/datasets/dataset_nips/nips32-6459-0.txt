1) The problem formulation is correct and it is backed well by supporting experimental results. But did not report any other baseline approaches and did not compare their framework to other approaches for this problem. 2) The writeup is good and easy to follow. Experiments are well described for others to repeat them.  3) The algorithm is novel and seems significant for others to continue from here.
