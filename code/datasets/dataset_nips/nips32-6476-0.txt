The submission is particularly well-written. The prior work, notations and mathematical setup are crystal clear and constitute excellent motivations for the work presented. Proofs and results are extensions of Sur and Cand√®s' work; they are not straightforward though, and often commented and summarized. The submission put so much effort on being as clear as possible that few parts are disappointing in that regard:   - the equation system is a central but presented somewhat abruptly; some naive intuition or interpretation would have been appreciated;   - the uniqueness of the solution is assumed in Theorem 1. Are there simple settings where it is always the case? Is this assumption reasonable with l1/l2 regularizers?   - the ending is sudden: what are the open questions and potential future work?  One last remark: the supplementary material is on the same level of quality as the main paper, which is rare enough to be noted.  Updated review: The author have addressed most of our concerned so I am favorable for the paper acceptance.
