After rebuttal: Although I would expect more technical argument instead of providing formal justification, I am satisfied with the authors' feedback in general. I agree with the other two reviewers the theory part is excellent and the work of this paper is far more meaningful than minor issues. ===  Originality: The topic picked by the authors is distinct and the proposed algorithm is novel. Related work is adequately cited.  Significance: The proposed algorithm is different from previous work. The comparison with gradient descent shows the proposed algorithm has a great advantage. However, I was expecting more results to demonstrate the efficiency of their algorithm.  Clarity and quality: In general, this is a well-written paper with strong theory proof. My concern comes from the completeness of the paper. First, the paper would be more complete if a precise description of Algorithm 2 was provided like Algorithm 1. Second, I couldn't find any conclusion part to summarize the work in the paper, which should be given shortly. Third, the format of references does not meet NeurIPS style.  This is a fancy and interesting paper. The theoretical analysis is very strong but it slightly lacks empirical results. The completeness of the paper could be improved. Although there are minor issues, the paper is worth an acceptance.
