Significance: the th1 can be useful in other works. The B_T term in Th2 (and the need of its knowledge to get the optimal \gamma) are little bit sad and could be more discussed (I'im wondering if on could get rid of it if the opponent had no knowledge of \theta_t but only \theta_{t-1} at timestep t)  Originality: Results are very similar to SW-LinUCB since this work is essentially a replacement of the sliding window by a discounted weighted estimation.   Quality: my main objection is about the adequacy to scenarios from real world (sec 4.2 is not very good). Anyway this is not the core of the paper since the proposed approach is likely to have the same kind of performances than any sliding windows technique.   Clarity: the paper is cristal clear
