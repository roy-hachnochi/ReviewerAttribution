Edit: I have read the author response and other reviews. My score remains the same.  The paper proposes to frame multi-task learning as multi-objective optimization in the line of Sener and Koltun (NIPS 2018). Importantly, the proposed approach not only finds a single solution on the Pareto frontier, but a diverse set of different solutions that trade-off with different trade-offs. This is achieved by decomposing the MTL problem into K subproblems, each of which is defined by a unit preference vector and constrained to be in a subregion in the objective space.   Overall, I found the approach well motivated and the paper well written. I am not aware of prior work that enables the user to trade-off the performance of different tasks for multi-task learning and believe that this may be of practical impact. It is also interesting to see that Pareto MTL is also able to find a good solution if only strong performance on one of the tasks is desired.  I also appreciated the comparison to adaptive weight loss approaches, which should enable different perspectives on multi-objective approaches to MTL. I particularly enjoyed the extensive supplementary material, including the analysis of the importance of finding an initial solution, the analysis of the adaptive weight vectors, and an extension to many tasks.  There are a few typos in the paper: "neural" -> "natural" (line 27); "depended" -> "dependant" (line 111); "significant" -> "significantly" (line 213); "MultiFashion-MINST" -> "MultiFashionMNIST" (line 245).
