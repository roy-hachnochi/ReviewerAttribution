Originality: This paper invents the trick of implicit communication through collisions for  synchronization case and it is used in subsequent papers. Also, it proposes the first algorithm without synchronization, which is an unrealistic assumption in real case.  Quality: The proofs seem to be right and it clearly support the theorem given and the claim that the existing lower bound has potential problem.  Clarity: The paper is well-organized.  Significance: The paper gives a useful trick for synchronization case which uses the information deduced from collisions and explains why the previous lower bound has potential problem. It also invents the first algorithm with log regret in dynamic setting, which is more realistic.
