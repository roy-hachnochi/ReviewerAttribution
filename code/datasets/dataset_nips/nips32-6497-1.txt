Originality: The paper studies the multiplayer bandit problem and is largely based on the Musical Chairs paper (Rosenski et al.). The fact that the players can use the collisions to their advantage, and that the resulting algorithm enjoys a similar regret bound to the centralized setting, is nontrivial.  Quality: The results are sound.  Clarity: The paper is well-written overall. However, the authors do not explicitly address the fact that SIC-MMAB2 and its analysis are only found in the supplementary material.  Significance: The theoretical results are important as they contradict two previously known lower bounds.  --- After rebuttal --- I have read the authors feedback and am satisfied with the fixes planned for the camera-ready version. I wholeheartedly suggest the papers acceptance.
