The proposed method is a nice contribution that provides a framework for evaluation of GANs using the duality gap theory. Specifically it considers the gap between various discriminator generator pairs (worst generator, discriminator). This can provide means for evaluation of gans in various settings. The method uses a good theoretical framework and well evaluated experimentally. It solves an important problem of evaluation of GANs
