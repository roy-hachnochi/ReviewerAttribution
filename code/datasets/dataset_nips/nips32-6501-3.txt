This submission aims to develop metrics for monitoring of GAN training and assessment of the quality for the resulting images. Such a metric is useful for inspecting the GAN convergence and to detect the mode collapse deficiency associated with GANs. This paper adapts the duality gap as the quality and provides a minmax approximation for the duality gap. Various experiments are performed that correlate the duality gap pattern with the convergence behavior.     Strong points: -metrics for monitoring the GAN performance is novel and very practical -the experiments are extensive   Weak points:  -the approximation for the duality gap is rather ad hoc; it is not clear how close the approximation is to the real statistical gap; this needs further experimental exploration and justification  -is the duality gap evaluated in parallel with the training?  -the main result in this paper is Theorem 1. However, the usefulness of the lower bound for the duality gap is not immediately useful. It would be interesting if one can develop upperbounds.
