Originality: The model is new. Though it's somehow similar to the bandit model, the new model captures exploits a salient feature that often appear in practical applications of submodular function minimization that is not captured by the bandit model. Quality: The proofs seem to be correct. The proofs are not very hard technically as we already have a sheer amount of proof techniques developed in online convex optimization. Clarity: It was easy to follow the argument. Significance: Although the proofs are not very hard, I think the model is worth studying.  Line 172: The range of f is missing
