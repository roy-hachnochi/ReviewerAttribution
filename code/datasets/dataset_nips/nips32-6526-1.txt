Let me start with a global comment. I enjoyed very much reading this paper. I found it well written (apart from typos, and some English sentences constructions that are a bit heavy) and interesting. It is related to a modern sub-field of reinforcement learning: multi-agent learning, that lacks theory w.r.t. to single-agent RL. The paper introduces a mean-field analysis of a large population of agents playing simple symmetric matrix games against each others, so that, as the population gets large, each player effectively plays against a single "mean" player. The theory is very well explained in spite of the conciseness of the paper, and the numerical experiments are very convincing. I recommend publication in NeurIPS. Let me give some more detailed comments (unfortunately the lines numbering are not present in the pdf; this is usually very convenient for pointing the mistakes, the authors will have to find where are the mistakes I'm referring to):  _typos: page 2 (of AN individual agent may...; we introduce a probability...; of individual agentS under...). page 3 (Q-value WITH probability 1). page 4 (for AN individual agent; bar x_t should be bold; in fact irrelevant to the identity... -> in fact independent of the agents, but only depends on the current Q-values; such that given the settings of.. -> such that given...). page 5 (around the point q_t travel ALONG THE Z_i-AXIS; adjacent box B'={... for all j in {1,...k}/{i} } YOU MISS THE /{i}; of of the box). page 6 (recap -> recall; unfair for the player that plays H -> that plays D; table 2 (PD): left-down corner should be 5,0). page 8 (of AN individual Q-learner under A n-agent setting; dominates THE choice..) _please say in table 1 if row player's payoff is the first or second number in each entry of the payoff matrix _algo 1: it misses initializations: theta=0, t=0 (maybe others?) _my main question: From (1) to (2), because the game is stateless, the greedy term max Q (last term in (1)) disappears in the Q update equation. But I do not clearly see why, and this seems crucial for the analysis in the paper. This point, even if evident for the authors, should be clearly explained. _below (3): "where a=a_j.." is a useless sentence, as there is no a written above. _eq (4) is wrong as such: the second t+1 index on the left hand side should be t, and or 1) a should be replaced by a_j everywhere (the clearer solution to me, as the left hand side as it it written right now does not depend on j, while the right hand side does which is strange), or 2) you write explicitly close to (4) that a=a_j (the sentence below (3)). The same comment applies to the next equations, like (5) etc, where a should be a_j.  Overall its a very good paper from which I leaned a lot. I recommend for acceptance after my comments have been taken into account, especially the authors should explain better how to go from (1) to (2). It would also have been nice to provide a code of the experiments.   I have read the authors' rebuttal and taken it into account.
