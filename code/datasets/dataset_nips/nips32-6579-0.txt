(Originality): This is the first paper to discuss flow-based models for discrete data, concurrent with [Tran et al. 2019] (see https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.10347). However, there is little overlap between the papers as the other paper considers flows for nominal data and proposes a different set of flows. The paper also, to the best of my knowledge, is the first to use flow-based methods for lossless compression, concurrent with [Ho et al. 2019] (see https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.08500).  (Quality): The paper appears technically sound.  As the flows map from integers to integers, the straight-through estimator (STE) is used to allow gradient-based optimization. The authors are clear about the gradient bias introduced by the STE.  (Clarity): I found the paper to be very readable and with a good structure. Background material is introduced, the method is clearly explained and supported by several illustrative figures.  (Significance): This paper is among the first papers on two emerging lines of research: - Flows for discrete data. - Flows for lossless compression.
