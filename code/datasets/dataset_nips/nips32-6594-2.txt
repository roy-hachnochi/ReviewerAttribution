I have read the author feedback and my evaluation remains the same. ============================================================  As I mentioned above, the choice of Lagrangian formulation seems natural (though the use in NLP problems could be still be novel and significant). The author cited Jin et al 2019 for the convergence of the optimizer. For better clarity, it would be good to discuss the specific conditions and conclusion of that result, and verify that the problems at hand do satisfy the conditions. Also, are (6) and (7) equivalent in this case (strong duality holds)?   How to interpret figure 1, where CI is the best performer on the 37k training set in plot (a), whereas it still violates much of the constraints in plot (b)?  This paper is quite NLP. Can authors think of additional application of the proposed approach in other domains (like in speech and vision?)
