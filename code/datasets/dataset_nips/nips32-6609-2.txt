Quality and Clarity - the main idea is good and overall the paper is interesting. In my opinion, some parts are not clear enough (for example  - subsection 3.1, when elaborating on the strategies). Adding pseudo code might help here.  Originality - it's the first time that using unlabeled data are shown to effective in the robust learning regime, both theoretically and empirically.   Significance - robust models require more samples in order to generalize. Showing that unlabeled data alleviate this problem is crucial because it is much easier (and cheaper) to collect.
