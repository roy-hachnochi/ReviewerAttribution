The paper is well-written and easy to follow. The main contributions are clear and justified, and they follow quite directly from the concept of using facility location and clustering to do learning. The technical ideas are strongly related to clustering, from the clustering-based loss functions to the EM/K-means flavor of the main algorithm. The experimental results quite thoroughly demonstrate the value of the proposed method on a dataset, though perhaps more datasets could be used.  [Update after Author Feedback].
