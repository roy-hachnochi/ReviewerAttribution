This paper proposes a sparse convex relation of the facility location utility function for subset selection, for the problem of recovering ground-truth representatives for datasets.  This relaxation is used to develop a supervised learning approach for this problem, which involves a learning algorithm that alternatively updates three loss functions (Eq. 7 and Alg. 1) based on three conditions for which this relaxation recovers ground-truth representatives (Theorem 1).  The supervised facility learning approach described in this paper appears to be novel, and is described clearly.  The experimental results are reasonably convincing overall.  One weakness is that only one dataset is used, the Breakfast dataset.  It would be more convincing to include results for at least one other dataset. The epoch 0 (before training) TSNE visualization is unnecessary and can be removed.  Also, the interpretation of Fig. 3 provided in the paper somewhat subjective and not completely convincing.  For example, while the authors point out that the SubModMix and dppLSTM baselines can select multiple representatives from the same activity, SupUFL-L (one of the proposed approaches in the paper) can also select multiple representatives from the same activity.  Also, while the baselines fail to select representatives from the “take cup” subactivity, SupUFL-L fails to select representatives from the SIL subactivity.  Finally, error bars (confidence estimates) should be provided for the scores in Tables 1 and 2.
