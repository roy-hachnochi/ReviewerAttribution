Originality: The work is original in its setup of preference order in multi-objective bayesian optimisation. It extends hypervolume based acquisition function for BO with an algorithm that tests for satisfiability of preference order in a sample.  Quality and clarity: The work done is complete in its motivation, formulation, aproach and experimentation. It is clearly presented. Significance: To my understanding, the use of algorithm (1) in checking if v \in \matbb{S}_{\mathcal{J}} is the only step where preference order plays a role. However, I would be interested to know how this compares to a trivial approach where the preference order sorting is carried out as a post processing step for filtering a pareto front obtained without consideration of any preference order.
