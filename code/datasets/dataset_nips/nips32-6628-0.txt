Originality ------------ The present work is a novel unifying view of multiple calibration errors (ECE, MCE, MMCE). The authors relates well their work to the literature as they show how the proposed framework generalize the aforementioned methods. Through this framework, new estimators with interesting theoretical and practical properties are derived. The proposed estimator are all consistent and one of them can be computed in linear time.The estimators are also interpretable in the sense that they can be used for hypothesis testing.  Quality --------- To the best of my knowledge the paper is technically sound, and all claims come with quality proofs. The authors backed error bounds by numerical studies. Yet the authors could have included experiments on real neural network (On Calibration of Modern Neural Networks, Guo et Al. 2017).   Clarity -------- The paper is well written and organized. The supplementary material embed all the knowledge on Operator-Valued kernel required to understand the proofs.  Significance --------------- Calibration of classification model is a very important topic for industries dealing with critical applications. Moreover the present work brings a new theoretical unifying view on calibration errors.  I have read the author response and changed my score from 7  to 8.
