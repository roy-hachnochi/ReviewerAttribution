The paper is well written. The authors provide a generalisation of the approach taken in [5] which seems quite natural. Their approximation of the metric seems also quite inspired by the approximation performed in [5]. I think the paper is  complete, the methodological results are well justified and the experimental study is extensive.  I think this paper "Interpoint Distance Based Two Sample Tests in High Dimension" is relevant as they show a very similar behaviour of L1-based test in higher dimensions   Typos:  1) In line 73, I think D_{\mu,J} has not been previously defined.  --------------------------- Post review comments: I thank the authors for their clear response. I think this paper is a good submission so I would like to maintain my overall score.
