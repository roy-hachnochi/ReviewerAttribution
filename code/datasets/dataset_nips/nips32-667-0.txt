Originality  I think this submission is very original as it aims at combining the physical process or rendering a scene via ray-casting with learning scene representation via deep-learning. This is actually a very natural thing to do, and I'm happy that the authors came up with this idea and made it work.  Quality  This submission is of high quality. The algorithm is explained clearly and the equations make sense. The authors made the effort of re-implementing three other competing techniques and compare their results against them.   Clarity  The authors describe all parts of the system separately and clearly, and explain how to combine them. The equations help to understand how they plug into each other and I am happy with the level of clarity overall.  Significance  This is a good building block that will surely open the door to more complex models combining 3D processed and deep-learning, as well are experiments at a higher scale. I think it is significant and I can see how this work could be extended in the future.
