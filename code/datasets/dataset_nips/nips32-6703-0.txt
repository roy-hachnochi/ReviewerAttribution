Originality: The method (pipelining + smoothing) is derivative. At the same time, I am not certain if the proof techniques are original or not. Overall, I would consider the paper to have low-to-medium originality.  Quality: The paper presents a thorough and important collection theoretical results, and provides excellent insight into the problem setting. There are some issues with the way the empirical results are presented (see the improvements section). Overall medium-high quality.  Clarity: I found the paper well-written and easy to follow. High clarity.  Significance: Although the authors were mostly concerned with the non-smooth, low-sample setting, I find that the paper addresses an important intersection of topics: ML-systems (pipelining), optimization theory, and deep learning. The intersection of these topics will only continue to grow in importance, and work such as this paper is highly significant.
