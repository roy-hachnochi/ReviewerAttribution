I read the author's response which addresses the raised concerns, esp. regarding the general applications and the shown experimental results. I raise my rating to 7.  The theoretical findings and contributions of this work are of general significance and give a nice overview of pipeline parallel optimization for different classes of functions. Further, the introduced PPRS optimization algorithm for non-smooth (and potentially almost non-smooth, e.g. L >>) functions is of general interest to the ML / DL community. However, the major problem of this work is that hypothesized benefits of PPRS are not backed up empirically, e.g. for section 5, and also the experimental section 6 seems unreliable at the current state.  Due to my limited overview over current optimization literature, it is hard for me to judge the originality of this work and especially the proposed PPRS algorithm.  Clarity: The paper is well written and structured. Theoretical concepts and theorems are described in an understandable manner. The figures and tables are also of high quality. Besides the challenges that arise from parallel computing, it seems, that one could easily implement the PPRS algorithm on the basis of the provided descriptions.
