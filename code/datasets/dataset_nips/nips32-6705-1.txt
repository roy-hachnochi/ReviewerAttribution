This is mostly an engineering/empirical paper which simply explores an architecture modification. The paper is clearly written and the idea is fairly straight forward: the authors propose to use LayerNorm without mean centering. As such, the originality is limited. Still, there has recently been a proliferation of different network architectures and especially normalization techniques, so any possible simplification with only minimal performance losses should be welcomed by the community (in the spirit of Occam's razor).  I'm not very familiar with the particular tasks the authors use to compare their method. There is a focus on language models, and this is likely because LayerNorm happens to provide good performance on these types of tasks. But since the paper brings only minimal theoretic contributions to the table, it would be helpful to compare performance on tasks which involve different types of architectures, as well as data (such as images, sound, video, etc.).  EDIT: I thank the authors for their helpful clarifications. I’m still somewhat on the fence about this paper, it mainly representing a fix to an earlier method (it appears the authors of LayerNorm were missing an ablation experiment). However, overall the paper represents a net benefit to the community, which shouldn’t be ignored. I’ll update my score to 7.
