The paper should provide a more thorough comparison with existing results on the characterizations of non-Gaussian random matrices (e.g., binary, Rademacher, etc.). In particular, whether the analytical results in this paper meet or exceed the performance guarantees already available in the literature for several non-Gaussian matrix designs. (This has been addressed in the rebuttal)  Clarity:  * The statement in lines 51-55 does not discuss any dependence of the number of measurements on the signal observed x_0. * The corollaries (1,2,...) should be linked to the Theorems from CGMT to which they are derived from. * The statements in lines 233-234 ("resembles the definition of the Gaussian width") should be more precise. Is (5) the Gaussian width? Or are there differences, and what are they? (This has been addressed in the rebuttal) * In line 247, should the matrix M be normalized so that its Gramian could match the covariance matrix? * In line 307, "Corollary 3 indicates that 3rn measurements...": the result in the corollary is asymptotic, while this statement appears to describe a finite value of n; so the two statements do not seem to be equivalent? (This has been addressed in the rebuttal) * The supplemental material has many broken references (??)  Minor items and typos: Line 39 define acronym iid  Line 59 vec(X) should be vec(X_0) Line 64 should non-negativity be positive (semi)definiteness? Line 67 et al -> et al. Line 185 funtion -> function Lines 251, 253 i.i.d -> i.i.d. Line 272 There is no need to define the assumption within the assumption. Line 301 the later -> the latter
