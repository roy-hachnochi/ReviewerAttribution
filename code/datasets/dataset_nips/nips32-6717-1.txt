Although the approach is somewhat incremental, I believe this is an interesting contribution for a fundamental task. The paper is well presented and experimental results are convincing.  In my opinion the main technical contribution of the paper is given by the fact that the proposed network is able to estimate (at the same time) a repeatability map as well as a local descriptors associated with a discriminativeness confidence map. This leads to descriptors that can be accurately matched with high confidence. This result is obtained by relying on a metric learning procedure based on approximated average precision, which seems novel.
