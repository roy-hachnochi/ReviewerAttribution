This is a well-written original paper. The key intuition of the proposed algorithm is neat. The effectiveness of the algorithm is well supported by theoretical guarantees and experimental results. I think this paper's contribution is sufficiently significant for NeurIPS publication.  One main question is that I wonder how this algorithm performs in noisy subspace clustering. I think that limiting the support set will make the algorithm performing worse in noisy setting. Some experiments with synthetic data will help understanding this.  [Minor comments/Typos] (3) : subject to C_{ii} = 0, ==> subject to C_{i' i} = 0, (9) : min aff ==> max aff? Shouldn't max be upper bounded in the sufficient condition?
