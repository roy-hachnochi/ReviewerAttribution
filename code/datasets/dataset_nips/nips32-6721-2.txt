This paper proposes an incremental algorithm based on a subgradient approximation to select a subsample of the data to improve the computational complexity of Sparse Subspace Clustering (SSC).  The authors show that under standard coherence conditions, this subsampling strategy (S5C) will in fact recover the true underlying union of subspaces in the data, thus improving the computational complexity of SSC without compromising performance.  In addition, the paper gives several experiments to show the effectiveness of their approach.  One of my main concerns is whether the paper is novel/significant enough for NeurIPS.  I am also curious as to the choice of datasets for experiments, some of which are not related to/justified for subspace clustering.  I am also a bit confused. If S5C is indeed running SSC on a subsample of the data, shouldn't SSC (and other variants that exploit the entire sample) do better than S5C (precisely because they are exploiting the entire sample)? It would be interesting to understand why S5C seems to be performing better. I initially thought it was because the parameters were only fine tuned for S5C, but after carefully reading Appendix E in the supplementary material, it seems like the authors did a very thorough and fair job at fine tuning all other algorithms as well. Hence I am curious as to what is the explanation behind this performance improvement -- which could be very interesting; maybe somehow this sub sampling is helping in some other way, for example ignoring outliers, or something like that?  Finally, I think such a thorough review/discussion of SSC, spectral clustering, and some technical definitions could be shrunk considerably.   ---- After Rebuttal ---- The authors have addressed my concerns, so I am changing my score to accept.
