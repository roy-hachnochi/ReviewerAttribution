The contributions in this paper are quite interesting and possibly significant. The paper fits in an ongoing series of developments for the studied problem, and gives a nice contribution. The main issue with the paper is that it feels extremely dry and it is hard to follow at times. Surely in part this limited readability is due to the relatively high technical level and the page limitation, but more intuition could be given to the reader to help them follow the ongoing reasoning, and to ensure that the paper is at least in part self-contained (for example, some intuition on the proofs of Thm 3.1 and 3.2, and Lemma 4.1 would be helpful).
