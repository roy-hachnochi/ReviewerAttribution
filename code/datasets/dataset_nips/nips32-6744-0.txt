In general, this paper is well-written and has important contributions to the machine learning community. Though it does not relieve the factorization assumption (line 260), it indeed provides a potential research direction in the future. I believe this paper should be at least among the top 50% of the accepted NeurIPS papers and would highly recommend this paper for acceptance.
