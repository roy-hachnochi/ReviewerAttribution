EDIT: changed my overall score from 6 to 7 in light of author's feedback.  Positive/negative things +/-: + clearly written + not all tasks are solved - "We plan to release the full task suite within six months of publication." weakens the article as one of its main contribution is this task suite.  Overall a good submission, but I feel like the contribution of the task suite is bigger than the modeling contribution. The delayed release of the task suite a big drawback.  Nitpicks: It is weird to describe IMPALA (Importance Weighted Actor-Learner Architecture) an agent: "it would be almost identical to IMPALA" -> "it would be almost identical to the model in Espeholt et al. 2018." (page 4). I applaud trying to make it better with heatmap coloring, but Figure 5 is still a bit hard to read (I don't mean the font size).
