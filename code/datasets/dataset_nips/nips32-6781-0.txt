The paper seems to address an important computational problem in identifying particular generalizations of the IVs, proposing an algorithm that can be implemented in polynomial time. The importance of this algorithm depends on how useful these generalizations are. The authors mention that they can be applied to arbitrary structural causal models (as opposed to linear SCMs that are commonly assumed in the literature). As these references are relatively new and somewhat specialized, it would be useful for the authors to include a more detailed introduction to these methods, highlighting the main ideas. For example, there is a big gap from the second to the third paragraph in Section 2; also in Definition 2.2.  Another concern is lack of numerical studies to illustrate the importance of the proposed method. Maybe a run time comparison would better illustrate the benefits of the proposed method in realistic settings.
