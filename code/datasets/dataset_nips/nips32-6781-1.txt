As noted above, I find this work to be quite interesting and also quite densely informative. I suspect that, should this paper be accepted, the authors are planning to further extend this work into a longer form. In that case, I would definitely suggest expanding on the examples and the introduction, since this was a challenging read for someone who is not intimately familiar with all of the previous work.  In the future, I would also appreciate the implementation of their suggested algorithm and some simulation comparisons of their work and other existing work. Of course, the worst case scenario is clear from their theoretical results, but I would still be interested to see how these algorithms compare in a simulation.  Minor comments:  - lines 31 and 32, I believe the indexes should be reversed \lambda_ij = 0, that is, whenever x_j is not a direct cause of x_i  - the references sometimes use initials and sometimes full first names.   - line 365 corollary -> Corollary
