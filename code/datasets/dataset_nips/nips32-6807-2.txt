The authors study correlation clustering where the similarity scores are hidden and can only be accessed using a query to an oracle. The goal is to find a good partition of the graph with small number of queries.   The exposition is relatively clean and done in a careful manner. Regarding the results however in most of the results the queries required for the guarantees of the theorem are prohibitively large close to n or n^2 in most cases. I believe this is a crucial problem with the model considered here. I think the model of Approximate Correlation Clustering with using Same Cluster queries by Nir Ailon, Anup Bhattacharya, Ragesh Jaiswal and Approximate Clustering with Same Cluster queries by Nir Ailon, Anup Bhattacharya, Ragesh Jaiswal, Amit Kumar is much more reasonable and there they get guarantees compared to k the number of clusters in the optimum solution that is usually much fewer than n. Given these papers, I think the originality of the query model is decreased and the significance of the results as well. Furthermore, related work is not done in a detailed manner (see below in the Improvements section).  Typos/Comments to improve exposition:  Abstract: When Q = n^2 that the suggested algorithm matches the guarantees of KwikCluster but isn't there an additional O(n) term? What is a quick explanation for that?
