I've read the other reviews and the rebuttal. I still believe that the contribution of the work is significant and keep my score - this is a good paper. I hope that all the minor issues will be fixed in the final version. -----------------------------------------------------  Originality. The proposed method and its analysis are based on previously known generic accelerated framework Catalyst, and generalized it to stochastic setting.  Quality. The paper is basically well-written. It contains a number of theoretical results (with proofs in the supplementary) as  well as experimental section. The part with contributions is a bit repetitive sometimes.   Clarity. The results are well described on a conceptual level, but I would prefer to have more precise theoretical statements (with a definition of all symbols, procedures, etc.), especially in Section 3 (about multi-stage schemes) and in Section 4 (about applicational cases).  Through out the paper, there is a plenty of notation which is used without preliminary definitions (or hidden inside the text). And it probably needs some clarifications (are norms Euclidean? Definitions of mu, L, sigma, ...)  Significance. The results seem significant to me as a part of comprehensive study of stochastic convex optimization methods.
