==================================== Strength/weakness/questions/suggestions: ====================================  1- In line 56, it is mentioned that “we extend the Catalyst approach [34] to stochastic problems,” as the reviewer is aware of Catalyst method, [34] talks about the stochastic problems too, however, not exactly the same as this paper. It would be more clear if the authors clarify more about it.  2- In line 72, eq. (3), the right term, $ \sigma^2 / \mu \eps, can be very big when $\eps$ or $\mu$ (similar to the selected $ \mu $ in the numerical section in this paper) is small or when $\sigma$ is big. It means that the oracle complexity can be huge.  3- In line 126, if $ \tao = 1/(2 t^’) $, then $ \tao $ will decrease, or equivalently, the slower convergence rate. It is suggested that the authors clarify more about it.  4- In Section 4, it is not mentioned how $ \kappa $ will be chosen. In [34], $ \kappa $ is calculated based on a small optimization problem. It is suggested that the authors clarify more about how to select $ \kappa $.  5- In line 139, it is mentioned that “Note that the conditions on hk bear similarities with estimate sequences introduced by Nesterov [41]” however, this is not a good analogy. In [41], the assumptions are valid for deterministic case and it is not the same to say that those conditions are valid for stochastic case too.  6- The assumptions, in lines 135- 138 are strong (in algorithmic view) though the authors talked about some examples in page 4 and 5.  7- In line 154, it is mentioned that “we recover the accelerated rates of of [21]”, however, that conclusion is based on exact minimization of $ h_k$, therefore, it is not true to claim the recovery the accelerated rates of [21].  8- In Algorithm 2, in step 4, why is the assumption $H_3$ still there?  9- In line 185, what is the relation between $f$ and $\eps_k$? According to assumption $H_4$, $\eps_k$ is related to $h_k$.  10- In line 197, it is mentioned that “when $\sigma =0 $...” however, $\sigma =0 $ means zero variance for stochastic case which is an unreal case.  11- The Figure 1 should have legend.  12- The x-axis in the first row of Figure 1 is not clear (the reviewer understands the number of pages are limited, however, the figures and text should be clear)  13- In page 9, the references [9] and [10] are the same.  ==================================== Typos: ==================================== 1- Line 154, “rates of of [21]”, one of the “of” should be erased.  2- Line 246, “Indeed, we may notice that Therefore, even though the”, this sentence is not complete.  3- Line 509 and before line 510, it is needed to put a full stop  4- Line 515, in the second inequality no comma is needed   ==================================== Comments about code: ==================================== 1- That would be better if a “Readme” file was provided how to run the code  2- The codes are well structured specially the file “svm.h” which the solvers are available there, however, it would be suggested to write more comments that the reviewer could follow it easier
