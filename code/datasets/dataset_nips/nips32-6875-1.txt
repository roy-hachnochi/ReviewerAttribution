The idea of the paper is original to the best of my knowledge.  Major references are being cited and the paper does a good job differentiating it from previously published papers.  The paper is technically sound with correct derivations.  Claims are supported by results and theoretical analysis.  The assumption that the embeddings follow a Gaussian distribution seems strong to me, and the limitations of such assumption could be studied by the paper.  Also, the generated images from the embeddings look interesting, but it would be nice to see results where the system fails.  The paper is clearly written -- very easy to follow.  A few details of the implementation are explained in the supplementary material.  The most relevant aspect of the paper is perhaps its significance - the proposed approach has the potential to be used by many researchers in the field given its simplicity and effectiveness.  After reading the rebuttal, I'm still happy with the paper.  I think this paper should be accepted to NIPS.
