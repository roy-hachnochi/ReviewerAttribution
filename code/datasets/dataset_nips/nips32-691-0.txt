This work gives a gap-dependent regret analysis for tabular MDPs. Since most recent works concentrate on the minimax regret bounds of MDPs, it is important but hard to analysis the problem-dependent performance of algorithms. I think this work gives one step for this analysis. The final result involving the sub-optimal gaps is also natural. The paper is clearly written and easy to read. Further, the definition of $gap(x, a)$ seems to be strange for me. For finite-horizon MDPs, it is possible that $x$ has different optimal action at different $h$. Is it possible that there exists a worst case where the $gap(x,a)=0$ for all $x,a$? If so, what will the regret like? The work is organized in a clear way, although there are many notations.  -----  The feedback responds to my questions.
