The idea of training using an adversarial approach, and generating region by region, instead of the whole image, goes towards building robustness on region segmentation. Results seems to demonstrate the effectiveness of this novel approach. The assumption of the paper, that training on partly reconstructed images should yield as good results than training on whole new images, seems intuitive. This is the first work that I aware of, tacking this approach.
