Originality: The proposed framework for unsupervised object segmentation is novel and its the first work using generative models to demonstrate unsupervised segmentation on real world datasets. The design of the segmentation model and the learner is done by combining ideas from prior work.  Quality: The paper is technically sound, and the experimental results show that proposed model performs well on three datasets showing the effectiveness of the approach. However, the evaluation is done in settings with a single fore-ground object, while the described model is for "n" different objects.   Clarity: The paper is well written and experimental details are clearly mentioned.  Significance: The proposed unsupervised segmentation model is shown to be effective on simple single object images. This is a step-up from recent prior work~[14][18], which is largely demonstrated on synthetic datasets. Future work could build on these ideas to extend this to segment varying number of objects on real images.   ------------------------------- Post-rebuttal --------------------------------------- I commend the authors for a well written rebuttal. The experiments with the combined LFW+Flowers dataset was interesting and illustrates that method works with more diverse real image datasets, which is a step beyond recent prior work. I increase my score to 7 and recommend accepting the paper.
