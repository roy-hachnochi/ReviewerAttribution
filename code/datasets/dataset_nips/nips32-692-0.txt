The paper proposes a method that reduces memory consumption of back prop, and as a result allows the use of larger batch sizes. The authors state that this is significant e.g. with batch norm, where batch size matters. In my own experience, I believe this is also significant for improved GPU utilization and data-parallel training.  The paper is original in that I have not seen a similar treatment (although the actual solution may have been relatively straight-forward; asking the right question was an important part of this).  The paper is well written and easy to follow. In Section 3, the paper formally defines the problem as a minimization problem under specified constraints, and then goes on to solve it in Section 4 via BP. I appreciate the systematic approach.  The results are great, with in some benchmarks achieving an up to 50% further memory reduction compared to the baseline method (Chen's). I consider the validation of the method good and convincing.  4.4 "If the solution to the time-centric strategy does not exist, then try the memory-centric strategy next to prioritize memory reduction." I don't understand this. Time-centric refers to the optimal strategy. If that does not exist, that means a solution does not exist. Then why try the other strategy? Section 4.2 is very clear that DP is a correct solution to the problem. So please clarify 4.4.
