First of all, I do believe that the general treatment of arbitrary computational graph is helpful. The authors build the constraints into the algorithm and uses a DP based algorithm to solve the planning under the given memory constraint.  Given that the proposed algorithm generalize beyond what Chen’s algorithm can do, I would recommend the authors to include experiments on models that cannot be handled in Chen’s algorithm. This will help to strengthen paper.  I want to point out that there are related treatment of using a tree decomposition https://medium.com/tensorflow/fitting-larger-networks-into-memory-583e3c758ff9 While I know we are not supposed to treat a blog post as existing literature since blogs are not peer-reviewed, the authors should still try to discuss it and give pointers to the related works.  Finally, although this is a borderline paper, I do think it has some values and might be interesting to NeurIPS audiences.  comment: I have changed the score to marginally above acceptance after reading authors feedback
