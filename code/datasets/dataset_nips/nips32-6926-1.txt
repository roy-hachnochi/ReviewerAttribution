This work can be considered as an extension of UCRL to state representation tasks, where the agent needs to choose an optimal MDP mapping for the ordinary task first and then finds an optimal policy. The originality of this work is not significant, because it mainly extends UCRL to a similar setting. Still, I think it gives a new way and tighter bound for the state representation problem. The writing is clear and easy to understand.  Some details I aim to concern: (1) Can UCB-MS ensure the final model to be a Markov model? If not, does the result still make sense? (2) Is there any discussion about the lower bound for this task? Since the regret bound of UCRL is near-optimal, I think the regret bound of UCB-MS should match lower bounds with respect to $T$. How about other parameters like $S$, $A$ or $\Phi$?
