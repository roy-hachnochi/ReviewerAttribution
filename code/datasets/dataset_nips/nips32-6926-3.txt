In this work the authors studied the online learning problem in finite -horizon RL setting when it also involves the learning of representation space. The paper is generally clearly-written, with several comparisons of performance with UCRL2, BLB and OMS discussed.   Regarding originality and significance, I found the results of UCB-M novel. However, it seems to me that the results are extension of UCRL2 with an addition of representation learning. Also terms such as S_\Sigma in the regret bound in Theorem 4, which indicates the total size of state space of all models and comes from the representation learning part of the problem, may make the bound very loose. Therefore, I'm not really sure how useful the regret analysis is, without seeing some form of lower bound analysis (if possible) or empirical validation.   Regarding the sections of unknown diameter, I appreciate the analysis on the doubling scheme for guessing D, and how its effect is compared with that in BLB. I also see that the authors are trying to address the aforementioned issue of S_\Sigma by introducing the notion of effective size S_\phi, but I am not sure how easy such a term can be derived for general representation classes. Can the authors provide some simple examples of S_Sigma and S_phi (or\min_\phi S_\phi) to illustrate their differences? Finally, the sections regarding the guessing of DS is good, but it seems to be a direct extension of the above results.   In conclusion, I found the significance moderate, but given the low number of work in this field, I think the paper probably still provides some theoretical value to the online learning (for RL) community especially when the underlying Markov model assumption is relaxed and when representation learning is also taken into account.
