   1. Thanks  to the  known surface  map of  the region  controlled by       different  nerves  and  empirically known  relationship  between       various diseases  and corresponding pain regions  it is possible       to  reconstruct a  complete graph  of relations  for this  small       subdomain. The paper proposes a causal simulator with this graph       structure   and  parameters   estimated  based   on  real   data       example. The samples  from the simulator are  evaluated by human       experts  and concluded  to be  more likely  indicators of  known       diseases than the real data.        To demonstrate  the utility  of the simulator  the paper  runs a       comparison of a few well established causal learning algorithms.        The  general idea  is great  and the  authors should  definitely       place their  simulator online and  actively advertise is  to the       interested group  of researchers. However, the  binary nature of       the data  and a  highly specific structure  of the  causal graph       limit the application area of the simulator.        I am not  sure if NeurIPS is the right  venue for presenting the       simulator  although I  understand the  paradoxical feel  of this       statement. Yes causal learning needs the tools like presented in       order to simplify  development. However, I feel a  paper where a       proposed simulator would have  been used to simplify development       of  a novel  algorithm and  demonstrate that  the thus  obtained       approach   beats  the   state   of  the   art   would  be   more       appropriate. Note, I fully support the proposed work and my only       concern is the fit.     2. It would  be nice to see  a layout of the complete  graph as the       partial representation  in Figure 2,  which currently is  a tree       and does  not convey the  sense of possible complexities  of the       proposed model graph.    3. With  the BDeU score, GES  is naturally fit for  the binary data       produced by the  simulator but it is unclear what  test was used       for the PC and FCI algorithms.
