K-means clustering for lines is a natural generalization of vanilla k-means problem, and it has potential in dealing with noise, error and missing information. However, few studies have focused on this problem and most of them are either for special cases or heuristic algorithms. This paper proposes the first PTAS algorithm for this problem with dependency near optimal in data size (linear). And the algorithm can also be easily extended to online cases where data may be distributed among several machines. Detailed proof of important results and codes are provided to inspire more follow-up work in this area.  Overall structure of this paper is fine and easy to follow, but there still exists some confusion. See improvements for details.
