1. Although the space-time graph is not a very novel, however, the proposed recurrent space-time graph is more principled than previous GCN applied on videos. It fits with a network rather being an indepent module.  2. The paper is easy to read and understand. 3. The paper has the potential to be applied widely in video processing community, conditioned on its computational efficiency.  4. I found no obvious faults in this paper. It is evaluated properly.
