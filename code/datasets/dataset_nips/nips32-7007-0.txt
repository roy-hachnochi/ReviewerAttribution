This paper makes a compelling case for explicitly modelling a time varying distribution over the simplex for asynchronous events prediction. This in itself makes the paper a valuable contribution. The use of gaussian process to model the time dependency along with pseudo point from RNN is original, but not particularly well motivated. The authors even mention that an alternative of modeling the time evolution of distribution using RNN directly, which seems like the natural approach to avoid relying on pseudo points. However the two approaches merits and disadvantages are never compared.  The paper is mostly well written and motivates the methodology well, but could do with more various topics such as the impact of UCE vs CE, how training looks in practice, or the choice of many pseudo points to use.
