This paper has the feature of being one of the first (arguably the first) to address the problem of sparse isotonic regression, thus it is not easy to establish comparisons with other works. Moreover, isotonic regression is somewhat a niche area, although important, thus it is not clear what type of impact and significance this work may have.   The paper is quite well written and, as far as I can assess (not having checked the proofs in detail) it is technically solid.   In addition to a simple synthetic problem, the experimental section of the manuscript is focused on a single real-data experiment with gene expression data for cancer classification. One thing that is missing is an explanation of the motivation for using isotonic regression for this problem.    I think the authors did a good job in addressing the reviewers' comments, so I'm keeping my original score 8 ("A very good submission; a clear accept.").
