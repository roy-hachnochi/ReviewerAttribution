The authors focus on the challenge of causal discovery in the presence of unmeasured confounders. This is an important topic within the causal inference literature (and in fact many causal discovery algorithms often assume *no* unobserved confounders, which may often be unrealistic). Whilst some methods have been proposed, they often rely on assumptions such as pure 1-factor models with at least children per latent variable.   The authors propose a two-stage method where they first use theorem 2 to find clusters based on whether triplets of variables satisfy a triad constraint. One important computational/algorithmic benefit of this first stage is that only independence testing (as opposed to conditional independence) testing is required.  Given the clusters, the authors then focus on recovering the causal ordering over latent variables.   The experiments are well executed. My only concern is the absence of traditional methods such as LiNGAM (even though it is misspecified). I would also have liked to see the performance of a very naive method which replaced the cluster finding using the triad constraints with simple clustering methods (eg k means clustering). This would help highlight which stage of the proposed method was really doing the heavy lifting (I would guess it is the first stage).   Overall the paper is original and clearly written. There are some minor concerns regarding the experiments (some basic/misspecified baselines as discussed above would have been helpful).   # minor comments/typos:  - just before section 3: "equation 1)"
