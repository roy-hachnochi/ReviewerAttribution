+ Detailed comments on the methodological and empirical contributions: The experiments lack a simple baseline of using uniform grids as design points of kernel quadrature. It is known that this method attains the optimal rate of convergence for deterministic quadrature in the Sobolev setting: see Corollary 1 of the following paper:  Convergence Analysis of Deterministic Kernel-Based Quadrature Rules in Misspecified Settings https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10208-018-09407-7  Thus, I'm wondering whether kernel quadrature with DPPs can outperform such a simple baseline. If not, what is the advantage of the proposed approach? An obvious drawback of the use of uniform grids is that it suffers from the curse of dimensionality. Thus, another question would be whether the use of DPPs works for for modestly large dimensional problems. This point might need a discussion.   + References for Bayesian / kernel quadrature are not up-to-date. For instance, the following paper, which has been on arXiv for several years and gained a number of citations, is one of the key references for Bayesian quadrature. This paper provides convergence analysis of Bayesian quadrature methods (or equivalent kernel quadrature). The authors will also find other papers on Bayesian / kernel quadrature that appeared in machine learning conferences such as NeurIPS and ICML.  Probabilistic Integration: A Role in Statistical Computation? Statist. Sci. Volume 34, Number 1 (2019), 1-22. https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.ss/1555056025  The following paper is strongly related to the topic of the current paper, and needs a discussion.

Did the authors use the approach of HuszaÃÅr and Duvenaud [17]? If so, this should be explicitly mentioned. The authors mention that BQ does not have theoretical guarantees, but this is a bit confusing. As shown in the above papers, there are several theoretical guarantees for BQ methods.     Minor comments: - The authors mention that Proposition 1 is Proposition 2 in Bach [3], but it seems that this result Proposition 1 in [3]. Also, in Eq. (7), the supremum over the weights w seems to be infimum in the original result of [3].  - The notation should be defined. For instance, where is \mathbb{N}^* defined? It seems that this is the set of positive integers, but I don't think this notation is standard in the literature.   - The Sobolev spaces discussed in this paper are periodic Sobolev spaces (also known as Korobov spaces in the QMC literature), so the authors should mention this.
