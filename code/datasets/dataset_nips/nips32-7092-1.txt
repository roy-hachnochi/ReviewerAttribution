         Originality: the approach is a combination of existing approaches and ideas with a slight modification to enable temporal processing.        Through citation of a large corpus of work the authors make that very clear.         quality: the paper is of high quality and thoughfully written.        I appreciated the detailed evaluation with a thorough ablation study for the model as well as the dataset.          clarity: The paper is well and clearly written. The motivation is clearly stated, and the approach clearly described.         significance:         showing results of a model trained on simulated data that performs on par with models trained on real data is an important contribution.         Various question:        1) Fig 5 is hard to understand and follow. Some images do show detections some dont? Why are some blue boxes empty?         2) The authors mention and compare against the Temporal HMR [35] model - it would be important to clarify the difference to the Motion HMR model. They sound very similar.         3) The paper title is very general about 3D pose estimation. While I agree that insights should be useful for training more general object tracking systems beyond humans, the paper does only show results for human 3D pose tracking. I would strongly encourage a modification to the title to reflect the fact that the paper only deals with human 3D pose estimation.
