Originality: this work is an extension of "Unsupervised learning of visual representations by solving jigsaw puzzles" in 3D point cloud.  The design is pretty natural and the paper has shown 3D design could be even simpler than its 2D counterpart since trivial solutions will not easily appear. The paper also shows through various experiments that the learned feature could be very helpful for different downstream tasks and is quite general for different learning frameworks. The overall contribution is valid yet a bit incremental. The references are ok as far as I could tell. Quality: the paper is technically sound with enough technical details provided. The paper requires prealigned  Clarity: the paper is clearly written and can be easily followed. Significance: self-supervised learning in 3D point cloud is an important problem in 3D computer vision. This paper has adapted an existing approach from 2D image world to process 3D point cloud. The approach is quite simple and natural. The change from 2D images seems quite small and the induced improvement is a bit marginal as well. The experiments are quite thorough though covering different 3D processing tasks and various baselines. I would say the paper has made a valid yet quite limited improvement without too many inspiring points, which would limit its influence in the community.
