This paper is well-written and makes novel contributions to the analysis of the energy landscape of neural networks (although, admittedly, I am not an expert on this topic). The author's results contribute to the understand of the optimization problems to be solved during training and have the potential to foster new convergence results for gradient descent on such problems.   The experimental section is, however, weaker than the theoretical one. It is a little unfortunate that the necessary bound (6) was too difficult to satisfy in practise even on small toy problems such that the numerical experiments cannot confirm the theory. This clearly limits the significance of the findings for practical applications. Nevertheless, the experiments could lead to the conjecture that for different problems (classification with cross-entropy, softmax, batchnorm, etc.) similar properties hold.   The criteria investigated in the experiments, namely convexity along a trajectory, is weaker than convexity of the (high dimensional) energy landscape, and works that have computed the Hessian after the convergence of gradient descent often still report a few negative eigenvalues (e.g. https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.07476). Thus, I am wondering to what extend theory and numerical experiments actually demonstrate the same effect. I this respect it seems unnatural to even deviate from the setting of a regression problem to a classification problem. In any case, I think it would be interesting to consider a network with few enough parameters to actually compute the Hessian and its eigenvalues.   Despite the weak link between the experiments and the theory, I consider the theory to clearly be the main contribution, which is why I see this submission on the positive side.
