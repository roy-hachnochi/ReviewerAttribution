I kind of like this paper.  This is the first theoretical work, at least in my sight, that does not apply any unrealistic assumption and toy architecture of the deep network. The model studied here is both deep and nonlinear, which is something that the society is actually using. If there is no other unrealistic assumption hiding at somewhere I have not noticed, I would give strong credit.  The piecewise strong convexity is a nice and reasonable notation to characterize the network, and something that aligns with my personal conjecture. Too bad, I am not the one to propose and prove it.   The paper is written well and math seems to be solid and clean.  I wonder whether the theory could work to explain some existing empirical findings. E.g. what is the relation of learning rate with the number of layers, and what is the relation with the number of nodes per layer, without the overparameterization assumption. This would make a huge difference if the theory is applied to some nontrivial findings.
