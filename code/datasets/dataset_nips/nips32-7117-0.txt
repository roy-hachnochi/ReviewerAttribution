The major aim of this paper is to provide improved bounds for the sample complexity of the networks. To this end, the authors resort to a technique that takes into consideration the magnitudes of the weights. Even if similar techniques have been used previously in machine learning, the way in which the method is applied in here seems to be new. The novelty stems from the use of the approximate description length in proving the theoretical results. The authors provide a fair interpretation of the obtained results. It is hard to anticipate the impact of these results on the practitioners who are employing networks in their works. It is likely that the results presented in this manuscript to be of interest for other researchers who are focused on theoretical aspects related to neural networks.    ******************************************* I have decided for this submission to keep the same score as in the first phase of the review process.
