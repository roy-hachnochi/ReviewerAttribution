(1) This paper has a very clear presentation. The overall writing is quite good. (2) The convergence proof in this paper is general --- no attacker is specified. Overall, the reviewer feels it is an important and nice theoretical work on adversarial training. This paper may shed lights on future works on designing better or understanding adversarial training. However, these theoretical proofs beyond the reviewerâ€™s domain knowledge, the reviewer is unable to justify the correctness of these math proofs.
