The paper is pleasant to read and presents a compelling innovation which complements GANs. The insight is simple yet powerful with strong potential impact in production systems relying on a quantification of uncertainty and offering the option to reject inputs.  Strengths:   1) The exposition is flawless as is the experimental evaluation;   2) The method is original and simple and yet powerful as shown in the experimental section;   3) The method differs significantly from Defense GAN in a practically critical aspect: it only requires transformation of rejected examples.  Weaknesses:   1) It may be interesting to comment on the added latency when re-processing an input as this may be a major practical problem when using such an approach in practice. For instance, what would be the added computational cost of the transformer in typical cases?
