The proposed method of step size learning for ISTA with fast convergence, as well as the extension to LISTA step size approximation is novel and interesting. The proposed methods are all theoretically grounded, with detailed analysis. The presentation is also clear. The paper can be further improved with more numerical experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of the learned model.
