- Even-sized kernels are rarely used in models for discriminative vision tasks. Based on the results the method can effectively address this problem on image classification tasks including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet.  - Additionally, some results on image generation are demonstrated. Their method consistently leads to a better FID score. - However, it's not evaluated on discriminative tasks like object detection or semantic segmentation where the spatial information is important. - Overall, the method is interesting and effective but simple.
