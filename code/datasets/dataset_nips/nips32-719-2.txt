Originality: Identifying and bringing up the problem of even-sized kernels is a very interesting direction to take. The method proposed in the paper is not very novel: it is in fact quite similar to what's done in [36]. However, I can also see that the authors come to the shift operation from a different direction, with the intention to address the asymmetric padding issue. I'm not aware of any work that address the asymmetric padding issue this way and I think this solution is quite novel.  Quality: The experiments do not fully convince me of the claims made in the paper. More details in "Improvements".  Clarity: the paper is written clearly on the methods and experiments. However the explanations and hypothesis of the "edge effect" and the "erosion" are described quite vaguely.  Significance: If the experiments and results are more solid (if my concerns about experiments can be resolved), I think this would be an insightful finding in CNN architecture design.  Given that the paper has novel motivation and ideas, I'm recommending a score of 6 in the hope that authors can convince me of their claims.
