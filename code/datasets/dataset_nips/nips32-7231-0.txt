The paper considers an elegant new perspective on Kalman Filters, by demonstrating how it might be considered a sensor fusion problem by absorbing the process error as a block diagonal term of the sensor error covariance matrix.   Further, the paper builds on this to formulate time-series data prediction from sensors as a regression based on empirical covariance estimates of the sensor error.   This tool is then used to formulate prediction of flu activity from proxy measurements. The formulation is well motivated and the results are good. The supplement offers further explanation of how covariance shrinkage might be viewed as being within this framework. This particular version yields good results in the use case demonstrated.   Further discussions on how the new formulation can lead to sensor selection (based on significance) are useful, but preliminary.  A minor nitpick is that the authors speculate that non-linear models could have offered further benefits, but do not complete the evaluation.
