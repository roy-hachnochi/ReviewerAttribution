Rebuttal acknowledged, thank you for the additional clarifications. --- Originality: I believe that the findings of Section 2 are well-known given a Bayesian / Gaussian viewpoint of the KF (c.f. [1] and [2]). Indeed, given a flat prior for $x_{t+1}$ (i.e., Gaussian with "infinite" variance), we have two independent observations:  - the influence of the past (prediction term) - the influence of the current measurement (filtering term)  both have Gaussian likelihood. So the posterior density of $x_{t+1}$ is proportional to a product of three Gaussian-shaped terms. The two different ways in which these terms can be folded into each other (using standard Gaussian conjugacy rules) lead to Thm 1. I believe that the linear-algebraic formulation the authors use just hides the fact that we are multiplying Gaussian PDFs in different ways.  On the other hand, I think that the reformulation of Section 3 is less straightforward and perhaps of larger interest. Just like the connection between the KF and linear-Gaussian models opened up many new possibilities, I believe the authors' reformulation may lead to practical improvements, such the ones outlined in Section 5.  Quality: Generally speaking, the paper is sound and rigorous. The experimental evaluation of Section 4 is well explained. The results are somewhat underwhelming: it is not clear that the proposed method does significantly better than competing ones.  I believe that the paper would benefit from having some of the new ideas outlined in Section 5 explored in the flu-nowcasting applications. E.g., maybe adding L1-regularization helps?  Clarity: Generally speaking, the paper is well-written and easy to follow. The supplementary material is also clear and well-structured.  Table 1 is not easy to parse. I would suggest presenting the results in a bar plot instead.  - line 67: "no a process" -> typo - line 87: "intuitive extend"' -> typo  [1]: Faragher, Understanding the basis of the Kalman filter via a simple and intuitive derivation, 2012 [2] Särkkä, S.
