I am afraid that I struggle to see what is new in this paper and what its significance is. As stated by the authors themselves the main result in Theorem 1 “is elementary”, like an exercise for a linear systems course.   There has been quite a lot of work on viewing the Kalman filtering problem as a convex optimisation problem, see e.g.  https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/papers/pdf/rt_cvx_sig_proc.pdf I have a feeling that this view will help the authors a fair bit in developing their ideas further and find relationships with more existing work.   A detail:  I would recommend the authors to reconsider the extremely narrow definition you are using for the word sensor fusion. Sensor fusion is a much wider term, see e.g. its Wikipedia entry https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensor_fusion Academically a lot of research related to sensor fusion is published at the yearly fusion conference https://fusion2019.org/ From just a very quick look at these sites it should be clear that sensor fusion is much broader that the particular linear equation (8) in the current manuscript.
