I thank the authors for their detailed response.  There is another NeuIPS submission whose results supersedes this one (this paper's result is only a corollary of that submission), and I will leave the decision to the AC.   =====   - originality   This paper only deals with the setting where response variables (y), and has to assume that x are sub-Gaussian, and similar results were already established in (Bhatia et al., 2017).  However, (Liu et al., 2019) can handle corruptions in both x and y, although the bound is slightly worse.   - quality   The proofs are sound.  - clarity  The paper is well written.  - significance  There are many papers in this area, and this work has not differentiated itself from other papers.
