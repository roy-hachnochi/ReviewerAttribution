The paper is well-writen, there are a few flaws in notation and typos though, such as:   - (62) rho should map to \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}, since it maps values to 0   - (133) remove paranthesis   - (150) the partial derivatives are somewhat misleading, yet formal correct; i suggest you replace \frac{\partial x_1}{\partial z_i}(z) with \frac{\partial g^{-1}(z)}{\partial z_i}. By equation (6) it is clear, that this is meant, but i find this explicit formulation more comprehensible.   - Figure 5: i think you mean epoch; the caption reads 'epcho'  General comments:   - All figures are too small. Without the ability to zoom, e.g. when you print out your paper, it is hardly possible to comprehend what is depicted.   - the statement in line 153 and below is misleading and also wrong, if one does insist on formal correctness, equation 8 is a tautology: in Euclidean space every Orthogonal is a Perpendicular, and every Perpendicular is an Orthogonal, so this equivalence holds independent of the choice of x (assuming that z = g(x)); what you want to say is: f(x) does not change with z_i in the neighbourhood of z <=>  \langle J_i(z), \nabla f(x) \rangle = 0    - Figure 2 is a bit hard to understand, though very expressive   - in line 218 "sensitivity" is defined different than in Figure 2   - in equation 12 and 13 f_1 and f_2 are defined over [0,1] x [0,1] but in figure 2 we see that z_1 takes negative values - how is the domain of g being determined?  Bottom line: I think this is a good and solid work which, except from the aforementioned flaws, supplies innovative methodology endowed with comprehensive thoughtful experiments, which do not only support the theoretical aspects of the methodology but also show the viability in real-world applications.  #### After reading the rebuttal, I thank the authors for the clarifications and incorporating my suggestions.
