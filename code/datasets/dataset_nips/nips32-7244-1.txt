The paper well structured, easy to read and technically sound. The problem under consideration is of importance in engineering and the proposed solution appears to be a first step towards a new general tool for more efficient function approximation. The use of RevNets in this context is an original and novel idea.  On the other one could argue that the major novelty of this work is a bit shallow (a new problem specific loss function) and that, as the authors admit, use of the method is still restricted to rather specific scenarios.  However, on the plus side, this paper makes headway into a direction of considerable industrial interest and demonstrates the potential of neural networks  beyond their common use cases.
