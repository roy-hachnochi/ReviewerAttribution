The authors use known asociation tests as the basis for their analysis and include existing measures and bleached sentences.  Their primary contribution is the addition of race and a different approach for analyzing contextualized word embeddings (not moving to the sentence level).  They find slight but predictable correlations on known biases across the population splits they analyze and differences between both model sizes and datasets.  This includes the surprising result that larger models appear to exhibit less of the known issues than expected.
