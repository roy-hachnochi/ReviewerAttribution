The authors propose an online version of convex matrix factorization (MF) which cannot be made online by adapting the seminal work of Mairal et al., 2000.They provide an unconstrained and a constrained version of online convex MF. The experiments show the advantages of convex MF over other MF versions as well as the online version of convex MF over the batch version.  The technical parts of the paper could have been written more clearly for a wider audience but it should be ok for experts in the field. The experiments section is clearer and makes a strong demonstration for the proposed method. In general, there is room for improvement in the structuring.
