Originality:  The method is relatively new although it is similar to some conditional GAN works in the literature. The main idea is the analysis showing the limitations of prior GAN+SSL work and in proposing a scheme with better chances of succeeding (at least theoretically). Then experiments show that there is an improvement. It would be good to show more the analogies to prior conditional GAN work, and this would not hurt the contribution, rather it would better clarify its context and provide more links to practitioners (who could better understand it).  ++++++++++++++++++++++ Quality:  There are some inconsistencies that I would like the authors to clarify. Basically, the minimax game should use the same cost function for the optimization of the discriminator, the generator and the classifier. However, as it is evident from the general formulation in eq 1 and 2, this is not the case. It would be good to clarify that this is not a standard minimax optimization.  If we ignore this inconsistency in the optimization objective function, then I still have some considerations that I would like the authors to respond to.  To my understanding the proposed method (eq 11) is also probably not the ultimate solution, as the optimal solution of eq 11 is a tradeoff between the ideal loss (the KL term) and the additional SSL term. Indeed, after eq 11 one can continue the calculations and get to the final optimization function for the generator G. As a first step, the optimal D in eq 8 is the usual one as the second term does not depend on D. Thus, we can plug in the expression for D(x) = pd(x)/(pd(x)+pg(x)) and the expression in eq 11  to eq 9 to calculate the cost function in G. If lambda_g = 1 (and my calculations are not wrong), this expression simplifies in a KL divergence  between (pd+pg)/2 and pd summed to a constant and the second term in eq 11.  This means 2 things: 1) the new objective function in G is not symmetric in the distributions pd and pg (as in the original formulation); 2) because of the second term, the solution in G will be a tradeoff between the GAN objective and the classifier objective. A tradeoff could hurt both objectives and in particular be worse for the GAN objective, which is the one of interest. Could the authors clarify if my derivation is wrong or if my conclusions are wrong with some clear mathematical/logical explanation?  In general, I would make theorems out of major results and some of the theorems in the paper are basic intermediate calculations. For example, Theorem 1 is quite trivial and I would not make a theorem out of a simple substitution.   ++++++++++++++++++++++ Clarity: The paper is clearly written for most part. It clearly has a space problem as it needs space to write down equations and theorem proofs. This is helped by the supplementary material, but I have the impression that more could be written in the theoretical analysis (eg see my comments above on continuing the derivation until one gets to the final optimization in G). The work is probably non trivial to reproduce so sharing the code would be quite important. There are some typos and grammar errors, but they are not too serious. It would certainly help the reader if the authors revised the writing or had a native English speaker revise the text.  ++++++++++++++++++++++ Significance:  The results show that the proposed method is better than [4]. It is always difficult to judge whether this is due to the proposed change or instead to a better tuning and engineering. The authors mention that they also searched parameters for the competing method but they could not replicate the published performance. This makes these experimental evaluations difficult to assess.   +++++++++++++++++++++ I read all the reviews and the rebuttal. We discussed briefly the rebuttal and I decided to keep my score.
