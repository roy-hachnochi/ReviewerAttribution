This paper studies the task of extreme classification with a large amount of target categories. It developed a hashing-based algorithm, MACH. MACH leverage multiple hash functions that each maps the label classes into a small set of groups. Then a classifier is trained and applied for each hash mapping, on the reduced problem with much smaller amount of target classes. The prediction results of the sub-classifiers are then combined to re-constructed the final output. The proposed methods are demonstrated to be both efficient and effective in multiple datasets.  Pros: a simple and efficient extreme classification method. The divide and concur approach works well on several datasets.  Cons: The effectiveness of proposed method seems to be rather data dependent. It works well on ODP but not as much on ImageNet. There is no clear discussion of this divergence. The experimental set up and the motivation of 50M IR experiment are a little supervising. The standard IR approach is not to treat each target document as a target class. It is unconventional to treat the product search task as a multi-class classification task. The application of extreme classification in this setting, which is the main motivation of this paper (as stated in the title and introduction), seems arbitrary. The baseline compared in the production search setting is also rather weak. Only simple embedding-based ones are compared.
