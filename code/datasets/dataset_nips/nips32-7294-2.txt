The paper discusses the analysis of bipartite randomized experiments, where treatment is assigned to diversion units and outcomes are measured on outcome units. The ideas discussed propose the use of correlation clustering to identify clusters of diversion units to benefit the estimation of a treatment effect. A scalable algorithm is provided for the correlation clustering and there is a simulation example to compare the variance of estimates when using other approaches to clustering.  The paper clearly demonstrates the benefits and popularity of bipartite experiments and explains the need for clustering. The level of novelty may be questioned as it is unclear of the benefits of the proposed algorithm versus other algorithms.  There is some novelty to the ideas presented and the algorithm developed would be useful in various applications, but a more thorough explanation of novelty may be required.  There is no conclusion section.
