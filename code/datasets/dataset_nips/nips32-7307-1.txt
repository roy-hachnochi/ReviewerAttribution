The paper should make it clear what exactly is new, and what was previously known in the gossip algorithm community.  The “beneficial effect” of noise is hypothesized, but not verified: please provide evidence for that claim.  Algo 1: this reads as if L6 is blocking, yet the text states the opposite? How does it actually work?  The “directed ring” topology should be describe in more depth, earlier, and justified.  What is a “nominal A2C score” if A2C fails? I also think “convergent” is a really bad term for 50%+ runs, as compared to some baseline.  Steps vs frames: I assume you use action repeat, in which case each environment step is 4 frames? And then the 200M reference number for impala should be 50M steps or 200M frames?  My reading of Fig 1a is that the “stability” results are weak, possibly even inconclusive: under which hypothesis would you have statistical significance?  The mentioned random start action mitigation: did you use that?  There are mismatches between the results in the figures and the table, eg impala on space invaders, a3c on pong, etc: where do these come from?  The shading in Fig 2b is unreadable, and it misses a legend for the absolute scales, as well as an explanation of “peer”.  Spelling: a bunch of “s” missing, eg L44, L87, L88.   ----- I liked the author response, and it addressed a number of my concerns, however R3 also raised some complementary issues to my own, so I think on balance the paper remains borderline, although I'm leaning toward accept.
