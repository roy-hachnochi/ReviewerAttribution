The paper studies a problem of transition matrix estimation for Markov processes uniformly in a sequential resource allocation setting. The paper introduces relevant notions from the theory of Markov chains and the studied performance measure. The authors introduce the BA-MC algorithm based on the optimism in the face of the uncertainty principle. Then they prove bounds for asymptotic and non-asymptotic bounds with asymptotic performance achieving the optimal loss.  Pros: * Detailed analysis for the static allocation scenario * Optimistic bound is based on a new concentration inequality for smoothed estimators * Results utilize both notions of Markov chain spectral gaps for reversible and non-reversible cases * BA-MC achieves the asymptotically optimal loss  Cons: * It would be great to see any practical motivation for the setting, right now it feels like a purely theoretical construct * The performance criterion with true state distributions seems more relevant and less tailored for "convenience", although I agree that the results should carry over to this loss  AFTER FEEDBACK:  Thanks to the authors for the feedback. The paper was already in a good shape, but would benefit from including the mentioned points. I would still recommend acceptance.
