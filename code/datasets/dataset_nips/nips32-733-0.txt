Updated Review: Thanks to the authors for fixing the plots, the intended message of those plots is now much easier to ascertain.  In light of the author response I have decided to keep my review of this work the same, as I believe the authors have successfully demonstrated that the work is of high quality.  Originality: The work builds off of a recently published result, the perception-distortion tradeoff, and shows that the original work was incomplete as it did not take into account the third dimension of the tradeoff, classification accuracy.  Though the idea of a tradeoff between objectives in signal restoration is not novel, the work is a novel contribution and extension to the theory around this important area of research.  Quality: The work is overall of very high quality, with a combination of rigorous proofs, experimental verification, and sound justification for the approach.    Clarity: I find the plots in figure 3 to be difficult to easily ascertain the fundamental idea from (though with some effort I understand what they are conveying).  I recognize the authors attempt to recreate the plot style from the original perception-distortion paper.  Perhaps the authors can find a more intelligible way to break down the many dimensions being displayed in those plots.  The paper is otherwise clear and well argued.  Significance: The paper strikes me as an extremely significant followup to a recent paper, and relevant to a wide audience at NeurIPS as signal restoration is a topic of high interest, especially in safety critical domains.  Better knowledge of these fundamental limitations and trade-offs will help many engineers design for the correct objectives for their applications.
