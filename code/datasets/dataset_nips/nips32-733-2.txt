This work is a novel extension of the preceding distortion-perception tradeoff in image restoration tasks. The practicality is enhanced by incorporating analysis of classification errors in related tasks.  The claims of this work are technically sound and supported by comprehensive analysis and the experiments. The proof is straightforward and clear. Analysis on the toy example gives solid evidence to support the claim. The overall structure of this paper is clear and easy to follow. Most parts of this work are clearly explained.   Issues: - There seems to be an ambiguity between the proposed CDP tradeoff and the discussion in section 4. Specifically, the described CDP suggests that classification error and perceptual naturalness cannot be simultaneously optimized. Yet, in section 4 (line 247-251), the authors also suggested a positive correlation between the classification error rate and "subjective" feeling. This is confusing as it implies the opposite to the original argument. The authors might want to provide a clarification about the statement in section 4 to avoid confusion.  - Visual analysis of the experiments can be more thorough. The authors only provided visual results to compare the classification-perception tradeoff with some analysis. While this is not a major concern, it would be more informative if the authors can also provided similar comparisons for distortion and classification. The analysis on visual results can also be more carefully formulated, such that the results can pose a stronger argument. ---------------- I have read the author rebuttal and other reviewers' comments and I tend to recommend this paper. It will be great if the authors can provide more analysis and experimental results beyond MNIST.
