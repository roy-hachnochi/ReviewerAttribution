Originality: this work is a combination of know methods with a completely new analysis on how to tune the parameters. Furthermore, in order to use the theory to estimate the parameters, the authors proposed a method based on Riemannian geometry. However, some related work should have be cited like [1-5] where there is indication on the guarantees of recovery and the complexity of the problem.  Quality: the RPCA part is sound. However, the Riemannian geometry part is confusing. Some part of the proposed method (section 5.2) seems difficult to implement without more information. For example, how to pick pairs (at a given distance) on the manifold ? How the geodesic distance is truly computed ? These part are hidden is the proposed algorithm page 6. Moreover, I would have expect some clues about the guarantees of recovery (not necessarily a theorem).  Clarity: most of the paper is well written. Still some parts lack motivations. For example at section 2, the presentation of the problematic is too fast and one key idea (the construction of the patches) is a little hidden on the text and lacks motivations (and citations like [6]). The section 5, which is perhaps the most important, is difficult to follow and some crucial information are missing such as how to pick points on the manifolds (a little algorithm could useful). In section 6, again some details are missing, for example equation (15) is not trivial to compute written this way.  Significance: principal component analysis is one of "classical" analysis tool with dealing with data. This method proposes a robust framework able to deal with spurious data and the manifold regularization allows a good reconstruction. This is very important when looking for trends with PCA.
