From a quick reading, it seems like a solid paper and a reasonable contribution. A better justification/stronger experimental results for the sparse noise model would improve the paper. I did not verify the details of the theoretical analyses.   Line 246: "Embeddin" --> Embedding Laplacian Eigenmaps is used and discussed but not cited. A citation needs to be added.
