[I have read the author response; no change in score as my confidence is the limiting factor]  In eq (3), it seems to me that "m" was not introduced - it is only in words defined later.  As I was reading the result, I was thinking about this question:  "What is the number of samples needed for optimal rates, if the communication network is fully connected graph?"  This is an interesting special case, which should be implied by existing work, probably worth highlighting in the paper. How does that special case compare to the presented result? I imagine there is a gap. If so, this would open another point for future directions - presented are two extremes - but how does the threshold depend on network topology?
