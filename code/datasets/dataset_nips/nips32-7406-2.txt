(Originality) Although the use of partial identification bounds for policy learning is not new (Kallus and Zhou 2018; the authors should cite this), yet its use in online decision making is innovative. In particular, the proposed approach to combine partial identification bounds and upper confidence bounds is elegant.   (Quality) The proposed method is well developed and the theoretical analysis is thorough. For the empirical evaluation, I think the experiment description is quite terse (especially for cancer treatment) and it may be hard to reproduce the results according to the descriptions alone. The appendix adds some details but making it more complete and clear can be very helpful (e.g., introduction of the dataset, definition of the treatments, how to introduce confounding, etc.). Moreover, in the experiment, I suggest the authors also evaluate the Causal UC-DTR algorithm with $M_t^c$ replaced by confidence bounds learnt from the observational data (as opposed to the bounds from the observation data that incorporate both partial identification and confidence bound). This would show the benefit of taking the confoundedness of the observational data into consideration.
