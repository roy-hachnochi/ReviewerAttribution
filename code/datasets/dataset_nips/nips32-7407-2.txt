1. It's original that this paper proposes a second order ODE that allows modelling the latent dynamic ODE state decomposed as position and momentum.  2. It's original to connect second order ODEs and Bayesian neural networks with VAE models. 3. The paper is well written and organized. 4. The method proposed in this paper can be applied for high-dimensional sequential data and learn the embedding of high dimensional trajectories.  5. The proposed methods are evaluated on a diverse of datasets with state-of-the-art performance.
