The paper introduces a novel notion of fairness. This new notion of fairness and its motivation are clearly explained; in particular, the paper provides a clear explanation of the settings in which this notion is applicable, including a honest discussion of when it is NOT applicable (this reviewer wishes more papers in the field did this).  This fairness definition is well-motivated and elegant, and it introduces a conceptually novel perspective to ML fairness. To me, it seems likely that this work will have a significant influence on future research in the ML fairness field.  The paper also provides a theoretical analysis of envy-free classification, focusing on generalization results. These results are elegant and nontrivial.  The paper also includes preliminary results about the computational problem of performing envy-free ERM. The proposed heuristic is nontrivial, but considerably less elegant than the theoretical results. The experimental results give evidence that the proposed heuristic performs reasonably well, but do not compare the proposed methods to any nontrivial baselines (the only comparisons are to the optimal and the random classifiers).  The paper is very well written overall, even if sometimes it seems to use more notation than necessary. (E.g., the paragraph starting with "Formally," in Section 4 does not seem to provide much value; the intuitive explanation in words is completely clear and much easier to read than the formal definition.)  Overall, this is a very strong paper that should be of interest to the entire ML fairness community.
