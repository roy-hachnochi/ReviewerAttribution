The paper offers an interesting, original notion of envy-free fairness that is well-studied in other disciplines such as sociology, psychology and economics, and applying it to machine learning. The paper is well-written and easy to follow. It offers nice technical results on generalization for simple classifiers given the fairness constraint as (a,b) envy-freeness.    While the paper offers a new notion of fairness, it does not discuss in details its justification and relationship with existing studies in other disciplines, but rather taking it as a premise of the paper. It also makes a very strong assumption of the existence of a particular form of utility function u(x, h(x)). Both of the two choices undermine the validity and usefulness of the results in the paper.
