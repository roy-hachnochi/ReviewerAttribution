This paper proposes the Adaptive Spectral Partition algorithm for stochastic block models. To the best of the reviewer's knowledge, this adaptive approach is novel for asymptotically exact recovery in the SBMs. Additionally, the authors have showed that compared to regular sampling, this adaptive sampling approach allow one to recover the clusters in a larger regime. The result is interesting to me. Does that imply one is "wasting" some information by using random sampling?   The main results seems tight. The authors compare their adaptive sampling algorithm to the regular clustering algorithm on the symmetric SBM with two clusters experimentally.  The paper is well written and easy to follow. The proofs employ hypothesis testing, and connect its error rate to the log-likelihood ratio of two constructed models.  Overall I believe the paper is a good contribution to the SBM literature.
