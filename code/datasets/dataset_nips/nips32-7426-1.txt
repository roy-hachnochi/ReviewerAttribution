In the paper titled "Recurrent Kernel Networks", the authors proposed a new method to model the gaps in comparative sequence analysis. The new method is termed Recurrent Kernel Networks, which essentially can embed sequences as points in RKHS, and leverage the training strategy of RNN. Overall, this is an innovative paper. The paper is also well organized. My only question is that in the original CKN paper, CKN was used to train DNA sequences (similar to DeepSEA), why the authors in this paper did not apply RKN to the same task?
