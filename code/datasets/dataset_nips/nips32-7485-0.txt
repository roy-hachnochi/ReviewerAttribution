This paper investigates structured regression tasks with generalized loss functions. It places a number of existing loss functions (e.g., quadratic, Huber) as special cases within the class of elliptical losses. The problem and formulation are well motivated and clearly described.  The approach is demonstrated on synthetic data to show that as the data generating distribution becomes more heavily tailed, the robust estimation is more beneficial. Only one comparison loss (Tyler) is shown in the interest of readability, but it would be nice to show that at least one of the other robust losses (e.g., Huber) also has a benefit. In addition (or in lieu of the additional comparison), the connection with line 138 might be emphasized in the experiment section.  The other experiments (stock market and river discharge) are more compelling and demonstrate the advantages in diverse application domains.   Overall, I think this is a solid paper with no obvious weaknesses.
