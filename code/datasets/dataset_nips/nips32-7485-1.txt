[originality]  I believe there is a clear novelty in the proof of global optimality of all stationary points for some important elliptical losses and linear structured models while the part of proof (e.g. Lemma 1) is incrementally built on previous work.  [clarity] While the problem is well-motivated and formulated clearly, there are some parts in the paper that are not clear. 1. Based on related work, itâ€™s hard to contextualize their work in the existing literature. The readers may have the following important questions.     * How does the existing literature for unstructured elliptical losses connect to your work?      * What is the main difference in discovered theoretical characteristics of unstructured elliptical losses from that of structured ones? 2. It lacks the reason how the proved global optimality leads to more efficient optimization while this is claimed as one of their main contributions. A clear explanation is needed for this.  [significance] 1. This work is significant in that they provide optimality proof that leads to more efficient optimization method for a wide range of robust elliptical losses including Gaussian, Generalized Gaussian, Huber, etc. They still need to clarity how optimality result in critical points enable more efficient optimization. 2. However, they did not present the comparison between their efficient optimization algorithm and less efficient one under the same robust loss function, which leads to empirical justification for more effective optimization method and the practical impact of their optimality proof.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Overall, I think this is an interesting paper and the authors did contextualize how significant this work is to the related work in their response and am changing the score.
