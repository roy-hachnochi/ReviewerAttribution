The paper proposes a method to adapt an existing landmark detector using an unsupervised objective to discover landmarks on new categories of objects. In particular, It uses a projection matrix to adapt the network. Experiments are performed on the face, cat head, and shoe datasets.   The idea of using the knowledge in an existing landmark detection is interesting, and the experiments show that the method works to some extent.   However, the technical novelty of this paper is not very significant. It is a relatively straightforward combination of existing unsupervised landmark learning and domain adaptation methods. The domain adaptation is done in a general way, which is not specific to the landmark discovery problem. A relevant question (not a con itself): is it possible to adapt an image classification or object detection model to unsupervised landmark learning?  In Table 1, the proposed method is not consistently better than the previous methods and the baselines. It is discouraging that using a pretrained network led to worse performance than the previous work, who trained the model from scratch.   In the remaining of the experiments, comparisons are done only with the two baselines. For example, the consistency metric (which is interesting) is not tested on previous methods.  It will be interesting to see fine-tuning with proper learning rate after matrix projection.  It will also be interesting different how different pretrained network can impact the final landmark discovery performance.
