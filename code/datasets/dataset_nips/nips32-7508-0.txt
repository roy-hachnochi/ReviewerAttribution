4 ) Originality: The work is highly original and I believe it could lead to novel RL algorithms in the future.  Quality:   5) The artificial tasks are well-designed to highlight the strength of RUDDER i.e. agent must be able to attribute reward through time in order to solve the task.  6) I would like to see comments comparing RUDDER to generalized advantage estimation (GAE). GAE can also be interpreted as reward shaping.  7) I would recommend using PPO in combination with GAE as a baseline. I don't think it will substantially change the results, but it will be a fairer comparison and the two works are often coupled.  Clarity:  8) The paper is clear and the appendix looks exhaustive. I think the experiments could be reproduce using the paper.  Conclusion:   9) I think this work is a very valuable contribution to the field. The main caveat for which I do not recommend the acceptance at the moment is that the work omits to mention and use the GAE baseline. I would like to hear the authors comments and would be happy to increase my score if they provide sufficient explanations for not including this baseline.
