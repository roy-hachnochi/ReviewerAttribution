Originality: The task is not new. But the paper did combined the normalizing flow to graph neural network in a new way. Related works are cited. Quality: The paper showed many results to support their model. They compared their method with several existing method and showed that their method is either better or as good as other methods. However, the results for the generative task seems to suggest that their method is not comparable to graphRNN on at least one task(community-small) and they didn't try to analysis that. Also they claimed that their method has better memory usage but didn't provide any quantitive results to show that. Clarity: The paper is well organized. Related works are introduced in detail.  Significance: Good but results are on small datasets. To have better impact and to really support their memory advantage claim they need results for large graph.
