The paper introduced a graph formulation of normalizing flows. The model is clearly presented and justified.   The numerical experiments are less convincing than the presentation of the model. The results are marginally better than the baselines. The baselines are also not the SOTA techniques as for example the QM9 molecule regression results or semi-supervised graph clustering techniques.   An advantage of normalizing flows is to reduce the memory footprints of GNNs, but this is not illustrated in any large graph problems. Also, what is the speed/complexity of GNFs compared to GNNs?
