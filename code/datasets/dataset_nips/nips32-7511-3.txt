The paper is novel on bridging fields between normalizing flow and graph neural networks, but all the sub-parts are not novel. This work provides diverse experiments. However,  every task is very simple and no significant performance boost on any of them. The improvements on the supervised tasks are very marginal compared to vanilla GNN. Over simplified dataset on Density estimation which is an important application. No experiments on other density estimation benchmarks. Graph Auto-Encoders part is not core contributions, but some engineering implementation.
