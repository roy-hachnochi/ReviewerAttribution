The paper is well written and strikes a balance between theory and practice.   I find Fig. 2 very clear but Fig. 1 not so clear as the first figure of the paper: Should add bottom row=explanation maps, and mention adversarial maps, present a proof of concept of bad manipulations in practice, etc. Revise caption.  I would prefer a different title like "Adversarial explanations depend on the geometric curvature: Better smoothed than manipulated"   In eq. 4, you mean a minus and not a plus for gamma>0? If so, please explain why.  line 65: states pointwise multiplication for symbol  Can you describe more what is the effects of clamping at each iteration, and why not clamp after a few iterations?        line 137: Hyperplane -> Hypersurface  Say that 2nd fundamental form is also called embedded curvature and may be state that 1st fundamental form is metric tensor.    After line 150, remove second minus (inner product is non-negative)  I like fig 19 of SI  Talk about manifold foliations in general?  Minor edits: \mathrm{adv}  Upper letter in bibref 7 and 16
