         I quite enjoyed reading this paper.          I do want the paper to include a brief discussion about the difficulties of training robust classifiers on large datasets.  Are there any schemes to mitigate these difficulties?  If such difficulties persist then the purposed approach would not really replace our reliance upon GANs.  GANs are tedious to train, but at least these work really well.          For image generation and image-to-image translation: I noticed that a number of generated images are very noisy.  Some of the images seem blended from multiple images.  Is it a deficiency in the method?  Is it due to lack of training?  Or is due to a lack of access to data?          For inpainting:  I assume that your method can work in situations where multiple non-overlapping regions are missing?          I think that the proposed approach has a lot of promise.  Some of the figures presented in the paper, however, doesn't do a good job of convincing a reader that the proposed method will eventually beat the performance achieved via using GANs.
