Originally: The ideas presented in the paper are original.  Quality: The theoretical and experimental analysis seems to be properly conducted. However, as the non-normal approach is compared to the performance of the expRNN and LSTM, comments should be added, how the asymptotic (in number of units or parameters) runtimes of the different approaches compare. Especially the runtime of optimizing P (line 187-189) should be clarified.  Clarity: The paper is clearly written.  Significance: Solving the proplem of vanishing and exploiding gradients is of large importance and at the same time a very difficult endeavor. Extending the orthogonal RNN approach and fixing its problems is one way to tackle this problem. The paper contributes novel theoretical ideas towards fixing this problems. The experimental improvement seems rather small and thus the immediate significance is probably limited. However, this work might be a step towards solving the vanishing and exploiding gradient problem.   _____________________  After reading the author feedback and reviewer discussion I increase my score to 6. I think overall the paper has strong contributions and valuable insights, though tackling a hard problem. However, I ask the authors to state the asymptotic runtime of the proposed algorithms in the final version of the manuscript. I think it would be very bad to hide the O(n^3) runtime from the reader.
