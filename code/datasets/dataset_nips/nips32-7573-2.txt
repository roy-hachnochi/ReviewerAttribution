The paper is well-written and technically sound. As mentioned below, the significance is less clear as the kernel assumption is not well justified.  Detailed comments: (1) Page 2, Table 1: Just based on what is in the table, it is really unclear how GP-MW improves over EXP3. The setting of EXP3 and GP-MW are different in several aspects and it is unclear which one of the differences causes the difference in regret bound. For example, what is the optimal regret bound of EXP3's setting plus kernel assumption? And what is the optimal regret bound of GP-MW's setting without the kernel's assumption? To make a fair comparison between EXP3 and GP-MW, the authors can also talk about how GP-MW performs when all opponents have only 1 action to choose from and there is no kernel assumption. (2) The authors do not spend enough effort to justify why the kernel assumption makes sense. Do most forms of games have this property? Not everyone is an expert on this assumption and it is really hard to judge the result without further justification of the assumption. (3) In the regret definition in this paper, a_t^{-i} is a fixed sequence. This mean the paper does not consider that other players are using adaptive strategies and chosen actions can affect other players' actions. It would be better to make this clear.  (4) Line 170: Is the improvement mainly because of the kernel assumption?  (5) In the experiments, although some part of the data is from real-world, the rewards are generated using kernels. So the experiments also don't justify the kernel assumption.   I have read the author response. "The Kernel assumption is standard in kernelized literature" does not sound like a good justification for the assumption. I agree that it is technically convenient. I would hope the authors can provide more justification from game theory perspective, i.e. showing examples of games which are standard in game theory and work well with the kernel assumption.
