The authors tackle the label ambiguity in the Bayesian mixture model setting, by considering quotients of group actions on the labels that preserve posterior likelihoods. A numerical algorithm for computing barycenters in the given latent space is then devised, by viewing the computation of a quotient metric as an optimal transport task.   The paper is well written and the exposition is clear. Notably, I enjoyed the general theoretical framework provided, which is then specialized to the finite mixture model setting. Although the experimental section is quite limited, I think the framework itself makes up for it as a contribution worthy to be published. However, I encourage the authors to provide more convincing experiments.  The problem of ıGı getting large quickly is acknowledged by the authors. Perhaps a simple approach to this that the authors could try, is to randomly sample elements of G for the barycentric problem and carry out a stochastic gradient descent on this level too?   Specific remarks: - Line 125: I might have missed it, but is the notation S_K defined prior to this part? - Line 131: The relation looks more like equivariance than invariance. Perhaps \pi(g x, g y) can be shown to be \pi(x,y) based on the group invariance of \nu_1 and \nu_2? - Line 140: I believe the push-forward notation of \Omega with respect to p_* should be used - Line 229: Are you referring to the map \sigma that minimizes (5) here? - Line 230: Bold face p notation is not defined until line 234. - Line 266 Exponential map: The 2-Wasserstein exponential map for spd matrices is given by Exp_K(v) = (I + v)K(I + v), and the logarithm given by T^{\Sigma_1\Sigma_2} - I. The exponential map here looks more related to the exponential map under the affine-invariant metric for spd matrices. Additionally, the gradient is written to be taken with respect ot \Sigma_1, although it should be with respect to L_1 as written in Muzellec & Cuturi (2018). If the gradient is with respect to \Sigma_1, then the expression should be (I - T^{\Sigma_1\Sigma_2}) without the L_1. -Table 2: Missing a dot.
