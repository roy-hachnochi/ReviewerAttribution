The idea seems interesting. It is aligned with the recent wave of studying standard versus robust accuracy; and focuses on a specific, relatively less noticed problem field (compression).   The loss of robustness was overlooked in most CNN compression literature. This paper addressed it well and would bring in new insights.   The authors also spent much effort into exploring different settings of model compression and adversarial training, which is appealing in revealing the relationship between the two aspects.  The writeup is mature and clear to follow; the literature review of robustness-compactness relationship (Sec 1.1) is very thorough and interesting.
