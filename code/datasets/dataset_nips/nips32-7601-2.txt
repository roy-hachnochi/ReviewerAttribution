This is a very well written paper and enjoyed reading it. The motivation is clear, the authors describe problems that arose with the Dirichlet prior in a VAE setting and how they have been circumvented in reference 12. They propose that circumvention was necessary because of the otherwise intractable inference procedure. Being able to utilize the reparameterization trick und thus cheaply arrive at gradient updates enables them to recreate the described model in a more principled and rigorous way. They describe a stick-breaking construction for the new type of simplex distribution and how this initially leads to strong dependence on component ordering. Their solution to this is both straight forward and compelling. They conclude with thorough experiments, demonstrating the usefulness of their approach and showing the benefit of having access to closed form gradient updates in terms of smaller error rates. In all, I have very little to criticize, this is well executed and presented research and may have a large impact on VAE applications that are henceforth not limited to Dirichlet priors when modelling multivariate random variables.
