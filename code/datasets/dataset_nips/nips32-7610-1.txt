I don't have any major technical criticisms of the paper. However, I didn't feel that the experimental results really highlighted the advantages of this approach. Specifically, the authors never compare against any other method for solving POMDPs. I think this is necssary for making a compelling case for this method. Is it more sample efficient, more computationally efficient, more flexible?  The links to neuroscience are very intriguing to me (as a neuroscientist), though I fully understand that the authors don't really have space to explore them. Nonetheless, one possibility might be to focus more on these applications instead of the toy experimental results. Then the impetus for demonstrating computational superiority over other methods is replaced with an impetus for demonstrating that this model can explain aspects of neural computation (e.g., in the hippocampus) that alternative models cannot.  Minor:  p. 3: "set features" -> "set of features"  There seems to be inconsistent indexing of various quantities (e.g., M, V, T) by the policy pi.  --------------  Comments after rebuttal:  I was already quite enthusiastic about this paper. I don't think it's necessary to increase my rating. I'm happy that the authors are interested in providing more neuroscience context for their ideas.
