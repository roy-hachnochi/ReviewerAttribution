The paper present a POMDP continuous approximation scheme for the RL successor representation, relevant when states are not known but must be inferred, allowing for a realistic learning algorithm in-between model-free and model-based RL. I am not aware of anyone having attempted something similar, clearly a very original submission.  This is a dense paper (in a good way) with a lot of vey interesting results. The density meant that some of the results were a little hard to follow, but I do not doubt the importance of these results. This should be of relevance to a large proportion of NeurIPS attendees.  After author response: I still think some more details on simulations would have beneficial, and I am not sure how much more the authors' response really adds, but I am still excited about this paper.
