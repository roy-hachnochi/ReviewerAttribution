Disclaimer: I am not in the CV and NLP field and not sure the proposed language can include every thing we want to search in the applications.  This work proposed a unified language for search space definition. To the best of my knowledge, this is original work and in my opinion also important as the search space in the NAS field is much more complicated than the normal HPO/BO cases.  The overall quality is quite good. However, I have some minor concerns in the search algorithm experiments: Now the "optimize" in Algorithm 4 only pick one from 256 random generated architectures. I agree this is a valid comparison but how many architectures the original search algorithm papers used? How easy it is to implement a new search algorithm in this framework?  The paper is written clearly but I think more comments in the Algorithm 1 and 2 can help. It would also be nice to see a comparison of search space definition using the proposed language and the definition in their original paper.   I do think this is a significant work on both methodological and empirical side.  After reading authors' response ======================== I changed my score to 7.
