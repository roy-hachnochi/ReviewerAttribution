        The paper is modestly original, high-quality in the experiments and analyses performed, written clearly enough (some improvements will be suggested below), and of modest significance.          The NC block is an improvement over the SE block, and likely was developed with SE block as the main motivation.         As such, a more thorough explanation of SE block decision and how NC block decisions contrast with it would be nice to include, and make the theoretical contribution clearer.         The "algorithmic" novelty of the NC block feels modest, but could be improved with better explanation of the motivations behind its development and specific choices made.          Experiments and analyses are sufficient and of high quality.          What they show is that the NC block is usually but not always a modest improvement of the SE block.         That does not feel very significant to practitioners.
