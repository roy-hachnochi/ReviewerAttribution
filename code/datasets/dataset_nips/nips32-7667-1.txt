This paper studies the problem of process approximate nearest neighbor search with memory and SSD, and propose a graph-based index and search algorithm named Rand-NSG. It can hold a billion points searching on a normal workstation with a cheap SSD.  However, there are some concerns: (1). The point of novelty is not strong enough, because the sub-ideas are all existing techniques in other existing researches (e.g. beam search, product quantization), and making previous NSG method SSD-friendly is an incremental work. (2). In Figure 3, it is not enough to only see the distance comparisons between different methods. The runtime of comparison is not the only factor affecting performance. Other overheads should be considered as well. The experiment of "Recall-Queries per second (1/s) tradeoff" should be added, like in https://github.com/erikbern/ann-benchmarks/.  Other minor typos: (1). page 2 line 80: "the number the number of random" -> "the number of random"
