This paper proposes a novel conditional computation layer, CondConv, to increase model capacity of ConvNets, while achieveing high efficiency at inference. The CondConv layer can be used as a drop-in replacement for existing convolution layers in CNN architectures. The implementation is quite simple and can be viewed as a complement for current techniques to improve model’s performance. Experiments have been conducted on multiple datasets, providing adequate evidence to demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed method. However, the proposed module is only tested on two network architectures, namely, MobileNet and ResNet. Whereas the whole paper is well-organized, there is some confusing conclusions that need to be clarified, e.g., the conclusion in section 5 “This agrees with empirical results in Table 4, which show that CondConv blocks at later layers of the network improve final accuracy more than those at earlier layers” remains questionable.
