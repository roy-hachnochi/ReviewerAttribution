Overall the paper is quite well written and convincing. The claimed rigorous results are not proven at all in the paper but proofs (which are based on known techniques, in particular developed for ML problems by recent works including some by the authors) are provided in the SM. Still I think that it would have been nice to give hints on how the proof works at least at a high level, just to convince the reader not keen to read the SM, or as an introduction for the more mathematically inclined one. The results are strong, the studied model is relevant despite being simple enough for complete analysis. The results in terms of ODEs/PDEs/SDEs are a bit harsh and do not give much insight by themselves (the equations are quite complicated) but the authors then provide nice numerical experiments to back up the results, and meaningful interpretation of the observed learning regimes, which I find very nice and enlightening. The paper is of high quality. Still there are a number of typos that should be corrected. I recommend acceptance.  Update: I have read the authors' rebuttal and taken it into account.
