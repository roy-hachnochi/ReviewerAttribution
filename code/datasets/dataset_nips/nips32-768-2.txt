Originality: The idea of integrating symbolic methods and neural networks to 1) learn better representations or 2) perform better search is not new. In this light, I would like to see a brief discussion of End-to-End Differentiable Proving, Rocktäschel and Riedel, 2017; this work also proposes a “neural” approach to perform backward chaining. (The authors *may* also consider going through the notation used in the paper to improve the clarity of the preliminaries section). Having said that, I think the work is still interesting, proposing a neat straightforward algorithm to perform planning.  Quality: The paper is technically sound and is reasonably grounded in previous literature.  Clarity: The paper is well-written and easy to understand (see below for minor comments on notation and typos) Significance: The work addresses an important challenge — that of building better reasoning systems — by integrating neural and symbolic methods to achieve best of both worlds. Apart from being a reasonable and grounded approach, RPNs also perform well experimentally on unseen goals and so, can be of general interest to the community.
