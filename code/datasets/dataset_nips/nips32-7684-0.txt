This work considers causal inference in the presence of unobserved confounding and studies the case where a proxy is available for the unobserved confounding in the form of a network connecting the units. This is an important problem and applying embedding to causal inference seems a natural way nowadays.   The novelty lies in using a network proxy to estimate the unobserved confounder. The theoretical results build upon Chernozhukov et al and modified to allow for the use of the full data in the embedding training.  The paper writing seems rush to me. There are a few issues/confusion here: 1) Page 3, Section 2. Embedding methods. Anonymous [Ano] 2) Page 3, last paragraph in Section 3, what is \hat{\eta}_n? 3) Page 3, Equation in Example 4.2, what is \sigma?
