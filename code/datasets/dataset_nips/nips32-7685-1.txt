This paper proposes using the polynomial representation for the trees. The main contribution of the authors can be summarized to the theoretical analysis, model pruning, and interpretation of the mentioned representation.  In the theoretical analysis presented in the paper, the authors introduced a theorem to define the equivalence of the tree ensembles with the same set of conditions and polynomial representation.   Also, an optimization problem is formalized for converting polynomial form back to tree ensemble.  However, later for simplicity, a greedy algorithm is proposed to convert the polynomial form to the ensemble of symmetric oblivious trees.   Based on PolyTree representation, a model reduction strategy is proposed in which the weight of the monomials with (defined) quality lower than a threshold is set to zero. Finally, an illustrative experiment and a theoretical justification are presented to show the ability of the presented model for feature importance.    The main idea presented in this work, a novel polynomial representation form for the decision trees, is interesting.  Mainly because it can open new avenues to understand and interpret the tree ensembles in general. The paper is easy to read and well organized.  However, I have some concerns related to the experimental results presented in section 4.
