The authors propose an approximation algorithm for computing the optimal transport that improves the time complexity of the best known comparable algorithm by a polylog factor and is efficient in practice. The paper provides a comprehensive review of the related work and puts the result well into context. The paper is generally well-written. However, comprehending the technical part requires familiarity with graph algorithms for flow and assignment problems and could probably be clarified. To satisfy the space limit, some proofs might be moved to the appendix. The result is obtained by a combination of classical scaling and primal-dual optimization techniques. The strength of the paper is its theoretical analysis. The approach allows for efficient implementations, which is demonstrated by the experimental evaluation. However, the experimental evaluation is the weakest part of the paper and compares the algorithm to the Sinkhorn method only. A comparison to other methods for the same problem would be desirable.
