The authors proposed to minimize a local linearity measure of the loss function (defined in Eq. (6) as the difference between tangent hyperplane and loss function) along with the empirical loss in the adversarial training. By doing so, one could avoid the so-called "gradient obfuscation" problem associated with few iterations of gradient based optimization of inner maximization in adversarial training. This leads to significant speedup of adversarial training, while achieving comparable or better robustness compared to PGA-based adversarial training.  The main theoretical result is presented in Prop. 4.1, where the adversarial change in loss function was shown to be upper bounded by sum of the defined local linearity measure and absolute inner product of perturbation and loss gradient w.r.t. the input.  The authors then suggested to use these two terms as regularizers in adversarial training of the model (Eq. (8)). For the first term, as we seek to minimize <\delta, \grad_x l(x)> for *all* perturbations \delta in the local neighborhood B_\epsilon, we should naturally aim at minimizing ||\grad_x l(x)||_2. However, the authors proposed to minimize <\delta_LLR, \grad_x l(x)> instead, where \delta_LLR is the perturbation that yields highest deviation from the tangent hyperplane. So the logic is not clear to me for this term. The second regularizer is the measure of deviation from linearity, which is computed in the same way as PGA iterative approximation to inner maximization of adversarial training, but with much fewer iterations. The empirical results on CIFAR 10 and ImageNet datasets support the claims under a rich variety of attacks.
