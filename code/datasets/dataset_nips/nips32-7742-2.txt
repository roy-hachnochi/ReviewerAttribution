Extreme multiclass classification is an important and challenging problem: the naive approach to training involves calculating the (gradient of the) softmax loss function, which scales as the number of classes.  One approach to make training more efficient is sampled softmax; however, bias is introduced from the sampling distribution differing from the softmax distribution.  The authors propose a sampling method with reduced bias, based on random Fourier features (RF-softmax). They prove a bound for the bias of a sampling method in terms of the multiplicative factor difference from the softmax distribution, and bound the multiplicative factor difference for RF-softmax. They show an improvement in efficiency and accuracy over other sampling methods, on benchmark datasets such as Penn Treebank and Delicious-200k.   The result is of practical importance, and the writing and organization are clear. The comparisons are thorough and well-documented: the authors document the effects of varying the dimension $D$ and temperature parameters $\nu$ and $\tau$.  Suggestions and questions (in decreasing order of importance):  + What do you get by applying Theorem 1 to RF-softmax? It would be nice to show as a corollary to Theorem 1 and 2 what the bounds are for RF-softmax. Are the bounds purely of theoretical interest, or do they give some guidance in selecting the parameters? + Theorem 2 and Remark 2: Where is the dependence on $D$ coming from in $o_D(1)$? I don't see a dependence on $D$ in (17). (Mention how $\gamma_2$ depends on $\gamma_1$.) + What happens if the inner product $\phi(c_i)^T\phi(h)$ is negative? + How does RF-softmax compare to hierarchical softmax? It appears that hierarchical softmax does not suffer from the shortcomings of negative sampling, as one can compute an unbiased gradient in $O(d \log n)$ time. What are the advantages of RF-softmax over hierarchical softmax? + ``$q_j$ should provide a tight uniform multiplicative approximation of $e^{o_j}$." How tight is the bound/how confident are you that this is the right bound? + It would be good to show the calculation that verifies (15).  Minor edits:   + (line 48) iterations -> iteration + (50) [brace] -> [parenthesis] + (55) compare -> compared + (130) based *on* + (144) multiplication -> multiplicative + (397) definition of $S_l$ should have indices $s_j$, not $j$.  ---  Reply: Thanks to the authors for addressing the points raised by the reviewers. I hope that the answers to the questions will be made clear, and that the theorem statement for RFF will be included in the final version of the paper. I continue to recommend the paper for acceptance.
