Post rebuttal: I read the rebuttal and other reviewers' comments. Assuming that the authors will fix the paper formatting and move the NLP experiments to the main body of the manuscript -- I'm satisfied with the paper and I'll stay with my original recommendation. ------------------------------- The paper discusses the calibration and predictive uncertainty aspects of the mixup training. Those are two important aspects of NNs, especially when deployed in decision making systems. The paper is well written and the insights are well validated. The results suggest that the models trained with mixup achieve better uncertainty calibration and are less prone to overconfidence.  Strengths: + The paper paper is well written and easy to follow. + The idea of studying the uncertainty calibration for mixup training is very reasonable and shows good results.  Weaknesses: - The formatting of the paper seems to be off. - The paper could benefit from reorganization of the experimental section; e. g. introducing NLP experiments in the main body of the paper. - Since the paper is proposing a new interpretation of mixup training, it could benefit by extending the comparisons in Figure 2 by including [8] and model ensembles (e. g. [14]).  Some suggestions on how the paper could be improved: * Paper formatting seems to be off - It does not follow the NeurIPS formatting style. The abstract font is too large and the bottom page margins seem to be altered. By fixing the paper style the authors should gain some space and the NLP experiments could be included in the main body of the paper. * It would be interesting to see plots similar to 2(h) and 2(i) for ERL and label smoothing. * Figure 2 - it would be beneficial to include comparisons to [8]  and [14] in the plots.  * Figure 3 -  it would be beneficial to include comparisons to [8] and [14]. * Adding calibration plots (similar to Figure 2 (a:d) ) would make the paper stronger. * Section 3.4.1 - What is the intuition behind the change of trends when comparing the results in Figure 3(b) to 3(c)? * Adding calibration results for manifold mixup [24] would further improve the paper. * Figure 5: Caption is missing. The mixup-feats-only results could be included in the Figure 2 -- this would lead to additional space that would enable moving some content from the supplementary material to the main body. * Figure 2(j) is too small. * l101 - a dot is missing * l142 - The bar plots in the bottom row ->  The bar plots in the middle row
