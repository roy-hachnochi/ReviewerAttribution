Quality: The submission is purely theoretical supported by solid analysis. I do not check the proofs in the appendix, but the claims sound correct to me. However, the constants in the almost all theorems seem to be too complicated to be the inherent constants for the problem.  Originality:  The lower bound for parallel non-smooth optimization has not been very well-studied and the submission presents a fairly thorough answer to that for both upper and lower bound.  Clarity: Although the problem setting is clear, it is hard to understand the proof techniques in the lower bound part. More explanations perhaps with a figure for the wall function will be helpful.   Significance: Obtaining the lower bound and constructing the random wall function are non-trivial in theory. Although the proposed algorithm seems to be impractical, the results provide a guideline on the lower bound for other algorithms fallen in the regime.  Updates after rebuttal: In Theorem 7, usually \eps<1, then it requires \delta<10^{-20}, which suggests the algorithm needs an exact gradient oracle.
