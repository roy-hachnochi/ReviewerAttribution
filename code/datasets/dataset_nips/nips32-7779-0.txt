The paper is nicely written and easy to follow.  For the modeling proposed in Section 2, it is easy to work with the regularized problem formulation, that is,  min_Sigma <S, Sigma^{-1}> +  log det (Sigma) + lambda d^2(Sigma, \hat{Sigma})   for some lambda ambiguity radius. Consequently, the convexity proof can be made simpler by computing the Hessian of the regularized function and showing it to be positive definite. Also, the iteration complexity result should follow from [42, 41] of the manuscript. Is my understanding correct? If so, any particular reason for choosing the constraint version (6) instead of the regularized version? If my understanding is not correct, what are the differences of the iteration complexity results with that of [42, 41] apart from those in Lines 191 - 193. This is crucial as in the absence of it, Section 2 needs to be toned down.  Theorem 3.5 is interesting. Is the regularized version of (12) not geodesically convex?  ======= After rebuttal ===== I appreciate the author rebuttal. It clarifies some confusions.
