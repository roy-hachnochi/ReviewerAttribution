This approach to density matching is new to me. The paper is rather well motivated and written but some parts need clarification.  - The main part of the paper consists in two parts: FR and KL ambiguity sets: * These parts seem (are?) somehow disconnected in terms of algorithmics. Could Pb. (12) be solved by (non-convex) gradient descent?  * Given some accuracy could you compare the wallclock time between both approaches? * Could you precise the statement of line 59 on the statistical differences between FR and KL? * More generally, could you give (maybe as a table) a synthetic comparison between FR and KL approaches.  - Could you provide more intuition about Algorithm 1: * why you need some kind of "ergodic geodesic average" in you algorithm. (See e.g. line 170-171) * Theorem 2.5 could be more emphasized, notably on how it relates to the complexity Theorem 2.7.  - One of the drawback of the FR distance is that there is no closed form in the case where both mean and covariance are subject to ambiguity (footnote 1). However, the extent of the limitation is not clear: * How does this impact the KL part (section 3)?  * In the application of Section 4 both classes means and covariances are different (225-226), so what approach to adopt?  - Section 4/5 lack clarity compared to the rest of the paper.  * 5.1 does not really bring much intuition about the behavior of the algorithm, it could be postponed to the supplementary * Section 4 and 5.2 could be merged, but 4 needs to be clarified (notably in relation with the question above). * The experimental setup could be more described (datasets, stopping criteria for FQDA and KQDA, etc.)  Minor comments: * 109: By "solvable", do you mean feasible? More generally, could you provide a clear proof of Lemma 2.2 and clarify the paragraph 111-115 that I did not really get. * There is no condition present to ensure that the ambiguity sets do not intersect. Could this pose a problem?
