1. The paper proposes the implicit MH algorithm, which can be used to improve performance of implicit models like GANs. The proposed method can be applied to different models in practice. Compared to some previous work, the proposed method doesnâ€™t need the optimality of the discriminator.  2. The paper provides some analysis on how to minimize the total variation distance between stationary distribution of the chain and the target distribution, how the different objective functions are derived. It also shows some relationships between the proposed method and previous works.  3. The paper considers both Markov proposal and independent proposal, shows how the proposed method can be applied in these scenarios with different objective functions.   4, The motivation is not very clear. The setting seems to suggest applications for sample generation based on a training dataset, similar to the GAN setting. Although experiments show some interesting results, the metric results (FID, IS) are not comparable to some of the recent models (MMD-GAN, SMMD-GAN, Sobolev-GAN, etc.). I think comparisons with some state-of-the-art models are needed; Baselines for comparisons to all the cases are also needed.
