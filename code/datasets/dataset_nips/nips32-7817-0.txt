Overall, I think this paper presents a valuable idea toward backdoor defending. The basic idea is to recover the triggers, while the main technical challenge that it solves is that different triggers being recovered may lead to poor defense performance. This work thus, instead of recovering one trigger, tries to model a distribution of the triggers. The technical development in Sec 3 makes sense, and the evaluation in Sec 4 demonstrates that the approach is valid.  There are also several aspects that can be improved. The presentation (esp. the notations) in Sec 3 is very dense and hard to follow. For example, $g$ is a function, but I'm not sure what $g'$ is, and why it can be compared with a scalar $\omega$. Are $g$ and $g'$ just two linear transformation?  The evaluation is done over CIFAR-10, while the triggers are all black/white. This may have some problem, since black-white triggers are clearly out of the distribution. The target class is set to c=0, and the authors argue that all classes are equivalent. But actually, they are not. It is natural to expect that some classes are easier to attack than others, as is in the case of adversarial example studies.  Nevertheless, I think this is an OK paper, and the results are worth to be published.
