(1) This paper is clearly written. Useful visualizations (e.g., Figure 3 & 5) are provided for better understanding of this paper. (2) This paper is well motivated --- by empirically show that there indeed exists a distribution for backdoor triggers, it then makes a perfect sense that we should apply a generative model to characterize this distribution for obtaining strong defense model. (3) The proposed method is novel. As the backdoor trigger distribution is unknown, traditional generative modeling methods, like GAN or VAE, which need directly sampling from the distribution is not applicable in this situation. Therefore, the author proposes a sampling-free algorithm (which based on entropy maximization) to model the trigger distribution. (4) Compared to traditional reverse engineering method, experiment results on CIFAR-10 demonstrate that the proposed method can improve and stabilize the robustness of defense models.
