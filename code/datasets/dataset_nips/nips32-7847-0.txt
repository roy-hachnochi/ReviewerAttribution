I have read the author response and am keeping my scores as is. I didn't have any real concerns so the response was mainly aimed toward other reviewers. The paper should probably get an oral presentation.  ***  I think this is a good application of the ideas of inference networks (finding a good use case for the functional approximation of a difficult distribution of interest). It is highly impactful in experimental design, of course, and noticing how the functional approximation could be taken advantage of in the context of nested MC in particular is not necessarily straightforward to spot.  The paper is well written and communicated. It is very easy to follow and covers a vast breadth of material succinctly yet still thoroughly.  With that said, it may be worth considering placing some concrete examples along the way. For example, early on in Sec 2 you could have followed your psychology motivation and provided what the design d looks like, the data y, the model p(y, \theta | d) and even what sampling y means intuitively in this case.
