I think that this is a good and well-written paper. Section 2 has a relevant review of related approaches. It is fairly easy to follow the arguments in most places of the paper and notation is neat; though, sections 3.1, 3.2, and 3.3 are quite compressed, and I could not understand the details deeply even though notation is very good in those sections.  The examples in Fig. 1 (right) are very useful and encouraging, but the authors could clarify if those particular examples where generated by their methods.  In Table 1, third section, the improvement of the second-order methods is rather small (small effect size). It "always outperforms" as the authors said, but I am not sure if this is a clear improvement.  Do other results also confirm the improvements due to the second-order method?
