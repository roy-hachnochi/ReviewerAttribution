Overall, the paper is well-written and presents an important novel contribution to the field in the ExactLine algorithm, although the description of the algorithm is a little unclear. The ACAS Xu example showcases the usefulness of such an algorithm in investigating and diagnosing problems with the decision boundary of a NN (e.g. the non-symmetric portions of the ACAS Xu boundary). The use of ExactLine to investigate inaccuracies in Integrated Gradient approximations is also an important contribution. Finally, the investigation of adversarial examples is also very interesting; further similar experiments using ExactLine could be a key component of developing a solid understanding of adversarial examples in the future.
