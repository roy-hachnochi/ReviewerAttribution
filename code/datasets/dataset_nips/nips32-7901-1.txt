Originality: the paper proposes a pseudo-mirror descent framework that can be applied to handle positive-value function learning problems such as Poisson processes and Hawkes processes. Related RKHS formulation of learning these processes exist in a batch-learning setting.  Quality and clarity: The paper provides both theoretical justifications as well as real-world examples to demonstrate the utility of the proposed method.  The presentation of the paper is also clear.  Significance: In section 3.1, the intensity function is assumed to be continuous. The reviewer is concerned with whether such an assumption could be restrictive as in many scenarios modeled by point processes the intensity function can demonstrate sudden changes and hence is not continuous. Overall, the author demonstrates a nice way to carry out optimization in Hilbert space and offer solutions to interesting point process problems. The convergence results of the psudo mirror descent algorithm can also be of interest to non-convex optimization.   =========== after feedback ========== The reviewer would like to thank the authors for their explanation. In terms of the concern in continuity, a nice addition would be some synthetic experiments where there are sudden changes in the intensity functions (e.g. how well the method can track a step function of intensity).
