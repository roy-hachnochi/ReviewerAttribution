pros: 1) This paper is well-written and easy to follow. 2) Theoretical assumptions for analysis and definitions are very clear. 3) Concrete examples are given to guide readers to interpret the definitions. cons: 1) The implication of some important theoretical results (e.g., theorem 3 and corollary 4) are not well explained. 2) The experimental results are not well analyzed.  It seems the proposed algorithm tend to oscillate after the first few iterations compared with the link function approach and projected gradient descent. It would be better that the authors could analyze this in detail to show some hidden properties of the new algorithm. 3) The experimental settings are a bit confusing. The reviewer usually chooses the same kernel across different experiments for convenience to justify the robustness of the proposed method. However, the authors used different kernels in synthetic and real experiments. It would be better to briefly explain the rationale behind.
