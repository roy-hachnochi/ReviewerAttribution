The paper proposes a simple algorithm for L_p regression problems and justifies its efficiency both theoretically and empirically.   Major concerns: 1) Related work: The comparison with related works is not sufficient. [AKPS19] has a (log(1/\epsilon))^2 dependence in the number of iterations, but it is not mentioned in Section 1.1. In Section, it only compares with the polynomial dependence.   2) As mentioned in the related work, the dependence on m of the proposed method is marginally worse than Bubeck et al. [BCLL19] and Adil et al. [AKPS19] but the overall comparisons are not clear. What are the advantages of the proposed one? Furthermore, the lack of sufficient baselines (at least Bubeck et al. [BCLL19] or Adil et al. [AKPS19]) in the numerical experiments weakens the superior of the proposed algorithm.  3) This paper needs significant rewriting. One example is the logic in the first paragraph of page 2 (line [34] to [40]). It first says that the convergence in solution is more important than function values, and then argued that this paper will measure the convergence in the function value. Figure 4 needs more spaces between subfigures to avoid confusion.   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ The authors answered several questions regarding the comparison with existing methods. They are mainly on the theoretical side. The numerical part is difficult because there is no available codes. Theoretical results are mostly based on the worst case, so the referee is not fully convinced by the response on the numerical part. Still this is a good submission, and the overall score will not be changed.
