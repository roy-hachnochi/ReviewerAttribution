The paper proposes a novel IRLS method to solve l_p linear regression for p>=2. The method is the first IRLS algorithm with provable linear convergence to the optimum.   The paper is clearly written and well structured and easy to read. The obtained results (Thm. 3.1) are currently state-of-the-art for the given problem class. Furthermore, the experiments are reasonable. Although I did not go through the proofs, the obtained results are believable. Overall, I do not have any objection against the paper, and I think it is in good shape to be accepted.   However, I must say I am not an expert on the IRLS algorithms.  Minor comments:  1) l. 99: p-IRLS is said to be far simpler to implement to methods mentioned in the previous paragraph. This is not completely true; as the method from Maddison et al is in fact way simpler to implement to p-IRLS. Furthermore, the method from Maddison et al also allows for the linesearch. I suggest the authors make the mentioned paragraph more clear.  2) The author names in the references are inconsistent, some have fist name shortened while others do not
