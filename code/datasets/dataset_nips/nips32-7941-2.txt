This paper is clearly written, well-motivated, and, to the best of this reviewer's knowledge, the proposed algorithm and corresponding analysis are novel. Of course, one may claim that the level of originality is limited, given that the proposed algorithm is nothing more than the combination of a couple of improvements to IRLS that had been independently proposed before, but the way in which they are combined and the corresponding analysis is novel. Moreover, the resulting algorithm is extremely fast in practice, as shown in the experimental section of the paper.  -------------------- After reading the other reviews and the authors' response, I see no reason to change my score (8).
