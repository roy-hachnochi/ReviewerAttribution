Quality:  I found the notion of similarity preserving transformations interesting, as well the posited learning rules. In terms of normative modeling, I found it somewhat odd that the authors considered only the case of K=2 (Line 212) filters. Given a reasonable set of natural movie statistics, it would be interesting to see what filters are generated by larger values of K, and whether they correspond to those seen in fly vision.      Clarity: I found the paper very  dense to read and difficult to understand.  While some of this is necessary because of the mathematical machinery involved, I have the sense that the clarity could be improved by putting some of the intuition first. For example, after going through all the math of section 2, one of the core results is given by Figure 2. After thinking it through, I found the core idea that translations are good at approximating future images from past images very intuitive, but during the process of reading the paper and working through the math, very little of that intuition came across. This might be a matter of taste, but Iâ€™d consider myself a fairly mathematical person and I still had a lot of trouble working my way through all the formalism.   Originality and Significance: I would classify this work as original, and possibly significant. Receptive fields forming through a combination of local learning rules and natural image is an interesting area of research, and the authors make some progress towards positing plausible objective functions as well as local learning rules
