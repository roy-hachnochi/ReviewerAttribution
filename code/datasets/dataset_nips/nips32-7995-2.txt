UPDATE afther the authors' rebuttal: thank you for your response to our comments, was interesting to read about the other reviewers' comment as well. I still believe your work is worth presenting at NIPS; now the meta-reviewers have their difficult job to do and make a selection. Best wishes for your work I would love to see published soon. After the review period, I could help reading your manuscript more in-depth (incl.  the Suppl material) and found a few remarks for you to fix:  - l81+82 notations, I assume it reads ...$ X_i $, $ \mathbf{p} = ... and then $ X_i \tilde p_i(... $, correct? NB you should define the noises N_i here and not on l89.  - eqn (4), you gave me a hard time on this one :). According to Wilkinson 2011, p194, the second term (h_2) of the sum on the RHS should be for Y(t)+1 instead of Y(t)-1. Seems to be what you wrote on l69 of your suppl. material, so reinsuring re: what you implemented!  - eqn (6) and (7): on a more careful reading, the g is not g(u)=u/(u+1), the derivaiton of the suppl. material reads OK to me so should be \frac{v_1 X_1(t)}{v_1 X_1(t) + v_2 X_2(t)}  - l236: shouldn't it be E[K3(t)] instead of K3(t) in the RHS of the equation? This is what seems correct (and written in Eqn (4) of the Suppl. material...which has missing brackets as a typo) The work in this paper describe the merging of Markov processes with SCM, ending up with the benefits of both models. To me, this is a very interesting, solid contribution, clearly worth presenting at NIPS. I list my questions along the text:  - SCM in abstract: avoid acronym (and define it first time used)  - l18: biochemical kinetic law is ONE possible modelling of a biological system (making a few 'averaging' assumptions btw), others exist.  - in the introduction, I would introduce the reference to Wilkinson's book.  - l46: to be pedantic, can we 'empirically' demonstrate a statement? You rely on two case studies only so more a proof of concept.  - l61: invariantS or invariant components (i.e. \sum_{i=1}^J X_i (t) = constant)?  - l71: 'occurs when': is it a iif, or a sufficient condition only?  - l80: not obvious that D needs to be acyclic. From a definition point of view, yes, from a purely causal perspective, this is a limiting assumption, could be discussed later? Ideas to extend this?  - l81-82: notation X_i p = ... and X_i p_i unclear  - l103-104: I assume the 2 distributions under the X_i^* = x do operator are DEFINED as equivalent, if it's a property, I am lost, how do you prove this?  - l114: again, some discussion on the approximation quality of plugging in P_N^{C;X=x} for P_N^C ?  - l115: the notation looks like a burden, is it needed, you don't seem to use it in your manuscript...  - Algorithms 1 and 2: I sympathise you are limited by space, yet the presentation of both algorithms side by side is poor. Quality of the $ \approx $ at the end of algorithm 1, where is it presented/discussed? In algorithm 2, it is 0:ssize or 1:ssize? No other parameters to be passed on to intModel()?  - Say that from l144, you depict the Algorithm 1 steps. l145: a reference or a short explanation, as this is not obvious to me?  - l150: binomial or Bernoulli?  - l158: an interpretation of the inequality?  - l163: ...studies 1 and 2 THEREAFTER, it may...  - l207-209: noise is assumed to be the same, not the deterministic part (averages), right?  - I am sure you knew someone was going to complain: Fig. 1 (b) and Fig. 2 (a) are barely readable when printed, might pay to try something and to make more precise statement in the text about what you get out of these plots.  I would like to finish by congratulating the authors. Quite appreciated the 'discussion' type of research and the fact that you provide the code. Very convincing work.
