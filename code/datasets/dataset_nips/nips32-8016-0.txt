**** Post rebuttal  I have read the rebuttal and other review, and I keep my initial score.  ****   The paper present a stochastic Frank-Wolfe method that solves min_{x} E_W f(x,w) + g(Ax), where f(.,w) is a convex, smooth function and g(.) is convex and potentially nonsmooth. The paper uses the Nesterov's smoothing technique to deal with the nonsmooth component. Shortly, it approximates the nonsmooth function g(.) by g_beta, where beta controls the smoothness. The idea is to decrease beta as a function of the iteration counter so that g_beta becomes closer to g.  The paper goes straight to the point and explains clearly the setting, the algorithm, and the technique used to design it. The final idea is elegant and leads to a quite simple algorithm. Moreover, the numerical experiments are well explained and are convincing, as the authors tested their approach to many different problems.  In term of novelty, the analysis seems pretty classical to me. The first step is the analysis of stochastic Frank-Wolfe for smooth problems, and then the second step uses Nesterov's results on smoothing techniques. However, this simple combination still leads to an interesting result.  A possible improvement for clarity may be to detail a bit more the proof of theorem 1, even if the sketch is already sufficient to be convinced that the claim is valid.  I think this is a good, well-written paper that presents a good contribution. However, even if the authors explained clearly their contribution and existing work on this topic, I may not have the right background to judge how different this algorithm is from other existing approaches.  Therefore, I recommend acceptance of this paper - but I may change my opinion depending on the other reviews
