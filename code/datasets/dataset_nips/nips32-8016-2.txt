Clarity and quality: The paper is easy to understand and the results are clearly stated and well-organized. I would like to suggest the authors move the contributions to the Introduction section. By the way, I prefer to remove the last contribution regarding the experiments, which I do not think this could be a contribution. The authors conducted several experiments, which is appreciated. However, it seems to me that the matrix completion problem does not satisfy convexity assumption.   Significance: This paper considers a very interesting and widely used constrained convex optimization problem semidefinite program (SDP), which is to minimize a convex function over the positive semidefinite cone subject to some affine constraints. However, given existing results, the main theoretical contributions of this paper are about solving the problem (3), which could be limited. For example, both iteration complexity and sample complexity in [2] are better than this work, while [2] can be also used to solve (3).   Originality: This paper proposed the first Frank-Wolf type method with theoretical guarantee for solving the considered constrained optimization problem in the stochastic setting, although this idea is simple. So I think the originality is ok.
