Updated: I have read the response and thank the authors for dealing with the points raised. My overall opinion of the paper has not changed and I have not updated my score.  ----------- The paper tackles the problem of lack of consistency in Bayesian network learning algorithms based on the well known PC algorithm. Specifically, the paper proposes and analyses an algorithm to ensures the conditional independences used during learning are consistent with those in the final learned graph. As the results show, this has the pleasing effect of producing final graphs that are more accurate.  The paper generally presents the problem to be solved well. The introduction arguably seems to be missing a sentence or two from the very beginning explaining the big picture or general area. The background and related work given is appropriate and sufficient, though the obligatory throw-away references to search-and-score methods looks quite dated - there has been a lot of significant improvement in this field in the last decade or so.  The method can generally be understood. However, a lot of the method description is being done by the algorithms given; the text would benefit from having more signposting of contributions and more focus on how it works at a conceptual level, not just the algorithmic level.  The evaluation is perfectly sensible and uses a range of different networks and measures to ensure general applicability of the results. While the text states the method can be used with any PC derived algorithm, the results only show it being applied to the main PC algorithm. It would perhaps also be useful to see the results for the method on some standard benchmark problems so that cross evaluation with other techniques could be easily made.
