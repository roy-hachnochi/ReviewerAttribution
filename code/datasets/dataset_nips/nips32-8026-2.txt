This paper introduces a modification of the PC algorithm to guarantee that the separating subsets of variables are, in the author terms "consistent" with the underlying graph. The use of the term "consistent" is, according to this reviewer, somewhat non-standard as, in general, it is used for an estimate that has some asymptotic properties. I would say that here it means that the separating subsets are compatible with the underlying graph. Obviously, once defined, the term "consistent" can be used but I think that a broad readership may have a different expectation on the paper when reading the term "consistent" in the current title.  The paper is well written and the contribution, while somewhat incremental, seems original to this reviewer. The experimental results should demonstrate that the proposed approach performs better than the original PC-algorithm. However, unless I'm misinterpreting Figure 2, that figure shows a better precision-recall trade-off for the standard PC-algorithm (yellow line) than the two proposed variants of the algorithm (skeleton-consistent -blue- and orientation-consistent -green), specially at the high-end of the precision. A good performance at that end of the precision is important in many domains.
