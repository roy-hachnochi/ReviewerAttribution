I'm pretty enthusiastic about this paper, though I can imagine shortcomings of this method -- particularly for non-stationary time series, and latent dynamics with nonlinear mappings.   Despite these potential limitations, the method appears highly useful to me, given the prevalence of dimensionality reduction methods in neural data analysis. Further, this paper opens the door to future work relaxing assumptions of stationarity and linearity, and does an excellent job of summarizing the current state of the field and related statistical methods.
