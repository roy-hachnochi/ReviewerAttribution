The authors conduct quite a fairly detailed study of different ways of thinking about statistical tests for detecting distribution shift.  The paper and contribution is well-contextualized and the manuscript is clear.  There is a clear takeaway message for engineers designing tools for monitoring deployed machine learning models to use pre-trained classifiers with single-dimensional statistical testing.  The shortcoming, which the authors themselves bring up is that there is no temporal dependence considered (i.e. streaming data) and that only images are considered.  To be really comprehensive, data of these other forms could have been considered.
