Non-line-of-Sight imaging is recently receiving attention in the computer vision/computational photography community, for example, a paper regarding this received the CVPR2019 best paper award. Most existing researches on NLoS imaging are active. On the contrary, this paper is purely passive. It tries to factorize the observed video into a matrix product between unknown hidden scene video and an unknown light transport matrix. So, the problem setting of this paper is extremely challenging but interesting.   Considering that the solution space is extremely huge, and popular priors of nonnegative constraints and spatial smoothness are shown to be insufficient. The authors proposed to use deep image prior, which seems to confine the solution space properly.   Experiment results show that the factorization is quite nice in capturing motions in the illumination, yet less capable of recovering color and object details. I think this is reasonable, since the cluttered scene has obvious cascade shadows.
