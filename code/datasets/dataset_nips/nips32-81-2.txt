The paper propose a free-anchor mechanism to address the object detection and break the constrain that anchors should be pre-defined and static. The proposed method updates anchor assignment to the dynamic matching by MLE.  Overall this Is a nice paper to resolve the anchor assignment based on the Maximum likelihood instead of the alternative IoU criterion, which is widely used in previous methods. The paper is written in a clear manner in terms of organisation and logic.  The core of the novelty in the paper is the assignment of anchors - based on MLE rather than the rigid IoU-based criterion. Such a modification is proven to be better achieving the goal of “anchor-object matching”.   The traditional IoU matching criterion could result in some confusing assignment especially the objects are heavily occluded. The proposed maximum likelihood solution could somehow alleviate such a situation.
