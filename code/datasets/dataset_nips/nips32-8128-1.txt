Update: the author has successfully addressed my concerns.  Original comments:  In this paper, the authors proposed a new characterization of the interventional equivalence class for learning DAGs with latent variables from soft interventional data. The authors also introduced a new algorithm based on such new characterization.  Pros.  1. The paper is well written. In introduction and preliminaries the authors gave a complete overview of previous work in this area, including basic Pearl’s do-calculus, characterization of equivalence in the causal sufficient setting as well as causal inference in the latent variable setting;  2. I agree that the problem considered in this paper is very important. So far a large body of methods have been proposed to perform causal inference with interventional data in the latent variable setting. However, the characterization of the degree of identifiability seems still missing. This paper presents an important work that filled this gap;  3. I did not check the proof in detail, but the proof looks technically sound.  Cons.  1. In lines 173-175, the authors claimed that  “For simplicity of exposition, in the rest of the paper we assume that all the interventions are controlled, although this is not required for the characterization.” I am a bit confused about this sentence. Does this mean that the controlled experiment assumption is not necessary? Since this assumption is required for example in the proof of Theorem 4 in the appendix, if this assumption is indeed not necessary, how can you prove Theorem 4 without this assumption?  2. This paper may benefit from a simulation. I am curious how the learn algorithm performs on real data.
