While the paper is interesting and useful, the authors should also compare this paper with recent work at ICASSP that superficially looks similar:  https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8682199  I am unaware if the authors happen to be the same, but regardless, the two papers seem very very closely related. If applicable, the authors should update their submission (and their response) with any other material (the above, as well as publications other than the ICASSP paper as well) that may be closely related to their work.   I will update my review after author feedback on this point.
