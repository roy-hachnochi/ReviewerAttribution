(1) In the introduction, the authors claimed that their margin-based approach removes the dependency on the number of classes by exploiting the structure of the SPO loss function. However, I can not see clearly this. As far as I can see, there is a logarithmic dependency for $\ell_1$-norm constrained ball and a sqrt dependency for $\ell_2$-norm constrained ball.  (2) the comparison with related work is not clear. The authors should present comparison with existing work more clearly to show how this work advance the state of the art. For example, how the results applied to multi-class classification can be compared with existing works.  (3) In Theorem 1, the risks and empirical risks are used but defined in Section 4.  (4) It seems that several notations are defined but not used in the main text, e.g., $B_q(\bar{w},r)$. These notations can be defined in the supplementary material if they are used there only.   --------------------- After authors' response:  I have read the authors' response as well as other reviewer comments. I would like to keep my original score.
