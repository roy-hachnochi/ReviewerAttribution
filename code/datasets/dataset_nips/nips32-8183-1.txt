This paper studies on three different levels of assumptions and provides both lower bounds and upper bounds for them. I mainly have several concerns.  1. The upper and lower bounds are stating *with ... assumption*. But what is known and what is unknown exactly to the learning agent? Are there uncomparable pairs under these assumptions?  2. If we regard these three assumptions as several examples of dominance spectrum over categories, then it seems that there is a big gap between strong dominance and first-order dominance, as well as the first-order dominance and no dominance. Can you give some discussions, or intuitions, for what kind of dominance should lie in these gaps?  3. It looks to me that these assumptions are quite strong. I guess in real applications, most categories are not comparable for these levels of relations, which limits the applicability of the algorithm. Can you provide some discussions on possible solutions for the case that these assumptions don't hold?  4. Why the regret curves are straight lines in Figure 3(a)? Perhaps more rounds would help show the learning behavior. Also, it would be better to also plot error bars.  --- I have read the rebuttal. The concern is on the reasonability of the dominance assumptions. These dominances would be more reasonable if there are additional dominance types to formulate a good spectrum. Also from the rebuttal, I realize the theorems need knowledge of the dominance type, which is usually impossible.
