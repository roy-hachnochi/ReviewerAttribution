Originality: The work is a novel combination of known techniques, which the authors clearly state in their introduction giving particular citation to Mena 2017 and Shah 2019.  It is not entirely clear, based on the manuscript, that others have not attempted similar or otherwise effective methods to remove stimulus artifact.  Perhaps this has not been done in retinal prostheses although this is not clear to this reviewer as those artifact reduction methods have been employed in a number of other electrophysiologic setups.  Quality & Significance: Overall quality is high, authors fail to highlight many weaknesses in their approach.  There are large-scale assumptions about how RGC create a perceived image which is more of a physiologic constraint and not critique-able in this setting.  The most notable aspect of the work is that taking prior experimental data can provide as high a quality output as closed-loop approaches, which is perhaps the most important aspect of this work given the heavy shift in the literature to closed-loop devices.  Clarity: The authors could provide code in addition to mathematical formulation, although this is a minor point.
