This paper is a solid contribution towards understand the sample complexity costs of achieving differential privacy during hypothesis testing. The paper explores this setting quite well, along with several motivating applications of a fairly abstract general mechanism.  Originality: The scoring function that measure the number of points that must be changed to change a pairwise comparison of hypotheses appears to be a novel contribution, and its application into the exponential mechanism (or GAP-MAX) achieves novel utility bounds. The paper sufficiently cites related work in this commonly explored problem.  Quality: The work appears quite sound with theoretical results, and the strengths and limitations of the analysis are explored.  Clarity: The work is quite clearly written, carefully building up their mechanism and its analysis.  Significance: The wide reach of their improved bounds to several applications is significant.
