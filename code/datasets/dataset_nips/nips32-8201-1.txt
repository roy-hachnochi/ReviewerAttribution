**********After author response*********** I thank the authors for answering my questions. In particular, my concern about novelty was addressed. I decide to raise my score. ************************************************  Originality: There are many previous results about the spectral filtering functions of AGD and the authors are not very clear about what's novel. See entry 1 in the "improvements" part.  Quality: I haven't checked the proofs in the appendices, but the theoretical insight is convincingly verified by experiments.  Clarity: The paper is clearly written in general, although there are minor issues that I mention in entries 2, 3 and 4 in the "improvements" part.  Significance: The generalization bounds for AGD in this work will enhance the statistical understanding of optimization methods. While there are previous works showing that AGD is less stable than GD, the finding that AGD achieves the same optimal excess risk as GD is interesting.
