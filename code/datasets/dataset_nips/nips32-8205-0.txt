The paper is easy to read. The authors convey their main ideas clearly. The main issue with this paper is that lower bounds are hard to interpret. They do show clearly how these lower bounds match with other results in the top-k bandits or the best-arm identification problem.  The regret bounds are also linearly dependent on the number of arm K. This poses problems when the number of arms is very big and therefor this analysis only seems to be interesting in the case when K << T. Therefore while these are finite time bounds, the time still has to significantly bigger than the number of arms.  Typo in line 4 of algorithm 1 in the subscript of the argmin.
