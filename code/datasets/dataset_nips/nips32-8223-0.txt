The authors consider a novel bandit setting where the rewards are censored which arise in a wide-range of applications. Classically, censored data is ubiquitous in medical settings when estimating effectiveness of treatments when patients may drop out of the study.  In particular resources are allocated to the arms and depending on arm-dependent thresholds we may or may not observe the loss of the arm. The goal is to both estimate the arm dependent thresholds and the optimal  allocation of the resources to the arms which minimizes the expected regret.   Comments:   Overall, the paper is well-written and is easy to follow. Splitting it into same thresholds and different thresholds and showing the corresponding reductions to the multi-play and its generalized version of combinatorial  semi-bandit helps with the development. Also, algorithms for both the settings are shown in the paper dubbed CSB-ST and CSB-DT for same and different thresholds correspondingly.   Various connections are shown to related problems such as bandits with knapsacks and contrasts are clearly drawn.  Censored settings are of vital interest in practical problems and have not yet been thoroughly studied and this work should help future work in this direction.
