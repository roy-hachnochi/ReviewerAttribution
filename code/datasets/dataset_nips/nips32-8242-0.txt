+ I really enjoyed reading this paper. It's a well-written work. The technical foundation about polarimetric imaging sounds solid. I cannot find out any serious issue in their image formation model in polarimetric imaging. The first neural network only estimates the surface normal of the reflective glass plane as \alpha and \beta, and then the image formation model allows for polarization-guided separation, resulting in reflection and transmission layers via the second network of a pair of encoder and decoder. These two networks are optimized in an end-to-end manner.   + They found that the gradient loss of the estimated reflection and transmission layers is effective. Their ablation study shows that having both the intensity and gradient losses is the most effective option. It outperforms a state-of-the-art method in this field, ReflectNet, with almost 1dB of PSNR.   + In addition, the proposed method is applied to a real polarimetric camera, Lucid. The proposed method was also tested with real images, where unpolarized images were obtained by adding a pair of orthogonal polarimetric images.   + I don't have any critical comments on this work. Strongly, I would like to recommend accepting this work for NeurIPS.   - Figures 3 and 4 are too small to evaluate the qualitative performance of separation. It would be better to have some closeup figures of results.
