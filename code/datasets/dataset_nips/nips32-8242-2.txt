Originality The setting and proposed solution is novel to reflection separation.  + The paper proposes a new setting for reflection separation using a pair of polarized and unpolarized images. The setting is easy to capture in practice. Similar to [22], the setting provides polarization cues for this task. + The paper formulates the problem based on the physical model, and presents that the relection separation depends on the plane parameters under the assumption of planar medium. Based on the model, the authors propose to use a network to regress the plane parameters.   Quality + The problem formulation and the derivation onto plane parameter estimation is reasonable and technically sound. The estimation of two parameters enables light network and facilitates training.   + The proposed method achieves promising results compared with other deep-learning-based methods on the synthetic dataset and real images, which clearly show the benefits of the proposed method.  + The authors show ablation study on directly estimating xi and zeta, and gradient loss. The ablation show that the proposed design on these are effective. - It is better to discuss limitations of the proposed method. For exmaple, when the assumption of planar medium does not hold? It is better to discuss and provide examples on this common case. - Is image noise added in the synthetic data generation? It is better to provide algorithm analysis on noise sensitivity, e.g., with Gaussian noise at different levels.  - Since the proposed method include a refinement process, it is suggested to provide quantitative and qualitative results before the refinement to show how the method works before refinement network.   Clarity The paper is clearly written and provides enough details for reproduction.  Significance The setting and formulation are useful and inspire future research along this direction.
