The idea is simple and valid, and the experimental results demonstrate improvement over other methods. The writing of the paper is also good, with strong logic and easy to follow. My major uncertainty, is whether cascade-rpn could be plug in other popular two-stage object detection approaches, and achieve better object detection results.
