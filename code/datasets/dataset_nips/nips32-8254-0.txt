The paper proposed a novel distribution, the kd-switch distribution using a k-d tree based hierarchical partitioning and a switch distribution as a nonparametric prior distribution: first a hierarchical partition is obtained for the parameter space, by separate the space sequentially in subsequent directions and then define a distribution on this partition.   The distribution is shown to be “point wise universal”, i.e. it achieved convergence in terms of entropy.  The method is applied to several simulated and real datasets and compared to other methods through the log loss performance.   Online computations are obtained by adapting the algorithm proposed for context tree switching.   I have only minor comments.   1) The bibliography does not use the capital letters (example: AIC/BIC in reference 28) 2) Why is the truth stopping in Figure 2c? Given the different computational times (Figures are stopped at 30 minutes running time) they are of difficult interpretation. I think a better description in the text would be useful.
