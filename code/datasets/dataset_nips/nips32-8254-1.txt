Originality: This seems like a new proposal for constructing a classifier based on a tree structure. Clarity: I found the paper very hard to read. A lot of the material is far from my usual field of research and I think that the authors are assuming a lot knowledge around ideas like Context Tree Switching. I found Figure 2 hard to read since the confidence intervals cross and some times cover other lines. Some lines are very short when plotted against n which makes them hard to interpret. The elapsed time goes to 1750 for a 30 minute run time. What are the units? To me it would clearer to plot NLL against elapsed time. You could then plot n against elapsed time to get an idea of the effects of computational speed. I found the description of the problem in 6.2 hard to understand and so it was hard to interpret the results. Significance: The paper seems like an interesting way to address problem but, since I'm familiar with a lot of methods in this area, it's difficult to give a clear opinion about significance.
