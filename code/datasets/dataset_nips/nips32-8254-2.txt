This paper is unfortunately not in my field of expertise and while I have made significant efforts to understand it, I’m unsure if I should attribute the extreme difficulty I had in doing so to any shortcomings in the paper’s clarity or merely to my own lack of background. Several terms which I expected would be defined on first usage were not; this suggests either more effort is required to allow an educated but inexpert reader to understand the work, or that such readers are not the audience in the first place. I sincerely hope that the other reviewers are able to provide better informed assessments.
