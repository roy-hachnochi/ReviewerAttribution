This paper is technically sound. The theoretical analysis supports the claims in the paper. However, the main body of the paper is dense in terms of the notations and theoretical results, so it is not easy for me to follow. This paper contains a lot of great theoretical results, while I recommend the authors reorganize the paper to make it more readable. I have not seen the game-theoretic equilibrium argument presented in this paper, and I believe other researchers are likely to use this idea to prove the complexity results for more complicated problems.
