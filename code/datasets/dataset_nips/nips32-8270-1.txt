Originality The idea of improving the fairness of predictions via disentangling looks novel to me.  Quality Most of the claims in this paper are supported by theorems and experiments. But it looks like there are some issues as I presented in Section 1.   Clarity In general, this paper is well-organized and not difficult to follow. I am not able to understand GBT 10000 scores and adj. metric. The authors might need to briefly introduce "gradient boosted trees classifier" and the motivation of computing adj. metric.  Significance I believe this paper will have reasonable contributions if the authors can fix the issues I have mentioned above.
