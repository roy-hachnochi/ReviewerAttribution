This paper presents an auto-vectorization technique based on imitation learning. The authors claim that the proposed method is much faster than ILP-based method with some small loss in vectorization performance. The technique seems reasonable and the experiments do show its advantages over other techniques. However, I feel the paper is unsuitable for Neurips for the following reasons: 1) Auto-vectorization is an important problem in the compiler area. The paper should be more suitable to compiler/parallelization conferences such as PACT or CGO.  2) The idea of using imitation learning to make approximate decisions is not new.  3) The experiments are superficial. There is no comparison of the actual compile time and execution time with existing methods.
