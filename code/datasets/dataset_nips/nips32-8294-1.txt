Originality: This work extends the contextual zooming algorithms to deal with the case of unknown similarity measure over the arm space. This is achieved by clustering the arms according to an an estimate of the integrated squared distance between two arms, based on a k-nearest neighbor estimators of the reward functions. This work is a nice combination of existing ideas.   Quality: I think that paper is technically sound, although I did not verify all the proofs in the appendix.   Clarity: The paper is well written and the key ideas are nicely presented.   Significance: Adapting to unknown regularity parameters and hidden structures in a data driven manner is an important topic in nonparametric statistics, and this paper presents a method of adapting to unknown structure in the arm-space for nonparametric contextual bandits. I think that this is a well executed incremental contribution.    Minor Comments: (i) Line 100: 'et al.' instead of 'et al' (ii) Line 104: has d_c been defined? (iii) Line 160: 'Nature could apply a measure preserving transform ...' -- Can you please illustrate this point with an example.    ___________________ POST AUTHOR RESPONSE: I have read the authors' response as well as the other reviews. I thank the authors for clarifying about the generalization of their algorithm to higher dimensions. I understand that it may not be possible to modify the algorithm to make it adaptive to the H\"older smoothness by incorporating techniques of Qian&Zhang (2016) within the limited time. I will retain my previous score of 6 for this submission.
