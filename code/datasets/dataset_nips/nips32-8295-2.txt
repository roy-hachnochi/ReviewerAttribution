I would like to thank the authors' feedback. I hope you can add more details about your experiments in the revised version. The score will be unchanged. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  This is a good work and the authors are quite familiar with this research area, but the experiment evaluation is not adequate. I have several questions: 1. In algorithm 1, why x_0 and \hat{x}_0^{(r)} are all initialized as 0 ? x_0 and   \hat{x}_0^{(r)} are all model parameters, setting them to 0 is unreasonable. 2. In the experiment part, what doest SignTopK_4L mean? You should describe your experiments in more detail. 3. More experimental results should be given, such as sync & async comparison , the effect of different sparsification strategies or quantization mehtods.
