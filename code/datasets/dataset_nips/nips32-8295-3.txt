a). My first concern is on the novelty. While the paper does a good combination of existing techniques, none of any individual part is interested enough.  - The motivation to combine these techniques are straightforward, authors do not show many insights and interesting things on this point. - Thus, I expect more interesting things can be discovered from the mathematic analysis. For example, whether authors can propose some usage of new analysis methods/tools, or strong results comparing with existing ones. - While authors have done a really solid analysis for the proposed work, I fail to find the desired interesting points, which I have mentioned above.  b). The presentation can be improved. - I do not see many new things in Section 3.2 and 4.1, these sections are not necessary. - Authors give a summary in Appendix.E, I hope they can move this table to the main text. Besides, it is better to add a comparison between related methods used in the experiments. This can help readers understand how tight the given bound is compared with other distributed SGD methods. - Appendix D should be moved in the main text in Section 5, they are necessary for ablation studies. Deep models are indeed popular, but it is not a good testbed to verify the obtained theoretical results as assumptions can be hardly satisfied.
