Originality: The idea of using likelihood ratio (LLR) with respect to a background distribution to detect OOD is novel (It has similarities to the learning of a statistical potential in the context of protein folding - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_potential).   Quality: The work is technically sound.  Clarity: The paper is very well written and easy to understand.  Significance: The experimental results are strong and give almost perfect results on Fashion-MNIST vs MNIST task. Furthermore they collect a bacterial genomic dataset (from publicly available genomes) to further evaluate their method and get significantly better results for that task as well. They also find that their OOD detection is correlated with distance to the in-distribution set giving more evidence for LLR. Given the experimental evidence and the novelty of the method, I think this is an important contribution to the stable of OOD detectors.
