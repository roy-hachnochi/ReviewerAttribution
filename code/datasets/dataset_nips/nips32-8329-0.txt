This work seems interesting, but I found the paper very confusing. Here are some comments and questions:  - The Introduction (and Figure 1 in particular) makes one think the paper addresses the join problem of predicting the location (bounding box) of the object of interest and recognizing the object. However, the results (as far as I understood) only test the mAP, meaning the accuracy on predicting the bounding box of the object of interest. Is the class prediction also tested quantitatively?  - The model seems interesting, but I still didn't understand completely the purpose of the Temporal Gear Branch. While the Spatial Gear Branch acts as an object detector, what is the expected contribution of the Temporal Gear Branch? The text seems to suggest that it acts as an attention module, but I don't see exactly how (particularly when the Self-Validation Module is removed -in the ablation studies-).  - In the qualitative results (Figure 3), it would be useful to see also how the baselines perform, for comparison. I assume authors made some visualizations, maybe they can discuss about their observations.
