This paper proposes a novel problem setting about the model specification in the multi-armed bandit problem. The method proposed by authors are quite persuasive, and the theoretical result consistent with the expected theoretical ideal result predicted from previous researches of the linear bandit. However, I have two concerns. First, I could not understand why authors dervise their algorithm from a method proposed in the research of adversarial bandit problem. Second, it is not necessary, but authors are recommended to show their experimental results. I think that it is not so difficult to experiment with their problem setting.  Originality: 5
