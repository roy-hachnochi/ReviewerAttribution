                            ### AFTER REBUTTAL####  I thank the authors for addressing my concerns, I change my score to 7.  #################################################################  This paper presents an interesting extension of the slicing trick use to compute the Wasserstein distance to the Gromov-Wasserstein distance. To do so, they provide a closed form solution to GW in 1D. The authors claim a huge gain in computational time with their method compared to previous methods for GW.  The paper is overall clear and well written, but I seem to be missing some key issues : - in the proof for QAP in 1D, i don't understand how the problem is equivalent to (2) : how do you make the quadratic term with y_sigma vanish? - I am confused by the role of delta. I understand that it is meant to allow points to be projected onto theta, but then why does it appear in cases when p=q (in particular 1st point of theorem 3.3)?  Regarding the experimental section: - I do not understant what you are computing in the spiral example? Simply GW between two spirals? if so, I don't see why GW would be used here, as both spirals are in 2D? It the idea is to get a rotation invariant metric, maybe it should be compared to other rotation invariant OT methods (Alvarez-Melis et al).  - How does RISGW compare to other state of the art methods for GW in terms of CPU time?  - The computational gain is impressive, but i am wondering what comes from SGW, and what comes from using PyKeops? I understand it might be too much to implement entropic GW with PyKeops but it would be interesting to see where you method stands with a simple pytorch implementation. - The setting that you use to compare runtimes is 2 measures in 2D, again for practical use it would make more sense to consider different distributions.  More generally, I would like the experimental section to highlight : - the effect of the number of projection directions - the effect of the delta operator  The paper is overall clear and well written, with very interesting ideas but for the moment the concerns that I have raised prevent me from giving it a clear accept.
