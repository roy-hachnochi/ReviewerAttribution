after feedback: I am happy with the author feedback and maintain my score.  === The article proposes a fast approximation of the Gromov Wasserstein distance, which allows comparing distributions defined possibly on different spaces, e.g. R^p and R^q for p different than q. The approximation draws on the sliced Wasserstein distance, and a new result on the quadratic assignment problem in one dimension.  The method is novel, the new result on QAP in 1-dimensional is quite simple but certainly useful. The experiments are very convincing; Figure 4 is particularly fun. The article is a pleasant read.   The method requires a choice of linear map Delta which could be elaborated on a bit more (what else apart from padding?). The rotational invariant version is appealing but also makes it clear that some of the appeal of the original GW distance is lost (namely the fact that no specific sets of invariances have to be specified for the original GW distance).  The discussion section raises some interesting points, e.g. GW is sometimes used on spaces that are not Hilbertian, and projections on the real line might not always be an option; I will be curious to see how the authors will tackle such cases.
