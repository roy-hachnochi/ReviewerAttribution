It is interesting to see that CCA is attracting attention again. Given the noticeable speed up achievable with the methods in this paper, it should be of interest to people working on (applications of) CCA. What I found missing was a better or more in-depth explanation/motivation as to where equation (4) comes from. How was it derived? Also, but this is a minor point, the lack of convergence analysis is indeed weakening this contribution. In section 6, the authors convincingly justify this but any attempt in this direction would considerably strengthen this paper.
