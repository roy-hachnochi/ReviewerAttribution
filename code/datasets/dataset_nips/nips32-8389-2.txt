Good: It was surprising that obtaining the training datasets is possible by only utilizing the gradients in a collaborative learning scenario. And, the paper is easy to read and understand.  Drawbacks or ‘should be improved’ Major 1. Since the proposed method utilizes the second order computation, L-BFGS, it will take quite a long time for computation (reconstruction). There is no information about it in the paper.  2. I think that comparisons with conventional attack methods (leakage) should be given in order to prove that your work is empirically better and the conventional approaches need extra information to obtain the leakage.  3. It is experimentally proven that the method is useful under a collaborative learning scenario. However, I think that the method itself is too simple. It is common to add noise to gradients or share fewer gradients in collaborative learning for defense or due to speed. So, a method that is more robust to noise injection or sparse gradient is more realistic.   Minor 1. There are too many blank spaces in the paper as a whole. I think more contents such as discussion, figures or additional experiments can be added in the paper. 2. In figure 3, I think it is visually better just matching the order of generated and ground truth images. 3. I think that the paper will be more understandable if the dimension of given variables is written with symbols.  4. More explanations about algorithm 1 are needed in the writing.
