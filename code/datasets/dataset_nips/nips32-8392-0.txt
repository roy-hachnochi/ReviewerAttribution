Mistakes: References not included in the paper to refer to related works. No references at all.    Originality and Significance of paper: The main contribution of this paper is to throw a theoretical perspective on usefullness of variusz regularization methods against designing specialized NN architectures that allow train machine learning models that are robust to transformations and attacks without compromising on natural accuracy on clean test set.     Pros: Experimental results support their hypothesis and theoretical conclusions.   Without references I am not 100% sure about fair judgement about originality of this work.
