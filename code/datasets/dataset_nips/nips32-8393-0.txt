It appears to me that this paper is closely related to the paper by Zhang et al. [24]. The settings differs slightly: a slightly different type of residual networks and a different loss function are considered in [24]. Due to such differences, there are new issues that the current paper needs to deal with. However, the analysis basically follows the same outline and the high-level ideas are very similar. Therefore, the optimization result of this paper seems somewhat incremental based on that of [24]. The generalization result seems new to me, but it does not look surprising as it is based on a standard approach via Rademacher complexity.  The results seem technically sound, as the proofs all look reasonable, although I did not check all of them carefully. The paper is well written in general, and the problem is important.  * After author response: I have read the response, but it does not change my evaluation. I still feel that the contribution of this paper given the results of Zhang et al. [24] is not substantial enough, as changing the loss does not seem to make a huge difference and the generalization result given the optimization result does not seem to require very novel idea.
