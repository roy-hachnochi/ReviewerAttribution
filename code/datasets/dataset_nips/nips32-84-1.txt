The paper considers the fundamental problem of learning a mixture of Gaussians under differential privacy. It builds on an algorithm by Achlioptas and McSherry and the robustness of PCA-projection to noise. The resulting sample complexity (for achieving a given level of accuracy) matches that of the non-private version of the algorithm. In particular, it shows a provable advantage compared with the well-known sample-and-aggregate framework. The paper is well written in general and the contributions are clearly stated.
