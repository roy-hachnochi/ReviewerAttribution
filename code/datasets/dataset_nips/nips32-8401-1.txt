This paper addresses the ice-start problem where the costs of collecting training data and the costs of collecting element-wise features are both considered. The authors propose a Bayesian deep latent gaussian model (BELGAM) that allows to quantify the uncertainty on weights, and derive a novel inference method. Experiments are performed on two tasks, imputation and active prediction, to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model.  This paper is not clearly written and can be better structured. It aims to solve two test tasks (1) imputation and (2) active prediction, however, these two tasks are not clearly defined.  I have been working on active learning problems, but I still found it is difficult to follow this paper. I would suggest the authors to focus on addressing one of the two tasks. For example, add a new section of problem definition that precisely defines the objective of the task (move some details from Appendix), and then present how the proposed model can be used to well solve this problem.  Some acronyms are used before they are defined in the paper, for example, what is NLL? What is AUIC curve?
