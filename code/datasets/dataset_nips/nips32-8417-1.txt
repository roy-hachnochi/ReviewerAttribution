In order to overcome the limitation of RL methods in learning temporally extended tasks, this paper proposes to combine a planner, which works with a high-level abstraction of the problem, with a model-free RL approach that learns goal-conditioned policies, which provide such an abstraction to the planner. In particular, the authors focus on goal reaching tasks with high-dimensional observation and goal spaces, like images. The proposed approach is then compared to simple model-free (TDM) and model-based (MPC) approaches and a state-of-the-art method (RIG) on two imaged based tasks.  Although the idea of combining model-free and model-based approaches is definitely not new, the proposed approach, as far as I know, is original. The authors have done a good job in placing their contribution with respect to the state of the art.  The technical content of the paper appears to be correct.  The paper is well written and clearly organized.  My main concern with this paper is about the significance of the contribution. The paper lacks any theoretical analysis of the proposed approach (no sample complexity, no computational complexity, no convergence guarantees). So the contribution can be evaluated only from the empirical analysis. I do not think that the two considered domains, even if not trivial, are enough to properly evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The advantages with respect to the considered (not so strong) baselines are not very large, especially considered the additional complexity introduced by the proposed approach.  The number of runs used in the experiments is quite low and I have found no explanation of the meaning of the shaded areas (even if the authors claimed to have specified it in the reproducibility checklist). Are they confidence intervals or standard deviations or what else? Furthermore, it would be interesting to see a comparison with respect to other model-free and model-based deep RL approaches (like DQN and Guided Policy Search). I do not think that the contribution introduced in this paper is so strong to attract the interest of many researchers in the field.  Minor issues: l.237 The initial arm and and pack locations => The initial arm and pack locations  ========================== Post Rebuttal  The authors have done a good job of addressing the issues raised in the reviews. The additional results show that the proposed approach outperforms other baselines. Although I still feel that the significance of the contribution is quite low, I have decided to raise my score to 6.
