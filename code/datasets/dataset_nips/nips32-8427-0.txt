The paper is generally well-written and provides useful illustrations.  It is novel and I believe technically correct.  It provides an important result for a small field.  Comments: It's worth noting that computationally efficient methods to measure TMs have been developed [A]. [A] Sharma, Manoj, et al.

I had not seen the use of a definition on the rhs of an equation before, as is done in (4). This made the text a little difficult to parse.  Typos: Line 80: "Experimantly" Line 277: "ore"
