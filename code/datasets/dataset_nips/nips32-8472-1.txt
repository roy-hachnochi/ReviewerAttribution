The paper and the contributions are cleanly written.   Matching upper/lower bounds on regret and proposed algorithm would be significant to community. One issue is upper/lower bounds still differ by condition number^2 as discussed below.  The fact that setup applies to possibly nonlinear f_t,g_t is definitely good although it is not clear how much technicality is introduced by doing this compared to LQT setup.  --------------------------------------------------------  After reading other reviews and author feedback, I am more convinced about the significance of the paper and adjusted my score accordingly.
