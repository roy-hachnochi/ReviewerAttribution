I have to say I really enjoyed reading this paper. The motivation, problem and insights are clear and well presented.  The paper addresses the problem of de-biasing a non-uniform sampling pattern for matrix completion by using a clever existing technique (1bit matrix completion) to estimate the matrix P indicating the probability of observing each entry.  My only concern is that this idea relies on such matrix P having low nuclear norm. Empirical evidence suggest that this is true for real datasets (experiments in the paper show that this technique produces a reasonable completion). However, it would be interesting to theoretically characterize (or at least provide some insights as to) which sampling patterns would correspond to a P with low nuclear norm.  In lack of such theoretical characterization, and since in general (as far as I know) P is unknown for most (if not all) real datasets, one way to obtain insights that justify the assumptions would be to analyze the type of patterns produced by matrices P with low nuclear norm, and test whether they resemble real data sampling patterns.
