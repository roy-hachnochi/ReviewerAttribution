As the contributions detailed above, this paper has good originality, which nicely connects the recent developments of graph neural networks and spectral hypergraph theory. Moreover, extensive experiments in both semi-supervised learning and combinatorial optimization demonstrate the effectiveness of such a new connection. So I also think this paper has good quality and significance. The only issue I suspect is about clarity. As I am rather familiar with spectral hypergraph theory and kind of understand graph neural networks, this content reads acceptable for me. However, I do not think the review of new hypergraph Laplacian operators is adequate, especially for the NeurIPS community to better capture the idea. Along with the review of GCN, More background on hypergraph Laplacian operators should be introduced.   --- I have read through the response. The authors have solved my questions. In the final version, please provide a better exposition of the new Laplacians that motivate your work and also additional evaluations on mediators.
