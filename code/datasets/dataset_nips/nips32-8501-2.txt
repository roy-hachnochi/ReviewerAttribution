The basic idea behind their algorithms is that of a projected gradient descent for the min player and inside the loop, one performs accelerated or simple gradient ascent respectively for non-convex concave or non-convex- PL games. For the case of the non-convex concave games, due to non-smoothness implications, the authors introduce some regularization to make the function smooth. The techniques are quite standard, nevertheless the result is quite decent.
