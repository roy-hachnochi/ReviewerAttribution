This paper presents interesting work on using brain imaging data to measure the quality of linguistic representations. Although the authors claim that they are the first in doing this, I believe there is a long tradition with this scope. See, for instance, https://aclweb.org/anthology/papers/D/D13/D13-1202/. Nonetheless, this is important work. I can't judge for the neuroscience methods, but otherwise the paper seems pretty solid. There are a few points that I'm not completely sure about: * The authors explore a fixed length window, whereas many of these models are trained at the sentence level. Aren't they introducing some arbitrary artifacts there? * The data reported in Figure 2 may be also interesting to report in a quantitative fashion (like, the distribution of red/blue areas in regions 1 and 2). * What are called NLP tasks, they are more like syntactic processing diagnostic tasks. Probably worth distinguishing them from downstream NLP tasks (like, sentiment analysis)
