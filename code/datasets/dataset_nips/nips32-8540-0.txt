 The authors have given a novel and expressive manner to learn covariance functions for Gaussian processes. The explanation of the model and the inference procedure are clear and to the point, making it a pleasant read. However, I think section 5 can be improved, perhaps swapping in material in the supplementary paper.  Main points 1. A discussion on how one might approach non-stationary kernels may help to initiate future work. 2. A discussion on how one might approach non-axis aligned kernels for multi-dimension input would also be helpful. 3. Line 112. If one need not worry about the normalization factor, does it mean that it is redundant to augment this kernel with a signal-variance factor? 4. Eq. 7. Seems to be missing a few subscript t's for tasks. 5. Section 5. Good to re-iterate how $\Delta$ in equation 2 is obtained, esp for multi-dimensional data. 6. Section 5.1 Please refer to Figure 3. 7. Section 5.2 What is the model predicting for the airline passenger data set? Is it the number of passengers (please indicate)? Why are there negative values in Figure 4a? Would modelling the logarithm of the data make more sense? 8. Figure 4. The lines are too close to prove the point. Please use a zoomed inset. 9. Section 5.3. Are there categorical and nominal data in the data set? If so, how useful/sensible is it to use the spectral method? Also a rough investigation into why the FKL does poorly on the fertility data set will be very helpful. 10. Section 5.4. Please discuss the figure (Figure 5) that you actually place on the main text, rather than go on the figures in the supplementary paper. The divide between the main paper and the supplementary paper is not reasonable.  Minor points A. References [22] and [23] are duplicated. B. Lines 118 to 122 reads awkward. Suggest to paraphrase C. Lines 195 to 197. Suggest to use "linear combination" rather than "mixture", since the mixture models have the weights sum to unity.
