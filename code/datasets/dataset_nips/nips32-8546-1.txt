*************After author response************  Thank you for the answer. I'll keep my mark and vote for accepting this paper.  ****************************************************   Originality and significance: as far as I understand the paper, the tools used to analyze the last iterate of SGD are not new, yet the results on least square are novel and deserve some attention. Note that there are only a few comments on the difference of behavior of the last iterate estimator for general convex problems and least-square problems in the case of polynomially decreasing step sizes.  Quality and clarity : the main quality of the paper is its clarity and its accuracy. All the insights claims are sufficiently argued and developed during the theorems and the purpose of the paper is clear.
