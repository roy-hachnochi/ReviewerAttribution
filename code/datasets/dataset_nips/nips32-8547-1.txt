The authors propose a new method called compositional plan vectors to handle complex tasks which involve compositions of skills. The method is based on a simple but effective idea of using the addition of task representation vectors to compose tasks. In my opinion, learning complex tasks involving many subskills is an important and challenging problem and the proposed method provides a novel and interesting way to approach this problem.  The paper is written well and easy to follow. The authors position their method well with respect to prior work.  The experiments test the proposed model in 2 diverse simulation environments. The proposed model is shown to perform better than a competitive baseline in both environments. CPV also outperform the baselines in generalizing to unseen longer tasks.  One of my concerns about the submissions is lack of motivation behind introducing new environments. Using existing environments make it easier to compare with prior methods and help in reproducibility. The authors should justify the need for new environments.
