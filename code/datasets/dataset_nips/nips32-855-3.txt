=== after author's rebuttal === Although the rebuttal did not address much about my concern about a high level intuition of the improvement, and R1's opinion that is incremental, I think this is still a good result, so I suggest for a poster admission. === after author's rebuttal === Originality: This paper reviews many related versions and improve the theoretical bound upon them. I believe it is a totally novel analysis.  Quality: This paper gives detailed analysis and the flow of the proof is clear and inspiring.  Clarity: The main paper gives the high level sketch of their proof and also the intuition why they can improve the existing result. The supplement is also well organized with full details.  Significance: Improves the known bound and match the $n^{-1/2}$ lower bound. I think it's of high significance.
