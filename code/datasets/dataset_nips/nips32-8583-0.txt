### Overall opinion * While this method is useful for certain non-convex problems, Iâ€™m not sure if neurips is a suitable publication venue for this paper.  ### Clarity * The motivation for each feature is well laid out. * The overall motivation is clear and the design of the model reflects this.  ### Originality * To the best of my knowledge, this is the first work to propose a meta-optimizer for population-based optimization. * The entropy term that encourages exploration seems novel, at least in the context of optimizer learning.  ### Significance * The model performs well on a variety of benchmarks. * While this paper seems to be a useful contribution to highly non convex optimization problems such as protein docking, it is a fairly straightforward combination of optimizer learning and population-based optimization.  ------------------------ post-rebuttal ---------------------------- The author response and other reviews have convinced me of the significance of this work; I change my score from 5 to 6.
