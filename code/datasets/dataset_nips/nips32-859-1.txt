The authors well formulated the task associated to the unconstrained monotonic neural networks, and accordingly demonstrated the technical outline to design a neural network architecture that enables learning arbitrary monotonic functions. There the forward integration and backward integration are clearly explained.  In addition, the authors demonstrated some UMNN autoregressive models, typically and yet interestingly including those related to the normalizing flows and autoregressive transformations, which may help us render new methods to solve many traditional hard tasks in information processing, image processing, and machine learning.   In a summary, its novelty and importance are both significant, in my option.
