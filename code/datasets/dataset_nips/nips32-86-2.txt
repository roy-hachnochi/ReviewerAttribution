Overall, the paper introduces an interesting algorithm with detailed theoretical and experimental analysis.  My only comments are minor: - the introduction of the full set of untied parameters in 2.2 then tying them in 2.3 seems cumbersome and a bit confusing on the first read - could the tied parameters be introduced directly instead? - line 147 references section 3.1.4 but there is no such section in the paper  Update:  The paper discusses the advantages of the proposed algorithm over Gibbs sampling approaches in terms of speed and convergence, and compares against a Gibbs baseline without sequential correlations, but it seems it should also be possible to create a Gibbs-based model that does consider sequential correlations.  It would be interesting to see a comparison against this stronger baseline in terms of empirical task performance.
