This paper proposes a general framework based on GPs for multi-task learning on the data aggregated over supports of different shapes and sizes. The change of support addressed herein is an important problem in various disciplines (e.g., geostatistics and epidemiology). The authors define the covariance function between any pair of supports as the double integration of the GPs, in which dependences between tasks are designed by the linear model of latent GPs. The inference procedure is based on variational EM that incorporates inducing points.  The problem addressed in this submission is important, and the proposed approach is reasonable. However, there are several concerns; especially the experimental results seem not enough to support the authors' claims.  Comments following the guidelines as requested. [Originality] Strengths. The main technical contribution of this submission is to extend the multi-task GP to handle the change of support; its idea sounds good and useful.  Weaknesses. Some important related works are not discussed. Multi-task (i.e., multivariate) GPs have been widely studied in machine learning community. Although most of them assume that data values are associated with points, it would be better to mention several related multi-task GPs (e.g., [1],[2],[3]). Especially, [1] designed the dependent GP by a linear mixing of latent GPs, which is similar to this submission.  Also, there is an important related work missing here: [4]. I think this paper essentially addressed a related task: Predicting the fine-grained data by using auxiliary data sets with various granularities. I would like the authors to clarify the differences and advantages of this submission.  [Quality] Strengths. This paper is technically sound except for some concerns. The authors evaluate the proposed model in the simple experimental setting using synthetic and real data sets.  Weaknesses. My concerns about the proposed model are as follows: 1) I have understood that the integral in Equation (1) corresponds to bag observation model in [Law et al., NeurIPS'18] or spatial aggregation process in [4]. The formulation introduced by the authors assume that the observations are obtained by averaging over the corresponding support $v$. However, the data might be aggregated by another procedure, e.g., simple summation or population weighted average; actually the disease incident data are often available in count, or rate per the number of residents. 2) In order to handle various data types (e.g., count and rate), shouldn't the corresponding aggregation processes be performed at the likelihood level? 3) I think it would be more efficient to estimate ${a_{d,q}}$ instead of $B_q$ since $b^q_{d,d'} = a_{d,q}a_{d',q}$. The major weakness of this submission is in the experiments. First, the proposed model should be compared with any typical baseline, such as regression-based model with aggregation process (e.g., Law et al., NeurIPS'18, [4]) and multi-task GP with point-referenced data (e.g., [1]). I believe the previous multi-task GP can be applied via the simplification; that is, each data value at the support $v$ is assumed to be associated with the representative point (e.g., centroid) of its support (as in the previous work [4]). Second, the extensive experiments are helpful to verify the effectiveness of the proposed model. In all the experiments, the authors consider two tasks. I would like to see the experimental results considering more tasks; then it is a good idea to discuss how to determine the number of latent GPs $Q$.  Short question: I was wondering if you could give me the detail of *resolution 5 \times 5* in the experimental setting of fertility rates.  [Clarity] This paper is easy to understand. Some typos: 1) In line 235, *low-cost* should be *low-accuracy*? 2) In line 239, *GP process* should be *GP*.   [Significance] Aggregated data with different supports are commonplace in a wide variety of applications, so I think this is an important problem to tackle. However, the major weakness of the submission in my view is that the evaluation of the proposed model is not enough, so the effectiveness/usefulness of the model is unclear from the experimental results. I think it would be great to compare the proposed model with baseline methods.   [1] Y. W. Teh et al., Semiparametric Latent Factor Models, AISTATS, 333-340, 2005. [2] P.

The new experimental results in the rebuttal is a welcome addition. In light of this, I upgraded my score. The proposal is a combination of the coregionalization and the concept of aggregation process used in block-kriging; this is a simple but effective way. I also agree that a sensor experiment is one of the applications with the proposed model. But I'm still of the opinion that there is not enough experiments and/or discussions to support the authors' claims. The authors state that the model is a general framework and has many applications related to geostatistics (lines 14-23); the support $v$ corresponds to the 2-dimensional region, e.g., borough (line 92). As described in Related work (lines 222-229), the proposed model strongly relates to spatial downscaling and disaggregation in geostatistics. If anything, I think this application that contains spatial aggregation is a more critical one for the proposed model. In the spatial data setting, a wide variety of data sets is available at various spatial granularities (for instance, New York City publish open data in [https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us]). Naturally, one would like to handle these data sets simultaneously (as in Law et al., NeurIPS'18, [4]); namely the setting with a large number of tasks. In that case, I believe the authors should discuss several issues; for example, the sensitivity of the number of latent GPs $Q$, the approximate accuracy of integral over regions, etc. I think it would be better to clarify the scope of this study and discuss the above issues.
