The text is very well-written; the algorithm is a bit involved (as it tests several cases), but a careful reader can follow all steps provided. The class of learnable polytrees is somewhat very limited; in particular, the assumption that the number of hidden variables is known limits the applicability of the method (from a machine learning perspective). Yet I find the work an important contribution for the field, and can certainly find application in some specific domain.
