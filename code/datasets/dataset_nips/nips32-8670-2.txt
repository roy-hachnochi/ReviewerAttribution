The author proposed a projected Stein variational Newton (pSVN) method for high-dimensional Bayesian inference. The author employed Hessian of the log posterior to explore the low dimension geometric structure of posterior distribution to address the curse of dimensionality. Experiment results on both linear and nonlinear synthetic data are presented. Overall, the paper is well organized and the presentation is clear. Detail comments and suggestions are as following.  - Using Hessian to find the low dimensional projection direction is under Gaussian assumption. Will this Gaussian assumption limit the ability of proposed method?   - In the nonlinear inference problem section, the dimension of the Hessian-based subspace r does not change with the increase of sample dimension. Another possibility is the data generation model is too simple. One experiment using more complex generative model will be able to rule out this possibility? - For these two example, it may not be a bad idea to have MCMC methods as one of the baseline (or ground truth)  Minor comment: I really like the right figure in figure 3. This show the potential of using proposed method in real world large scale problem.   I have read author's rebuttal and I will keep my original scores.
