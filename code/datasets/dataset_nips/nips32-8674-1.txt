Overall it is an interesting paper, with nice results. However, I am not as certain about the relevance of the results. It is not clear that the three methods considered are often used in their compressive version combined with quantization. One example I have seen is: [*] M. Li, S. Rane, and P. T. Boufounos, “Quantized embeddings of scale-invariant image features for mobile augmented reality,” IEEE 14th International Workshop on Multimedia Signal Processing (MMSP), Banff, Canada, Sept. 17-19, 2012, and subsequent work by the authors above. Still, the literature is still scarce for such applications. It would be interesting if the authors could provide a bit more motivation.  With respect to the results, I think that overall it is a good start in this direction. One thing that is missing from the results is the link between the quantization interval \Delta and the number of best used. I can always reduce \Delta and improve the error bounds, but then I need to use more bits per measurement. Furthermore, when it comes to compressive methods, there is also the tradeoff between number of measurements and size of \Delta, which affects the total rate. Some discussion towards addressing these questions would be valuable.  ==== I've seen and taken into account the author's response, and it does not change my score.
