The paper is well described and the proposed method appears to be interesting and useful. The authors show performance improvement over existing methods on text-based recommendation and text generation tasks.   I'd suggest more details to be provided for "Model Training" (line 125-151), including explaining the selection of \Gamma and \lambda_{max} and how the projection operator stabilizes the parameters.
