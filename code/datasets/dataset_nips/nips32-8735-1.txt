This paper presents a novel reinforcement learning algorithm that incorporates constraints from previous feedback into recommendation. The key contribution is that the user preference constraints can be learned by a discriminator neural network. It is well written and easy to understand, and experimental results clearly demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other existing baseline algorithms.
