 • Originality: the authors are very clear on what is prior work and what their contributions are. Their algorithmic contributions are both (i) clearly novel and (ii) significant improvements over naïve baselines.   • Quality: the theorems and proofs are written clearly and concisely. The authors cover all the natural sub-topics that ought to be covered when connecting two fields like this: both (i) on the algorithmic side, with sampling and mode-finding algorithms, and (ii) analyzing the theoretical properites thereof.  • Clarity: the paper was very well-organized and clear. Significance: while strong empirical results are left to future work, the algorithmic and theoretical contributions are significant ant stand on their own.
