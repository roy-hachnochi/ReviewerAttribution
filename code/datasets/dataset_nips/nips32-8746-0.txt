######################################################## I thank the authors for their response. Given the authors' promises to address the reviewers concerns, I continue to support acceptance of this paper. I agree with the other reviewers that a more thorough comparison with previous work such as SARAH should be added to the paper, and I think care should be taken in making the theorem statement more understandable. ########################################################  This is a very nice paper. The ideas are presented clearly and concisely. The proofs are accompanied by intuitive explanations. Most of all, the algorithm is straightforward and gives me confidence that it would be a good and robust approach to solving non-convex optimization problems in practice. The connection between momentum and variance reduction is particularly useful and may be quite useful for the analysis of other algorithms in the future.   The one trouble spot is the theorem statement, which is quite confusing and difficult to parse. I found it very hard to make sense of all the parameters b, k, c, w, M, etc.
