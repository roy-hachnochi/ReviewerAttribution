The paper is well written and clearly organized. A smoother introduction of equation (2) would be nice for non-experts though. The quality of the theoretical part is undeniable. The elegant interpretations of the method steps given make the method quite compelling and the arguments convincing. As a simple comment, I must say that it's a shame that the PGD interpretation of the LISTA network is lost in practice when the ReLU activations are replaced by tanh.  Moreover, the originality of the submission relies on the adaptation of a known technique (LISTA Network) for the particular application of real-time acoustic imaging. This can have great significance for practitioners and researchers in the field given the strong claims made in terms of performance and the disruptiveness of the ideas compared to the state-of-the-art approaches. For this reason, I believe that the experimental results section could have been larger, with more results to support the claims that are made by the authors. Indeed, I am surprised that 2760 data points were enough for training (without overfitting) and assessing the 5-layered neural network. More explanations on that matter would be nice. Also, I wonder what is the spherical map resolution N for the experiment and if the improvements stated in terms of runtime, resolution and contrast are averages over the 2760 * 0.2 = 552 test data points. In this case, some confidence measure of these scores could be useful to interpret the results. Other experiments from the supplementary material are cited in a small paragraph and should be further commented in the main document in my opinion.  --  The authors have addressed most of my concerns. I am increasing my score under the condition that they add more precisions and results to their experimental section.
