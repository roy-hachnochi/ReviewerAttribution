This work proposes a RNN for real-time reconstruction of acoustic camera spherical maps. It belongs to the wider topic of neural-networks inspired by optimization algorithms., e.g, LISTA based on iterative soft-thresholding algorithm.   The authors did a good job in telling the stories behind the logic of the network they designed. They carefully reviewed the connection of the network with PGD, how in theory and by nature the network was developed and trained.    The analysis is solid.  However, I don't think the paper presents enough contribution and novelty.  Firstly, the network was proposed to solve the acoustic imaging problem, and was not designed for a wider range of applications. Secondly, the formulation of the network was largely based on the natural settings of an acoustic imaging, e.g., the settings related to the spherical microphone arrays. Based on these settings, the authors discussed the theoretical justifications and their solutions, which seems not well applied to other areas.
