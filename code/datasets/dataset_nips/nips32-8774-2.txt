+ Traditional acoustic camera methods had been advanced significantly with the advent of compressed sensing techniques, which reconstruct the original signals successfully by means of hand-crafted features or functions with nonlinear optimization, e.g., proximal gradient descent. However, the performance of the reconstruction process has been significantly slow due to nonlinear optimization steps. This paper proposes a new approach that substitutes the traditional nonlinear optimization approach with recurrent network architecture, i.e., by unrolling the iterative convex optimization algorithm in a form of neural network architecture. This paper takes a two-layered design, where a bias and back-projection gradient, and deblurring matrix are learned.  + As described in the paper, the recurrent architecture has been proposed to substitute the signal reconstruction problem for other field applications of compressive sensings, such as compressive imaging. I'm not an expert in the acoustic camera field, but I cannot find out any existing works in this field yet. I, therefore, assume that this work is novel.  + This submission is very carefully prepared. The supplemental document provides a thorough derivation of backpropagation and gradient descent details. The writing and soundness of this work should meet the standard of NeurIPS.   + This work also tested the proposed method with real participants of eight people by recording their conversation.   + I cannot find out any problem in terms of algorithms.   - In this work, I cannot find out any ablation study of the parameters of the proposed method. It would be better if this paper might include an ablation study of the proposed method in terms of hyper-parameters or learnable parameters.  - In addition, I cannot find out any quantitative comparison of the proposed method with state-of-the-art methods. For this reason, I cannot give a higher score to this work.
