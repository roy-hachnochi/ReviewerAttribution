Significance: The field of adversarial robustness and verification currently focuses mostly on various L_p metrics which are not aligned with human perception (e.g. a shift of an image does not change the content but has high L_p differenc). Here the authors take various geometric transformations and provide certifications for the robustness.   Style: Well written and clear structure and intuitive explanation with a running example.   Questions: * How does this relate to vector field based transformations? Is it a subset thereof?
