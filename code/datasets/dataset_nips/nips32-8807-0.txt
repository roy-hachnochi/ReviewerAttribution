After rebuttal comments: the authors address many questions and propose some updates to improve the quality of the paper. In my view these are minor and doable. Assuming this adjustments my overall score is increased. ________________________________________________ Originality: the paper builds on previous work and ideas used in those works (HER, BC, DDPG, GAIL). The paper argues how learning can be sped up in goal oriented sparse reward problems using demonstrations. In previous work (HER) data relabeling has been exploited and now applied for BC. Additionally, goal oriented demonstrations are combined with GAIL (goal oriented GAIL) and DDPG to learn an appropriate policy. Ultimately, the policy gradient of BC can be combined with DDPGs based on discriminator rewards in GAIL. While the paper considers different combinations of existing works it mostly convincingly shows how demonstrations can speed up learning especially in "bottlenecked" tasks. The paper does not discuss literature that purely considers demonstrations for goal oriented robot learning (on real robots) [1]  Quality: the overall quality of the paper is OK, but some details remain vague. The idea of using sparse rewards depending on goal states limits the range of tasks where these kind of approaches are applicable. For example, for the FetchSlide task, or for a simple throwing task the state-dependent sparse reward will not work in my opinion. The paper also claims that scaling to real world robotic tasks of goalGAIL is potentially possible. It is difficult to see how, given the data-hungry RL setting (at least 10^6 step until convergence). While the paper convincingly shows different positive aspects of exploiting demonstrations, it is not clear how these demonstrations were collected for the simulated tasks.   Clarity: the paper overall reads well. However, the techniques used are not always clearly introduced/explained, (examples: what is the objective J in the policy gradient in Sec. 4.1, also use equation numbers; say clearly what does the discriminator corresponds to when introducing GAIL, what's the main idea behind GAIL?) I'm afraid the reader requires a substantial knowledge of related literature for understanding the technical approach due to the lack of clarity while introducing the used work.  Minor suggestions: use goalGAIL or gGAIL in the figures to highlight your proposed approach.  Significance: the paper overall carries an interesting message, but the clarity and some vague technical details make its impact a bit hard to assess. Nevertheless, in my opinion the paper shares enough value for the research community and others may be motivated by and use the work.
