Originality:  - The approach is original. It uses GCN to learn and encode neighborhood information in image retrieval, that previously relied on mostly handcrafted QE/similarity propagation/spatial verification. This has the potential of learning higher-order relationships and more powerful representations.  Quality:  - The proposed technique appears sound and well researched. The proposed GSS loss is based on a simple intuition and is demonstrated to work well. The second-order approximation to the adjacency matrix during inference is reasonable.  Clarity: - This paper is well written. The motivation and techniques are explained clearly, and implementation details are discussed. Ablation study on the most important parameter, $\beta$, is included.  Significance:  - The results show convincing improvements over state-of-the-art on INSTRE, ROxford and RParis. Although, it would be nice to see results on the augmented ROxford+1M and RParis+1M.
