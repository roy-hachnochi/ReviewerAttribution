Originality: Convex approximations to LQR-like problems have been studied extensively in the literature, and the authors are up-front about this.  However, the bound on the estimation error, the convex reformulation of the infinite horizon LQR problem, and the convex semi-definite program formulation are all novel.  Quality: The paper is of extremely high quality, and provides thorough proofs and analysis of all claims.  The authors could spend more time comparing their algorithm to other benchmarks tasks (if only to situate the algorithm with others in the space), but the provided analysis seems more than sufficient for publication.  Clarity: The work is quite clear.  I particularly enjoyed the comparisons demonstrating the higher information gleaned by greedy algorithms (yet concomitant lower performance) because of their failure to automatically balance exploration/exploitation.  Significance:  While I am not overwhelmingly familiar with the space, this work seems like an extremely general tool for use on LQR type problems.  I would appreciate more discussion of how this method compares with others in the space (if only for this reviewer's edification).
