Originality: The paper is an extension of the NeuralLP model wherein changes are made to handle variable length rules.  Significance: The paper provides a way to learn variable length rules and improves on the previous by sharing of information while estimating rules for different head relations. Results on the inductive setting for link prediction are promising. The human evaluation is interesting but would benefit from comparison to other methods than just NeuralLP. Clarity & Quality : The paper is well written and does well to explain the problems with simpler approaches and provides solutions in a step-wise manner. However, notations for the equations especially going from page 3 to page 4 should be defined better as the variables used are not adequately described. Issues with the paper: 1) The authors claim that it is not right to compare their method to the black box methods which are not interpretable but also do not report results using models that are, like [1],  [2]. These are currently relevant approaches for this task and it is important to report results on them regardless of whether DRUM is able to beat the scores or not. Comparing only to NeuralLP does not seem fair.  2) It has been shown that WN18 is inadequate and recent work on the link prediction task has shifted to using WN18RR instead of WN18 it would be great if the authors reported on this dataset as well.  3) Would like to see hits@1,3 for the inductive setting as well.  4) Equation numbers should be added.
