[Originality] Although the authors point out that there exist papers on Lipschitz convolutional networks, they are not expressive enough to perform well. And analyzing the Lipschitz property of CNNs is harder than that of fully-connected nets. Therefore, I consider this paper a novel and original extension of previous work for Lipschitz networks (on fully-connected networks).  [Quality] The proposed method (BCOP) is technically sound. The visualizations of singular values of weights of trained network layers clearly indicate that BCOP works as predicted in theory. The authors show empirical results on both adversarial robustness and estimating Wasserstein distance between data distribution and generated image distribution of GAN. I believe these results justify the effectiveness of BCOP.  [Clarity] The paper is well-written and enough implementation details are provided for readers to implement BCOP. Moreover, the authors explain the derivation in depth in the appendix.  [Significance] As mentioned in originality section, this paper is the first paper that does not place tight constraints on expressiveness of CNNs to constrain the Lipschitz constant while keeping gradient not vanishing. As Lipschitz network has been shown important in many tasks like GAN, adversarial robustness and invertible nets, this paper definitely makes a major contribution to the community. In addition, this paper provides theoretical insights for others to work on Lipschitz properties of neural nets.
