The authors propose to employ bandit algorithms to handle dynamic pricing models where the product features lie in a low-dimensional space. This is reasonable for instance consider movies which are typically assumed to be a mix of few genres such as action, comedy and so on. Two settings corresponding to known low-rank structure U and when its unknown are considered and surprisingly when estimated leads to better results.   Comments:  Overall the paper is well-written with good discussion of related work. In particular, OPOK is introduced when the product features are known and then extended to the setting where we estimate the low-rank features space corresponding to OPOL. Pricing models are of vital interest in e-commerce settings and this work considers the difficult settings where the product feature space is unknown as well as demands are noisy.
