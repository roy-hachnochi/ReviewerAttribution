This paper extends the gradient-descent without a gradient (GDG) method to adapt to the situation where the demand (and hence the pricing actions) of a set of products is low-rank.  The algorithmic modification comes with a theoretical guarantee on a regret bound that scales with only the number of latent factors.  This is a nice contribution to the online bandit optimization literature. A few comments follow: - The demand data in the experiments is generated by a process that satisfies exactly the assumptions of the proposed algorithm, e.g. dimension of latent factors.  So most of the experiment results are for a stylized setting.  The practical usability of this work needs some further verification. - Section 5.3: The misspecified settings are the most interesting and relevant ones in practice as the number of latent factors is usually unknown.  This part of the empirical results should be elaborated and analyzed in greater details. -------------------------------------- I have read the author feedback.  However, it did not address my comments.
