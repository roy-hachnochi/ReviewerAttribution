In this paper the authors discuss the limitations of current representation learning approaches that aim to approximate MI, and propose their own objective, a lower bound on what they call the Wasserstein dependency measure.  They compare their method to a similar approach, CPC, where the difference largely lies in the constraint that the function class they are optimizing over is 1-Lipschitz.  Their results are really promising and show increased robustness and performance on small, relatively simple datasets with regards to dataset size, mini batch size and mutual information of the dataset.  Overall, I think this is a nice paper - it's a simple modification to an existing approach, but the performance gains are significant in the settings considered. Id like to see more discussion on the limitations of this method in more complicated settings - this is alluded in the paper, but I think careful analysis about the limitations of an approach is also valuable in addition to the analysis about its strengths.
