This is an interesting paper with solid and novel work.   1. Novelty. The authors start from label distribution independent margin theory to distribution aware margin generalization bound, from which the optimal distribution aware margin is derived. Inspired by the proposed label distribution aware margin theory, the authors propose the LDAM loss to adjust the margin between frequent and minority classes. The class-distribution-aware margin trade-off theory is profound and  novel.   2. Quality. The main mathematical tool applied is margin theory. The mathematical statement is simplified, like Eq. (3), however, just enough to illustrate. I didn't check the proof carefully provided by the authors.   3. Clarity. The paper is well-written and organized.   4. Significance. The proposed method is simple yet effective. Inspired from margin theory the proposed method is theoretically sound. Also the authors conduct carefully designed experiments, which validates the feasibility.
