The key point of this paper is the equation (10) which is inspired by the trade-off between the class margins for BINARY classification. The loss function, LDAM takes the class margins into account so that the minority classes will enjoy a larger margin. The best numerical results come from LDAM-DRW scheme. I can't not find a very convincing argument for deferred re-weight scheme. The numerical result outperform than current popular strategies for dealing with imbalanced dataset. However, it is only tested on the computer vision learning task.
