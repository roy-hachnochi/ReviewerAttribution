 Braverman et al in EC'18 considered how to sell items to a no-regret buyer. The current paper offers a broad generalization of this result (in a bit of a different context, as buying items in a Bayesian game, while they consider general matrix games). The results are as follows  1. against a no-regret learner one can guarantee at least the Stackelberg value of the game (that is: the value one can get by committing to a move first, and letting the opponent best respond). If the learner is using a no-swap-regret strategy, than this is *exactly* the value attainable (no matter what that strategy is). I find this the most important/interesting finding of the paper.   In contrast, if the learner is using a mean-based learning strategy, than an example is provided to show that one can get higher value against such a learner, and theorem 9 offers a characterization of the optimal strategy against such a player. The main result of the Braverman et al paper in EC'18 is an analogous result for auction games, showing that the auctioneer can extract more than the optimal revenue of the 1-shot game against such mean-based learners.    I have read the author response. It is unfortunate that the paper does not extend the work to Bayesian games, and hence doesn't offer a clear comparison with the Braverman paper. But the results are very strong, and enlightening.
