Authors proposed using self-supervised learning methods to improve deep learning methods generalization properties such robustness against adversarial attacks and also to improve uncertainty estimates.  Authors propose a simple extension to already established algorithm, i.e. PGD, by adding a term (second term in eq.3) to the loss. They show improvement of their proposed method in different problems e.g. out-of-distribution detection. They have used several different datasets e.g. Cifar, Imagenet.  Paper is well written and experiments are conducted well. However, the novelty of the proposed method is limited and improvements are not surprising. Using self-supervised learning as a "data augmentation" method will improve the generalization performance of methods. Adding "extra" data points that are strictly not  in original dataset will also improve the performance metrics.   Hence in my opinion although paper is well written and experiments are well conducted the novelty of the paper is limited.
