DeepUDPS is an interesting improvement to [Zhang et al. (2018, 2017a)]&[Makansi et al. (2018)] via at least 2 aspects: 1) refining noisy labels in isolation and then 2) incremental refining with self-supervision via historical model averaging and yields very competative results. Their method has generality to some extent e.g.,for other problem seetings including medical image segementation and so on, and from my viewpoint, though novelty is not specially significant due to some similarity to both the crowdsourcing and the unsupervised ensemble learning, the idea is intuitively simple yet effective.  My other comments are 1.Using many handcrafted methods actually is similar to the crowdourcing in idea,where each handcrafted method plays a worker role for which the authors do mention nothing!  2. how to avoid cumulative mistakes once a mistake has truly been made but is not perceived. 3.One theoretical problem: Under what condition, such noisy label refinement can be helpful for better results?  4. Whether do the handcrafted methods  need the diversity for improved performance? What effect is the number of the handcrafted methods used on performance? 5. For which images, your method will NOT work! 6.How do different initial handcrafted methods and the number of them influence on final label-quality, Do these methods need to selectively be fused?  7.Performance curves in Fig. 5 are NOT quite clear!
