The paper "Inherent Tradeoffs in Learning Fair Representation" analyses the trade-off between learning fair representations and the resulting loss for the targetted task. The analysis is done via lowerbounds of the prediction error from fair representations, by the use of f-divergence measures.  It also gives an upper-bound of the discrepancy of accuracy across groups.  My feeling is that the paper is interesting, theoretically well sounded and rather well written, but the findings are too much obvious. It has a great pedagogical interest, but do we really need all of this theoretical analysis to state that when gaining in fairness tend to reduce the prediction ability ? To strengthen the contribution, it would be required to propose a novel approach based on the bounds derived in the paper.    However it is one of the first papers that gives a solid theoretical analysis of trade-offs between fairness and utility. While findings are not surprising, bounds given in the paper can inspire researchers in fairness. Authors of the paper give a possible direction in conclusion.  Based on the other reviews and the authors feedback, I changed my mark from 4 to 6.
