After Author Rebuttal ================ I agree with acceptance. It's nice to see such a clearly-written paper!  That said I would love for the authors to include a discussion in the final version of the paper that addresses some of these questions in my review:  I'd like to understand better how this relates to the results of Chouldechova [9] and Kleinberg et al., [24]. - Is the result here stronger? - Would we expect solutions, such as the suggested instance-weighting future work, to circumvent the above results as well?  I'd also like to know how these results generalize - Do the results here extend to equal opportunity? - Would collecting additional data circumvent this result?  And more about future work: - Do you think the lower bound is a useful tool to understand base distribution drift over time? - Why does instance-weighting improve fairness? ================  1. Summary  This paper gives a lower bound on the error of fair representations when base rates are different, if they aren't, the fair representations lead to accuracy parity.  2. High level paper  This paper is very clearly written. I think there are sufficient experiments. This paper nicely complements the trade-off results of Chouldechova [9] and Kleinberg et al., [24]. It will certainly be interesting to people.  3. High level technical  I enjoyed reading this paper. I have no complaints, but there are a few things I'd like to understand better:  I'd like to understand better how this relates to the results of Chouldechova [9] and Kleinberg et al., [24].  - Is the result here stronger? - Would we expect solutions, such as the suggested instance-weighting future work, to circumvent the above results as well?  I'd also like to know how these results generalize - Do the results here extend to equal opportunity? - Would collecting additional data circumvent this result?  And more about future work: - Do you think the lower bound is a useful tool to understand base distribution drift over time? - Why does instance-weighting improve fairness?  4. Review summary  Overall, this paper is well-suited for publication at neurips.
