Originality: The authors clearly distinguish their work from previous efforts in the related work section. TMD seems to be the most similar work, at least thematically, but was not included as a baseline.  Quality: The results and proofs are thorough. Classification is run on a variety of datasets against reasonable baselines. The classification performance numbers are supplemented with sensitivity analysis, runtime information, and two additional tasks (t-SNE visualizations and link prediction). The proposed approaches work best on average across all datasets, but they only beat all baselines on 1 of the 8 datasets, a fact that could use more discussion in the paper.  Clarity: The work is well-motivated, and the authors do a good job of anticipating reader questions. Some smaller points were unclear (see "Improvements"), but overall well-written.  Significance: The good results on long texts (especially the full novels of Project Gutenberg) and focus on computational efficiency are especially promising as research continues to push towards using longer and more complex texts.
