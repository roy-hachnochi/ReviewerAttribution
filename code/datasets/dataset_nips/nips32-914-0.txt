The authors provide a model of stochastic processes that aim at modeling strong non-stationarities. The model is built from Gaussian Processes (GPs) and has multivariate outputs. Algorithms are carefully discussed for the Bayesian implementation. Good results are provided on two real applications to iEEG and criminology.  Originality: As discussed in the paper, the model is more flexible than previous approaches for modeling non-stationarity. The method and applications of the paper are thus original, in my opinion.   Quality: The model is complex and seems to provide good numerical results in applications. The methodology is well developed.  Clarity: I think the clarity could be improved. I would have liked to see more careful definitions of the different quantity involved, and more explanations and discussions. For instance around equation (3) I did not understand what C is exactly.  Significance: I think the topic is significant and the methods of the paper are useful.
