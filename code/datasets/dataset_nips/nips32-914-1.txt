Originality: As mentioned in the paper, when dealing with non-stationary data within GPs, there are two approaches: 1. Use a non-stationary covariance function and 2. Partition the input space into local regions and for each region fit a stationary GP. The paper follows the latter, although the novelty of the paper is the fact that the probabilistic partition is coupled with ARD which yields the most relevant data point for each partition member, which become the training locations for the global GP. The paper lack comparisons against the first type of non-stationary GP models.  Clarity: I found the presentation of the paper very clear and easy to follow. It would have been ideal to see, for the sake of comprehension, an example showing the partitions learned with each local GP on it and the long-range global GP.   Quality: The paper is technically correct although there are some potential issues that limit the effectiveness of the proposed model. For instance, the multivariate model is limited to highly correlated signals since the underlying global GP is the same across all multivariate variables. A mixture of global GPs could allow for more flexibility across signals, as is typically done in multivariate GPs models.  Questions:  - Given that the probabilistic model for the partitions is based on observation correlations, how does the model guarantee that each partition is local?  - Do you think is possible to encode the observation correlations into a Chinese Restaurant process in order to determine the number of partitions nonparametrically?  Significance: I can see this model being used in the problem of SOZ detection given its principled approach and the experimental results, although the scope of the model seems rather limited to applications to highly correlated signals.
