EDIT: After reading the feedback of the other reviewers I realized that I was too harsh in the assessment of the paper. Consequently, I updated my assessment of the paper to a good submission that should be accepted at the conference.  The paper in itself is well written, and the explanations are clear and concise. However, I don't feel NeurIPS is the appropriate venue to publish it. My main concern about the paper is with respect to its appeal for the ML community at large. My impression is that its scope is rather limited. The presented examples are of reduced dimension and it is not clear for me how the method could scale to large datasets. There are some leads given in the conclusion section, however I would have preferred to actually see them implemented instead of just being mentioned.
