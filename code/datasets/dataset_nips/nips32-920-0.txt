The paper is fairly well-written, the structure is clear.  Experiments are strong and contain main image translation methods (pix2pix and cyclegan) as well as some new multimodal ones (DRIT, MUNIT). The authors compare with SPADE (basically spatially-aware BN that shares some ideas with PONO).  I find this submission quite original and novel. I believe it will be useful for a variety of generative models.  Implementation is straightforward (the code is given in supplementary) so I consider it reproducible.
