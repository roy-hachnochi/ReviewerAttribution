This paper addressed the issues of representative learning, and then systematically designed a setup to collect a new set of datasets to help with evaluating/addressing the representative learning issues. The authors then conducted an empirical study of existing approaches on this new dataset with some confirmative conclusions.  The main value of this paper lies in the creation of the new dataset.
