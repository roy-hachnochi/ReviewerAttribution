I think the paper was very insightful and represents a significant advance. It was well written and well explained.  It combines two powerful ideas, using feedback from a small validation set, and a fresh theoretical perspective linking RL ideas to the gradient descent realm.  ------------------------------------------- Post Rebuttal --------------------------------------- I've read the author rebuttal and other reviews. The authors seems to have replied to issues other reviewers had in appreciating the novelty/significance. Myself, I still honestly think that if I randomly sampled 19 other accepted NIPS papers and this one, it would be the most significant and interesting read.  I'm comfortable remaining an isolated outlier for this evaluation.
