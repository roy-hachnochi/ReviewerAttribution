Originality:  The proposed framework is fairly novel and provides an interesting perspective on learning data manipulation. I found the  Quality:  The experiments on the text classification show that the proposed algorithms work well. However I found the experiments on image classification setting to be not very convincing~(see Improvements section) Clarity: The paper is well written and organized and contains sufficient details to enable reproducing the results. Significance: The proposed algorithm is flexible to incorporate different data manipulation schemes and provides a method to learn them to improve the end-task. This might enable integrating data generation methods~(GANs, VAEs) and learning an effective task-specific data-augmentation algorithms.  ------------------------------------------- Post Rebuttal --------------------------------------- Having read the other reviews and the authors rebuttal, I stick to my initial evaluation that this is a good paper and should be accepted.  The rebuttal provides satisfactory answers to my questions.
