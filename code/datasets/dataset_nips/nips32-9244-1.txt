First of all, my knowledge of formal verification of neural networks is very limited, and I apologize for the limitations this poses on my review.  That said, I found this paper very interesting, well written, and from my limited understanding of the literature, this seems like a novel and highly useful tool in the toolbox for verifying neural network models. I am strongly in favor of acceptance.  My main questions are the following: * It is not clear to me what increase in false positives does the method introduce by relaxing the estimate of the output of the network to a superset. * I would like to see a more formal definition of the algorithm with the "moving pieces" (e.g. partitioning strategies) stated more explicitly. Then I would like to have a discussion of the considerations that go into defining these "moving pieces". * What are the practical limitations of the method on real-world network sizes and architectures.
