         This paper proposes a new scoring criterion (PIDScore) for the         "anomalousness" of data points, based on (loosely)         information-theoretic intuitions around how difficult it is to         identify or characterize the point, which can be expressed in         terms of the sparsity of the containing subcube. This is a         richer notion that goes significantly beyond previous notions         of "low density" regions for outlier detection, and also has         benefits around interpretability. A corresponding algorithm         (PIDForest) is developed, similar to Isolation Forests but         with some differences that are motivated by PIDScore designed         to overcome known weaknesses.          Overall, I found the paper to be well-written and         well-contextualized with respect to other work. The         experiments show good performance against sound baselines, and         some targeted "lesion-style" experiments support the claims         around the underlying reasons why the approach works. The         ideas behind the scoring function could be a good foundation         for other research in anomaly detection.                 MORE DETAILED COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS                  I found the presentation of the core ideas of PIDScore         (Section 2) to be clear. The differences between this approach         and iForest are described and motivated well.          L107: this idea gets better context in the Appendix, it might         help to at least put the appropriate cites here.                  L42: the comparison to the "implicit" scoring definition of         anomalies in iForest is very helpful for context.                  L74: at this point in the paper it is not very clear what this         means. A simple example might help.          L198: should be "in any partition _of_ C" ?          L229: the parenthetical VC-dimension comment should be backed         up with either a cite or clarification in the Appendix.                  L230: this is very well put, this paragraph captures the key         distinction with iForest.          L249: spelling error, "Seismic"          L283: nice to see some concrete wall-clock numbers here.          L289 and L297: these "lesion-style" analyses do a good job         supporting the proposed claims about the benefits of the         specific mechanisms of PIDForest.          L313: "iForestunder" to "iForest under"          L307: the synthetic experiments successfully highlight issues         with other approaches.                  L453 (Appendix): in eq on LHS, it should be \bar{f(J(j)} (not         I(J))?                  The Related Work section in the Appendix was informative. The         Wigderson and Yehudayoff reference seems important enough to         include in the main paper.                  The associated supplemental code submission was exceptionally         thorough, it was especially helpful to browse the synthetic         experiment notebooks.           UPDATE: I have read the author response. The clarifications and additional detail are helpful, and if possible it would be good to slightly modify the discussions in the paper based on these. The addition of the other approaches to the "noise dimension" plot and associated discussion were also valuable, and could be included as well (perhaps in the Appendix).
