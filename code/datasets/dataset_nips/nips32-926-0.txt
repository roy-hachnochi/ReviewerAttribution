I like the paper, I think it is mostly nicely written, well motivated and the method seems solid. However there are some  issues with the evaluation. While it seems that the authors did work hard to produce good evaluations, it is very hard to evaluate adversarial defense and I feel like more is needed for me to be convinced of the merits of these method.  Detailed remarks: - The authors claim to use BPDA that is a method to overcome non-differentiable transformations, but there is nothing non-differentiable in objective 3 or 4 (unlike the number of steps). You can backpropagate through the gradients and it is commonly used in second order methods. These results should be added as well. - As is easily seen, in this work and others, there can be great variance in robustness against various attacks. To show validity of a defense it needs to be tested vs more attacks (and attacks targeted to fool the detector). I would be much more convinced if they showed robustness against different strong attacks, like the boundary attack that can be modified easily to work against detection. - While the results are ok, they are still bellow performance of robust networks like Madry et al so I am unsure about the practical significance (I know this is about detection not robust classification so the comparison isn't exact but still). - The main idea is combining two known properties of NN for detection so this work has slightly limited novelty.
