** Summary The paper takes the speaker-listener population setup to study the emergence of language structure in the form of compositionality and ease of teaching. This is done via constant replacement of listeners that creates a pressure for solutions to tilt that way. Interestingly, smooth population changes were not as amenable for such emergence when compared to abrupt changes. ** Strength - The paper performs an extensive set of experiments. The population experiments were quite interesting. - Experimental setup is well described and the attached source code was quite useful ** Weakness - Not completely sure about the meaning of the results of certain experiments and the paper refuses to hypothesize any explanations. Other results show very little difference between the alternatives and unclear whether they are significant. - Lot of result description is needlessly convoluted e.g. "less likely to produce less easier to teach and less structured languages when no listener gets reset". ** Suggestions - A related idea of speaker-listener communication from a teachability perspective was studied in [1] - In light of [2], it's pertinent that we check that useful communication is actually happening. The differences in figures seem too small. Although the topography plots do seem to indicate something reasonable going on.  [1]: https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.06464 [2]: https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.05168
