+ Novel idea + Good results + complete evaluation - Technical section can be streamlined more - flow filtering missing some technical details  I liked the idea and motivation of the paper. It makes intuitive sense and is well explained. The proposed algorithm produces good results, not just numerically, but also qualitatively. There is an extensive comparison to prior work and a ablation study. One minor request would be to ablate all possible combinations of components instead of just removing each individual component. It would make the paper stronger. However, the current ablation is sufficient.  May main points of improvement lie in the technical section. First, equation 1 is probably not needed. Most readers will be familiar with velocity and acceleration. Maybe, a slightly version of equation 3 is fine. If the authors decide to keep equation 1, I'd recommend to fix the notation: the bounds of the integration currently use the same symbol as the differential, which seems wrong.  The proposed flow reversal (eq 4) is commonly called splatting in computer graphics. It might be worth a citation, and carefully highlighting the differences (if there are any). If it is just splatting of the flow field (which seems to be the case at first glance), the section can be shortened a bit.  Finally, I was missing some information on how the flow filtering works, how the network is set up, what are the inputs, what are the outputs. Are all inputs fed into a single network (concatenated or separate paths), is there any normalization between images and flow fields?
