Overall the paper is clear and easy to follow. The proofs and main derivations are all in the appendix and while I did not thoroughly check them they are relatively straightforward.  The idea of analyzing the training dynamics by taking a tractable simple model, making approximations, and deriving both qualitative and quantitative conclusions which can be validated experimentally is quite interesting. The particular approach adopted here to analyze multitask learning in particular is novel.
