Originality: The theoretical results on single and multitask learning in classification networks are novel as in previous literature the focus was mainly on regression networks. The key analysis are although inspired by [16] but tackling the cross entropy loss function in this setting is original.  Quality: The theoretical derivation of dynamics of generalization of both single task and multitask classification networks and its comparison to empirical results thorugh well thought experiments makes this paper a good contribution. The results of deeper non linear networks showing a similar trends to shallow linear networks makes this contribution much stronger.   Clarity: The paper is well-written, the theory clearly described and presentation of results through descriptive figures.  Significance: The contribution is important for understanding generalization dynamics of classification networks. The theoretical results and their empirical validation on generalization dynamics in multitask setting is very relevant in complex setups where multiple auxiliary tasks can aid in learning a new tasks.
