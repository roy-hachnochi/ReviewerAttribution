A main selling point of this paper is that it significantly improves image splice detection on several standard datasets. This is achieved using clever engineering with an elaborate architecture and loss functions. I don't think there is a particularly deep novel insight in this paper, but the intuition behind the design decisions makes sense, and it seems to pay off in the evaluations.  The paper is mostly well written. I think it might be difficult though to reproduce the results based on the information in the paper only due to the complexity of the system. Therefore, it would be important that code will published also.  In summary, this paper makes significant progress in an important practical problem. It presents a well engineered system with a reasonable evaluation. There I think it could be published at NIPS.
