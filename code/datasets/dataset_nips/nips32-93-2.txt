The paper proposed a splice detection system that is designed based on the existing unsupervised image-to-image translation frameworks. Specifically, it assumes two domains of images: the authentic domain and the forged domain. It utilizes two generators where one generator aims at translating a forged image to a corresponding authentic image while the other generator aims at producing the semantic segmentation mask and the binary mask of the forged region if any in the input image. By teaming up with a discriminator, they serves as an adversary to the first generator. In some sense, the first generator acts as a data augmenter to help the second generator performs better in detecting forged regions.  - In terms of originality, the design proposed in the paper appears to be new and makes intuitive sense.  - In terms of clarity of the presentation, it is below the publication standard. Vague descriptions are abundant in the manuscript. The notation is also hard to follow. For example, Equation (2) and (3) are difficult to understand. It is unclear how the label loss is computed.  - In terms of significant, the baselines the paper compares to for the forged region detection task, which is the main task considered in the paper, appear to be simple methods based on local statistics analysis. It is not surprised that a deep learning based method performs better. The paper should consider stronger baseline that are based on deep learning.  It is unclear why the paper includes a comparison to unsupervised image-to-image translation model. Achieving better performance on the image translation task is not helping the paper as 1) this task is just digression from the main topic, and 2) the achieved better performance is largely due to the use of segmentation mask in the training. It is expected. It is not supporting the proposed paper.
