Update: I have read the author's rebuttal and the other reviews. I am happy with my previous recommendation.    - Regarding experiments, the highest vanilla resnet accuracy in the paper is close to 85%, however, there are many implementations of resnets which achieve close to 95% on CIFAR10. Why aren't the baseline numbers reported in the paper high enough? The observations of the paper still hold. However, this reviewer is concerned regarding the efficacy of the method towards very high or SOTA performing models.  - I believe the  derivation of the solution eq 10 is important and relevant for readers new to ODEs. The  paper's accessibility/correctness would be improved if the derivation was included in the supplementary.  - Line 126, strong suggestion to change the symbol denoting injected noise into resnets as Resnet'. Better symbols might be Resnet* etc. This is because Line 130, uses Resnet's, which cause confusion.  - How is a picked, what happens if you increase or decrease a?  Minor comments: - Th 1, line 116, please add in the meanings of the symbols that were mentioned in [22]. This interrupts readability. Even a very brief one linear suffices.
