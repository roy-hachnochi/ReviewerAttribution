The work is amazingly well-written and easy to follow. The work does a pretty good job of introducing the required logic background for understanding the rest of the work (I was not introduced to the notions and terminology before and I found it very easy to follow). As a researcher in both fields, I find this new direction very much and appreciate the work's significance. However, from a practitioner's point of view, the main question is the applicability of the introduced algorithm. The algorithm requires computations up to the order of the feature space size (which is intractably large even for the simplest problems). I am leaning towards an acceptance score due to its novelty but the actual contribution and its usefulness in practice should become more clear.
