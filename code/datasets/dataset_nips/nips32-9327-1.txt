This paper address an intuition that has been present in the literature for some time, but has not been formalized or published that i am aware of. Many papers hint at the duality between adversarial examples and explanations, but by formalizing these notions and proving the duality between them, the authors make an important contribution to the literature,   the paper is quite dense, and spends most of its time on theoretical proofs and justifications for the relationship between adversarial examples. It may find a wider readership if it allocates some more space to introducing the concepts it employs, even such simple things as "subset-minimal" may not be widely known in the adversarial community.     The final section focusing on the experimental result making use of a subset of a binarized version of MNIST is compelling, and makes the theoretical work significantly easier to grasp. The running example of the restaurant running problem, also helps illustrate the theorems presented, but the paragraph describing the specifics of the problem is probably not needed.    Overall i think this paper is an important contribution to the research literature, but could be made more approachable and subsequently reach a broader audience with some light rewriting with a focus on making more accessible.
