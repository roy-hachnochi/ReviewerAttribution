In this paper, the authors continue the line of work that replaces k independent minhashes, sample only one permutation and then extract k samples for it so to obtain an unbiased estimator for the Jaccard similarity.  The authors show a minor variant of the algorithm from [23], where more randomness is injected. They analyze the variance of estimator and conclude that the variance is smaller than for the scheme from [23], as well as evaluate it experimentally.  I like the result, since it makes progress on an important problem (estimators for the Jaccard similarity are heavily used in practice). However, the result is a bit incremental, and not really about learning (sure, minhash and its variants can be used for kernel methods, but it's orthogonal to the contribution of the present paper). These considerations make me put this paper into the "slightly above borderline" pile.
