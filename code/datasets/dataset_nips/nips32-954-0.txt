The idea of parameterizing Bayesian framework with neural networks is very interesting. The learned framework has the benefit of efficient inference as well as good generalization. Paper is overall clearly presented but more implementation details are needed in order for others to reproduce. Detailed comments in the following:  1, At the end, the paper learns a feedforward image denoising neural network. It highly depends on the training dataset. So it is not truly a blind image denoising algorithm, but reviewer won't be too critical about it. In this sense, how does the algorithm perform compared with other recent deep learning denoising algorithms (e.g., MemNet, NLRN) straightly trained on the datasets?  2. It drops the assumption of i.i.d. Guassian distribution for noise. In practice, the noise is closely related to pixel illuminance, but this is not modeled in the framework.  3. In essence, because it learned a feedforward neural network, it looks to the reviewer that, what the algorithm really does is to restrict the field of view of the network in order to have a good estimation of the local noise. Would like to hear comments from the authors about it.  4. In the experiment section, the paper does not report ablation study for hyper-parameter epsilon_0. Specifically, setting epsilon_0 to be zero (simple MSE loss) should be the baseline for the proposed algorithm. How sensitive the algorithm is to epsilon_0?  5. Any noise variance visualization for the real dataset? Can one spot some patterns?
