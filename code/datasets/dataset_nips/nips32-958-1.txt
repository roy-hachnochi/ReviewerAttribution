Originality: this paper proposes a new bound on the screening criterion that help to reduce the computation of the group Lasso. Combined with block coordinate descent, experiments show a drastic improvement compare to recent screening methods.  Quality: the mathematical analysis relies on previous results on screening methods. Though no sketches are given for the most important lemmas and theorem (they all are in the supplementary material), the guiding line is clear and motivated.  Clarity: the paper is easy to read. All the idea are motivated and the algorithm come easily.  Significance: as group Lasso is a very used and useful methods when dealing with high dimensional data and small dataset, such work is significant as it propose a pretty fast method.
