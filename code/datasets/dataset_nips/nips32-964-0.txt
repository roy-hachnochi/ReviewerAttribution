1. Originality: The idea is motivated by Yang, stereo matching using tree filtering, PAMI2015. But it is considerably novel in incorporating this idea in an end-to-end deep network.  2. Quality: + Tree structure to exploit irregular shaped long term dependencies. + Detailed ablation analysis. + More efficient than PSP and non-local operations.  3. Clarity: This paper is in general well written. But I still have some concerns to be clarified: - How the higher level semantics/features can guide to generate the MST (L40-41, L141-143)? In my understanding, is the MST generate based on the weights calculated by the CURRENT feature map rather than higher ones? - How to initialize the MST weights? Are they initialized once (by Euclidean distance on features of each pixel) then updated solely by gradients, or the Euclidean distance should be calculated every step (as the CNN paras change)? - What is multi-groups in Figure 2 and how does it take efforts?  4. Significance: The proposed method better exploits irregular shaped long term dependencies for semantic segmentation.  ----------------  I appreciate the authors' rebuttal which well addressed my concerns, therefore, I remain my recommendation as an accept.
