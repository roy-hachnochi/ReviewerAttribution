This work shows that the difference between the state-action occupancy of LFD and the state-transition occupancy of LFO can be characterized by the difference between the inverse dynamics models of the expert policy and the agent's policy. This paper then proposes an algorithm for learning from observations by minimizing an upper bound on the inverse-dynamics disagreement. The method is evaluated on a number of benchmark tasks.  I think the paper is generally well written and presents the derivation of IDDM in a fairly clear manner. The overall concept of inverse dynamics disagreement is also quite interesting. There are some minor typos and instances of awkward phrasing, but can be fixed with some additional polishing. The experiments show promising results on a diverse set of tasks. IDDM compares pretty favourable to a number of previous methods, though the improvements appear to be fairly marginal on many of the tasks. But overall, I am in favour of accepting this work.  I have only some small concerns regarding some of the experiments, but it should in no way be a barrier for acceptance. In the performance statistics reported in Table 2, the performance of the handcrafted reward function (DeepMimic) seems unusually low, particularly for the ant. In the original paper, the method was able to reproduce very challenging skills with much more complex simulated agents. The tasks in this work are substantially simpler, so one would expect that the hand designed reward function, with some tuning, should be able to closely reproduce the demonstrations.
