united states a few months ago, after the extraordinary series of adventure in the south seas and elsewhere, of which an account is given in the following pages, accident threw me into the society of several gentlemen in richmond, va., who felt deep interest in all matters relating to the regions i had visited, and who were constantly urging it upon me, as a duty, to give my narrative to the public. i had several reasons, however, for declining to do so, some of which were of a nature altogether private, and concern no person but myself; others not so much so. one consideration which deterred me was that, having kept no journal during a greater portion of the time in which i was absent, i feared i should not be able to write, from mere memory, a statement so minute and connected as to have the _appearance _of that truth it would really possess, barring only the natural and unavoidable exaggeration to which all of us are prone when detailing events which have had powerful influence in exciting the imaginative faculties. another reason was, that the incidents to be narrated were of a nature so positively marvellous that, unsupported as my assertions must necessarily be (except by the evidence of a single individual, and he a half-breed indian), i could only hope for belief among my family, and those of my friends who have had reason, through life, to put faith in my veracity--the probability being that the public at large would regard what i should put forth as merely an impudent and ingenious fiction. a distrust in my own abilities as a writer was, nevertheless, one of the principal causes which prevented me from complying with the suggestions of my advisers. among those gentlemen in virginia who expressed the greatest interest in my statement, more particularly in regard to that portion of it which related to the antarctic ocean, was mr. poe, lately editor of the “southern literary messenger,” a monthly magazine, published by mr. thomas w. white, in the city of richmond. he strongly advised me, among others, to prepare at once a full account of what i had seen and undergone, and trust to the shrewdness and common-sense of the public--insisting, with great plausibility, that however roughly, as regards mere authorship, my book should be got up, its very uncouthness, if there were any, would give it all the better chance of being received as truth. notwithstanding this representation, i did not make up my mind to do as he suggested. he afterward proposed (finding that i would not stir in the matter) that i should allow him to draw up, in his own words, a narrative of the earlier portion of my adventures, from facts afforded by myself, publishing it in the “southern messenger” _under the garb of fiction. _to this, perceiving no objection, i consented, stipulating only that my real name should be retained. two numbers of the pretended fiction appeared, consequently, in the “messenger” for january and february <UNK> and, in order that it might certainly be regarded as fiction, the name of mr. poe was affixed to the articles in the table of contents of the magazine. the manner in which this ruse was received has induced me at length to undertake a regular compilation and publication of the adventures in question; for i found that, in spite of the air of fable which had been so ingeniously thrown around that portion of my statement which appeared in the “messenger” (without altering or distorting a single fact), the public were still not at all disposed to receive it as fable, and several letters were sent to mr. p.’s address, distinctly expressing a conviction to the contrary. i thence concluded that the facts of my narrative would prove of such a nature as to carry with them sufficient evidence of their own authenticity, and that i had consequently little to fear on the score of popular incredulity. this_ exposé _being made, it will be seen at once how much of what follows i claim to be my own writing; and it will also be understood that no fact is misrepresented in the first few pages which were written by mr. poe. even to those readers who have not seen the “messenger,” it will be unnecessary to point out where his portion ends and my own commences; the difference in point of style will be readily perceived. a. g. pym. chapter <UNK> my name is arthur gordon pym. my father was a respectable trader in sea-stores at nantucket, where i was born. my maternal grandfather was an attorney in good practice. he was fortunate in every thing, and had speculated very successfully in stocks of the edgarton new bank, as it was formerly called. by these and other means he had managed to lay by a tolerable sum of money. he was more attached to myself, i believe, than to any other person in the world, and i expected to inherit the most of his property at his death. he sent me, at six years of age, to the school of old mr. ricketts, a gentleman with only one arm and of eccentric manners--he is well known to almost every person who has visited new bedford. i stayed at his school until i was sixteen, when i left him for mr. e. ronald’s academy on the hill. here i became intimate with the son of mr. barnard, a sea-captain, who generally sailed in the employ of lloyd and vredenburgh--mr. barnard is also very well known in new bedford, and has many relations, i am certain, in edgarton. his son was named augustus, and he was nearly two years older than myself. he had been on a whaling voyage with his father in the john donaldson, and was always talking to me of his adventures in the south pacific ocean. i used frequently to go home with him, and remain all day, and sometimes all night. we occupied the same bed, and he would be sure to keep me awake until almost light, telling me stories of the natives of the island of tinian, and other places he had visited in his travels. at last i could not help being interested in what he said, and by degrees i felt the greatest desire to go to sea. i owned a sailboat called the ariel, and worth about seventy-five dollars. she had a half-deck or cuddy, and was rigged sloop-fashion--i forget her tonnage, but she would hold ten persons without much crowding. in this boat we were in the habit of going on some of the maddest freaks in the world; and, when i now think of them, it appears to me a thousand wonders that i am alive to-day. i will relate one of these adventures by way of introduction to a longer and more momentous narrative. one night there was a party at mr. barnard’s, and both augustus and myself were not a little intoxicated toward the close of it. as usual, in such cases, i took part of his bed in preference to going home. he went to sleep, as i thought, very quietly (it being near one when the party broke up), and without saying a word on his favorite topic. it might have been half an hour from the time of our getting in bed, and i was just about falling into a doze, when he suddenly started up, and swore with a terrible oath that he would not go to sleep for any arthur pym in christendom, when there was so glorious a breeze from the southwest. i never was so astonished in my life, not knowing what he intended, and thinking that the wines and liquors he had drunk had set him entirely beside himself. he proceeded to talk very coolly, however, saying he knew that i supposed him intoxicated, but that he was never more sober in his life. he was only tired, he added, of lying in bed on such a fine night like a dog, and was determined to get up and dress, and go out on a frolic with the boat. i can hardly tell what possessed me, but the words were no sooner out of his mouth than i felt a thrill of the greatest excitement and pleasure, and thought his mad idea one of the most delightful and most reasonable things in the world. it was blowing almost a gale, and the weather was very cold--it being late in october. i sprang out of bed, nevertheless, in a kind of ecstasy, and told him i was quite as brave as himself, and quite as tired as he was of lying in bed like a dog, and quite as ready for any fun or frolic as any augustus barnard in nantucket. we lost no time in getting on our clothes and hurrying down to the boat. she was lying at the old decayed wharf by the lumber-yard of pankey & co., and almost thumping her side out against the rough logs. augustus got into her and bailed her, for she was nearly half full of water. this being done, we hoisted jib and mainsail, kept full, and started boldly out to sea. the wind, as i before said, blew freshly from the southwest. the night was very clear and cold. augustus had taken the helm, and i stationed myself by the mast, on the deck of the cuddy. we flew along at a great rate--neither of us having said a word since casting loose from the wharf. i now asked my companion what course he intended to steer, and what time he thought it probable we should get back. he whistled for a few minutes, and then said crustily: “_i_ am going to sea--_you_ may go home if you think proper.” turning my eyes upon him, i perceived at once that, in spite of his assumed _nonchalance_, he was greatly agitated. i could see him distinctly by the light of the moon--his face was paler than any marble, and his hand shook so excessively that he could scarcely retain hold of the tiller. i found that something had gone wrong, and became seriously alarmed. at this period i knew little about the management of a boat, and was now depending entirely upon the nautical skill of my friend. the wind, too, had suddenly increased, as we were fast getting out of the lee of the land--still i was ashamed to betray any trepidation, and for almost half an hour maintained a resolute silence. i could stand it no longer, however, and spoke to augustus about the propriety of turning back. as before, it was nearly a minute before he made answer, or took any notice of my suggestion. “by-and-by,” said he at length--“time enough--home by-and-by.” i had expected a similar reply, but there was something in the tone of these words which filled me with an indescribable feeling of dread. i again looked at the speaker attentively. his lips were perfectly livid, and his knees shook so violently together that he seemed scarcely able to stand. “for god’s sake, augustus,” i screamed, now heartily frightened, “what ails you?--what is the matter?--what _are_ you going to do?” “matter!” he stammered, in the greatest apparent surprise, letting go the tiller at the same moment, and falling forward into the bottom of the boat--“matter--why, nothing is the--matter--going home--d--d--don’t you see?” the whole truth now flashed upon me. i flew to him and raised him up. he was drunk--beastly drunk--he could no longer either stand, speak, or see. his eyes were perfectly glazed; and as i let him go in the extremity of my despair, he rolled like a mere log into the bilge-water, from which i had lifted him. it was evident that, during the evening, he had drunk far more than i suspected, and that his conduct in bed had been the result of a highly-concentrated state of intoxication--a state which, like madness, frequently enables the victim to imitate the outward demeanour of one in perfect possession of his senses. the coolness of the night air, however, had had its usual effect--the mental energy began to yield before its influence--and the confused perception which he no doubt then had of his perilous situation had assisted in hastening the catastrophe. he was now thoroughly insensible, and there was no probability that he would be otherwise for many hours. it is hardly possible to conceive the extremity of my terror. the fumes of the wine lately taken had evaporated, leaving me doubly timid and irresolute. i knew that i was altogether incapable of managing the boat, and that a fierce wind and strong ebb tide were hurrying us to destruction. a storm was evidently gathering behind us; we had neither compass nor provisions; and it was clear that, if we held our present course, we should be out of sight of land before daybreak. these thoughts, with a crowd of others equally fearful, flashed through my mind with a bewildering rapidity, and for some moments paralyzed me beyond the possibility of making any exertion. the boat was going through the water at a terrible rate--full before the wind--no reef in either jib or mainsail--running her bows completely under the foam. it was a thousand wonders she did not broach to--augustus having let go the tiller, as i said before, and i being too much agitated to think of taking it myself. by good luck, however, she kept steady, and gradually i recovered some degree of presence of mind. still the wind was increasing fearfully, and whenever we rose from a plunge forward, the sea behind fell combing over our counter, and deluged us with water. i was so utterly benumbed, too, in every limb, as to be nearly unconscious of sensation. at length i summoned up the resolution of despair, and rushing to the mainsail let it go by the run. as might have been expected, it flew over the bows, and, getting drenched with water, carried away the mast short off by the board. this latter accident alone saved me from instant destruction. under the jib only, i now boomed along before the wind, shipping heavy seas occasionally over the counter, but relieved from the terror of immediate death. i took the helm, and breathed with greater freedom as i found that there yet remained to us a chance of ultimate escape. augustus still lay senseless in the bottom of the boat; and as there was imminent danger of his drowning (the water being nearly a foot deep just where he fell), i contrived to raise him partially up, and keep him in a sitting position, by passing a rope round his waist, and lashing it to a ringbolt in the deck of the cuddy. having thus arranged every thing as well as i could in my chilled and agitated condition, i recommended myself to god, and made up my mind to bear whatever might happen with all the fortitude in my power. hardly had i come to this resolution, when, suddenly, a loud and long scream or yell, as if from the throats of a thousand demons, seemed to pervade the whole atmosphere around and above the boat. never while i live shall i forget the intense agony of terror i experienced at that moment. my hair stood erect on my head--i felt the blood congealing in my veins--my heart ceased utterly to beat, and without having once raised my eyes to learn the source of my alarm, i tumbled headlong and insensible upon the body of my fallen companion. i found myself, upon reviving, in the cabin of a large whaling-ship (the penguin) bound to nantucket. several persons were standing over me, and augustus, paler than death, was busily occupied in chafing my hands. upon seeing me open my eyes, his exclamations of gratitude and joy excited alternate laughter and tears from the rough-looking personages who were present. the mystery of our being in existence was now soon explained. we had been run down by the whaling-ship, which was close-hauled, beating up to nantucket with every sail she could venture to set, and consequently running almost at right angles to our own course. several men were on the look-out forward, but did not perceive our boat until it was an impossibility to avoid coming in contact--their shouts of warning upon seeing us were what so terribly alarmed me. the huge ship, i was told, rode immediately over us with as much ease as our own little vessel would have passed over a feather, and without the least perceptible impediment to her progress. not a scream arose from the deck of the victim--there was a slight grating sound to be heard mingling with the roar of wind and water, as the frail bark which was swallowed up rubbed for a moment along the keel of her destroyer--but this was all. thinking our boat (which it will be remembered was dismasted) some mere shell cut adrift as useless, the captain (captain e. t. v. block, of new london) was for proceeding on his course without troubling himself further about the matter. luckily, there were two of the look-out who swore positively to having seen some person at our helm, and represented the possibility of yet saving him. a discussion ensued, when block grew angry, and, after a while, said that “it was no business of his to be eternally watching for egg-shells; that the ship should not put about for any such nonsense; and if there was a man run down, it was nobody’s fault but his own, he might drown and be dammed” or some language to that effect. henderson, the first mate, now took the matter up, being justly indignant, as well as the whole ship’s crew, at a speech evincing so base a degree of heartless atrocity. he spoke plainly, seeing himself upheld by the men, told the captain he considered him a fit subject for the gallows, and that he would disobey his orders if he were hanged for it the moment he set his foot on shore. he strode aft, jostling block (who turned pale and made no answer) on one side, and seizing the helm, gave the word, in a firm voice, hard-a-lee! the men flew to their posts, and the ship went cleverly about. all this had occupied nearly five minutes, and it was supposed to be hardly within the bounds of possibility that any individual could be saved--allowing any to have been on board the boat. yet, as the reader has seen, both augustus and myself were rescued; and our deliverance seemed to have been brought about by two of those almost inconceivable pieces of good fortune which are attributed by the wise and pious to the special interference of providence. while the ship was yet in stays, the mate lowered the jolly-boat and jumped into her with the very two men, i believe, who spoke up as having seen me at the helm. they had just left the lee of the vessel (the moon still shining brightly) when she made a long and heavy roll to windward, and henderson, at the same moment, starting up in his seat bawled out to his crew to back water. he would say nothing else--repeating his cry impatiently, back water! back water! the men put back as speedily as possible, but by this time the ship had gone round, and gotten fully under headway, although all hands on board were making great exertions to take in sail. in despite of the danger of the attempt, the mate clung to the main-chains as soon as they came within his reach. another huge lurch now brought the starboard side of the vessel out of water nearly as far as her keel, when the cause of his anxiety was rendered obvious enough. the body of a man was seen to be affixed in the most singular manner to the smooth and shining bottom (the penguin was coppered and copper-fastened), and beating violently against it with every movement of the hull. after several ineffectual efforts, made during the lurches of the ship, and at the imminent risk of swamping the boat i was finally disengaged from my perilous situation and taken on board--for the body proved to be my own. it appeared that one of the timber-bolts having started and broken a passage through the copper, it had arrested my progress as i passed under the ship, and fastened me in so extraordinary a manner to her bottom. the head of the bolt had made its way through the collar of the green baize jacket i had on, and through the back part of my neck, forcing itself out between two sinews and just below the right ear. i was immediately put to bed--although life seemed to be totally extinct. there was no surgeon on board. the captain, however, treated me with every attention--to make amends, i presume, in the eyes of his crew, for his atrocious behaviour in the previous portion of the adventure. in the meantime, henderson had again put off from the ship, although the wind was now blowing almost a hurricane. he had not been gone many minutes when he fell in with some fragments of our boat, and shortly afterward one of the men with him asserted that he could distinguish a cry for help at intervals amid the roaring of the tempest. this induced the hardy seamen to persevere in their search for more than half an hour, although repeated signals to return were made them by captain block, and although every moment on the water in so frail a boat was fraught to them with the most imminent and deadly peril. indeed, it is nearly impossible to conceive how the small jolly they were in could have escaped destruction for a single instant. she was built, however, for the whaling service, and was fitted, as i have since had reason to believe, with air-boxes, in the manner of some life-boats used on the coast of wales. after searching in vain for about the period of time just mentioned, it was determined to get back to the ship. they had scarcely made this resolve when a feeble cry arose from a dark object that floated rapidly by. they pursued and soon overtook it. it proved to be the entire deck of the ariel’s cuddy. augustus was struggling near it, apparently in the last agonies. upon getting hold of him it was found that he was attached by a rope to the floating timber. this rope, it will be remembered, i had myself tied around his waist, and made fast to a ringbolt, for the purpose of keeping him in an upright position, and my so doing, it appeared, had been ultimately the means of preserving his life. the ariel was slightly put together, and in going down her frame naturally went to pieces; the deck of the cuddy, as might have been expected, was lifted, by the force of the water rushing in, entirely from the main timbers, and floated (with other fragments, no doubt) to the surface--augustus was buoyed up with it, and thus escaped a terrible death. it was more than an hour after being taken on board the penguin before he could give any account of himself, or be made to comprehend the nature of the accident which had befallen our boat. at length he became thoroughly aroused, and spoke much of his sensations while in the water. upon his first attaining any degree of consciousness, he found himself beneath the surface, whirling round and round with inconceivable rapidity, and with a rope wrapped in three or four folds tightly about his neck. in an instant afterward he felt himself going rapidly upward, when, his head striking violently against a hard substance, he again relapsed into insensibility. upon once more reviving he was in fuller possession of his reason--this was still, however, in the greatest degree clouded and confused. he now knew that some accident had occurred, and that he was in the water, although his mouth was above the surface, and he could breathe with some freedom. possibly, at this period the deck was drifting rapidly before the wind, and drawing him after it, as he floated upon his back. of course, as long as he could have retained this position, it would have been nearly impossible that he should be drowned. presently a surge threw him directly athwart the deck, and this post he endeavored to maintain, screaming at intervals for help. just before he was discovered by mr. henderson, he had been obliged to relax his hold through exhaustion, and, falling into the sea, had given himself up for lost. during the whole period of his struggles he had not the faintest recollection of the ariel, nor of the matters in connexion with the source of his disaster. a vague feeling of terror and despair had taken entire possession of his faculties. when he was finally picked up, every power of his mind had failed him; and, as before said, it was nearly an hour after getting on board the penguin before he became fully aware of his condition. in regard to myself--i was resuscitated from a state bordering very nearly upon death (and after every other means had been tried in vain for three hours and a half) by vigorous friction with flannels bathed in hot oil--a proceeding suggested by augustus. the wound in my neck, although of an ugly appearance, proved of little real consequence, and i soon recovered from its effects. the penguin got into port about nine o’clock in the morning, after encountering one of the severest gales ever experienced off nantucket. both augustus and myself managed to appear at mr. barnard’s in time for breakfast--which, luckily, was somewhat late, owing to the party over night. i suppose all at the table were too much fatigued themselves to notice our jaded appearance--of course, it would not have borne a very rigid scrutiny. schoolboys, however, can accomplish wonders in the way of deception, and i verily believe not one of our friends in nantucket had the slightest suspicion that the terrible story told by some sailors in town of their having run down a vessel at sea and drowned some thirty or forty poor devils, had reference either to the ariel, my companion, or myself. we two have since very frequently talked the matter over--but never without a shudder. in one of our conversations augustus frankly confessed to me, that in his whole life he had at no time experienced so excruciating a sense of dismay, as when on board our little boat he first discovered the extent of his intoxication, and felt himself sinking beneath its influence. chapter <UNK> in no affairs of mere prejudice, pro or con, do we deduce inferences with entire certainty, even from the most simple data. it might be supposed that a catastrophe such as i have just related would have effectually cooled my incipient passion for the sea. on the contrary, i never experienced a more ardent longing for the wild adventures incident to the life of a navigator than within a week after our miraculous deliverance. this short period proved amply long enough to erase from my memory the shadows, and bring out in vivid light all the pleasurably exciting points of color, all the picturesqueness, of the late perilous accident. my conversations with augustus grew daily more frequent and more intensely full of interest. he had a manner of relating his stories of the ocean (more than one half of which i now suspect to have been sheer fabrications) well adapted to have weight with one of my enthusiastic temperament and somewhat gloomy although glowing imagination. it is strange, too, that he most strongly enlisted my feelings in behalf of the life of a seaman, when he depicted his more terrible moments of suffering and despair. for the bright side of the painting i had a limited sympathy. my visions were of shipwreck and famine; of death or captivity among barbarian hordes; of a lifetime dragged out in sorrow and tears, upon some gray and desolate rock, in an ocean unapproachable and unknown. such visions or desires--for they amounted to desires--are common, i have since been assured, to the whole numerous race of the melancholy among men--at the time of which i speak i regarded them only as prophetic glimpses of a destiny which i felt myself in a measure bound to fulfil. augustus thoroughly entered into my state of mind. it is probable, indeed, that our intimate communion had resulted in a partial interchange of character. about eighteen months after the period of the ariel’s disaster, the firm of lloyd and vredenburgh (a house connected in some manner with the messieurs enderby, i believe, of liverpool) were engaged in repairing and fitting out the brig grampus for a whaling voyage. she was an old hulk, and scarcely seaworthy when all was done to her that could be done. i hardly know why she was chosen in preference to other good vessels belonging to the same owners--but so it was. mr. barnard was appointed to command her, and augustus was going with him. while the brig was getting ready, he frequently urged upon me the excellency of the opportunity now offered for indulging my desire of travel. he found me by no means an unwilling listener--yet the matter could not be so easily arranged. my father made no direct opposition; but my mother went into hysterics at the bare mention of the design; and, more than all, my grandfather, from whom i expected much, vowed to cut me off with a shilling if i should ever broach the subject to him again. these difficulties, however, so far from abating my desire, only added fuel to the flame. i determined to go at all hazards; and, having made known my intentions to augustus, we set about arranging a plan by which it might be accomplished. in the meantime i forbore speaking to any of my relations in regard to the voyage, and, as i busied myself ostensibly with my usual studies, it was supposed that i had abandoned the design. i have since frequently examined my conduct on this occasion with sentiments of displeasure as well as of surprise. the intense hypocrisy i made use of for the furtherance of my project--an hypocrisy pervading every word and action of my life for so long a period of time--could only have been rendered tolerable to myself by the wild and burning expectation with which i looked forward to the fulfilment of my long-cherished visions of travel. in pursuance of my scheme of deception, i was necessarily obliged to leave much to the management of augustus, who was employed for the greater part of every day on board the grampus, attending to some arrangements for his father in the cabin and cabin hold. at night, however, we were sure to have a conference and talk over our hopes. after nearly a month passed in this manner, without our hitting upon any plan we thought likely to succeed, he told me at last that he had determined upon everything necessary. i had a relation living in new bedford, a mr. ross, at whose house i was in the habit of spending occasionally two or three weeks at a time. the brig was to sail about the middle of june (june, <UNK> and it was agreed that, a day or two before her putting to sea, my father was to receive a note, as usual, from mr. ross, asking me to come over and spend a fortnight with robert and emmet (his sons). augustus charged himself with the inditing of this note and getting it delivered. having set out as supposed, for new bedford, i was then to report myself to my companion, who would contrive a hiding-place for me in the grampus. this hiding-place, he assured me, would be rendered sufficiently comfortable for a residence of many days, during which i was not to make my appearance. when the brig had proceeded so far on her course as to make any turning back a matter out of question, i should then, he said, be formally installed in all the comforts of the cabin; and as to his father, he would only laugh heartily at the joke. vessels enough would be met with by which a letter might be sent home explaining the adventure to my parents. the middle of june at length arrived, and every thing had been matured. the note was written and delivered, and on a monday morning i left the house for the new bedford packet, as supposed. i went, however, straight to augustus, who was waiting for me at the corner of a street. it had been our original plan that i should keep out of the way until dark, and then slip on board the brig; but, as there was now a thick fog in our favor, it was agreed to lose no time in secreting me. augustus led the way to the wharf, and i followed at a little distance, enveloped in a thick seaman’s cloak, which he had brought with him, so that my person might not be easily recognized. just as we turned the second corner, after passing mr. edmund’s well, who should appear, standing right in front of me, and looking me full in the face, but old mr. peterson, my grandfather. “why, bless my soul, gordon,” said he, after a long pause, “why, why,--whose dirty cloak is that you have on?” “sir!” i replied, assuming, as well as i could, in the exigency of the moment, an air of offended surprise, and talking in the gruffest of all imaginable tones--“sir! you are a sum’mat mistaken--my name, in the first place, bee’nt nothing at all like goddin, and i’d want you for to know better, you blackguard, than to call my new obercoat a darty one.” for my life i could hardly refrain from screaming with laughter at the odd manner in which the old gentleman received this handsome rebuke. he started back two or three steps, turned first pale and then excessively red, threw up his spectacles, then, putting them down, ran full tilt at me, with his umbrella uplifted. he stopped short, however, in his career, as if struck with a sudden recollection; and presently, turning round, hobbled off down the street, shaking all the while with rage, and muttering between his teeth: “won’t do--new glasses--thought it was gordon--d--d good-for-nothing salt water long tom.” after this narrow escape we proceeded with greater caution, and arrived at our point of destination in safety. there were only one or two of the hands on board, and these were busy forward, doing something to the forecastle combings. captain barnard, we knew very well, was engaged at lloyd and vredenburgh’s, and would remain there until late in the evening, so we had little to apprehend on his account. augustus went first up the vessel’s side, and in a short while i followed him, without being noticed by the men at work. we proceeded at once into the cabin, and found no person there. it was fitted up in the most comfortable style--a thing somewhat unusual in a whaling-vessel. there were four very excellent staterooms, with wide and convenient berths. there was also a large stove, i took notice, and a remarkably thick and valuable carpet covering the floor of both the cabin and staterooms. the ceiling was full seven feet high, and, in short, every thing appeared of a more roomy and agreeable nature than i had anticipated. augustus, however, would allow me but little time for observation, insisting upon the necessity of my concealing myself as soon as possible. he led the way into his own stateroom, which was on the starboard side of the brig, and next to the bulkheads. upon entering, he closed the door and bolted it. i thought i had never seen a nicer little room than the one in which i now found myself. it was about ten feet long, and had only one berth, which, as i said before, was wide and convenient. in that portion of the closet nearest the bulkheads there was a space of four feet square, containing a table, a chair, and a set of hanging shelves full of books, chiefly books of voyages and travels. there were many other little comforts in the room, among which i ought not to forget a kind of safe or refrigerator, in which augustus pointed out to me a host of delicacies, both in the eating and drinking department. he now pressed with his knuckles upon a certain spot of the carpet in one corner of the space just mentioned, letting me know that a portion of the flooring, about sixteen inches square, had been neatly cut out and again adjusted. as he pressed, this portion rose up at one end sufficiently to allow the passage of his finger beneath. in this manner he raised the mouth of the trap (to which the carpet was still fastened by tacks), and i found that it led into the after hold. he next lit a small taper by means of a phosphorous match, and, placing the light in a dark lantern, descended with it through the opening, bidding me follow. i did so, and he then pulled the cover upon the hole, by means of a nail driven into the under side--the carpet, of course, resuming its original position on the floor of the stateroom, and all traces of the aperture being concealed. the taper gave out so feeble a ray that it was with the greatest difficulty i could grope my way through the confused mass of lumber among which i now found myself. by degrees, however, my eyes became accustomed to the gloom, and i proceeded with less trouble, holding on to the skirts of my friend’s coat. he brought me, at length, after creeping and winding through innumerable narrow passages, to an iron-bound box, such as is used sometimes for packing fine earthenware. it was nearly four feet high, and full six long, but very narrow. two large empty oil-casks lay on the top of it, and above these, again, a vast quantity of straw matting, piled up as high as the floor of the cabin. in every other direction around was wedged as closely as possible, even up to the ceiling, a complete chaos of almost every species of ship-furniture, together with a heterogeneous medley of crates, hampers, barrels, and bales, so that it seemed a matter no less than miraculous that we had discovered any passage at all to the box. i afterward found that augustus had purposely arranged the stowage in this hold with a view to affording me a thorough concealment, having had only one assistant in the labour, a man not going out in the brig. my companion now showed me that one of the ends of the box could be removed at pleasure. he slipped it aside and displayed the interior, at which i was excessively amused. a mattress from one of the cabin berths covered the whole of its bottom, and it contained almost every article of mere comfort which could be crowded into so small a space, allowing me, at the same time, sufficient room for my accommodation, either in a sitting position or lying at full length. among other things, there were some books, pen, ink, and paper, three blankets, a large jug full of water, a keg of sea-biscuit, three or four immense bologna sausages, an enormous ham, a cold leg of roast mutton, and half a dozen bottles of cordials and liqueurs. i proceeded immediately to take possession of my little apartment, and this with feelings of higher satisfaction, i am sure, than any monarch ever experienced upon entering a new palace. augustus now pointed out to me the method of fastening the open end of the box, and then, holding the taper close to the deck, showed me a piece of dark whipcord lying along it. this, he said, extended from my hiding-place throughout all the necessary windings among the lumber, to a nail which was driven into the deck of the hold, immediately beneath the trap-door leading into his stateroom. by means of this cord i should be enabled readily to trace my way out without his guidance, provided any unlooked-for accident should render such a step necessary. he now took his departure, leaving with me the lantern, together with a copious supply of tapers and phosphorous, and promising to pay me a visit as often as he could contrive to do so without observation. this was on the seventeenth of june. i remained three days and nights (as nearly as i could guess) in my hiding-place without getting out of it at all, except twice for the purpose of stretching my limbs by standing erect between two crates just opposite the opening. during the whole period i saw nothing of augustus; but this occasioned me little uneasiness, as i knew the brig was expected to put to sea every hour, and in the bustle he would not easily find opportunities of coming down to me. at length i heard the trap open and shut, and presently he called in a low voice, asking if all was well, and if there was any thing i wanted. “nothing,” i replied; “i am as comfortable as can be; when will the brig sail?” “she will be under weigh in less than half an hour,” he answered. “i came to let you know, and for fear you should be uneasy at my absence. i shall not have a chance of coming down again for some time--perhaps for three or four days more. all is going on right aboveboard. after i go up and close the trap, do you creep along by the whipcord to where the nail is driven in. you will find my watch there--it may be useful to you, as you have no daylight to keep time by. i suppose you can’t tell how long you have been buried--only three days--this is the twentieth. i would bring the watch to your box, but am afraid of being missed.” with this he went up. in about an hour after he had gone i distinctly felt the brig in motion, and congratulated myself upon having at length fairly commenced a voyage. satisfied with this idea, i determined to make my mind as easy as possible, and await the course of events until i should be permitted to exchange the box for the more roomy, although hardly more comfortable, accommodations of the cabin. my first care was to get the watch. leaving the taper burning, i groped along in the dark, following the cord through windings innumerable, in some of which i discovered that, after toiling a long distance, i was brought back within a foot or two of a former position. at length i reached the nail, and securing the object of my journey, returned with it in safety. i now looked over the books which had been so thoughtfully provided, and selected the expedition of lewis and clarke to the mouth of the columbia. with this i amused myself for some time, when, growing sleepy, i extinguished the light with great care, and soon fell into a sound slumber. upon awakening i felt strangely confused in mind, and some time elapsed before i could bring to recollection all the various circumstances of my situation. by degrees, however, i remembered all. striking a light, i looked at the watch; but it was run down, and there were, consequently, no means of determining how long i slept. my limbs were greatly cramped, and i was forced to relieve them by standing between the crates. presently feeling an almost ravenous appetite, i bethought myself of the cold mutton, some of which i had eaten just before going to sleep, and found excellent. what was my astonishment in discovering it to be in a state of absolute putrefaction! this circumstance occasioned me great disquietude; for, connecting it with the disorder of mind i experienced upon awakening, i began to suppose that i must have slept for an inordinately long period of time. the close atmosphere of the hold might have had something to do with this, and might, in the end, be productive of the most serious results. my head ached excessively; i fancied that i drew every breath with difficulty; and, in short, i was oppressed with a multitude of gloomy feelings. still i could not venture to make any disturbance by opening the trap or otherwise, and, having wound up the watch, contented myself as well as possible. throughout the whole of the next tedious twenty-four hours no person came to my relief, and i could not help accusing augustus of the grossest inattention. what alarmed me chiefly was, that the water in my jug was reduced to about half a pint, and i was suffering much from thirst, having eaten freely of the bologna sausages after the loss of my mutton. i became very uneasy, and could no longer take any interest in my books. i was overpowered, too, with a desire to sleep, yet trembled at the thought of indulging it, lest there might exist some pernicious influence, like that of burning charcoal, in the confined air of the hold. in the meantime the roll of the brig told me that we were far in the main ocean, and a dull humming sound, which reached my ears as if from an immense distance, convinced me no ordinary gale was blowing. i could not imagine a reason for the absence of augustus. we were surely far enough advanced on our voyage to allow of my going up. some accident might have happened to him--but i could think of none which would account for his suffering me to remain so long a prisoner, except, indeed, his having suddenly died or fallen overboard, and upon this idea i could not dwell with any degree of patience. it was possible that we had been baffled by head winds, and were still in the near vicinity of nantucket. this notion, however, i was forced to abandon; for such being the case, the brig must have frequently gone about; and i was entirely satisfied, from her continual inclination to the larboard, that she had been sailing all along with a steady breeze on her starboard quarter. besides, granting that we were still in the neighborhood of the island, why should not augustus have visited me and informed me of the circumstance? pondering in this manner upon the difficulties of my solitary and cheerless condition, i resolved to wait yet another twenty-four hours, when, if no relief were obtained, i would make my way to the trap, and endeavour either to hold a parley with my friend, or get at least a little fresh air through the opening, and a further supply of water from the stateroom. while occupied with this thought, however, i fell in spite of every exertion to the contrary, into a state of profound sleep, or rather stupor. my dreams were of the most terrific description. every species of calamity and horror befell me. among other miseries i was smothered to death between huge pillows, by demons of the most ghastly and ferocious aspect. immense serpents held me in their embrace, and looked earnestly in my face with their fearfully shining eyes. then deserts, limitless, and of the most forlorn and awe-inspiring character, spread themselves out before me. immensely tall trunks of trees, gray and leafless, rose up in endless succession as far as the eye could reach. their roots were concealed in wide-spreading morasses, whose dreary water lay intensely black, still, and altogether terrible, beneath. and the strange trees seemed endowed with a human vitality, and waving to and fro their skeleton arms, were crying to the silent waters for mercy, in the shrill and piercing accents of the most acute agony and despair. the scene changed; and i stood, naked and alone, amidst the burning sand-plains of sahara. at my feet lay crouched a fierce lion of the tropics. suddenly his wild eyes opened and fell upon me. with a conclusive bound he sprang to his feet, and laid bare his horrible teeth. in another instant there burst from his red throat a roar like the thunder of the firmament, and i fell impetuously to the earth. stifling in a paroxysm of terror, i at last found myself partially awake. my dream, then, was not all a dream. now, at least, i was in possession of my senses. the paws of some huge and real monster were pressing heavily upon my bosom--his hot breath was in my ear--and his white and ghastly fangs were gleaming upon me through the gloom. had a thousand lives hung upon the movement of a limb or the utterance of a syllable, i could have neither stirred nor spoken. the beast, whatever it was, retained his position without attempting any immediate violence, while i lay in an utterly helpless, and, i fancied, a dying condition beneath him. i felt that my powers of body and mind were fast leaving me--in a word, that i was perishing, and perishing of sheer fright. my brain swam--i grew deadly sick--my vision failed--even the glaring eyeballs above me grew dim. making a last strong effort, i at length breathed a faint ejaculation to god, and resigned myself to die. the sound of my voice seemed to arouse all the latent fury of the animal. he precipitated himself at full length upon my body; but what was my astonishment, when, with a long and low whine, he commenced licking my face and hands with the greatest eagerness, and with the most extravagant demonstration of affection and joy! i was bewildered, utterly lost in amazement--but i could not forget the peculiar whine of my newfoundland dog tiger, and the odd manner of his caresses i well knew. it was he. i experienced a sudden rush of blood to my temples--a giddy and overpowering sense of deliverance and reanimation. i rose hurriedly from the mattress upon which i had been lying, and, throwing myself upon the neck of my faithful follower and friend, relieved the long oppression of my bosom in a flood of the most passionate tears. as upon a former occasion my conceptions were in a state of the greatest indistinctness and confusion after leaving the mattress. for a long time i found it nearly impossible to connect any ideas; but, by very slow degrees, my thinking faculties returned, and i again called to memory the several incidents of my condition. for the presence of tiger i tried in vain to account; and after busying myself with a thousand different conjectures respecting him, was forced to content myself with rejoicing that he was with me to share my dreary solitude, and render me comfort by his caresses. most people love their dogs--but for tiger i had an affection far more ardent than common; and never, certainly, did any creature more truly deserve it. for seven years he had been my inseparable companion, and in a multitude of instances had given evidence of all the noble qualities for which we value the animal. i had rescued him, when a puppy, from the clutches of a malignant little villain in nantucket who was leading him, with a rope around his neck, to the water; and the grown dog repaid the obligation, about three years afterward, by saving me from the bludgeon of a street robber. getting now hold of the watch, i found, upon applying it to my ear, that it had again run down; but at this i was not at all surprised, being convinced, from the peculiar state of my feelings, that i had slept, as before, for a very long period of time, how long, it was of course impossible to say. i was burning up with fever, and my thirst was almost intolerable. i felt about the box for my little remaining supply of water, for i had no light, the taper having burnt to the socket of the lantern, and the phosphorus-box not coming readily to hand. upon finding the jug, however, i discovered it to be empty--tiger, no doubt, having been tempted to drink it, as well as to devour the remnant of mutton, the bone of which lay, well picked, by the opening of the box. the spoiled meat i could well spare, but my heart sank as i thought of the water. i was feeble in the extreme--so much so that i shook all over, as with an ague, at the slightest movement or exertion. to add to my troubles, the brig was pitching and rolling with great violence, and the oil-casks which lay upon my box were in momentary danger of falling down, so as to block up the only way of ingress or egress. i felt, also, terrible sufferings from sea-sickness. these considerations determined me to make my way, at all hazards, to the trap, and obtain immediate relief, before i should be incapacitated from doing so altogether. having come to this resolve, i again felt about for the phosphorus-box and tapers. the former i found after some little trouble; but, not discovering the tapers as soon as i had expected (for i remembered very nearly the spot in which i had placed them), i gave up the search for the present, and bidding tiger lie quiet, began at once my journey toward the trap. in this attempt my great feebleness became more than ever apparent. it was with the utmost difficulty i could crawl along at all, and very frequently my limbs sank suddenly from beneath me; when, falling prostrate on my face, i would remain for some minutes in a state bordering on insensibility. still i struggled forward by slow degrees, dreading every moment that i should swoon amid the narrow and intricate windings of the lumber, in which event i had nothing but death to expect as the result. at length, upon making a push forward with all the energy i could command, i struck my forehead violently against the sharp corner of an iron-bound crate. the accident only stunned me for a few moments; but i found, to my inexpressible grief, that the quick and violent roll of the vessel had thrown the crate entirely across my path, so as effectually to block up the passage. with my utmost exertions i could not move it a single inch from its position, it being closely wedged in among the surrounding boxes and ship-furniture. it became necessary, therefore, enfeebled as i was, either to leave the guidance of the whipcord and seek out a new passage, or to climb over the obstacle, and resume the path on the other side. the former alternative presented too many difficulties and dangers to be thought of without a shudder. in my present weak state of both mind and body, i should infallibly lose my way if i attempted it, and perish miserably amid the dismal and disgusting labyrinths of the hold. i proceeded, therefore, without hesitation, to summon up all my remaining strength and fortitude, and endeavour, as i best might, to clamber over the crate. upon standing erect, with this end in view, i found the undertaking even a more serious task than my fears had led me to imagine. on each side of the narrow passage arose a complete wall of various heavy lumber, which the least blunder on my part might be the means of bringing down upon my head; or, if this accident did not occur, the path might be effectually blocked up against my return by the descending mass, as it was in front by the obstacle there. the crate itself was a long and unwieldy box, upon which no foothold could be obtained. in vain i attempted, by every means in my power, to reach the top, with the hope of being thus enabled to draw myself up. had i succeeded in reaching it, it is certain that my strength would have proved utterly inadequate to the task of getting over, and it was better in every respect that i failed. at length, in a desperate effort to force the crate from its ground, i felt a strong vibration in the side next me. i thrust my hand eagerly to the edge of the planks, and found that a very large one was loose. with my pocket-knife, which, luckily, i had with me, i succeeded, after great labour, in prying it entirely off; and getting it through the aperture, discovered, to my exceeding joy, that there were no boards on the opposite side--in other words, that the top was wanting, it being the bottom through which i had forced my way. i now met with no important difficulty in proceeding along the line until i finally reached the nail. with a beating heart i stood erect, and with a gentle touch pressed against the cover of the trap. it did not rise as soon as i had expected, and i pressed it with somewhat more determination, still dreading lest some other person than augustus might be in his state-room. the door, however, to my astonishment, remained steady, and i became somewhat uneasy, for i knew that it had formerly required but little or no effort to remove it. i pushed it strongly--it was nevertheless firm: with all my strength--it still did not give way: with rage, with fury, with despair--it set at defiance my utmost efforts; and it was evident, from the unyielding nature of the resistance, that the hole had either been discovered and effectually nailed up, or that some immense weight had been placed upon it, which it was useless to think of removing. my sensations were those of extreme horror and dismay. in vain i attempted to reason on the probable cause of my being thus entombed. i could summon up no connected chain of reflection, and, sinking on the floor, gave way, unresistingly, to the most gloomy imaginings, in which the dreadful deaths of thirst, famine, suffocation, and premature interment crowded upon me as the prominent disasters to be encountered. at length there returned to me some portion of presence of mind. i arose, and felt with my fingers for the seams or cracks of the aperture. having found them, i examined them closely to ascertain if they emitted any light from the state-room; but none was visible. i then forced the blade of my pen-knife through them, until i met with some hard obstacle. scraping against it, i discovered it to be a solid mass of iron, which, from its peculiar wavy feel as i passed the blade along it, i concluded to be a chain-cable. the only course now left me was to retrace my way to the box, and there either yield to my sad fate, or try so to tranquilize my mind as to admit of my arranging some plan of escape. i immediately set about the attempt, and succeeded, after innumerable difficulties, in getting back. as i sank, utterly exhausted, upon the mattress, tiger threw himself at full length by my side, and seemed as if desirous, by his caresses, of consoling me in my troubles, and urging me to bear them with fortitude. the singularity of his behavior at length forcibly arrested my attention. after licking my face and hands for some minutes, he would suddenly cease doing so, and utter a low whine. upon reaching out my hand toward him, i then invariably found him lying on his back, with his paws uplifted. this conduct, so frequently repeated, appeared strange, and i could in no manner account for it. as the dog seemed distressed, i concluded that he had received some injury; and, taking his paws in my hands, i examined them one by one, but found no sign of any hurt. i then supposed him hungry, and gave him a large piece of ham, which he devoured with avidity--afterward, however, resuming his extraordinary manoeuvres. i now imagined that he was suffering, like myself, the torments of thirst, and was about adopting this conclusion as the true one, when the idea occurred to me that i had as yet only examined his paws, and that there might possibly be a wound upon some portion of his body or head. the latter i felt carefully over, but found nothing. on passing my hand, however, along his back, i perceived a slight erection of the hair extending completely across it. probing this with my finger, i discovered a string, and tracing it up, found that it encircled the whole body. upon a closer scrutiny, i came across a small slip of what had the feeling of letter paper, through which the string had been fastened in such a manner as to bring it immediately beneath the left shoulder of the animal. chapter <UNK> the thought instantly occurred to me that the paper was a note from augustus, and that some unaccountable accident having happened to prevent his relieving me from my dungeon, he had devised this method of acquainting me with the true state of affairs. trembling with eagerness, i now commenced another search for my phosphorus matches and tapers. i had a confused recollection of having put them carefully away just before falling asleep; and, indeed, previously to my last journey to the trap, i had been able to remember the exact spot where i had deposited them. but now i endeavored in vain to call it to mind, and busied myself for a full hour in a fruitless and vexatious search for the missing articles; never, surely, was there a more tantalizing state of anxiety and suspense. at length, while groping about, with my head close to the ballast, near the opening of the box, and outside of it, i perceived a faint glimmering of light in the direction of the steerage. greatly surprised, i endeavored to make my way toward it, as it appeared to be but a few feet from my position. scarcely had i moved with this intention, when i lost sight of the glimmer entirely, and, before i could bring it into view again, was obliged to feel along by the box until i had exactly resumed my original situation. now, moving my head with caution to and fro, i found that, by proceeding slowly, with great care, in an opposite direction to that in which i had at first started, i was enabled to draw near the light, still keeping it in view. presently i came directly upon it (having squeezed my way through innumerable narrow windings), and found that it proceeded from some fragments of my matches lying in an empty barrel turned upon its side. i was wondering how they came in such a place, when my hand fell upon two or three pieces of taper wax, which had been evidently mumbled by the dog. i concluded at once that he had devoured the whole of my supply of candles, and i felt hopeless of being ever able to read the note of augustus. the small remnants of the wax were so mashed up among other rubbish in the barrel, that i despaired of deriving any service from them, and left them as they were. the phosphorus, of which there was only a speck or two, i gathered up as well as i could, and returned with it, after much difficulty, to my box, where tiger had all the while remained. what to do next i could not tell. the hold was so intensely dark that i could not see my hand, however close i would hold it to my face. the white slip of paper could barely be discerned, and not even that when i looked at it directly; by turning the exterior portions of the retina toward it--that is to say, by surveying it slightly askance, i found that it became in some measure perceptible. thus the gloom of my prison may be imagined, and the note of my friend, if indeed it were a note from him, seemed only likely to throw me into further trouble, by disquieting to no purpose my already enfeebled and agitated mind. in vain i revolved in my brain a multitude of absurd expedients for procuring light--such expedients precisely as a man in the perturbed sleep occasioned by opium would be apt to fall upon for a similar purpose--each and all of which appear by turns to the dreamer the most reasonable and the most preposterous of conceptions, just as the reasoning or imaginative faculties flicker, alternately, one above the other. at last an idea occurred to me which seemed rational, and which gave me cause to wonder, very justly, that i had not entertained it before. i placed the slip of paper on the back of a book, and, collecting the fragments of the phosphorus matches which i had brought from the barrel, laid them together upon the paper. i then, with the palm of my hand, rubbed the whole over quickly, yet steadily. a clear light diffused itself immediately throughout the whole surface; and had there been any writing upon it, i should not have experienced the least difficulty, i am sure, in reading it. not a syllable was there, however--nothing but a dreary and unsatisfactory blank; the illumination died away in a few seconds, and my heart died away within me as it went. i have before stated more than once that my intellect, for some period prior to this, had been in a condition nearly bordering on idiocy. there were, to be sure, momentary intervals of perfect sanity, and, now and then, even of energy; but these were few. it must be remembered that i had been, for many days certainly, inhaling the almost pestilential atmosphere of a close hold in a whaling vessel, and for a long portion of that time but scantily supplied with water. for the last fourteen or fifteen hours i had none--nor had i slept during that time. salt provisions of the most exciting kind had been my chief, and, indeed, since the loss of the mutton, my only supply of food, with the exception of the sea-biscuit; and these latter were utterly useless to me, as they were too dry and hard to be swallowed in the swollen and parched condition of my throat. i was now in a high state of fever, and in every respect exceedingly ill. this will account for the fact that many miserable hours of despondency elapsed after my last adventure with the phosphorus, before the thought suggested itself that i had examined only one side of the paper. i shall not attempt to describe my feelings of rage (for i believe i was more angry than any thing else) when the egregious oversight i had committed flashed suddenly upon my perception. the blunder itself would have been unimportant, had not my own folly and impetuosity rendered it otherwise--in my disappointment at not finding some words upon the slip, i had childishly torn it in pieces and thrown it away, it was impossible to say where. from the worst part of this dilemma i was relieved by the sagacity of tiger. having got, after a long search, a small piece of the note, i put it to the dog’s nose, and endeavored to make him understand that he must bring me the rest of it. to my astonishment, (for i had taught him none of the usual tricks for which his breed are famous,) he seemed to enter at once into my meaning, and, rummaging about for a few moments, soon found another considerable portion. bringing me this, he paused awhile, and, rubbing his nose against my hand, appeared to be waiting for my approval of what he had done. i patted him on the head, when he immediately made off again. it was now some minutes before he came back--but when he did come, he brought with him a large slip, which proved to be all the paper missing--it having been torn, it seems, only into three pieces. luckily, i had no trouble in finding what few fragments of the phosphorus were left--being guided by the indistinct glow one or two of the particles still emitted. my difficulties had taught me the necessity of caution, and i now took time to reflect upon what i was about to do. it was very probable, i considered, that some words were written upon that side of the paper which had not been examined--but which side was that? fitting the pieces together gave me no clew in this respect, although it assured me that the words (if there were any) would be found all on one side, and connected in a proper manner, as written. there was the greater necessity of ascertaining the point in question beyond a doubt, as the phosphorus remaining would be altogether insufficient for a third attempt, should i fail in the one i was now about to make. i placed the paper on a book as before, and sat for some minutes thoughtfully revolving the matter over in my mind. at last i thought it barely possible that the written side might have some unevenness on its surface, which a delicate sense of feeling might enable me to detect. i determined to make the experiment and passed my finger very carefully over the side which first presented itself. nothing, however, was perceptible, and i turned the paper, adjusting it on the book. i now again carried my forefinger cautiously along, when i was aware of an exceedingly slight, but still discernable glow, which followed as it proceeded. this, i knew, must arise from some very minute remaining particles of the phosphorus with which i had covered the paper in my previous attempt. the other, or under side, then, was that on which lay the writing, if writing there should finally prove to be. again i turned the note, and went to work as i had previously done. having rubbed in the phosphorus, a brilliancy ensued as before--but this time several lines of ms. in a large hand, and apparently in red ink, became distinctly visible. the glimmer, although sufficiently bright, was but momentary. still, had i not been too greatly excited, there would have been ample time enough for me to peruse the whole three sentences before me--for i saw there were three. in my anxiety, however, to read all at once, i succeeded only in reading the seven concluding words, which thus appeared--“blood--your life depends upon lying close.” had i been able to ascertain the entire contents of the note--the full meaning of the admonition which my friend had thus attempted to convey, that admonition, even although it should have revealed a story of disaster the most unspeakable, could not, i am firmly convinced, have imbued my mind with one tithe of the harrowing and yet indefinable horror with which i was inspired by the fragmentary warning thus received. and “blood,” too, that word of all words--so rife at all times with mystery, and suffering, and terror--how trebly full of import did it now appear--how chilly and heavily (disjointed, as it thus was, from any foregoing words to qualify or render it distinct) did its vague syllables fall, amid the deep gloom of my prison, into the innermost recesses of my soul! augustus had, undoubtedly, good reasons for wishing me to remain concealed, and i formed a thousand surmises as to what they could be--but i could think of nothing affording a satisfactory solution of the mystery. just after returning from my last journey to the trap, and before my attention had been otherwise directed by the singular conduct of tiger, i had come to the resolution of making myself heard at all events by those on board, or, if i could not succeed in this directly, of trying to cut my way through the orlop deck. the half certainty which i felt of being able to accomplish one of these two purposes in the last emergency, had given me courage (which i should not otherwise have had) to endure the evils of my situation. the few words i had been able to read, however, had cut me off from these final resources, and i now, for the first time, felt all the misery of my fate. in a paroxysm of despair i threw myself again upon the mattress, where, for about the period of a day and night, i lay in a kind of stupor, relieved only by momentary intervals of reason and recollection. at length i once more arose, and busied myself in reflection upon the horrors which encompassed me. for another twenty-four hours it was barely possible that i might exist without water--for a longer time i could not do so. during the first portion of my imprisonment i had made free use of the cordials with which augustus had supplied me, but they only served to excite fever, without in the least degree assuaging thirst. i had now only about a gill left, and this was of a species of strong peach liqueur at which my stomach revolted. the sausages were entirely consumed; of the ham nothing remained but a small piece of the skin; and all the biscuit, except a few fragments of one, had been eaten by tiger. to add to my troubles, i found that my headache was increasing momentarily, and with it the species of delirium which had distressed me more or less since my first falling asleep. for some hours past it had been with the greatest difficulty i could breathe at all, and now each attempt at so doing was attended with the most depressing spasmodic action of the chest. but there was still another and very different source of disquietude, and one, indeed, whose harassing terrors had been the chief means of arousing me to exertion from my stupor on the mattress. it arose from the demeanor of the dog. i first observed an alteration in his conduct while rubbing in the phosphorus on the paper in my last attempt. as i rubbed, he ran his nose against my hand with a slight snarl; but i was too greatly excited at the time to pay much attention to the circumstance. soon afterward, it will be remembered, i threw myself on the mattress, and fell into a species of lethargy. presently i became aware of a singular hissing sound close at my ears, and discovered it to proceed from tiger, who was panting and wheezing in a state of the greatest apparent excitement, his eyeballs flashing fiercely through the gloom. i spoke to him, when he replied with a low growl, and then remained quiet. presently i relapsed into my stupor, from which i was again awakened in a similar manner. this was repeated three or four times, until finally his behaviour inspired me with so great a degree of fear, that i became fully aroused. he was now lying close by the door of the box, snarling fearfully, although in a kind of undertone, and grinding his teeth as if strongly convulsed. i had no doubt whatever that the want of water or the confined atmosphere of the hold had driven him mad, and i was at a loss what course to pursue. i could not endure the thought of killing him, yet it seemed absolutely necessary for my own safety. i could distinctly perceive his eyes fastened upon me with an expression of the most deadly animosity, and i expected every instant that he would attack me. at last i could endure my terrible situation no longer, and determined to make my way from the box at all hazards, and dispatch him, if his opposition should render it necessary for me to do so. to get out, i had to pass directly over his body, and he already seemed to anticipate my design--missing himself upon his fore-legs (as i perceived by the altered position of his eyes), and displayed the whole of his white fangs, which were easily discernible. i took the remains of the ham-skin, and the bottle containing the liqueur, and secured them about my person, together with a large carving-knife which augustus had left me--then, folding my cloak around me as closely as possible, i made a movement toward the mouth of the box. no sooner did i do this, than the dog sprang with a loud growl toward my throat. the whole weight of his body struck me on the right shoulder, and i fell violently to the left, while the enraged animal passed entirely over me. i had fallen upon my knees, with my head buried among the blankets, and these protected me from a second furious assault, during which i felt the sharp teeth pressing vigorously upon the woollen which enveloped my neck--yet, luckily, without being able to penetrate all the folds. i was now beneath the dog, and a few moments would place me completely in his power. despair gave me strength, and i rose boldly up, shaking him from me by main force, and dragging with me the blankets from the mattress. these i now threw over him, and before he could extricate himself, i had got through the door and closed it effectually against his pursuit. in this struggle, however, i had been forced to drop the morsel of ham-skin, and i now found my whole stock of provisions reduced to a single gill of liqueur. as this reflection crossed my mind, i felt myself actuated by one of those fits of perverseness which might be supposed to influence a spoiled child in similar circumstances, and, raising the bottle to my lips, i drained it to the last drop, and dashed it furiously upon the floor. scarcely had the echo of the crash died away, when i heard my name pronounced in an eager but subdued voice, issuing from the direction of the steerage. so unexpected was anything of the kind, and so intense was the emotion excited within me by the sound, that i endeavoured in vain to reply. my powers of speech totally failed, and in an agony of terror lest my friend should conclude me dead, and return without attempting to reach me, i stood up between the crates near the door of the box, trembling convulsively, and gasping and struggling for utterance. had a thousand words depended upon a syllable, i could not have spoken it. there was a slight movement now audible among the lumber somewhere forward of my station. the sound presently grew less distinct, then again less so, and still less. shall i ever forget my feelings at this moment? he was going--my friend, my companion, from whom i had a right to expect so much--he was going--he would abandon me--he was gone! he would leave me to perish miserably, to expire in the most horrible and loathesome of dungeons--and one word, one little syllable, would save me--yet that single syllable i could not utter! i felt, i am sure, more than ten thousand times the agonies of death itself. my brain reeled, and i fell, deadly sick, against the end of the box. as i fell the carving-knife was shaken out from the waist-band of my pantaloons, and dropped with a rattling sound to the floor. never did any strain of the richest melody come so sweetly to my ears! with the intensest anxiety i listened to ascertain the effect of the noise upon augustus--for i knew that the person who called my name could be no one but himself. all was silent for some moments. at length i again heard the word “arthur!” repeated in a low tone, and one full of hesitation. reviving hope loosened at once my powers of speech, and i now screamed at the top of my voice, “augustus! oh, augustus!” “hush! for god’s sake be silent!” he replied, in a voice trembling with agitation; “i will be with you immediately--as soon as i can make my way through the hold.” for a long time i heard him moving among the lumber, and every moment seemed to me an age. at length i felt his hand upon my shoulder, and he placed, at the same moment, a bottle of water to my lips. those only who have been suddenly redeemed from the jaws of the tomb, or who have known the insufferable torments of thirst under circumstances as aggravated as those which encompassed me in my dreary prison, can form any idea of the unutterable transports which that one long draught of the richest of all physical luxuries afforded. when i had in some degree satisfied my thirst, augustus produced from his pocket three or four boiled potatoes, which i devoured with the greatest avidity. he had brought with him a light in a dark lantern, and the grateful rays afforded me scarcely less comfort than the food and drink. but i was impatient to learn the cause of his protracted absence, and he proceeded to recount what had happened on board during my incarceration. chapter <UNK> the brig put to sea, as i had supposed, in about an hour after he had left the watch. this was on the twentieth of june. it will be remembered that i had then been in the hold for three days; and, during this period, there was so constant a bustle on board, and so much running to and fro, especially in the cabin and staterooms, that he had had no chance of visiting me without the risk of having the secret of the trap discovered. when at length he did come, i had assured him that i was doing as well as possible; and, therefore, for the two next days he felt but little uneasiness on my account--still, however, watching an opportunity of going down. it was not until the fourth day that he found one. several times during this interval he had made up his mind to let his father know of the adventure, and have me come up at once; but we were still within reaching distance of nantucket, and it was doubtful, from some expressions which had escaped captain barnard, whether he would not immediately put back if he discovered me to be on board. besides, upon thinking the matter over, augustus, so he told me, could not imagine that i was in immediate want, or that i would hesitate, in such case, to make myself heard at the trap. when, therefore, he considered everything he concluded to let me stay until he could meet with an opportunity of visiting me unobserved. this, as i said before, did not occur until the fourth day after his bringing me the watch, and the seventh since i had first entered the hold. he then went down without taking with him any water or provisions, intending in the first place merely to call my attention, and get me to come from the box to the trap,--when he would go up to the stateroom and thence hand me down a supply. when he descended for this purpose he found that i was asleep, for it seems that i was snoring very loudly. from all the calculations i can make on the subject, this must have been the slumber into which i fell just after my return from the trap with the watch, and which, consequently, must have lasted for more than three entire days and nights at the very least. latterly, i have had reason both from my own experience and the assurance of others, to be acquainted with the strong soporific effects of the stench arising from old fish-oil when closely confined; and when i think of the condition of the hold in which i was imprisoned, and the long period during which the brig had been used as a whaling vessel, i am more inclined to wonder that i awoke at all, after once falling asleep, than that i should have slept uninterruptedly for the period specified above. augustus called to me at first in a low voice and without closing the trap--but i made him no reply. he then shut the trap, and spoke to me in a louder, and finally in a very loud tone--still i continued to snore. he was now at a loss what to do. it would take him some time to make his way through the lumber to my box, and in the meanwhile his absence would be noticed by captain barnard, who had occasion for his services every minute, in arranging and copying papers connected with the business of the voyage. he determined, therefore, upon reflection, to ascend, and await another opportunity of visiting me. he was the more easily induced to this resolve, as my slumber appeared to be of the most tranquil nature, and he could not suppose that i had undergone any inconvenience from my incarceration. he had just made up his mind on these points when his attention was arrested by an unusual bustle, the sound of which proceeded apparently from the cabin. he sprang through the trap as quickly as possible, closed it, and threw open the door of his stateroom. no sooner had he put his foot over the threshold than a pistol flashed in his face, and he was knocked down, at the same moment, by a blow from a handspike. a strong hand held him on the cabin floor, with a tight grasp upon his throat; still he was able to see what was going on around him. his father was tied hand and foot, and lying along the steps of the companion-way, with his head down, and a deep wound in the forehead, from which the blood was flowing in a continued stream. he spoke not a word, and was apparently dying. over him stood the first mate, eyeing him with an expression of fiendish derision, and deliberately searching his pockets, from which he presently drew forth a large wallet and a chronometer. seven of the crew (among whom was the cook, a negro) were rummaging the staterooms on the larboard for arms, where they soon equipped themselves with muskets and ammunition. besides augustus and captain barnard, there were nine men altogether in the cabin, and these among the most ruffianly of the brig’s company. the villains now went upon deck, taking my friend with them after having secured his arms behind his back. they proceeded straight to the forecastle, which was fastened down--two of the mutineers standing by it with axes--two also at the main hatch. the mate called out in a loud voice: “do you hear there below? tumble up with you, one by one--now, mark that--and no grumbling!” it was some minutes before any one appeared:--at last an englishman, who had shipped as a raw hand, came up, weeping piteously, and entreating the mate, in the most humble manner, to spare his life. the only reply was a blow on the forehead from an axe. the poor fellow fell to the deck without a groan, and the black cook lifted him up in his arms as he would a child, and tossed him deliberately into the sea. hearing the blow and the plunge of the body, the men below could now be induced to venture on deck neither by threats nor promises, until a proposition was made to smoke them out. a general rush then ensued, and for a moment it seemed possible that the brig might be retaken. the mutineers, however, succeeded at last in closing the forecastle effectually before more than six of their opponents could get up. these six, finding themselves so greatly outnumbered and without arms, submitted after a brief struggle. the mate gave them fair words--no doubt with a view of inducing those below to yield, for they had no difficulty in hearing all that was said on deck. the result proved his sagacity, no less than his diabolical villainy. all in the forecastle presently signified their intention of submitting, and, ascending one by one, were pinioned and then thrown on their backs, together with the first six--there being in all, of the crew who were not concerned in the mutiny, twenty-seven. a scene of the most horrible butchery ensued. the bound seamen were dragged to the gangway. here the cook stood with an axe, striking each victim on the head as he was forced over the side of the vessel by the other mutineers. in this manner twenty-two perished, and augustus had given himself up for lost, expecting every moment his own turn to come next. but it seemed that the villains were now either weary, or in some measure disgusted with their bloody labour; for the four remaining prisoners, together with my friend, who had been thrown on the deck with the rest, were respited while the mate sent below for rum, and the whole murderous party held a drunken carouse, which lasted until sunset. they now fell to disputing in regard to the fate of the survivors, who lay not more than four paces off, and could distinguish every word said. upon some of the mutineers the liquor appeared to have a softening effect, for several voices were heard in favor of releasing the captives altogether, on condition of joining the mutiny and sharing the profits. the black cook, however (who in all respects was a perfect demon, and who seemed to exert as much influence, if not more, than the mate himself), would listen to no proposition of the kind, and rose repeatedly for the purpose of resuming his work at the gangway. fortunately he was so far overcome by intoxication as to be easily restrained by the less bloodthirsty of the party, among whom was a line-manager, who went by the name of dirk peters. this man was the son of an indian squaw of the tribe of upsarokas, who live among the fastnesses of the black hills, near the source of the missouri. his father was a fur-trader, i believe, or at least connected in some manner with the indian trading-posts on lewis river. peters himself was one of the most ferocious-looking men i ever beheld. he was short in stature, not more than four feet eight inches high, but his limbs were of herculean mould. his hands, especially, were so enormously thick and broad as hardly to retain a human shape. his arms, as well as legs, were bowed in the most singular manner, and appeared to possess no flexibility whatever. his head was equally deformed, being of immense size, with an indentation on the crown (like that on the head of most negroes), and entirely bald. to conceal this latter deficiency, which did not proceed from old age, he usually wore a wig formed of any hair-like material which presented itself--occasionally the skin of a spanish dog or american grizzly bear. at the time spoken of, he had on a portion of one of these bearskins; and it added no little to the natural ferocity of his countenance, which betook of the upsaroka character. the mouth extended nearly from ear to ear, the lips were thin, and seemed, like some other portions of his frame, to be devoid of natural pliancy, so that the ruling expression never varied under the influence of any emotion whatever. this ruling expression may be conceived when it is considered that the teeth were exceedingly long and protruding, and never even partially covered, in any instance, by the lips. to pass this man with a casual glance, one might imagine him to be convulsed with laughter, but a second look would induce a shuddering acknowledgment, that if such an expression were indicative of merriment, the merriment must be that of a demon. of this singular being many anecdotes were prevalent among the seafaring men of nantucket. these anecdotes went to prove his prodigious strength when under excitement, and some of them had given rise to a doubt of his sanity. but on board the grampus, it seems, he was regarded, at the time of the mutiny, with feelings more of derision than of anything else. i have been thus particular in speaking of dirk peters, because, ferocious as he appeared, he proved the main instrument in preserving the life of augustus, and because i shall have frequent occasion to mention him hereafter in the course of my narrative--a narrative, let me here say, which, in its latter portions, will be found to include incidents of a nature so entirely out of the range of human experience, and for this reason so far beyond the limits of human credulity, that i proceed in utter hopelessness of obtaining credence for all that i shall tell, yet confidently trusting in time and progressing science to verify some of the most important and most improbable of my statements. after much indecision and two or three violent quarrels, it was determined at last that all the prisoners (with the exception of augustus, whom peters insisted in a jocular manner upon keeping as his clerk) should be set adrift in one of the smallest whaleboats. the mate went down into the cabin to see if captain barnard was still living--for, it will be remembered, he was left below when the mutineers came up. presently the two made their appearance, the captain pale as death, but somewhat recovered from the effects of his wound. he spoke to the men in a voice hardly articulate, entreated them not to set him adrift, but to return to their duty, and promising to land them wherever they chose, and to take no steps for bringing them to justice. he might as well have spoken to the winds. two of the ruffians seized him by the arms and hurled him over the brig’s side into the boat, which had been lowered while the mate went below. the four men who were lying on the deck were then untied and ordered to follow, which they did without attempting any resistance--augustus being still left in his painful position, although he struggled and prayed only for the poor satisfaction of being permitted to bid his father farewell. a handful of sea-biscuit and a jug of water were now handed down; but neither mast, sail, oar, nor compass. the boat was towed astern for a few minutes, during which the mutineers held another consultation--it was then finally cut adrift. by this time night had come on--there were neither moon nor stars visible--and a short and ugly sea was running, although there was no great deal of wind. the boat was instantly out of sight, and little hope could be entertained for the unfortunate sufferers who were in it. this event happened, however, in latitude <UNK> degrees <UNK> north, longitude <UNK> degrees <UNK> west, and consequently at no very great distance from the bermuda islands. augustus therefore endeavored to console himself with the idea that the boat might either succeed in reaching the land, or come sufficiently near to be fallen in with by vessels off the coast. all sail was now put upon the brig, and she continued her original course to the southwest--the mutineers being bent upon some piratical expedition, in which, from all that could be understood, a ship was to be intercepted on her way from the cape verd islands to porto rico. no attention was paid to augustus, who was untied and suffered to go about anywhere forward of the cabin companion-way. dirk peters treated him with some degree of kindness, and on one occasion saved him from the brutality of the cook. his situation was still one of the most precarious, as the men were continually intoxicated, and there was no relying upon their continued good-humor or carelessness in regard to himself. his anxiety on my account he represented, however, as the most distressing result of his condition; and, indeed, i had never reason to doubt the sincerity of his friendship. more than once he had resolved to acquaint the mutineers with the secret of my being on board, but was restrained from so doing, partly through recollection of the atrocities he had already beheld, and partly through a hope of being able soon to bring me relief. for the latter purpose he was constantly on the watch; but, in spite of the most constant vigilance, three days elapsed after the boat was cut adrift before any chance occurred. at length, on the night of the third day, there came on a heavy blow from the eastward, and all hands were called up to take in sail. during the confusion which ensued, he made his way below unobserved, and into the stateroom. what was his grief and horror in discovering that the latter had been rendered a place of deposit for a variety of sea-stores and ship-furniture, and that several fathoms of old chain-cable, which had been stowed away beneath the companion-ladder, had been dragged thence to make room for a chest, and were now lying immediately upon the trap! to remove it without discovery was impossible, and he returned on deck as quickly as he could. as he came up, the mate seized him by the throat, and demanding what he had been doing in the cabin, was about flinging him over the larboard bulwark, when his life was again preserved through the interference of dirk peters. augustus was now put in handcuffs (of which there were several pairs on board), and his feet lashed tightly together. he was then taken into the steerage, and thrown into a lower berth next to the forecastle bulkheads, with the assurance that he should never put his foot on deck again “until the brig was no longer a brig.” this was the expression of the cook, who threw him into the berth--it is hardly possible to say what precise meaning intended by the phrase. the whole affair, however, proved the ultimate means of my relief, as will presently appear. chapter <UNK> for some minutes after the cook had left the forecastle, augustus abandoned himself to despair, never hoping to leave the berth alive. he now came to the resolution of acquainting the first of the men who should come down with my situation, thinking it better to let me take my chance with the mutineers than perish of thirst in the hold,--for it had been ten days since i was first imprisoned, and my jug of water was not a plentiful supply even for four. as he was thinking on this subject, the idea came all at once into his head that it might be possible to communicate with me by the way of the main hold. in any other circumstances, the difficulty and hazard of the undertaking would have prevented him from attempting it; but now he had, at all events, little prospect of life, and consequently little to lose, he bent his whole mind, therefore, upon the task. his handcuffs were the first consideration. at first he saw no method of removing them, and feared that he should thus be baffled in the very outset; but upon a closer scrutiny he discovered that the irons could be slipped off and on at pleasure, with very little effort or inconvenience, merely by squeezing his hands through them,--this species of manacle being altogether ineffectual in confining young persons, in whom the smaller bones readily yield to pressure. he now untied his feet, and, leaving the cord in such a manner that it could easily be readjusted in the event of any person’s coming down, proceeded to examine the bulkhead where it joined the berth. the partition here was of soft pine board, an inch thick, and he saw that he should have little trouble in cutting his way through. a voice was now heard at the forecastle companion-way, and he had just time to put his right hand into its handcuff (the left had not been removed) and to draw the rope in a slipknot around his ankle, when dirk peters came below, followed by tiger, who immediately leaped into the berth and lay down. the dog had been brought on board by augustus, who knew my attachment to the animal, and thought it would give me pleasure to have him with me during the voyage. he went up to our house for him immediately after first taking me into the hold, but did not think of mentioning the circumstance upon his bringing the watch. since the mutiny, augustus had not seen him before his appearance with dirk peters, and had given him up for lost, supposing him to have been thrown overboard by some of the malignant villains belonging to the mate’s gang. it appeared afterward that he had crawled into a hole beneath a whale-boat, from which, not having room to turn round, he could not extricate himself. peters at last let him out, and, with a species of good feeling which my friend knew well how to appreciate, had now brought him to him in the forecastle as a companion, leaving at the same time some salt junk and potatoes, with a can of water, he then went on deck, promising to come down with something more to eat on the next day. when he had gone, augustus freed both hands from the manacles and unfastened his feet. he then turned down the head of the mattress on which he had been lying, and with his penknife (for the ruffians had not thought it worth while to search him) commenced cutting vigorously across one of the partition planks, as closely as possible to the floor of the berth. he chose to cut here, because, if suddenly interrupted, he would be able to conceal what had been done by letting the head of the mattress fall into its proper position. for the remainder of the day, however, no disturbance occurred, and by night he had completely divided the plank. it should here be observed that none of the crew occupied the forecastle as a sleeping-place, living altogether in the cabin since the mutiny, drinking the wines and feasting on the sea-stores of captain barnard, and giving no more heed than was absolutely necessary to the navigation of the brig. these circumstances proved fortunate both for myself and augustus; for, had matters been otherwise, he would have found it impossible to reach me. as it was, he proceeded with confidence in his design. it was near daybreak, however, before he completed the second division of the board (which was about a foot above the first cut), thus making an aperture quite large enough to admit his passage through with facility to the main orlop deck. having got here, he made his way with but little trouble to the lower main hatch, although in so doing he had to scramble over tiers of oil-casks piled nearly as high as the upper deck, there being barely room enough left for his body. upon reaching the hatch he found that tiger had followed him below, squeezing between two rows of the casks. it was now too late, however, to attempt getting to me before dawn, as the chief difficulty lay in passing through the close stowage in the lower hold. he therefore resolved to return, and wait till the next night. with this design, he proceeded to loosen the hatch, so that he might have as little detention as possible when he should come again. no sooner had he loosened it than tiger sprang eagerly to the small opening produced, snuffed for a moment, and then uttered a long whine, scratching at the same time, as if anxious to remove the covering with his paws. there could be no doubt, from his behaviour, that he was aware of my being in the hold, and augustus thought it possible that he would be able to get to me if he put him down. he now hit upon the expedient of sending the note, as it was especially desirable that i should make no attempt at forcing my way out at least under existing circumstances, and there could be no certainty of his getting to me himself on the morrow as he intended. after-events proved how fortunate it was that the idea occurred to him as it did; for, had it not been for the receipt of the note, i should undoubtedly have fallen upon some plan, however desperate, of alarming the crew, and both our lives would most probably have been sacrificed in consequence. having concluded to write, the difficulty was now to procure the materials for so doing. an old toothpick was soon made into a pen; and this by means of feeling altogether, for the between-decks was as dark as pitch. paper enough was obtained from the back of a letter--a duplicate of the forged letter from mr. ross. this had been the original draught; but the handwriting not being sufficiently well imitated, augustus had written another, thrusting the first, by good fortune, into his coat-pocket, where it was now most opportunely discovered. ink alone was thus wanting, and a substitute was immediately found for this by means of a slight incision with the pen-knife on the back of a finger just above the nail--a copious flow of blood ensuing, as usual, from wounds in that vicinity. the note was now written, as well as it could be in the dark and under the circumstances. it briefly explained that a mutiny had taken place; that captain barnard was set adrift; and that i might expect immediate relief as far as provisions were concerned, but must not venture upon making any disturbance. it concluded with these words: “_i have scrawled this with blood--your life depends upon lying close._” this slip of paper being tied upon the dog, he was now put down the hatchway, and augustus made the best of his way back to the forecastle, where he found no reason to believe that any of the crew had been in his absence. to conceal the hole in the partition, he drove his knife in just above it, and hung up a pea-jacket which he found in the berth. his handcuffs were then replaced, and also the rope around his ankles. these arrangements were scarcely completed when dirk peters came below, very drunk, but in excellent humour, and bringing with him my friend’s allowance of provision for the day. this consisted of a dozen large irish potatoes roasted, and a pitcher of water. he sat for some time on a chest by the berth, and talked freely about the mate and the general concerns of the brig. his demeanour was exceedingly capricious, and even grotesque. at one time augustus was much alarmed by odd conduct. at last, however, he went on deck, muttering a promise to bring his prisoner a good dinner on the morrow. during the day two of the crew (harpooners) came down, accompanied by the cook, all three in nearly the last stage of intoxication. like peters, they made no scruple of talking unreservedly about their plans. it appeared that they were much divided among themselves as to their ultimate course, agreeing in no point, except the attack on the ship from the cape verd islands, with which they were in hourly expectation of meeting. as far as could be ascertained, the mutiny had not been brought about altogether for the sake of booty; a private pique of the chief mate’s against captain barnard having been the main instigation. there now seemed to be two principal factions among the crew--one headed by the mate, the other by the cook. the former party were for seizing the first suitable vessel which should present itself, and equipping it at some of the west india islands for a piratical cruise. the latter division, however, which was the stronger, and included dirk peters among its partisans, were bent upon pursuing the course originally laid out for the brig into the south pacific; there either to take whale, or act otherwise, as circumstances should suggest. the representations of peters, who had frequently visited these regions, had great weight, apparently, with the mutineers, wavering, as they were, between half-engendered notions of profit and pleasure. he dwelt on the world of novelty and amusement to be found among the innumerable islands of the pacific, on the perfect security and freedom from all restraint to be enjoyed, but, more particularly, on the deliciousness of the climate, on the abundant means of good living, and on the voluptuous beauty of the women. as yet, nothing had been absolutely determined upon; but the pictures of the hybrid line-manager were taking strong hold upon the ardent imaginations of the seamen, and there was every possibility that his intentions would be finally carried into effect. the three men went away in about an hour, and no one else entered the forecastle all day. augustus lay quiet until nearly night. he then freed himself from the rope and irons, and prepared for his attempt. a bottle was found in one of the berths, and this he filled with water from the pitcher left by peters, storing his pockets at the same time with cold potatoes. to his great joy he also came across a lantern, with a small piece of tallow candle in it. this he could light at any moment, as he had in his possession a box of phosphorus matches. when it was quite dark, he got through the hole in the bulkhead, having taken the precaution to arrange the bedclothes in the berth so as to convey the idea of a person covered up. when through, he hung up the pea-jacket on his knife, as before, to conceal the aperture--this manoeuvre being easily effected, as he did not readjust the piece of plank taken out until afterward. he was now on the main orlop deck, and proceeded to make his way, as before, between the upper deck and the oil-casks to the main hatchway. having reached this, he lit the piece of candle, and descended, groping with extreme difficulty among the compact stowage of the hold. in a few moments he became alarmed at the insufferable stench and the closeness of the atmosphere. he could not think it possible that i had survived my confinement for so long a period breathing so oppressive an air. he called my name repeatedly, but i made him no reply, and his apprehensions seemed thus to be confirmed. the brig was rolling violently, and there was so much noise in consequence, that it was useless to listen for any weak sound, such as those of my breathing or snoring. he threw open the lantern, and held it as high as possible, whenever an opportunity occurred, in order that, by observing the light, i might, if alive, be aware that succor was approaching. still nothing was heard from me, and the supposition of my death began to assume the character of certainty. he determined, nevertheless, to force a passage, if possible, to the box, and at least ascertain beyond a doubt the truth of his surmises. he pushed on for some time in a most pitiable state of anxiety, until, at length, he found the pathway utterly blocked up, and that there was no possibility of making any farther way by the course in which he had set out. overcome now by his feelings, he threw himself among the lumber in despair, and wept like a child. it was at this period that he heard the crash occasioned by the bottle which i had thrown down. fortunate, indeed, was it that the incident occurred--for, upon this incident, trivial as it appears, the thread of my destiny depended. many years elapsed, however, before i was aware of this fact. a natural shame and regret for his weakness and indecision prevented augustus from confiding to me at once what a more intimate and unreserved communion afterward induced him to reveal. upon finding his further progress in the hold impeded by obstacles which he could not overcome, he had resolved to abandon his attempt at reaching me, and return at once to the forecastle. before condemning him entirely on this head, the harassing circumstances which embarrassed him should be taken into consideration. the night was fast wearing away, and his absence from the forecastle might be discovered; and indeed would necessarily be so, if he should fail to get back to the berth by daybreak. his candle was expiring in the socket, and there would be the greatest difficulty in retracing his way to the hatchway in the dark. it must be allowed, too, that he had every good reason to believe me dead; in which event no benefit could result to me from his reaching the box, and a world of danger would be encountered to no purpose by himself. he had repeatedly called, and i had made him no answer. i had been now eleven days and nights with no more water than that contained in the jug which he had left with me--a supply which it was not at all probable i had hoarded in the beginning of my confinement, as i had every cause to expect a speedy release. the atmosphere of the hold, too, must have appeared to him, coming from the comparatively open air of the steerage, of a nature absolutely poisonous, and by far more intolerable than it had seemed to me upon my first taking up my quarters in the box--the hatchways at that time having been constantly open for many months previous. add to these considerations that of the scene of bloodshed and terror so lately witnessed by my friend; his confinement, privations, and narrow escapes from death, together with the frail and equivocal tenure by which he still existed--circumstances all so well calculated to prostrate every energy of mind--and the reader will be easily brought, as i have been, to regard his apparent falling off in friendship and in faith with sentiments rather of sorrow than of anger. the crash of the bottle was distinctly heard, yet augustus was not sure that it proceeded from the hold. the doubt, however, was sufficient inducement to persevere. he clambered up nearly to the orlop deck by means of the stowage, and then, watching for a lull in the pitchings of the vessel, he called out to me in as loud a tone as he could command, regardless, for the moment, of being overheard by the crew. it will be remembered that on this occasion the voice reached me, but i was so entirely overcome by violent agitation as to be incapable of reply. confident, now, that his worst apprehensions were well founded, he descended, with a view of getting back to the forecastle without loss of time. in his haste some small boxes were thrown down, the noise occasioned by which i heard, as will be recollected. he had made considerable progress on his return when the fall of the knife again caused him to hesitate. he retraced his steps immediately, and, clambering up the stowage a second time, called out my name, loudly as before, having watched for a lull. this time i found voice to answer. overjoyed at discovering me to be still alive, he now resolved to brave every difficulty and danger in reaching me. having extricated himself as quickly as possible from the labyrinth of lumber by which he was hemmed in, he at length struck into an opening which promised better, and finally, after a series of struggles, arrived at the box in a state of utter exhaustion. chapter <UNK> the leading particulars of this narration were all that augustus communicated to me while we remained near the box. it was not until afterward that he entered fully into all the details. he was apprehensive of being missed, and i was wild with impatience to leave my detested place of confinement. we resolved to make our way at once to the hole in the bulkhead, near which i was to remain for the present, while he went through to reconnoiter. to leave tiger in the box was what neither of us could endure to think of, yet, how to act otherwise was the question. he now seemed to be perfectly quiet, and we could not even distinguish the sound of his breathing upon applying our ears closely to the box. i was convinced that he was dead, and determined to open the door. we found him lying at full length, apparently in a deep stupor, yet still alive. no time was to be lost, yet i could not bring myself to abandon an animal who had now been twice instrumental in saving my life, without some attempt at preserving him. we therefore dragged him along with us as well as we could, although with the greatest difficulty and fatigue; augustus, during part of the time, being forced to clamber over the impediments in our way with the huge dog in his arms--a feat to which the feebleness of my frame rendered me totally inadequate. at length we succeeded in reaching the hole, when augustus got through, and tiger was pushed in afterward. all was found to be safe, and we did not fail to return sincere thanks to god for our deliverance from the imminent danger we had escaped. for the present, it was agreed that i should remain near the opening, through which my companion could readily supply me with a part of his daily provision, and where i could have the advantages of breathing an atmosphere comparatively pure. in explanation of some portions of this narrative, wherein i have spoken of the stowage of the brig, and which may appear ambiguous to some of my readers who may have seen a proper or regular stowage, i must here state that the manner in which this most important duty had been performed on board the grampus was a most shameful piece of neglect on the part of captain barnard, who was by no means as careful or as experienced a seaman as the hazardous nature of the service on which he was employed would seem necessarily to demand. a proper stowage cannot be accomplished in a careless manner, and many most disastrous accidents, even within the limits of my own experience, have arisen from neglect or ignorance in this particular. coasting vessels, in the frequent hurry and bustle attendant upon taking in or discharging cargo, are the most liable to mishap from the want of a proper attention to stowage. the great point is to allow no possibility of the cargo or ballast shifting position even in the most violent rollings of the vessel. with this end, great attention must be paid, not only to the bulk taken in, but to the nature of the bulk, and whether there be a full or only a partial cargo. in most kinds of freight the stowage is accomplished by means of a screw. thus, in a load of tobacco or flour, the whole is screwed so tightly into the hold of the vessel that the barrels or hogsheads, upon discharging, are found to be completely flattened, and take some time to regain their original shape. this screwing, however, is resorted to principally with a view of obtaining more room in the hold; for in a full load of any such commodities as flour or tobacco, there can be no danger of any shifting whatever, at least none from which inconvenience can result. there have been instances, indeed, where this method of screwing has resulted in the most lamentable consequences, arising from a cause altogether distinct from the danger attendant upon a shifting of cargo. a load of cotton, for example, tightly screwed while in certain conditions, has been known, through the expansion of its bulk, to rend a vessel asunder at sea. there can be no doubt either that the same result would ensue in the case of tobacco, while undergoing its usual course of fermentation, were it not for the interstices consequent upon the rotundity of the hogsheads. it is when a partial cargo is received that danger is chiefly to be apprehended from shifting, and that precautions should be always taken to guard against such misfortune. only those who have encountered a violent gale of wind, or rather who have experienced the rolling of a vessel in a sudden calm after the gale, can form an idea of the tremendous force of the plunges, and of the consequent terrible impetus given to all loose articles in the vessel. it is then that the necessity of a cautious stowage, when there is a partial cargo, becomes obvious. when lying-to (especially with a small head sail), a vessel which is not properly modelled in the bows is frequently thrown upon her beam-ends; this occurring even every fifteen or twenty minutes upon an average, yet without any serious consequences resulting, provided there be a proper stowage. if this, however, has not been strictly attended to, in the first of these heavy lurches the whole of the cargo tumbles over to the side of the vessel which lies upon the water, and, being thus prevented from regaining her equilibrium, as she would otherwise necessarily do, she is certain to fill in a few seconds and go down. it is not too much to say that at least one-half of the instances in which vessels have foundered in heavy gales at sea may be attributed to a shifting of cargo or of ballast. when a partial cargo of any kind is taken on board, the whole, after being first stowed as compactly as may be, should be covered with a layer of stout shifting-boards, extending completely across the vessel. upon these boards strong temporary stanchions should be erected, reaching to the timbers above, and thus securing every thing in its place. in cargoes consisting of grain, or any similar matter, additional precautions are requisite. a hold filled entirely with grain upon leaving port will be found not more than three fourths full upon reaching its destination--this, too, although the freight, when measured bushel by bushel by the consignee, will overrun by a vast deal (on account of the swelling of the grain) the quantity consigned. this result is occasioned by settling during the voyage, and is the more perceptible in proportion to the roughness of the weather experienced. if grain loosely thrown in a vessel, then, is ever so well secured by shifting-boards and stanchions, it will be liable to shift in a long passage so greatly as to bring about the most distressing calamities. to prevent these, every method should be employed before leaving port to settle the cargo as much as possible; and for this there are many contrivances, among which may be mentioned the driving of wedges into the grain. even after all this is done, and unusual pains taken to secure the shifting-boards, no seaman who knows what he is about will feel altogether secure in a gale of any violence with a cargo of grain on board, and, least of all, with a partial cargo. yet there are hundreds of our coasting vessels, and, it is likely, many more from the ports of europe, which sail daily with partial cargoes, even of the most dangerous species, and without any precaution whatever. the wonder is that no more accidents occur than do actually happen. a lamentable instance of this heedlessness occurred to my knowledge in the case of captain joel rice of the schooner firefly, which sailed from richmond, virginia, to madeira, with a cargo of corn, in the year <UNK> the captain had gone many voyages without serious accident, although he was in the habit of paying no attention whatever to his stowage, more than to secure it in the ordinary manner. he had never before sailed with a cargo of grain, and on this occasion had the corn thrown on board loosely, when it did not much more than half fill the vessel. for the first portion of the voyage he met with nothing more than light breezes; but when within a day’s sail of madeira there came on a strong gale from the n. n. e. which forced him to lie-to. he brought the schooner to the wind under a double-reefed foresail alone, when she rode as well as any vessel could be expected to do, and shipped not a drop of water. toward night the gale somewhat abated, and she rolled with more unsteadiness than before, but still did very well, until a heavy lurch threw her upon her beam-ends to starboard. the corn was then heard to shift bodily, the force of the movement bursting open the main hatchway. the vessel went down like a shot. this happened within hail of a small sloop from madeira, which picked up one of the crew (the only person saved), and which rode out the gale in perfect security, as indeed a jolly boat might have done under proper management. the stowage on board the grampus was most clumsily done, if stowage that could be called which was little better than a promiscuous huddling together of oil-casks <UNK> and ship furniture. i have already spoken of the condition of articles in the hold. on the orlop deck there was space enough for my body (as i have stated) between the oil-casks and the upper deck; a space was left open around the main hatchway; and several other large spaces were left in the stowage. near the hole cut through the bulkhead by augustus there was room enough for an entire cask, and in this space i found myself comfortably situated for the present. by the time my friend had got safely into the berth, and readjusted his handcuffs and the rope, it was broad daylight. we had made a narrow escape indeed; for scarcely had he arranged all matters, when the mate came below, with dirk peters and the cook. they talked for some time about the vessel from the cape verds, and seemed to be excessively anxious for her appearance. at length the cook came to the berth in which augustus was lying, and seated himself in it near the head. i could see and hear every thing from my hiding-place, for the piece cut out had not been put back, and i was in momentary expectation that the negro would fall against the pea-jacket, which was hung up to conceal the aperture, in which case all would have been discovered, and our lives would, no doubt, have been instantly sacrificed. our good fortune prevailed, however; and although he frequently touched it as the vessel rolled, he never pressed against it sufficiently to bring about a discovery. the bottom of the jacket had been carefully fastened to the bulkhead, so that the hole might not be seen by its swinging to one side. all this time tiger was lying in the foot of the berth, and appeared to have recovered in some measure his faculties, for i could see him occasionally open his eyes and draw a long breath. after a few minutes the mate and cook went above, leaving dirk peters behind, who, as soon as they were gone, came and sat himself down in the place just occupied by the mate. he began to talk very sociably with augustus, and we could now see that the greater part of his apparent intoxication, while the two others were with him, was a feint. he answered all my companion’s questions with perfect freedom; told him that he had no doubt of his father’s having been picked up, as there were no less than five sail in sight just before sundown on the day he was cut adrift; and used other language of a consolatory nature, which occasioned me no less surprise than pleasure. indeed, i began to entertain hopes, that through the instrumentality of peters we might be finally enabled to regain possession of the brig, and this idea i mentioned to augustus as soon as i found an opportunity. he thought the matter possible, but urged the necessity of the greatest caution in making the attempt, as the conduct of the hybrid appeared to be instigated by the most arbitrary caprice alone; and, indeed, it was difficult to say if he was at any moment of sound mind. peters went upon deck in about an hour, and did not return again until noon, when he brought augustus a plentiful supply of junk beef and pudding. of this, when we were left alone, i partook heartily, without returning through the hole. no one else came down into the forecastle during the day, and at night, i got into augustus’ berth, where i slept soundly and sweetly until nearly daybreak, when he awakened me upon hearing a stir upon deck, and i regained my hiding-place as quickly as possible. when the day was fully broke, we found that tiger had recovered his strength almost entirely, and gave no indications of hydrophobia, drinking a little water that was offered him with great apparent eagerness. during the day he regained all his former vigour and appetite. his strange conduct had been brought on, no doubt, by the deleterious quality of the air of the hold, and had no connexion with canine madness. i could not sufficiently rejoice that i had persisted in bringing him with me from the box. this day was the thirtieth of june, and the thirteenth since the grampus made sail from nantucket. on the second of july the mate came below drunk as usual, and in an excessively good-humor. he came to augustus’s berth, and, giving him a slap on the back, asked him if he thought he could behave himself if he let him loose, and whether he would promise not to be going into the cabin again. to this, of course, my friend answered in the affirmative, when the ruffian set him at liberty, after making him drink from a flask of rum which he drew from his coat-pocket. both now went on deck, and i did not see augustus for about three hours. he then came below with the good news that he had obtained permission to go about the brig as he pleased anywhere forward of the mainmast, and that he had been ordered to sleep, as usual, in the forecastle. he brought me, too, a good dinner, and a plentiful supply of water. the brig was still cruising for the vessel from the cape verds, and a sail was now in sight, which was thought to be the one in question. as the events of the ensuing eight days were of little importance, and had no direct bearing upon the main incidents of my narrative, i will here throw them into the form of a journal, as i do not wish to omit them altogether. july <UNK> augustus furnished me with three blankets, with which i contrived a comfortable bed in my hiding-place. no one came below, except my companion, during the day. tiger took his station in the berth just by the aperture, and slept heavily, as if not yet entirely recovered from the effects of his sickness. toward night a flaw of wind struck the brig before sail could be taken in, and very nearly capsized her. the puff died away immediately, however, and no damage was done beyond the splitting of the foretopsail. dirk peters treated augustus all this day with great kindness and entered into a long conversation with him respecting the pacific ocean, and the islands he had visited in that region. he asked him whether he would not like to go with the mutineers on a kind of exploring and pleasure voyage in those quarters, and said that the men were gradually coming over to the mate’s views. to this augustus thought it best to reply that he would be glad to go on such an adventure, since nothing better could be done, and that any thing was preferable to a piratical life. july <UNK> the vessel in sight proved to be a small brig from liverpool, and was allowed to pass unmolested. augustus spent most of his time on deck, with a view of obtaining all the information in his power respecting the intentions of the mutineers. they had frequent and violent quarrels among themselves, in one of which a harpooner, jim bonner, was thrown overboard. the party of the mate was gaining ground. jim bonner belonged to the cook’s gang, of which peters was a partisan. july <UNK> about daybreak there came on a stiff breeze from the west, which at noon freshened into a gale, so that the brig could carry nothing more than her trysail and foresail. in taking in the foretopsail, simms, one of the common hands, and belonging also to the cook’s gang, fell overboard, being very much in liquor, and was drowned--no attempt being made to save him. the whole number of persons on board was now thirteen, to wit: dirk peters; seymour, the black cook; jones, greely, hartman rogers and william allen, all of the cook’s party; the mate, whose name i never learned; absalom hicks, wilson, john hunty richard parker, of the mate’s party;--besides augustus and myself. july <UNK> the gale lasted all this day, blowing in heavy squalls, accompanied with rain. the brig took in a good deal of water through her seams, and one of the pumps was kept continually going, augustus being forced to take his turn. just at twilight a large ship passed close by us, without having been discovered until within hail. the ship was supposed to be the one for which the mutineers were on the lookout. the mate hailed her, but the reply was drowned in the roaring of the gale. at eleven, a sea was shipped amidships, which tore away a great portion of the larboard bulwarks, and did some other slight damage. toward morning the weather moderated, and at sunrise there was very little wind. july <UNK> there was a heavy swell running all this day, during which the brig, being light, rolled excessively, and many articles broke loose in the hold, as i could hear distinctly from my hiding-place. i suffered a great deal from sea-sickness. peters had a long conversation this day with augustus, and told him that two of his gang, greely and allen, had gone over to the mate, and were resolved to turn pirates. he put several questions to augustus which he did not then exactly understand. during a part of this evening the leak gained upon the vessel; and little could be done to remedy it, as it was occasioned by the brig's straining, and taking in the water through her seams. a sail was thrummed, and got under the bows, which aided us in some measure, so that we began to gain upon the leak. july <UNK> a light breeze sprang up at sunrise from the eastward, when the mate headed the brig to the southwest, with the intention of making some of the west india islands in pursuance of his piratical designs. no opposition was made by peters or the cook--at least none in the hearing of augustus. all idea of taking the vessel from the cape verds was abandoned. the leak was now easily kept under by one pump going every three quarters of an hour. the sail was drawn from beneath the bows. spoke two small schooners during the day. july <UNK> fine weather. all hands employed in repairing bulwarks. peters had again a long conversation with augustus, and spoke more plainly than he had done heretofore. he said nothing should induce him to come into the mate’s views, and even hinted his intention of taking the brig out of his hands. he asked my friend if he could depend upon his aid in such case, to which augustus said, “yes,” without hesitation. peters then said he would sound the others of his party upon the subject, and went away. during the remainder of the day augustus had no opportunity of speaking with him privately. chapter <UNK> july <UNK> spoke a brig from rio, bound to norfolk. weather hazy, with a light baffling wind from the eastward. to-day hartman rogers died, having been attacked on the eighth with spasms after drinking a glass of grog. this man was of the cook’s party, and one upon whom peters placed his main reliance. he told augustus that he believed the mate had poisoned him, and that he expected, if he did not be on the look-out, his own turn would come shortly. there were now only himself, jones, and the cook belonging to his own gang--on the other side there were five. he had spoken to jones about taking the command from the mate; but the project having been coolly received, he had been deterred from pressing the matter any further, or from saying any thing to the cook. it was well, as it happened, that he was so prudent, for in the afternoon the cook expressed his determination of siding with the mate, and went over formally to that party; while jones took an opportunity of quarrelling with peters, and hinted that he would let the mate know of the plan in agitation. there was now, evidently, no time to be lost, and peters expressed his determination of attempting to take the vessel at all hazards, provided augustus would lend him his aid. my friend at once assured him of his willingness to enter into any plan for that purpose, and, thinking the opportunity a favourable one, made known the fact of my being on board. at this the hybrid was not more astonished than delighted, as he had no reliance whatever upon jones, whom he already considered as belonging to the party of the mate. they went below immediately, when augustus called to me by name, and peters and myself were soon made acquainted. it was agreed that we should attempt to retake the vessel upon the first good opportunity, leaving jones altogether out of our councils. in the event of success, we were to run the brig into the first port that offered, and deliver her up. the desertion of his party had frustrated peters’ design of going into the pacific--an adventure which could not be accomplished without a crew, and he depended upon either getting acquitted upon trial, on the score of insanity (which he solemnly avowed had actuated him in lending his aid to the mutiny), or upon obtaining a pardon, if found guilty, through the representations of augustus and myself. our deliberations were interrupted for the present by the cry of, “all hands take in sail,” and peters and augustus ran up on deck. as usual, the crew were nearly all drunk; and, before sail could be properly taken in, a violent squall laid the brig on her beam-ends. by keeping her away, however, she righted, having shipped a good deal of water. scarcely was everything secure, when another squall took the vessel, and immediately afterward another--no damage being done. there was every appearance of a gale of wind, which, indeed, shortly came on, with great fury, from the northward and westward. all was made as snug as possible, and we laid-to, as usual, under a close-reefed foresail. as night drew on, the wind increased in violence, with a remarkably heavy sea. peters now came into the forecastle with augustus, and we resumed our deliberations. we agreed that no opportunity could be more favourable than the present for carrying our designs into effect, as an attempt at such a moment would never be anticipated. as the brig was snugly laid-to, there would be no necessity of manoeuvring her until good weather, when, if we succeeded in our attempt, we might liberate one, or perhaps two of the men, to aid us in taking her into port. the main difficulty was the great disproportion in our forces. there were only three of us, and in the cabin there were nine. all the arms on board, too, were in their possession, with the exception of a pair of small pistols which peters had concealed about his person, and the large seaman’s knife which he always wore in the waistband of his pantaloons. from certain indications, too--such, for example, as there being no such thing as an axe or a handspike lying in their customary places--we began to fear that the mate had his suspicions, at least in regard to peters, and that he would let slip no opportunity of getting rid of him. it was clear, indeed, that what we should determine to do could not be done too soon. still the odds were too much against us to allow of our proceeding without the greatest caution. peters proposed that he should go up on deck, and enter into conversation with the watch (allen), when he would be able to throw him into the sea without trouble, and without making any disturbance, by seizing a good opportunity, that augustus and myself should then come up, and endeavour to provide ourselves with some kind of weapons from the deck, and that we should then make a rush together, and secure the companion-way before any opposition could be offered. i objected to this, because i could not believe that the mate (who was a cunning fellow in all matters which did not affect his superstitious prejudices) would suffer himself to be so easily entrapped. the very fact of there being a watch on deck at all was sufficient proof that he was upon the alert,--it not being usual except in vessels where discipline is most rigidly enforced, to station a watch on deck when a vessel is lying-to in a gale of wind. as i address myself principally, if not altogether, to persons who have never been to sea, it may be as well to state the exact condition of a vessel under such circumstances. lying-to, or, in sea-parlance, “laying-to,” is a measure resorted to for various purposes, and effected in various manners. in moderate weather it is frequently done with a view of merely bringing the vessel to a stand-still, to wait for another vessel or any similar object. if the vessel which lies-to is under full sail, the manoeuvre is usually accomplished by throwing round some portion of her sails, so as to let the wind take them aback, when she becomes stationary. but we are now speaking of lying-to in a gale of wind. this is done when the wind is ahead, and too violent to admit of carrying sail without danger of capsizing; and sometimes even when the wind is fair, but the sea too heavy for the vessel to be put before it. if a vessel be suffered to scud before the wind in a very heavy sea, much damage is usually done her by the shipping of water over her stern, and sometimes by the violent plunges she makes forward. this manoeuvre, then, is seldom resorted to in such case, unless through necessity. when the vessel is in a leaky condition she is often put before the wind even in the heaviest seas; for, when lying-to, her seams are sure to be greatly opened by her violent straining, and it is not so much the case when scudding. often, too, it becomes necessary to scud a vessel, either when the blast is so exceedingly furious as to tear in pieces the sail which is employed with a view of bringing her head to the wind, or when, through the false modelling of the frame or other causes, this main object cannot be effected. vessels in a gale of wind are laid-to in different manners, according to their peculiar construction. some lie-to best under a foresail, and this, i believe, is the sail most usually employed. large square-rigged vessels have sails for the express purpose, called storm-staysails. but the jib is occasionally employed by itself,--sometimes the jib and foresail, or a double-reefed foresail, and not unfrequently the after-sails, are made use of. foretopsails are very often found to answer the purpose better than any other species of sail. the grampus was generally laid-to under a close-reefed foresail. when a vessel is to be laid-to, her head is brought up to the wind just so nearly as to fill the sail under which she lies when hauled flat aft, that is, when brought diagonally across the vessel. this being done, the bows point within a few degrees of the direction from which the wind issues, and the windward bow of course receives the shock of the waves. in this situation a good vessel will ride out a very heavy gale of wind without shipping a drop of water, and without any further attention being requisite on the part of the crew. the helm is usually lashed down, but this is altogether unnecessary (except on account of the noise it makes when loose), for the rudder has no effect upon the vessel when lying-to. indeed, the helm had far better be left loose than lashed very fast, for the rudder is apt to be torn off by heavy seas if there be no room for the helm to play. as long as the sail holds, a well modelled vessel will maintain her situation, and ride every sea, as if instinct with life and reason. if the violence of the wind, however, should tear the sail into pieces (a feat which it requires a perfect hurricane to accomplish under ordinary circumstances), there is then imminent danger. the vessel falls off from the wind, and, coming broadside to the sea, is completely at its mercy: the only resource in this case is to put her quietly before the wind, letting her scud until some other sail can be set. some vessels will lie-to under no sail whatever, but such are not to be trusted at sea. but to return from this digression. it had never been customary with the mate to have any watch on deck when lying-to in a gale of wind, and the fact that he had now one, coupled with the circumstance of the missing axes and handspikes, fully convinced us that the crew were too well on the watch to be taken by surprise in the manner peters had suggested. something, however, was to be done, and that with as little delay as practicable, for there could be no doubt that a suspicion having been once entertained against peters, he would be sacrificed upon the earliest occasion, and one would certainly be either found or made upon the breaking of the gale. augustus now suggested that if peters could contrive to remove, under any pretext, the piece of chain-cable which lay over the trap in the stateroom, we might possibly be able to come upon them unawares by means of the hold; but a little reflection convinced us that the vessel rolled and pitched too violently for any attempt of that nature. by good fortune i at length hit upon the idea of working upon the superstitious terrors and guilty conscience of the mate. it will be remembered that one of the crew, hartman rogers, had died during the morning, having been attacked two days before with spasms after drinking some spirits and water. peters had expressed to us his opinion that this man had been poisoned by the mate, and for this belief he had reasons, so he said, which were incontrovertible, but which he could not be prevailed upon to explain to us--this wayward refusal being only in keeping with other points of his singular character. but whether or not he had any better grounds for suspecting the mate than we had ourselves, we were easily led to fall in with his suspicion, and determined to act accordingly. rogers had died about eleven in the forenoon, in violent convulsions; and the corpse presented in a few minutes after death one of the most horrid and loathsome spectacles i ever remember to have seen. the stomach was swollen immensely, like that of a man who has been drowned and lain under water for many weeks. the hands were in the same condition, while the face was shrunken, shrivelled, and of a chalky whiteness, except where relieved by two or three glaring red blotches like those occasioned by the erysipelas: one of these blotches extended diagonally across the face, completely covering up an eye as if with a band of red velvet. in this disgusting condition the body had been brought up from the cabin at noon to be thrown overboard, when the mate getting a glimpse of it (for he now saw it for the first time), and being either touched with remorse for his crime or struck with terror at so horrible a sight, ordered the men to sew the body up in its hammock, and allow it the usual rites of sea-burial. having given these directions, he went below, as if to avoid any further sight of his victim. while preparations were making to obey his orders, the gale came on with great fury, and the design was abandoned for the present. the corpse, left to itself, was washed into the larboard scuppers, where it still lay at the time of which i speak, floundering about with the furious lurches of the brig. having arranged our plan, we set about putting it in execution as speedily as possible. peters went upon deck, and, as he had anticipated, was immediately accosted by allen, who appeared to be stationed more as a watch upon the forecastle than for any other purpose. the fate of this villain, however, was speedily and silently decided; for peters, approaching him in a careless manner, as if about to address him, seized him by the throat, and, before he could utter a single cry, tossed him over the bulwarks. he then called to us, and we came up. our first precaution was to look about for something with which to arm ourselves, and in doing this we had to proceed with great care, for it was impossible to stand on deck an instant without holding fast, and violent seas broke over the vessel at every plunge forward. it was indispensable, too, that we should be quick in our operations, for every minute we expected the mate to be up to set the pumps going, as it was evident the brig must be taking in water very fast. after searching about for some time, we could find nothing more fit for our purpose than the two pump-handles, one of which augustus took, and i the other. having secured these, we stripped off the shirt of the corpse and dropped the body overboard. peters and myself then went below, leaving augustus to watch upon deck, where he took his station just where allen had been placed, and with his back to the cabin companionway, so that, if any of the mate's gang should come up, he might suppose it was the watch. as soon as i got below i commenced disguising myself so as to represent the corpse of rogers. the shirt which we had taken from the body aided us very much, for it was of singular form and character, and easily recognizable--a kind of smock, which the deceased wore over his other clothing. it was a blue stockinett, with large white stripes running across. having put this on, i proceeded to equip myself with a false stomach, in imitation of the horrible deformity of the swollen corpse. this was soon effected by means of stuffing with some bedclothes. i then gave the same appearance to my hands by drawing on a pair of white woollen mittens, and filling them in with any kind of rags that offered themselves. peters then arranged my face, first rubbing it well over with white chalk, and afterward blotching it with blood, which he took from a cut in his finger. the streak across the eye was not forgotten and presented a most shocking appearance. chapter <UNK> as i viewed myself in a fragment of looking-glass which hung up in the cabin, and by the dim light of a kind of battle-lantern, i was so impressed with a sense of vague awe at my appearance, and at the recollection of the terrific reality which i was thus representing, that i was seized with a violent tremour, and could scarcely summon resolution to go on with my part. it was necessary, however, to act with decision, and peters and myself went upon deck. we there found everything safe, and, keeping close to the bulwarks, the three of us crept to the cabin companion-way. it was only partially closed, precautions having been taken to prevent its being suddenly pushed to from without, by means of placing billets of wood on the upper step so as to interfere with the shutting. we found no difficulty in getting a full view of the interior of the cabin through the cracks where the hinges were placed. it now proved to have been very fortunate for us that we had not attempted to take them by surprise, for they were evidently on the alert. only one was asleep, and he lying just at the foot of the companion-ladder, with a musket by his side. the rest were seated on several mattresses, which had been taken from the berths and thrown on the floor. they were engaged in earnest conversation; and although they had been carousing, as appeared from two empty jugs, with some tin tumblers which lay about, they were not as much intoxicated as usual. all had knives, one or two of them pistols, and a great many muskets were lying in a berth close at hand. we listened to their conversation for some time before we could make up our minds how to act, having as yet resolved on nothing determinate, except that we would attempt to paralyze their exertions, when we should attack them, by means of the apparition of rogers. they were discussing their piratical plans, in which all we could hear distinctly was, that they would unite with the crew of a schooner _hornet_, and, if possible, get the schooner herself into their possession preparatory to some attempt on a large scale, the particulars of which could not be made out by either of us. one of the men spoke of peters, when the mate replied to him in a low voice which could not be distinguished, and afterward added more loudly, that “he could not understand his being so much forward with the captain’s brat in the forecastle, and he thought the sooner both of them were overboard the better.” to this no answer was made, but we could easily perceive that the hint was well received by the whole party, and more particularly by jones. at this period i was excessively agitated, the more so as i could see that neither augustus nor peters could determine how to act. i made up my mind, however, to sell my life as dearly as possible, and not to suffer myself to be overcome by any feelings of trepidation. the tremendous noise made by the roaring of the wind in the rigging, and the washing of the sea over the deck, prevented us from hearing what was said, except during momentary lulls. in one of these, we all distinctly heard the mate tell one of the men to “go forward, have an eye upon them, for he wanted no such secret doings on board the brig.” it was well for us that the pitching of the vessel at this moment was so violent as to prevent this order from being carried into instant execution. the cook got up from his mattress to go for us, when a tremendous lurch, which i thought would carry away the masts, threw him headlong against one of the larboard stateroom doors, bursting it open, and creating a good deal of other confusion. luckily, neither of our party was thrown from his position, and we had time to make a precipitate retreat to the forecastle, and arrange a hurried plan of action before the messenger made his appearance, or rather before he put his head out of the companion-hatch, for he did not come on deck. from this station he could not notice the absence of allen, and he accordingly bawled out, as if to him, repeating the orders of the mate. peters cried out, “ay, ay,” in a disguised voice, and the cook immediately went below, without entertaining a suspicion that all was not right. my two companions now proceeded boldly aft and down into the cabin, peters closing the door after him in the same manner he had found it. the mate received them with feigned cordiality, and told augustus that, since he had behaved himself so well of late, he might take up his quarters in the cabin and be one of them for the future. he then poured him out a tumbler half full of rum, and made him drink it. all this i saw and heard, for i followed my friends to the cabin as soon as the door was shut, and took up my old point of observation. i had brought with me the two pump-handles, one of which i secured near the companion-way, to be ready for use when required. i now steadied myself as well as possible so as to have a good view of all that was passing within, and endeavoured to nerve myself to the task of descending among the mutineers when peters should make a signal to me, as agreed upon. presently he contrived to turn the conversation upon the bloody deeds of the mutiny, and by degrees led the men to talk of the thousand superstitions which are so universally current among seamen. i could not make out all that was said, but i could plainly see the effects of the conversation in the countenances of those present. the mate was evidently much agitated, and presently, when some one mentioned the terrific appearance of rogers’ corpse, i thought he was upon the point of swooning. peters now asked him if he did not think it would be better to have the body thrown overboard at once as it was too horrible a sight to see it floundering about in the scuppers. at this the villain absolutely gasped for breath, and turned his head slowly round upon his companions, as if imploring some one to go up and perform the task. no one, however, stirred, and it was quite evident that the whole party were wound up to the highest pitch of nervous excitement. peters now made me the signal. i immediately threw open the door of the companion-way, and, descending, without uttering a syllable, stood erect in the midst of the party. the intense effect produced by this sudden apparition is not at all to be wondered at when the various circumstances are taken into consideration. usually, in cases of a similar nature, there is left in the mind of the spectator some glimmering of doubt as to the reality of the vision before his eyes; a degree of hope, however feeble, that he is the victim of chicanery, and that the apparition is not actually a visitant from the old world of shadows. it is not too much to say that such remnants of doubt have been at the bottom of almost every such visitation, and that the appalling horror which has sometimes been brought about, is to be attributed, even in the cases most in point, and where most suffering has been experienced, more to a kind of anticipative horror, lest the apparition might possibly be real, than to an unwavering belief in its reality. but, in the present instance, it will be seen immediately, that in the minds of the mutineers there was not even the shadow of a basis upon which to rest a doubt that the apparition of rogers was indeed a revivification of his disgusting corpse, or at least its spiritual image. the isolated situation of the brig, with its entire inaccessibility on account of the gale, confined the apparently possible means of deception within such narrow and definite limits, that they must have thought themselves enabled to survey them all at a glance. they had now been at sea twenty-four days, without holding more than a speaking communication with any vessel whatever. the whole of the crew, too--at least all whom they had the most remote reason for suspecting to be on board--were assembled in the cabin, with the exception of allen, the watch; and his gigantic stature (he was six feet six inches high) was too familiar in their eyes to permit the notion that he was the apparition before them to enter their minds even for an instant. add to these considerations the awe-inspiring nature of the tempest, and that of the conversation brought about by peters; the deep impression which the loathsomeness of the actual corpse had made in the morning upon the imaginations of the men; the excellence of the imitation in my person, and the uncertain and wavering light in which they beheld me, as the glare of the cabin lantern, swinging violently to and fro, fell dubiously and fitfully upon my figure, and there will be no reason to wonder that the deception had even more than the entire effect which we had anticipated. the mate sprang up from the mattress on which he was lying, and, without uttering a syllable, fell back, stone dead, upon the cabin floor, and was hurled to the leeward like a log by a heavy roll of the brig. of the remaining seven, there were but three who had at first any degree of presence of mind. the four others sat for some time rooted apparently to the floor, the most pitiable objects of horror and utter despair my eyes ever encountered. the only opposition we experienced at all was from the cook, john hunt, and richard parker; but they made but a feeble and irresolute defence. the two former were shot instantly by peters, and i felled parker with a blow on the head from the pump-handle which i had brought with me. in the meantime, augustus seized one of the muskets lying on the floor and shot another mutineer wilson through the breast. there were now but three remaining; but by this time they had become aroused from their lethargy, and perhaps began to see that a deception had been practised upon them, for they fought with great resolution and fury, and, but for the immense muscular strength of peters, might have ultimately got the better of us. these three men were--jones, greely, and absolom hicks. jones had thrown augustus to the floor, stabbed him in several places along the right arm, and would no doubt have soon dispatched him (as neither peters nor myself could immediately get rid of our own antagonists), had it not been for the timely aid of a friend, upon whose assistance we, surely, had never depended. this friend was no other than tiger. with a low growl, he bounded into the cabin, at a most critical moment for augustus, and throwing himself upon jones, pinned him to the floor in an instant. my friend, however, was now too much injured to render us any aid whatever, and i was so encumbered with my disguise that i could do but little. the dog would not leave his hold upon the throat of jones--peters, nevertheless, was far more than a match for the two men who remained, and would, no doubt, have dispatched them sooner, had it not been for the narrow space in which he had to act, and the tremendous lurches of the vessel. presently he was enabled to get hold of a heavy stool, several of which lay about the floor. with this he beat out the brains of greely as he was in the act of discharging a musket at me, and immediately afterward a roll of the brig throwing him in contact with hicks, he seized him by the throat, and, by dint of sheer strength, strangled him instantaneously. thus, in far less time than i have taken to tell it, we found ourselves masters of the brig. the only person of our opponents who was left alive was richard parker. this man, it will be remembered, i had knocked down with a blow from the pump-handle at the commencement of the attack. he now lay motionless by the door of the shattered stateroom; but, upon peters touching him with his foot, he spoke, and entreated for mercy. his head was only slightly cut, and otherwise he had received no injury, having been merely stunned by the blow. he now got up, and, for the present, we secured his hands behind his back. the dog was still growling over jones; but, upon examination, we found him completely dead, the blood issuing in a stream from a deep wound in the throat, inflicted, no doubt, by the sharp teeth of the animal. it was now about one o’clock in the morning, and the wind was still blowing tremendously. the brig evidently laboured much more than usual, and it became absolutely necessary that something should be done with a view of easing her in some measure. at almost every roll to leeward she shipped a sea, several of which came partially down into the cabin during our scuffle, the hatchway having been left open by myself when i descended. the entire range of bulwarks to larboard had been swept away, as well as the caboose, together with the jollyboat from the counter. the creaking and working of the mainmast, too, gave indication that it was nearly sprung. to make room for more stowage in the afterhold, the heel of this mast had been stepped between decks (a very reprehensible practice, occasionally resorted to by ignorant ship-builders), so that it was in imminent danger of working from its step. but, to crown all our difficulties, we plummed the well, and found no less than seven feet of water. leaving the bodies of the crew lying in the cabin, we got to work immediately at the pumps--parker, of course, being set at liberty to assist us in the labour. augustus’s arm was bound up as well as we could effect it, and he did what he could, but that was not much. however, we found that we could just manage to keep the leak from gaining upon us by having one pump constantly going. as there were only four of us, this was severe labour; but we endeavoured to keep up our spirits, and looked anxiously for daybreak, when we hoped to lighten the brig by cutting away the mainmast. in this manner we passed a night of terrible anxiety and fatigue, and, when the day at length broke, the gale had neither abated in the least, nor were there any signs of its abating. we now dragged the bodies on deck and threw them overboard. our next care was to get rid of the mainmast. the necessary preparations having been made, peters cut away at the mast (having found axes in the cabin), while the rest of us stood by the stays and lanyards. as the brig gave a tremendous lee-lurch, the word was given to cut away the weather-lanyards, which being done, the whole mass of wood and rigging plunged into the sea, clear of the brig, and without doing any material injury. we now found that the vessel did not labour quite as much as before, but our situation was still exceedingly precarious, and in spite of the utmost exertions, we could not gain upon the leak without the aid of both pumps. the little assistance which augustus could render us was not really of any importance. to add to our distress, a heavy sea, striking the brig to the windward, threw her off several points from the wind, and, before she could regain her position, another broke completely over her, and hurled her full upon her beam-ends. the ballast now shifted in a mass to leeward (the stowage had been knocking about perfectly at random for some time), and for a few moments we thought nothing could save us from capsizing. presently, however, we partially righted; but the ballast still retaining its place to larboard, we lay so much along that it was useless to think of working the pumps, which indeed we could not have done much longer in any case, as our hands were entirely raw with the excessive labour we had undergone, and were bleeding in the most horrible manner. contrary to parker’s advice, we now proceeded to cut away the foremast, and at length accomplished it after much difficulty, owing to the position in which we lay. in going overboard the wreck took with it the bowsprit, and left us a complete hulk. so far we had had reason to rejoice in the escape of our longboat, which had received no damage from any of the huge seas which had come on board. but we had not long to congratulate ourselves; for the foremast having gone, and, of course, the foresail with it, by which the brig had been steadied, every sea now made a complete breach over us, and in five minutes our deck was swept from stem to stern, the longboat and starboard bulwarks torn off, and even the windlass shattered into fragments. it was, indeed, hardly possible for us to be in a more pitiable condition. at noon there seemed to be some slight appearance of the gale’s abating, but in this we were sadly disappointed, for it only lulled for a few minutes to blow with redoubled fury. about four in the afternoon it was utterly impossible to stand up against the violence of the blast; and, as the night closed in upon us, i had not a shadow of hope that the vessel would hold together until morning. by midnight we had settled very deep in the water, which was now up to the orlop deck. the rudder went soon afterward, the sea which tore it away lifting the after portion of the brig entirely from the water, against which she thumped in her descent with such a concussion as would be occasioned by going ashore. we had all calculated that the rudder would hold its own to the last, as it was unusually strong, being rigged as i have never seen one rigged either before or since. down its main timber there ran a succession of stout iron hooks, and others in the same manner down the stern-post. through these hooks there extended a very thick wrought-iron rod, the rudder being thus held to the stern-post and swinging freely on the rod. the tremendous force of the sea which tore it off may be estimated by the fact, that the hooks in the stern-post, which ran entirely through it, being clinched on the inside, were drawn every one of them completely out of the solid wood. we had scarcely time to draw breath after the violence of this shock, when one of the most tremendous waves i had then ever known broke right on board of us, sweeping the companion-way clear off, bursting in the hatchways, and filling every inch of the vessel with water. chapter <UNK> luckily, just before night, all four of us had lashed ourselves firmly to the fragments of the windlass, lying in this manner as flat upon the deck as possible. this precaution alone saved us from destruction. as it was, we were all more or less stunned by the immense weight of water which tumbled upon us, and which did not roll from above us until we were nearly exhausted. as soon as i could recover breath, i called aloud to my companions. augustus alone replied, saying: “it is all over with us, and may god have mercy upon our souls!” by-and-by both the others were enabled to speak, when they exhorted us to take courage, as there was still hope; it being impossible, from the nature of the cargo, that the brig could go down, and there being every chance that the gale would blow over by the morning. these words inspired me with new life; for, strange as it may seem, although it was obvious that a vessel with a cargo of empty oil-casks would not sink, i had been hitherto so confused in mind as to have overlooked this consideration altogether; and the danger which i had for some time regarded as the most imminent was that of foundering. as hope revived within me, i made use of every opportunity to strengthen the lashings which held me to the remains of the windlass, and in this occupation i soon discovered that my companions were also busy. the night was as dark as it could possibly be, and the horrible shrieking din and confusion which surrounded us it is useless to attempt describing. our deck lay level with the sea, or rather we were encircled with a towering ridge of foam, a portion of which swept over us every instant. it is not too much to say that our heads were not fairly out of the water more than one second in three. although we lay close together, no one of us could see the other, or, indeed, any portion of the brig itself, upon which we were so tempestuously hurled about. at intervals we called one to the other, thus endeavouring to keep alive hope, and render consolation and encouragement to such of us as stood most in need of it. the feeble condition of augustus made him an object of solicitude with us all; and as, from the lacerated condition of his right arm, it must have been impossible for him to secure his lashings with any degree of firmness, we were in momentary expectation of finding that he had gone overboard--yet to render him aid was a thing altogether out of the question. fortunately, his station was more secure than that of any of the rest of us; for the upper part of his body lying just beneath a portion of the shattered windlass, the seas, as they tumbled in upon him, were greatly broken in their violence. in any other situation than this (into which he had been accidentally thrown after having lashed himself in a very exposed spot) he must inevitably have perished before morning. owing to the brig’s lying so much along, we were all less liable to be washed off than otherwise would have been the case. the heel, as i have before stated, was to larboard, about one half of the deck being constantly under water. the seas, therefore, which struck us to starboard were much broken, by the vessel’s side, only reaching us in fragments as we lay flat on our faces; while those which came from larboard being what are called back-water seas, and obtaining little hold upon us on account of our posture, had not sufficient force to drag us from our fastenings. in this frightful situation we lay until the day broke so as to show us more fully the horrors which surrounded us. the brig was a mere log, rolling about at the mercy of every wave; the gale was upon the increase, if any thing, blowing indeed a complete hurricane, and there appeared to us no earthly prospect of deliverance. for several hours we held on in silence, expecting every moment that our lashings would either give way, that the remains of the windlass would go by the board, or that some of the huge seas, which roared in every direction around us and above us, would drive the hulk so far beneath the water that we should be drowned before it could regain the surface. by the mercy of god, however, we were preserved from these imminent dangers, and about midday were cheered by the light of the blessed sun. shortly afterward we could perceive a sensible diminution in the force of the wind, when, now for the first time since the latter part of the evening before, augustus spoke, asking peters, who lay closest to him, if he thought there was any possibility of our being saved. as no reply was at first made to this question, we all concluded that the hybrid had been drowned where he lay; but presently, to our great joy, he spoke, although very feebly, saying that he was in great pain, being so cut by the tightness of his lashings across the stomach, that he must either find means of loosening them or perish, as it was impossible that he could endure his misery much longer. this occasioned us great distress, as it was altogether useless to think of aiding him in any manner while the sea continued washing over us as it did. we exhorted him to bear his sufferings with fortitude, and promised to seize the first opportunity which should offer itself to relieve him. he replied that it would soon be too late; that it would be all over with him before we could help him; and then, after moaning for some minutes, lay silent, when we concluded that he had perished. as the evening drew on, the sea had fallen so much that scarcely more than one wave broke over the hulk from windward in the course of five minutes, and the wind had abated a great deal, although still blowing a severe gale. i had not heard any of my companions speak for hours, and now called to augustus. he replied, although very feebly, so that i could not distinguish what he said. i then spoke to peters and to parker, neither of whom returned any answer. shortly after this period i fell into a state of partial insensibility, during which the most pleasing images floated in my imagination; such as green trees, waving meadows of ripe grain, processions of dancing girls, troops of cavalry, and other phantasies. i now remember that, in all which passed before my mind’s eye, motion was a predominant idea. thus, i never fancied any stationary object, such as a house, a mountain, or any thing of that kind; but windmills, ships, large birds, balloons, people on horseback, carriages driving furiously, and similar moving objects, presented themselves in endless succession. when i recovered from this state, the sun was, as near as i could guess, an hour high. i had the greatest difficulty in bringing to recollection the various circumstances connected with my situation, and for some time remained firmly convinced that i was still in the hold of the brig, near the box, and that the body of parker was that of tiger. when i at length completely came to my senses, i found that the wind blew no more than a moderate breeze, and that the sea was comparatively calm; so much so that it only washed over the brig amidships. my left arm had broken loose from its lashings, and was much cut about the elbow; my right was entirely benumbed, and the hand and wrist swollen prodigiously by the pressure of the rope, which had worked from the shoulder downward. i was also in great pain from another rope which went about my waist, and had been drawn to an insufferable degree of tightness. looking round upon my companions, i saw that peters still lived, although a thick line was pulled so forcibly around his loins as to give him the appearance of being cut nearly in two; as i stirred, he made a feeble motion to me with his hand, pointing to the rope. augustus gave no indication of life whatever, and was bent nearly double across a splinter of the windlass. parker spoke to me when he saw me moving, and asked me if i had not sufficient strength to release him from his situation, saying that if i would summon up what spirits i could, and contrive to untie him, we might yet save our lives; but that otherwise we must all perish. i told him to take courage, and i would endeavor to free him. feeling in my pantaloons’ pocket, i got hold of my penknife, and, after several ineffectual attempts, at length succeeded in opening it. i then, with my left hand, managed to free my right from its fastenings, and afterward cut the other ropes which held me. upon attempting, however, to move from my position, i found that my legs failed me altogether, and that i could not get up; neither could i move my right arm in any direction. upon mentioning this to parker, he advised me to lie quiet for a few minutes, holding on to the windlass with my left hand, so as to allow time for the blood to circulate. doing this, the numbness presently began to die away so that i could move first one of my legs, and then the other, and, shortly afterward i regained the partial use of my right arm. i now crawled with great caution toward parker, without getting on my legs, and soon cut loose all the lashings about him, when, after a short delay, he also recovered the partial use of his limbs. we now lost no time in getting loose the rope from peters. it had cut a deep gash through the waistband of his woollen pantaloons, and through two shirts, and made its way into his groin, from which the blood flowed out copiously as we removed the cordage. no sooner had we removed it, however, than he spoke, and seemed to experience instant relief--being able to move with much greater ease than either parker or myself--this was no doubt owing to the discharge of blood. we had little hopes that augustus would recover, as he evinced no signs of life; but, upon getting to him, we discovered that he had merely swooned from the loss of blood, the bandages we had placed around his wounded arm having been torn off by the water; none of the ropes which held him to the windlass were drawn sufficiently tight to occasion his death. having relieved him from the fastenings, and got him clear of the broken wood about the windlass, we secured him in a dry place to windward, with his head somewhat lower than his body, and all three of us busied ourselves in chafing his limbs. in about half an hour he came to himself, although it was not until the next morning that he gave signs of recognizing any of us, or had sufficient strength to speak. by the time we had thus got clear of our lashings it was quite dark, and it began to cloud up, so that we were again in the greatest agony lest it should come on to blow hard, in which event nothing could have saved us from perishing, exhausted as we were. by good fortune it continued very moderate during the night, the sea subsiding every minute, which gave us great hopes of ultimate preservation. a gentle breeze still blew from the n. w., but the weather was not at all cold. augustus was lashed carefully to windward in such a manner as to prevent him from slipping overboard with the rolls of the vessel, as he was still too weak to hold on at all. for ourselves there was no such necessity. we sat close together, supporting each other with the aid of the broken ropes about the windlass, and devising methods of escape from our frightful situation. we derived much comfort from taking off our clothes and wringing the water from them. when we put them on after this, they felt remarkably warm and pleasant, and served to invigorate us in no little degree. we helped augustus off with his, and wrung them for him, when he experienced the same comfort. our chief sufferings were now those of hunger and thirst, and when we looked forward to the means of relief in this respect, our hearts sunk within us, and we were induced to regret that we had escaped the less dreadful perils of the sea. we endeavoured, however, to console ourselves with the hope of being speedily picked up by some vessel and encouraged each other to bear with fortitude the evils that might happen. the morning of the fourteenth at length dawned, and the weather still continued clear and pleasant, with a steady but very light breeze from the n. w. the sea was now quite smooth, and as, from some cause which we could not determine, the brig did not lie so much along as she had done before, the deck was comparatively dry, and we could move about with freedom. we had now been better than three entire days and nights without either food or drink, and it became absolutely necessary that we should make an attempt to get up something from below. as the brig was completely full of water, we went to this work despondently, and with but little expectation of being able to obtain anything. we made a kind of drag by driving some nails which we broke out from the remains of the companion-hatch into two pieces of wood. tying these across each other, and fastening them to the end of a rope, we threw them into the cabin, and dragged them to and fro, in the faint hope of being thus able to entangle some article which might be of use to us for food, or which might at least render us assistance in getting it. we spent the greater part of the morning in this labour without effect, fishing up nothing more than a few bedclothes, which were readily caught by the nails. indeed, our contrivance was so very clumsy that any greater success was hardly to be anticipated. we now tried the forecastle, but equally in vain, and were upon the brink of despair, when peters proposed that we should fasten a rope to his body, and let him make an attempt to get up something by diving into the cabin. this proposition we hailed with all the delight which reviving hope could inspire. he proceeded immediately to strip off his clothes with the exception of his pantaloons; and a strong rope was then carefully fastened around his middle, being brought up over his shoulders in such a manner that there was no possibility of its slipping. the undertaking was one of great difficulty and danger; for, as we could hardly expect to find much, if any, provision in the cabin itself, it was necessary that the diver, after letting himself down, should make a turn to the right, and proceed under water a distance of ten or twelve feet, in a narrow passage, to the storeroom, and return, without drawing breath. everything being ready, peters now descended in the cabin, going down the companion-ladder until the water reached his chin. he then plunged in, head first, turning to the right as he plunged, and endeavouring to make his way to the storeroom. in this first attempt, however, he was altogether unsuccessful. in less than half a minute after his going down we felt the rope jerked violently (the signal we had agreed upon when he desired to be drawn up). we accordingly drew him up instantly, but so incautiously as to bruise him badly against the ladder. he had brought nothing with him, and had been unable to penetrate more than a very little way into the passage, owing to the constant exertions he found it necessary to make in order to keep himself from floating up against the deck. upon getting out he was very much exhausted, and had to rest full fifteen minutes before he could again venture to descend. the second attempt met with even worse success; for he remained so long under water without giving the signal, that, becoming alarmed for his safety, we drew him out without it, and found that he was almost at the last gasp, having, as he said, repeatedly jerked at the rope without our feeling it. this was probably owing to a portion of it having become entangled in the balustrade at the foot of the ladder. this balustrade was, indeed, so much in the way, that we determined to remove it, if possible, before proceeding with our design. as we had no means of getting it away except by main force, we all descended into the water as far as we could on the ladder, and giving a pull against it with our united strength, succeeded in breaking it down. the third attempt was equally unsuccessful with the two first, and it now became evident that nothing could be done in this manner without the aid of some weight with which the diver might steady himself, and keep to the floor of the cabin while making his search. for a long time we looked about in vain for something which might answer this purpose; but at length, to our great joy, we discovered one of the weather-forechains so loose that we had not the least difficulty in wrenching it off. having fastened this securely to one of his ankles, peters now made his fourth descent into the cabin, and this time succeeded in making his way to the door of the steward’s room. to his inexpressible grief, however, he found it locked, and was obliged to return without effecting an entrance, as, with the greatest exertion, he could remain under water not more, at the utmost extent, than a single minute. our affairs now looked gloomy indeed, and neither augustus nor myself could refrain from bursting into tears, as we thought of the host of difficulties which encompassed us, and the slight probability which existed of our finally making an escape. but this weakness was not of long duration. throwing ourselves on our knees to god, we implored his aid in the many dangers which beset us; and arose with renewed hope and vigor to think what could yet be done by mortal means toward accomplishing our deliverance. chapter <UNK> shortly afterward an incident occurred which i am induced to look upon as more intensely productive of emotion, as far more replete with the extremes first of delight and then of horror, than even any of the thousand chances which afterward befell me in nine long years, crowded with events of the most startling and, in many cases, of the most unconceived and unconceivable character. we were lying on the deck near the companion-way, and debating the possibility of yet making our way into the storeroom, when, looking toward augustus, who lay fronting myself, i perceived that he had become all at once deadly pale, and that his lips were quivering in the most singular and unaccountable manner. greatly alarmed, i spoke to him, but he made me no reply, and i was beginning to think that he was suddenly taken ill, when i took notice of his eyes, which were glaring apparently at some object behind me. i turned my head, and shall never forget the ecstatic joy which thrilled through every particle of my frame, when i perceived a large brig bearing down upon us, and not more than a couple of miles off. i sprung to my feet as if a musket bullet had suddenly struck me to the heart; and, stretching out my arms in the direction of the vessel, stood in this manner, motionless, and unable to articulate a syllable. peters and parker were equally affected, although in different ways. the former danced about the deck like a madman, uttering the most extravagant rhodomontades, intermingled with howls and imprecations, while the latter burst into tears, and continued for many minutes weeping like a child. the vessel in sight was a large hermaphrodite brig, of a dutch build, and painted black, with a tawdry gilt figure-head. she had evidently seen a good deal of rough weather, and, we supposed, had suffered much in the gale which had proved so disastrous to ourselves; for her foretopmast was gone, and some of her starboard bulwarks. when we first saw her, she was, as i have already said, about two miles off and to windward, bearing down upon us. the breeze was very gentle, and what astonished us chiefly was, that she had no other sails set than her foremast and mainsail, with a flying jib--of course she came down but slowly, and our impatience amounted nearly to phrensy. the awkward manner in which she steered, too, was remarked by all of us, even excited as we were. she yawed about so considerably, that once or twice we thought it impossible she could see us, or imagined that, having seen us, and discovered no person on board, she was about to tack and make off in another direction. upon each of these occasions we screamed and shouted at the top of our voices, when the stranger would appear to change for a moment her intention, and again hold on toward us--this singular conduct being repeated two or three times, so that at last we could think of no other manner of accounting for it than by supposing the helmsman to be in liquor. no person was seen upon her decks until she arrived within about a quarter of a mile of us. we then saw three seamen, whom by their dress we took to be hollanders. two of these were lying on some old sails near the forecastle, and the third, who appeared to be looking at us with great curiosity, was leaning over the starboard bow near the bowsprit. this last was a stout and tall man, with a very dark skin. he seemed by his manner to be encouraging us to have patience, nodding to us in a cheerful although rather odd way, and smiling constantly, so as to display a set of the most brilliantly white teeth. as his vessel drew nearer, we saw a red flannel cap which he had on fall from his head into the water; but of this he took little or no notice, continuing his odd smiles and gesticulations. i relate these things and circumstances minutely, and i relate them, it must be understood, precisely as they _appeared _to us. the brig came on slowly, and now more steadily than before, and--i cannot speak calmly of this event--our hearts leaped up wildly within us, and we poured out our whole souls in shouts and thanksgiving to god for the complete, unexpected, and glorious deliverance that was so palpably at hand. of a sudden, and all at once, there came wafted over the ocean from the strange vessel (which was now close upon us) a smell, a stench, such as the whole world has no name for--no conception of--hellish--utterly suffocating--insufferable, inconceivable. i gasped for breath, and turning to my companions, perceived that they were paler than marble. but we had now no time left for question or surmise--the brig was within fifty feet of us, and it seemed to be her intention to run under our counter, that we might board her without putting out a boat. we rushed aft, when, suddenly, a wide yaw threw her off full five or six points from the course she had been running, and, as she passed under our stern at the distance of about twenty feet, we had a full view of her decks. shall i ever forget the triple horror of that spectacle? twenty-five or thirty human bodies, among whom were several females, lay scattered about between the counter and the galley in the last and most loathsome state of putrefaction. we plainly saw that not a soul lived in that fated vessel! yet we could not help shouting to the dead for help! yes, long and loudly did we beg, in the agony of the moment, that those silent and disgusting images would stay for us, would not abandon us to become like them, would receive us among their goodly company! we were raving with horror and despair--thoroughly mad through the anguish of our grievous disappointment. as our first loud yell of terror broke forth, it was replied to by something, from near the bowsprit of the stranger, so closely resembling the scream of a human voice that the nicest ear might have been startled and deceived. at this instant another sudden yaw brought the region of the forecastle for a moment into view, and we beheld at once the origin of the sound. we saw the tall stout figure still leaning on the bulwark, and still nodding his head to and fro, but his face was now turned from us so that we could not behold it. his arms were extended over the rail, and the palms of his hands fell outward. his knees were lodged upon a stout rope, tightly stretched, and reaching from the heel of the bowsprit to a cathead. on his back, from which a portion of the shirt had been torn, leaving it bare, there sat a huge sea-gull, busily gorging itself with the horrible flesh, its bill and talons deep buried, and its white plumage spattered all over with blood. as the brig moved farther round so as to bring us close in view, the bird, with much apparent difficulty, drew out its crimsoned head, and, after eyeing us for a moment as if stupefied, arose lazily from the body upon which it had been feasting, and, flying directly above our deck, hovered there a while with a portion of clotted and liver-like substance in its beak. the horrid morsel dropped at length with a sullen splash immediately at the feet of parker. may god forgive me, but now, for the first time, there flashed through my mind a thought, a thought which i will not mention, and i felt myself making a step toward the ensanguined spot. i looked upward, and the eyes of augustus met my own with a degree of intense and eager meaning which immediately brought me to my senses. i sprang forward quickly, and, with a deep shudder, threw the frightful thing into the sea. the body from which it had been taken, resting as it did upon the rope, had been easily swayed to and fro by the exertions of the carnivorous bird, and it was this motion which had at first impressed us with the belief of its being alive. as the gull relieved it of its weight, it swung round and fell partially over, so that the face was fully discovered. never, surely, was any object so terribly full of awe! the eyes were gone, and the whole flesh around the mouth, leaving the teeth utterly naked. this, then, was the smile which had cheered us on to hope! this the--but i forbear. the brig, as i have already told, passed under our stern, and made its way slowly but steadily to leeward. with her and with her terrible crew went all our gay visions of deliverance and joy. deliberately as she went by, we might possibly have found means of boarding her, had not our sudden disappointment and the appalling nature of the discovery which accompanied it laid entirely prostrate every active faculty of mind and body. we had seen and felt, but we could neither think nor act, until, alas! too late. how much our intellects had been weakened by this incident may be estimated by the fact, that when the vessel had proceeded so far that we could perceive no more than the half of her hull, the proposition was seriously entertained of attempting to overtake her by swimming! i have, since this period, vainly endeavoured to obtain some clew to the hideous uncertainty which enveloped the fate of the stranger. her build and general appearance, as i have before stated, led us to the belief that she was a dutch trader, and the dresses of the crew also sustained this opinion. we might have easily seen the name upon her stern, and, indeed, taken other observations, which would have guided us in making out her character; but the intense excitement of the moment blinded us to every thing of that nature. from the saffron-like hue of such of the corpses as were not entirely decayed, we concluded that the whole of her company had perished by the yellow fever, or some other virulent disease of the same fearful kind. if such were the case (and i know not what else to imagine), death, to judge from the positions of the bodies, must have come upon them in a manner awfully sudden and overwhelming, in a way totally distinct from that which generally characterizes even the most deadly pestilences with which mankind are acquainted. it is possible, indeed, that poison, accidentally introduced into some of their sea-stores, may have brought about the disaster, or that the eating of some unknown venomous species of fish, or other marine animal, or oceanic bird, might have induced it--but it is utterly useless to form conjectures where all is involved, and will, no doubt, remain for ever involved, in the most appalling and unfathomable mystery. chapter <UNK> we spent the remainder of the day in a condition of stupid lethargy, gazing after the retreating vessel until the darkness, hiding her from our sight, recalled us in some measure to our senses. the pangs of hunger and thirst then returned, absorbing all other cares and considerations. nothing, however, could be done until the morning, and, securing ourselves as well as possible, we endeavoured to snatch a little repose. in this i succeeded beyond my expectations, sleeping until my companions, who had not been so fortunate, aroused me at daybreak to renew our attempts at getting up provisions from the hull. it was now a dead calm, with the sea as smooth as i have ever known it,--the weather warm and pleasant. the brig was out of sight. we commenced our operations by wrenching off, with some trouble, another of the forechains; and having fastened both to peters’ feet, he again made an endeavour to reach the door of the storeroom, thinking it possible that he might be able to force it open, provided he could get at it in sufficient time; and this he hoped to do, as the hulk lay much more steadily than before. he succeeded very quickly in reaching the door, when, loosening one of the chains from his ankle, he made every exertion to force the passage with it, but in vain, the framework of the room being far stronger than was anticipated. he was quite exhausted with his long stay under water, and it became absolutely necessary that some other one of us should take his place. for this service parker immediately volunteered; but, after making three ineffectual efforts, found that he could never even succeed in getting near the door. the condition of augustus’s wounded arm rendered it useless for him to attempt going down, as he would be unable to force the room open should he reach it, and it accordingly now devolved upon me to exert myself for our common deliverance. peters had left one of the chains in the passage, and i found, upon plunging in, that i had not sufficient balance to keep me firmly down. i determined, therefore, to attempt no more, in my first effort, than merely to recover the other chain. in groping along the floor of the passage for this, i felt a hard substance, which i immediately grasped, not having time to ascertain what it was, but returning and ascending instantly to the surface. the prize proved to be a bottle, and our joy may be conceived when i say that it was found to be full of port wine. giving thanks to god for this timely and cheering assistance, we immediately drew the cork with my penknife, and, each taking a moderate sup, felt the most indescribable comfort from the warmth, strength, and spirits with which it inspired us. we then carefully recorked the bottle, and, by means of a handkerchief, swung it in such a manner that there was no possibility of its getting broken. having rested a while after this fortunate discovery, i again descended, and now recovered the chain, with which i instantly came up. i then fastened it on and went down for the third time, when i became fully satisfied that no exertions whatever, in that situation, would enable me to force open the door of the storeroom. i therefore returned in despair. there seemed now to be no longer any room for hope, and i could perceive in the countenances of my companions that they had made up their minds to perish. the wine had evidently produced in them a species of delirium, which, perhaps, i had been prevented from feeling by the immersion i had undergone since drinking it. they talked incoherently, and about matters unconnected with our condition, peters repeatedly asking me questions about nantucket. augustus, too, i remember, approached me with a serious air, and requested me to lend him a pocket-comb, as his hair was full of fish-scales, and he wished to get them out before going on shore. parker appeared somewhat less affected, and urged me to dive at random into the cabin, and bring up any article which might come to hand. to this i consented, and, in the first attempt, after staying under a full minute, brought up a small leather trunk belonging to captain barnard. this was immediately opened in the faint hope that it might contain something to eat or drink. we found nothing, however, except a box of razors and two linen shirts. i now went down again, and returned without any success. as my head came above water i heard a crash on deck, and, upon getting up, saw that my companions had ungratefully taken advantage of my absence to drink the remainder of the wine, having let the bottle fall in the endeavour to replace it before i saw them. i remonstrated with them on the heartlessness of their conduct, when augustus burst into tears. the other two endeavoured to laugh the matter off as a joke, but i hope never again to behold laughter of such a species: the distortion of countenance was absolutely frightful. indeed, it was apparent that the stimulus, in the empty state of their stomachs, had taken instant and violent effect, and that they were all exceedingly intoxicated. with great difficulty i prevailed upon them to lie down, when they fell very soon into a heavy slumber, accompanied with loud stertorous breathing. i now found myself, as it were, alone in the brig, and my reflections, to be sure, were of the most fearful and gloomy nature. no prospect offered itself to my view but a lingering death by famine, or, at the best, by being overwhelmed in the first gale which should spring up, for in our present exhausted condition we could have no hope of living through another. the gnawing hunger which i now experienced was nearly insupportable, and i felt myself capable of going to any lengths in order to appease it. with my knife i cut off a small portion of the leather trunk, and endeavoured to eat it, but found it utterly impossible to swallow a single morsel, although i fancied that some little alleviation of my suffering was obtained by chewing small pieces of it and spitting them out. toward night my companions awoke, one by one, each in an indescribable state of weakness and horror, brought on by the wine, whose fumes had now evaporated. they shook as if with a violent ague, and uttered the most lamentable cries for water. their condition affected me in the most lively degree, at the same time causing me to rejoice in the fortunate train of circumstances which had prevented me from indulging in the wine, and consequently from sharing their melancholy and most distressing sensations. their conduct, however, gave me great uneasiness and alarm; for it was evident that, unless some favourable change took place, they could afford me no assistance in providing for our common safety. i had not yet abandoned all idea of being able to get up something from below; but the attempt could not possibly be resumed until some one of them was sufficiently master of himself to aid me by holding the end of the rope while i went down. parker appeared to be somewhat more in possession of his senses than the others, and i endeavoured, by every means in my power, to rouse him. thinking that a plunge in the sea-water might have a beneficial effect, i contrived to fasten the end of a rope around his body, and then, leading him to the companion-way (he remaining quite passive all the while), pushed him in, and immediately drew him out. i had good reason to congratulate myself upon having made this experiment; for he appeared much revived and invigorated, and, upon getting out, asked me, in a rational manner, why i had so served him. having explained my object, he expressed himself indebted to me, and said that he felt greatly better from the immersion, afterward conversing sensibly upon our situation. we then resolved to treat augustus and peters in the same way, which we immediately did, when they both experienced much benefit from the shock. this idea of sudden immersion had been suggested to me by reading in some medical work the good effect of the shower-bath in a case where the patient was suffering from _mania a potu_. finding that i could now trust my companions to hold the end of the rope, i again made three or four plunges into the cabin, although it was now quite dark, and a gentle but long swell from the northward rendered the hulk somewhat unsteady. in the course of these attempts i succeeded in bringing up two case-knives, a three-gallon jug, empty, and a blanket, but nothing which could serve us for food. i continued my efforts, after getting these articles, until i was completely exhausted, but brought up nothing else. during the night parker and peters occupied themselves by turns in the same manner; but nothing coming to hand, we now gave up this attempt in despair, concluding that we were exhausting ourselves in vain. we passed the remainder of this night in a state of the most intense mental and bodily anguish that can possibly be imagined. the morning of the sixteenth at length dawned, and we looked eagerly around the horizon for relief, but to no purpose. the sea was still smooth, with only a long swell from the northward, as on yesterday. this was the sixth day since we had tasted either food or drink, with the exception of the bottle of port wine, and it was clear that we could hold out but a very little while longer unless something could be obtained. i never saw before, nor wish to see again, human beings so utterly emaciated as peters and augustus. had i met them on shore in their present condition i should not have had the slightest suspicion that i had ever beheld them. their countenances were totally changed in character, so that i could not bring myself to believe them really the same individuals with whom i had been in company but a few days before. parker, although sadly reduced, and so feeble that he could not raise his head from his bosom, was not so far gone as the other two. he suffered with great patience, making no complaint, and endeavouring to inspire us with hope in every manner he could devise. for myself, although at the commencement of the voyage i had been in bad health, and was at all times of a delicate constitution, i suffered less than any of us, being much less reduced in frame, and retaining my powers of mind in a surprising degree, while the rest were completely prostrated in intellect, and seemed to be brought to a species of second childhood, generally simpering in their expressions, with idiotic smiles, and uttering the most absurd platitudes. at intervals, however, they would appear to revive suddenly, as if inspired all at once with a consciousness of their condition, when they would spring upon their feet in a momentary flash of vigour, and speak, for a short period, of their prospects, in a manner altogether rational, although full of the most intense despair. it is possible, however, that my companions may have entertained the same opinion of their own condition as i did of mine, and that i may have unwittingly been guilty of the same extravagances and imbecilities as themselves--this is a matter which cannot be determined. about noon parker declared that he saw land off the larboard quarter, and it was with the utmost difficulty i could restrain him from plunging into the sea with the view of swimming toward it. peters and augustus took little notice of what he said, being apparently wrapped up in moody contemplation. upon looking in the direction pointed out, i could not perceive the faintest appearance of the shore--indeed, i was too well aware that we were far from any land to indulge in a hope of that nature. it was a long time, nevertheless, before i could convince parker of his mistake. he then burst into a flood of tears, weeping like a child, with loud cries and sobs, for two or three hours, when becoming exhausted, he fell asleep. peters and augustus now made several ineffectual efforts to swallow portions of the leather. i advised them to chew it and spit it out; but they were too excessively debilitated to be able to follow my advice. i continued to chew pieces of it at intervals, and found some relief from so doing; my chief distress was for water, and i was only prevented from taking a draught from the sea by remembering the horrible consequences which thus have resulted to others who were similarly situated with ourselves. the day wore on in this manner, when i suddenly discovered a sail to the eastward, and on our larboard bow. she appeared to be a large ship, and was coming nearly athwart us, being probably twelve or fifteen miles distant. none of my companions had as yet discovered her, and i forbore to tell them of her for the present, lest we might again be disappointed of relief. at length upon her getting nearer, i saw distinctly that she was heading immediately for us, with her light sails filled. i could now contain myself no longer, and pointed her out to my fellow-sufferers. they immediately sprang to their feet, again indulging in the most extravagant demonstrations of joy, weeping, laughing in an idiotic manner, jumping, stamping upon the deck, tearing their hair, and praying and cursing by turns. i was so affected by their conduct, as well as by what i considered a sure prospect of deliverance, that i could not refrain from joining in with their madness, and gave way to the impulses of my gratitude and ecstasy by lying and rolling on the deck, clapping my hands, shouting, and other similar acts, until i was suddenly called to my recollection, and once more to the extreme human misery and despair, by perceiving the ship all at once with her stern fully presented toward us, and steering in a direction nearly opposite to that in which i had at first perceived her. it was some time before i could induce my poor companions to believe that this sad reverse in our prospects had actually taken place. they replied to all my assertions with a stare and a gesture implying that they were not to be deceived by such misrepresentations. the conduct of augustus most sensibly affected me. in spite of all i could say or do to the contrary, he persisted in saying that the ship was rapidly nearing us, and in making preparations to go on board of her. some seaweed floating by the brig, he maintained that it was the ship’s boat, and endeavoured to throw himself upon it, howling and shrieking in the most heartrending manner, when i forcibly restrained him from thus casting himself into the sea. having become in some degree pacified, we continued to watch the ship until we finally lost sight of her, the weather becoming hazy, with a light breeze springing up. as soon as she was entirely gone, parker turned suddenly toward me with an expression of countenance which made me shudder. there was about him an air of self-possession which i had not noticed in him until now, and before he opened his lips my heart told me what he would say. he proposed, in a few words, that one of us should die to preserve the existence of the others. chapter <UNK> i had for some time past, dwelt upon the prospect of our being reduced to this last horrible extremity, and had secretly made up my mind to suffer death in any shape or under any circumstances rather than resort to such a course. nor was this resolution in any degree weakened by the present intensity of hunger under which i laboured. the proposition had not been heard by either peters or augustus. i therefore took parker aside; and mentally praying to god for power to dissuade him from the horrible purpose he entertained, i expostulated with him for a long time, and in the most supplicating manner, begging him in the name of every thing which he held sacred, and urging him by every species of argument which the extremity of the case suggested, to abandon the idea, and not to mention it to either of the other two. he heard all i said without attempting to controvert any of my arguments, and i had begun to hope that he would be prevailed upon to do as i desired. but when i had ceased speaking, he said that he knew very well all i had said was true, and that to resort to such a course was the most horrible alternative which could enter into the mind of man; but that he had now held out as long as human nature could be sustained; that it was unnecessary for all to perish, when, by the death of one, it was possible, and even probable, that the rest might be finally preserved; adding that i might save myself the trouble of trying to turn him from his purpose, his mind having been thoroughly made up on the subject even before the appearance of the ship, and that only her heaving in sight had prevented him from mentioning his intention at an earlier period. i now begged him, if he would not be prevailed upon to abandon his design, at least to defer it for another day, when some vessel might come to our relief; again reiterating every argument i could devise, and which i thought likely to have influence with one of his rough nature. he said, in reply, that he had not spoken until the very last possible moment, that he could exist no longer without sustenance of some kind, and that therefore in another day his suggestion would be too late, as regarded himself at least. finding that he was not to be moved by anything i could say in a mild tone, i now assumed a different demeanor, and told him that he must be aware i had suffered less than any of us from our calamities; that my health and strength, consequently, were at that moment far better than his own, or than that either of peters or augustus; in short, that i was in a condition to have my own way by force if i found it necessary; and that if he attempted in any manner to acquaint the others with his bloody and cannibal designs, i would not hesitate to throw him into the sea. upon this he immediately seized me by the throat, and drawing a knife, made several ineffectual efforts to stab me in the stomach; an atrocity which his excessive debility alone prevented him from accomplishing. in the meantime, being roused to a high pitch of anger, i forced him to the vessel’s side, with the full intention of throwing him overboard. he was saved from his fate, however, by the interference of peters, who now approached and separated us, asking the cause of the disturbance. this parker told before i could find means in any manner to prevent him. the effect of his words was even more terrible than what i had anticipated. both augustus and peters, who, it seems, had long secretly entertained the same fearful idea which parker had been merely the first to broach, joined with him in his design and insisted upon its immediately being carried into effect. i had calculated that one at least of the two former would be found still possessed of sufficient strength of mind to side with myself in resisting any attempt to execute so dreadful a purpose, and, with the aid of either one of them, i had no fear of being able to prevent its accomplishment. being disappointed in this expectation, it became absolutely necessary that i should attend to my own safety, as a further resistance on my part might possibly be considered by men in their frightful condition a sufficient excuse for refusing me fair play in the tragedy that i knew would speedily be enacted. i now told them i was willing to submit to the proposal, merely requesting a delay of about one hour, in order that the fog which had gathered around us might have an opportunity of lifting, when it was possible that the ship we had seen might be again in sight. after great difficulty i obtained from them a promise to wait thus long; and, as i had anticipated (a breeze rapidly coming in), the fog lifted before the hour had expired, when, no vessel appearing in sight, we prepared to draw lots. it is with extreme reluctance that i dwell upon the appalling scene which ensued; a scene which, with its minutest details, no after events have been able to efface in the slightest degree from my memory, and whose stern recollection will embitter every future moment of my existence. let me run over this portion of my narrative with as much haste as the nature of the events to be spoken of will permit. the only method we could devise for the terrific lottery, in which we were to take each a chance, was that of drawing straws. small splinters of wood were made to answer our purpose, and it was agreed that i should be the holder. i retired to one end of the hulk, while my poor companions silently took up their station in the other with their backs turned toward me. the bitterest anxiety which i endured at any period of this fearful drama was while i occupied myself in the arrangement of the lots. there are few conditions into which man can possibly fall where he will not feel a deep interest in the preservation of his existence; an interest momentarily increasing with the frailness of the tenure by which that existence may be held. but now that the silent, definite, and stern nature of the business in which i was engaged (so different from the tumultuous dangers of the storm or the gradually approaching horrors of famine) allowed me to reflect on the few chances i had of escaping the most appalling of deaths--a death for the most appalling of purposes--every particle of that energy which had so long buoyed me up departed like feathers before the wind, leaving me a helpless prey to the most abject and pitiable terror. i could not, at first, even summon up sufficient strength to tear and fit together the small splinters of wood, my fingers absolutely refusing their office, and my knees knocking violently against each other. my mind ran over rapidly a thousand absurd projects by which to avoid becoming a partner in the awful speculation. i thought of falling on my knees to my companions, and entreating them to let me escape this necessity; of suddenly rushing upon them, and, by putting one of them to death, of rendering the decision by lot useless--in short, of every thing but of going through with the matter i had in hand. at last, after wasting a long time in this imbecile conduct, i was recalled to my senses by the voice of parker, who urged me to relieve them at once from the terrible anxiety they were enduring. even then i could not bring myself to arrange the splinters upon the spot, but thought over every species of finesse by which i could trick some one of my fellow-sufferers to draw the short straw, as it had been agreed that whoever drew the shortest of four splinters from my hand was to die for the preservation of the rest. before any one condemn me for this apparent heartlessness, let him be placed in a situation precisely similar to my own. at length delay was no longer possible, and, with a heart almost bursting from my bosom, i advanced to the region of the forecastle, where my companions were awaiting me. i held out my hand with the splinters, and peters immediately drew. he was free--his, at least, was not the shortest; and there was now another chance against my escape. i summoned up all my strength, and passed the lots to augustus. he also drew immediately, and he also was free; and now, whether i should live or die, the chances were no more than precisely even. at this moment all the fierceness of the tiger possessed my bosom, and i felt toward my poor fellow-creature, parker, the most intense, the most diabolical hatred. but the feeling did not last; and, at length, with a convulsive shudder and closed eyes, i held out the two remaining splinters toward him. it was fully five minutes before he could summon resolution to draw, during which period of heartrending suspense i never once opened my eyes. presently one of the two lots was quickly drawn from my hand. the decision was then over, yet i knew not whether it was for me or against me. no one spoke, and still i dared not satisfy myself by looking at the splinter i held. peters at length took me by the hand, and i forced myself to look up, when i immediately saw by the countenance of parker that i was safe, and that he it was who had been doomed to suffer. gasping for breath, i fell senseless to the deck. i recovered from my swoon in time to behold the consummation of the tragedy in the death of him who had been chiefly instrumental in bringing it about. he made no resistance whatever, and was stabbed in the back by peters, when he fell instantly dead. i must not dwell upon the fearful repast which immediately ensued. such things may be imagined, but words have no power to impress the mind with the exquisite horror of their reality. let it suffice to say that, having in some measure appeased the raging thirst which consumed us by the blood of the victim, and having by common consent taken off the hands, feet, and head, throwing them together with the entrails, into the sea, we devoured the rest of the body, piecemeal, during the four ever memorable days of the seventeenth, eighteenth, nineteenth, and twentieth of the month. on the nineteenth, there coming on a smart shower which lasted fifteen or twenty minutes, we contrived to catch some water by means of a sheet which had been fished up from the cabin by our drag just after the gale. the quantity we took in all did not amount to more than half a gallon; but even this scanty allowance supplied us with comparative strength and hope. on the twenty-first we were again reduced to the last necessity. the weather still remained warm and pleasant, with occasional fogs and light breezes, most usually from n. to w. on the twenty-second, as we were sitting close huddled together, gloomily revolving over our lamentable condition, there flashed through my mind all at once an idea which inspired me with a bright gleam of hope. i remembered that, when the foremast had been cut away, peters, being in the windward chains, passed one of the axes into my hand, requesting me to put it, if possible, in a place of security, and that a few minutes before the last heavy sea struck the brig and filled her i had taken this axe into the forecastle and laid it in one of the larboard berths. i now thought it possible that, by getting at this axe, we might cut through the deck over the storeroom, and thus readily supply ourselves with provisions. when i communicated this object to my companions, they uttered a feeble shout of joy, and we all proceeded forthwith to the forecastle. the difficulty of descending here was greater than that of going down in the cabin, the opening being much smaller, for it will be remembered that the whole framework about the cabin companion-hatch had been carried away, whereas the forecastle-way, being a simple hatch of only about three feet square, had remained uninjured. i did not hesitate, however, to attempt the descent; and a rope being fastened round my body as before, i plunged boldly in, feet foremost, made my way quickly to the berth, and at the first attempt brought up the axe. it was hailed with the most ecstatic joy and triumph, and the ease with which it had been obtained was regarded as an omen of our ultimate preservation. we now commenced cutting at the deck with all the energy of rekindled hope, peters and myself taking the axe by turns, augustus’s wounded arm not permitting him to aid us in any degree. as we were still so feeble as to be scarcely able to stand unsupported, and could consequently work but a minute or two without resting, it soon became evident that many long hours would be necessary to accomplish our task--that is, to cut an opening sufficiently large to admit of a free access to the storeroom. this consideration, however, did not discourage us; and, working all night by the light of the moon, we succeeded in effecting our purpose by daybreak on the morning of the twenty-third. peters now volunteered to go down; and, having made all arrangements as before, he descended, and soon returned bringing up with him a small jar, which, to our great joy, proved to be full of olives. having shared these among us, and devoured them with the greatest avidity, we proceeded to let him down again. this time he succeeded beyond our utmost expectations, returning instantly with a large ham and a bottle of madeira wine. of the latter we each took a moderate sup, having learned by experience the pernicious consequences of indulging too freely. the ham, except about two pounds near the bone, was not in a condition to be eaten, having been entirely spoiled by the salt water. the sound part was divided among us. peters and augustus, not being able to restrain their appetite, swallowed theirs upon the instant; but i was more cautious, and ate but a small portion of mine, dreading the thirst which i knew would ensue. we now rested a while from our labors, which had been intolerably severe. by noon, feeling somewhat strengthened and refreshed, we again renewed our attempt at getting up provisions, peters and myself going down alternately, and always with more or less success, until sundown. during this interval we had the good fortune to bring up, altogether, four more small jars of olives, another ham, a carboy containing nearly three gallons of excellent cape madeira wine, and, what gave us still more delight, a small tortoise of the gallipago breed, several of which had been taken on board by captain barnard, as the _grampus_ was leaving port, from the schooner _mary pitts_, just returned from a sealing voyage in the pacific. in a subsequent portion of this narrative i shall have frequent occasion to mention this species of tortoise. it is found principally, as most of my readers may know, in the group of islands called the gallipagos, which, indeed, derive their name from the animal--the spanish word gallipago meaning a fresh-water terrapin. from the peculiarity of their shape and action they have been sometimes called the elephant tortoise. they are frequently found of an enormous size. i have myself seen several which would weigh from twelve to fifteen hundred pounds, although i do not remember that any navigator speaks of having seen them weighing more than eight hundred. their appearance is singular, and even disgusting. their steps are very slow, measured, and heavy, their bodies being carried about a foot from the ground. their neck is long, and exceedingly slender, from eighteen inches to two feet is a very common length, and i killed one, where the distance from the shoulder to the extremity of the head was no less than three feet ten inches. the head has a striking resemblance to that of a serpent. they can exist without food for an almost incredible length of time, instances having been known where they have been thrown into the hold of a vessel and lain two years without nourishment of any kind--being as fat, and, in every respect, in as good order at the expiration of the time as when they were first put in. in one particular these extraordinary animals bear a resemblance to the dromedary, or camel of the desert. in a bag at the root of the neck they carry with them a constant supply of water. in some instances, upon killing them after a full year’s deprivation of all nourishment, as much as three gallons of perfectly sweet and fresh water have been found in their bags. their food is chiefly wild parsley and celery, with purslain, sea-kelp, and prickly pears, upon which latter vegetable they thrive wonderfully, a great quantity of it being usually found on the hillsides near the shore wherever the animal itself is discovered. they are excellent and highly nutritious food, and have, no doubt, been the means of preserving the lives of thousands of seamen employed in the whale-fishery and other pursuits in the pacific. the one which we had the good fortune to bring up from the storeroom was not of a large size, weighing probably sixty-five or seventy pounds. it was a female, and in excellent condition, being exceedingly fat, and having more than a quart of limpid and sweet water in its bag. this was indeed a treasure; and, falling on our knees with one accord, we returned fervent thanks to god for so seasonable a relief. we had great difficulty in getting the animal up through the opening, as its struggles were fierce and its strength prodigious. it was upon the point of making its escape from peter’s grasp, and slipping back into the water, when augustus, throwing a rope with a slipknot around its throat, held it up in this manner until i jumped into the hole by the side of peters, and assisted him in lifting it out. the water we drew carefully from the bag into the jug; which, it will be remembered, had been brought up before from the cabin. having done this, we broke off the neck of a bottle so as to form, with the cork, a kind of glass, holding not quite half a gill. we then each drank one of these measures full, and resolved to limit ourselves to this quantity per day as long as it should hold out. during the last two or three days, the weather having been dry and pleasant, the bedding we had obtained from the cabin, as well as our clothing, had become thoroughly dry, so that we passed this night (that of the twenty-third) in comparative comfort, enjoying a tranquil repose, after having supped plentifully on olives and ham, with a small allowance of the wine. being afraid of losing some of our stores overboard during the night, in the event of a breeze springing up, we secured them as well as possible with cordage to the fragments of the windlass. our tortoise, which we were anxious to preserve alive as long as we could, we threw on its back, and otherwise carefully fastened. chapter <UNK> july <UNK> this morning saw us wonderfully recruited in spirits and strength. notwithstanding the perilous situation in which we were still placed, ignorant of our position, although certainly at a great distance from land, without more food than would last us for a fortnight even with great care, almost entirely without water, and floating about at the mercy of every wind and wave on the merest wreck in the world, still the infinitely more terrible distresses and dangers from which we had so lately and so providentially been delivered caused us to regard what we now endured as but little more than an ordinary evil--so strictly comparative is either good or ill. at sunrise we were preparing to renew our attempts at getting up something from the storeroom, when, a smart shower coming on, with some lightning, we turn our attention to the catching of water by means of the sheet we had used before for this purpose. we had no other means of collecting the rain than by holding the sheet spread out with one of the forechain-plates in the middle of it. the water, thus conducted to the centre, was drained through into our jug. we had nearly filled it in this manner, when, a heavy squall coming on from the northward, obliged us to desist, as the hulk began once more to roll so violently that we could no longer keep our feet. we now went forward, and, lashing ourselves securely to the remnant of the windlass as before, awaited the event with far more calmness than could have been anticipated or would have been imagined possible under the circumstances. at noon the wind had freshened into a two-reef breeze, and by night into a stiff gale, accompanied with a tremendously heavy swell. experience having taught us, however, the best method of arranging our lashings, we weathered this dreary night in tolerable security, although thoroughly drenched at almost every instant by the sea, and in momentary dread of being washed off. fortunately, the weather was so warm as to render the water rather grateful than otherwise. july <UNK> this morning the gale had diminished to a mere ten-knot breeze, and the sea had gone down with it so considerably that we were able to keep ourselves dry upon the deck. to our great grief, however, we found that two jars of our olives, as well as the whole of our ham, had been washed overboard, in spite of the careful manner in which they had been fastened. we determined not to kill the tortoise as yet, and contented ourselves for the present with a breakfast on a few of the olives, and a measure of water each, which latter we mixed half and half, with wine, finding great relief and strength from the mixture, without the distressing intoxication which had ensued upon drinking the port. the sea was still far too rough for the renewal of our efforts at getting up provision from the storeroom. several articles, of no importance to us in our present situation, floated up through the opening during the day, and were immediately washed overboard. we also now observed that the hulk lay more along than ever, so that we could not stand an instant without lashing ourselves. on this account we passed a gloomy and uncomfortable day. at noon the sun appeared to be nearly vertical, and we had no doubt that we had been driven down by the long succession of northward and northwesterly winds into the near vicinity of the equator. toward evening we saw several sharks, and were somewhat alarmed by the audacious manner in which an enormously large one approached us. at one time, a lurch throwing the deck very far beneath the water, the monster actually swam in upon us, floundering for some moments just over the companion-hatch, and striking peters violently with his tail. a heavy sea at length hurled him overboard, much to our relief. in moderate weather we might have easily captured him. july <UNK> this morning, the wind having greatly abated, and the sea not being very rough, we determined to renew our exertions in the storeroom. after a great deal of hard labor during the whole day, we found that nothing further was to be expected from this quarter, the partitions of the room having been stove during the night, and its contents swept into the hold. this discovery, as may be supposed, filled us with despair. july <UNK> the sea nearly smooth, with a light wind, and still from the northward and westward. the sun coming out hotly in the afternoon, we occupied ourselves in drying our clothes. found great relief from thirst, and much comfort otherwise, by bathing in the sea; in this, however, we were forced to use great caution, being afraid of sharks, several of which were seen swimming around the brig during the day. july <UNK> good weather still. the brig now began to lie along so alarmingly that we feared she would eventually roll bottom up. prepared ourselves as well as we could for this emergency, lashing our tortoise, waterjug, and two remaining jars of olives as far as possible over to the windward, placing them outside the hull below the main-chains. the sea very smooth all day, with little or no wind. july <UNK> a continuance of the same weather. augustus’s wounded arm began to evince symptoms of mortification. he complained of drowsiness and excessive thirst, but no acute pain. nothing could be done for his relief beyond rubbing his wounds with a little of the vinegar from the olives, and from this no benefit seemed to be experienced. we did every thing in our power for his comfort, and trebled his allowance of water. july <UNK> an excessively hot day, with no wind. an enormous shark kept close by the hulk during the whole of the forenoon. we made several unsuccessful attempts to capture him by means of a noose. augustus much worse, and evidently sinking as much from want of proper nourishment as from the effect of his wounds. he constantly prayed to be relieved from his sufferings, wishing for nothing but death. this evening we ate the last of our olives, and found the water in our jug so putrid that we could not swallow it at all without the addition of wine. determined to kill our tortoise in the morning. july <UNK> after a night of excessive anxiety and fatigue, owing to the position of the hulk, we set about killing and cutting up our tortoise. he proved to be much smaller than we had supposed, although in good condition,--the whole meat about him not amounting to more than ten pounds. with a view of preserving a portion of this as long as possible, we cut it into fine pieces, and filled with them our three remaining olive jars and the wine-bottle (all of which had been kept), pouring in afterward the vinegar from the olives. in this manner we put away about three pounds of the tortoise, intending not to touch it until we had consumed the rest. we concluded to restrict ourselves to about four ounces of the meat per day; the whole would thus last us thirteen days. a brisk shower, with severe thunder and lightning, came on about dusk, but lasted so short a time that we only succeeded in catching about half a pint of water. the whole of this, by common consent, was given to augustus, who now appeared to be in the last extremity. he drank the water from the sheet as we caught it (we holding it above him as he lay so as to let it run into his mouth), for we had now nothing left capable of holding water, unless we had chosen to empty out our wine from the carboy, or the stale water from the jug. either of these expedients would have been resorted to had the shower lasted. the sufferer seemed to derive but little benefit from the draught. his arm was completely black from the wrist to the shoulder, and his feet were like ice. we expected every moment to see him breathe his last. he was frightfully emaciated; so much so that, although he weighed a hundred and twenty-seven pounds upon his leaving nantucket, he now did not weigh more than forty or fifty at the farthest. his eyes were sunk far in his head, being scarcely perceptible, and the skin of his cheeks hung so loosely as to prevent his masticating any food, or even swallowing any liquid, without great difficulty. august <UNK> a continuance of the same calm weather, with an oppressively hot sun. suffered exceedingly from thirst, the water in the jug being absolutely putrid and swarming with vermin. we contrived, nevertheless, to swallow a portion of it by mixing it with wine; our thirst, however, was but little abated. we found more relief by bathing in the sea, but could not avail ourselves of this expedient except at long intervals, on account of the continual presence of sharks. we now saw clearly that augustus could not be saved; that he was evidently dying. we could do nothing to relieve his sufferings, which appeared to be great. about twelve o’clock he expired in strong convulsions, and without having spoken for several hours. his death filled us with the most gloomy forebodings, and had so great an effect upon our spirits that we sat motionless by the corpse during the whole day, and never addressed each other except in a whisper. it was not until some time after dark that we took courage to get up and throw the body overboard. it was then loathsome beyond expression, and so far decayed that, as peters attempted to lift it, an entire leg came off in his grasp. as the mass of putrefaction slipped over the vessel’s side into the water, the glare of phosphoric light with which it was surrounded plainly discovered to us seven or eight large sharks, the clashing of whose horrible teeth, as their prey was torn to pieces among them, might have been heard at the distance of a mile. we shrunk within ourselves in the extremity of horror at the sound. august <UNK> the same fearfully calm and hot weather. the dawn found us in a state of pitiable dejection as well as bodily exhaustion. the water in the jug was now absolutely useless, being a thick gelatinous mass; nothing but frightful-looking worms mingled with slime. we threw it out, and washed the jug well in the sea, afterward pouring a little vinegar in it from our bottles of pickled tortoise. our thirst could now scarcely be endured, and we tried in vain to relieve it by wine, which seemed only to add fuel to the flame, and excited us to a high degree of intoxication. we afterward endeavoured to relieve our sufferings by mixing the wine with seawater; but this instantly brought about the most violent retchings, so that we never again attempted it. during the whole day we anxiously sought an opportunity of bathing, but to no purpose; for the hulk was now entirely besieged on all sides with sharks--no doubt the identical monsters who had devoured our poor companion on the evening before, and who were in momentary expectation of another similar feast. this circumstance occasioned us the most bitter regret and filled us with the most depressing and melancholy forebodings. we had experienced indescribable relief in bathing, and to have this resource cut off in so frightful a manner was more than we could bear. nor, indeed, were we altogether free from the apprehension of immediate danger, for the least slip or false movement would have thrown us at once within reach of those voracious fish, who frequently thrust themselves directly upon us, swimming up to leeward. no shouts or exertions on our part seemed to alarm them. even when one of the largest was struck with an axe by peters and much wounded, he persisted in his attempts to push in where we were. a cloud came up at dusk, but, to our extreme anguish, passed over without discharging itself. it is quite impossible to conceive our sufferings from thirst at this period. we passed a sleepless night, both on this account and through dread of the sharks. august <UNK> no prospect of relief, and the brig lying still more and more along, so that now we could not maintain a footing upon deck at all. busied ourselves in securing our wine and tortoise-meat, so that we might not lose them in the event of our rolling over. got out two stout spikes from the forechains, and, by means of the axe, drove them into the hull to windward within a couple of feet of the water, this not being very far from the keel, as we were nearly upon our beam-ends. to these spikes we now lashed our provisions, as being more secure than their former position beneath the chains. suffered great agony from thirst during the whole day--no chance of bathing on account of the sharks, which never left us for a moment. found it impossible to sleep. august <UNK> a little before daybreak we perceived that the hulk was heeling over, and aroused ourselves to prevent being thrown off by the movement. at first the roll was slow and gradual, and we contrived to clamber over to windward very well, having taken the precaution to leave ropes hanging from the spikes we had driven in for the provision. but we had not calculated sufficiently upon the acceleration of the impetus; for, presently the heel became too violent to allow of our keeping pace with it; and, before either of us knew what was to happen, we found ourselves hurled furiously into the sea, and struggling several fathoms beneath the surface, with the huge hull immediately above us. in going under the water i had been obliged to let go my hold upon the rope; and finding that i was completely beneath the vessel, and my strength nearly exhausted, i scarcely made a struggle for life, and resigned myself, in a few seconds, to die. but here again i was deceived, not having taken into consideration the natural rebound of the hull to windward. the whirl of the water upward, which the vessel occasioned in rolling partially back, brought me to the surface still more violently than i had been plunged beneath. upon coming up i found myself about twenty yards from the hulk, as near as i could judge. she was lying keel up, rocking furiously from side to side, and the sea in all directions around was much agitated, and full of strong whirlpools. i could see nothing of peters. an oil-cask was floating within a few feet of me, and various other articles from the brig were scattered about. my principal terror was now on account of the sharks, which i knew to be in my vicinity. in order to deter these, if possible, from approaching me, i splashed the water vigorously with both hands and feet as i swam towards the hulk, creating a body of foam. i have no doubt that to this expedient, simple as it was, i was indebted for my preservation; for the sea all round the brig, just before her rolling over, was so crowded with these monsters, that i must have been, and really was, in actual contact with some of them during my progress. by great good fortune, however, i reached the side of the vessel in safety, although so utterly weakened by the violent exertion i had used that i should never have been able to get upon it but for the timely assistance of peters, who, now, to my great joy, made his appearance (having scrambled up to the keel from the opposite side of the hull), and threw me the end of a rope--one of those which had been attached to the spikes. having barely escaped this danger, our attention was now directed to the dreadful imminency of another--that of absolute starvation. our whole stock of provision had been swept overboard in spite of all our care in securing it; and seeing no longer the remotest possibility of obtaining more, we gave way both of us to despair, weeping aloud like children, and neither of us attempting to offer consolation to the other. such weakness can scarcely be conceived, and to those who have never been similarly situated will, no doubt, appear unnatural; but it must be remembered that our intellects were so entirely disordered by the long course of privation and terror to which we had been subjected, that we could not justly be considered, at that period, in the light of rational beings. in subsequent perils, nearly as great, if not greater, i bore up with fortitude against all the evils of my situation, and peters, it will be seen, evinced a stoical philosophy nearly as incredible as his present childlike supineness and imbecility--the mental condition made the difference. the overturning of the brig, even with the consequent loss of the wine and turtle, would not, in fact, have rendered our situation more deplorable than before, except for the disappearance of the bedclothes by which we had been hitherto enabled to catch rainwater, and of the jug in which we had kept it when caught; for we found the whole bottom, from within two or three feet of the bends as far as the keel, together with the keel itself, thickly covered with large barnacles, which proved to be excellent and highly nutritious food. thus, in two important respects, the accident we had so greatly dreaded proved to be a benefit rather than an injury; it had opened to us a supply of provisions which we could not have exhausted, using it moderately, in a month; and it had greatly contributed to our comfort as regards position, we being much more at ease, and in infinitely less danger, than before. the difficulty, however, of now obtaining water blinded us to all the benefits of the change in our condition. that we might be ready to avail ourselves, as far as possible, of any shower which might fall we took off our shirts, to make use of them as we had of the sheets--not hoping, of course, to get more in this way, even under the most favorable circumstances, than half a gill at a time. no signs of a cloud appeared during the day, and the agonies of our thirst were nearly intolerable. at night, peters obtained about an hour’s disturbed sleep, but my intense sufferings would not permit me to close my eyes for a single moment. august <UNK> to-day, a gentle breeze springing up carried us through a vast quantity of seaweed, among which we were so fortunate as to find eleven small crabs, which afforded us several delicious meals. their shells being quite soft, we ate them entire, and found that they irritated our thirst far less than the barnacles. seeing no trace of sharks among the seaweed, we also ventured to bathe, and remained in the water for four or five hours, during which we experienced a very sensible diminution of our thirst. were greatly refreshed, and spent the night somewhat more comfortably than before, both of us snatching a little sleep. august <UNK> this day we were blessed by a brisk and continual rain, lasting from about noon until after dark. bitterly did we now regret the loss of our jug and carboy; for, in spite of the little means we had of catching the water, we might have filled one, if not both of them. as it was, we contrived to satisfy the cravings of thirst by suffering the shirts to become saturated, and then wringing them so as to let the grateful fluid trickle into our mouths. in this occupation we passed the entire day. august <UNK> just at daybreak we both at the same instant descried a sail to the eastward, and _evidently coming towards us!_ we hailed the glorious sight with a long, although feeble shout of rapture; and began instantly to make every signal in our power, by flaring the shirts in the air, leaping as high as our weak condition would permit, and even by hallooing with all the strength of our lungs, although the vessel could not have been less than fifteen miles distant. however, she still continued to near our hulk, and we felt that, if she but held her present course, she must eventually come so close as to perceive us. in about an hour after we first discovered her, we could clearly see the people on her decks. she was a long, low, and rakish-looking topsail schooner, with a black ball in her foretopsail, and had, apparently, a full crew. we now became alarmed, for we could hardly imagine it possible that she did not observe us, and were apprehensive that she meant to leave us to perish as we were--an act of fiendish barbarity, which, however incredible it may appear, has been repeatedly perpetuated at sea, under circumstances very nearly similar, and by beings who were regarded as belonging to the human species. <UNK> in this instance, however, by the mercy of god, we were destined to be most happily deceived; for, presently we were aware of a sudden commotion on the deck of the stranger, who immediately afterward ran up a british flag, and, hauling her wind, bore up directly upon us. in half an hour more we found ourselves in her cabin. she proved to be the jane guy, of liverpool, captain guy, bound on a sealing and trading voyage to the south seas and pacific. chapter <UNK> the _jane guy_ was a fine-looking topsail schooner of a hundred and eighty tons burden. she was unusually sharp in the bows, and on a wind, in moderate weather, the fastest sailer i have ever seen. her qualities, however, as a rough sea-boat, were not so good, and her draught of water was by far too great for the trade to which she was destined. for this peculiar service, a larger vessel, and one of a light proportionate draught, is desirable--say a vessel of from three hundred to three hundred and fifty tons. she should be bark-rigged, and in other respects of a different construction from the usual south sea ships. it is absolutely necessary that she should be well armed. she should have, say ten or twelve twelve-pound carronades, and two or three long twelves, with brass blunderbusses, and water-tight arm-chests for each top. her anchors and cables should be of far greater strength than is required for any other species of trade, and, above all, her crew should be numerous and efficient--not less, for such a vessel as i have described, than fifty or sixty able-bodied men. the jane guy had a crew of thirty-five, all able seamen, besides the captain and mate, but she was not altogether as well armed or otherwise equipped, as a navigator acquainted with the difficulties and dangers of the trade could have desired. captain guy was a gentleman of great urbanity of manner, and of considerable experience in the southern traffic, to which he had devoted a great portion of his life. he was deficient, however, in energy, and, consequently, in that spirit of enterprise which is here so absolutely requisite. he was part owner of the vessel in which he sailed, and was invested with discretionary powers to cruise in the south seas for any cargo which might come most readily to hand. he had on board, as usual in such voyages, beads, looking-glasses, tinder-works, axes, hatchets, saws, adzes, planes, chisels, gouges, gimlets, files, spokeshaves, rasps, hammers, nails, knives, scissors, razors, needles, thread, crockery-ware, calico, trinkets, and other similar articles. the schooner sailed from liverpool on the tenth of july, crossed the tropic of cancer on the twenty-fifth, in longitude twenty degrees west, and reached sal, one of the cape verd islands, on the twenty-ninth, where she took in salt and other necessaries for the voyage. on the third of august, she left the cape verds and steered southwest, stretching over toward the coast of brazil, so as to cross the equator between the meridians of twenty-eight and thirty degrees west longitude. this is the course usually taken by vessels bound from europe to the cape of good hope, or by that route to the east indies. by proceeding thus they avoid the calms and strong contrary currents which continually prevail on the coast of guinea, while, in the end, it is found to be the shortest track, as westerly winds are never wanting afterward by which to reach the cape. it was captain guy’s intention to make his first stoppage at kerguelen’s land--i hardly know for what reason. on the day we were picked up the schooner was off cape st. roque, in longitude thirty-one degrees west; so that, when found, we had drifted probably, from north to south, _not less than five-and-twenty degrees!_ on board the jane guy we were treated with all the kindness our distressed situation demanded. in about a fortnight, during which time we continued steering to the southeast, with gentle breezes and fine weather, both peters and myself recovered entirely from the effects of our late privation and dreadful sufferings, and we began to remember what had passed rather as a frightful dream from which we had been happily awakened, than as events which had taken place in sober and naked reality. i have since found that this species of partial oblivion is usually brought about by sudden transition, whether from joy to sorrow or from sorrow to joy--the degree of forgetfulness being proportioned to the degree of difference in the exchange. thus, in my own case, i now feel it impossible to realize the full extent of the misery which i endured during the days spent upon the hulk. the incidents are remembered, but not the feelings which the incidents elicited at the time of their occurrence. i only know, that when they did occur, i then thought human nature could sustain nothing more of agony. we continued our voyage for some weeks without any incidents of greater moment than the occasional meeting with whaling-ships, and more frequently with the black or right whale, so called in contradistinction to the spermaceti. these, however, were chiefly found south of the twenty-fifth parallel. on the sixteenth of september, being in the vicinity of the cape of good hope, the schooner encountered her first gale of any violence since leaving liverpool. in this neighborhood, but more frequently to the south and east of the promontory (we were to the westward), navigators have often to contend with storms from the northward, which rage with great fury. they always bring with them a heavy sea, and one of their most dangerous features is the instantaneous chopping round of the wind, an occurrence almost certain to take place during the greatest force of the gale. a perfect hurricane will be blowing at one moment from the northward or northeast, and in the next not a breath of wind will be felt in that direction, while from the southwest it will come out all at once with a violence almost inconceivable. a bright spot to the southward is the sure forerunner of the change, and vessels are thus enabled to take the proper precautions. it was about six in the morning when the blow came on with a white squall, and, as usual, from the northward. by eight it had increased very much, and brought down upon us one of the most tremendous seas i had then ever beheld. every thing had been made as snug as possible, but the schooner laboured excessively, and gave evidence of her bad qualities as a seaboat, pitching her forecastle under at every plunge and with the greatest difficulty struggling up from one wave before she was buried in another. just before sunset the bright spot for which we had been on the look-out made its appearance in the southwest, and in an hour afterward we perceived the little headsail we carried flapping listlessly against the mast. in two minutes more, in spite of every preparation, we were hurled on our beam-ends, as if by magic, and a perfect wilderness of foam made a clear breach over us as we lay. the blow from the southwest, however, luckily proved to be nothing more than a squall, and we had the good fortune to right the vessel without the loss of a spar. a heavy cross sea gave us great trouble for a few hours after this, but toward morning we found ourselves in nearly as good condition as before the gale. captain guy considered that he had made an escape little less than miraculous. on the thirteenth of october we came in sight of prince edward’s island, in latitude <UNK> degrees <UNK> s., longitude <UNK> degrees <UNK> e. two days afterward we found ourselves near possession island, and presently passed the islands of crozet, in latitude <UNK> degrees <UNK> s., longitude <UNK> degrees e. on the eighteenth we made kerguelen’s or desolation island, in the southern indian ocean, and came to anchor in christmas harbour, having four fathoms of water. this island, or rather group of islands, bears southeast from the cape of good hope, and is distant therefrom nearly eight hundred leagues. it was first discovered in <UNK> by the baron de kergulen, or kerguelen, a frenchman, who, thinking the land to form a portion of an extensive southern continent carried home information to that effect, which produced much excitement at the time. the government, taking the matter up, sent the baron back in the following year for the purpose of giving his new discovery a critical examination, when the mistake was discovered. in <UNK> captain cook fell in with the same group, and gave to the principal one the name of desolation island, a title which it certainly well deserves. upon approaching the land, however, the navigator might be induced to suppose otherwise, as the sides of most of the hills, from september to march, are clothed with very brilliant verdure. this deceitful appearance is caused by a small plant resembling saxifrage, which is abundant, growing in large patches on a species of crumbling moss. besides this plant there is scarcely a sign of vegetation on the island, if we except some coarse rank grass near the harbor, some lichen, and a shrub which bears resemblance to a cabbage shooting into seed, and which has a bitter and acrid taste. the face of the country is hilly, although none of the hills can be called lofty. their tops are perpetually covered with snow. there are several harbors, of which christmas harbour is the most convenient. it is the first to be met with on the northeast side of the island after passing cape francois, which forms the northern shore, and, by its peculiar shape, serves to distinguish the harbour. its projecting point terminates in a high rock, through which is a large hole, forming a natural arch. the entrance is in latitude <UNK> degrees <UNK> s., longitude <UNK> degrees <UNK> e. passing in here, good anchorage may be found under the shelter of several small islands, which form a sufficient protection from all easterly winds. proceeding on eastwardly from this anchorage you come to wasp bay, at the head of the harbour. this is a small basin, completely landlocked, into which you can go with four fathoms, and find anchorage in from ten to three, hard clay bottom. a ship might lie here with her best bower ahead all the year round without risk. to the westward, at the head of wasp bay, is a small stream of excellent water, easily procured. some seal of the fur and hair species are still to be found on kerguelen’s island, and sea elephants abound. the feathered tribes are discovered in great numbers. penguins are very plenty, and of these there are four different kinds. the royal penguin, so called from its size and beautiful plumage, is the largest. the upper part of the body is usually gray, sometimes of a lilac tint; the under portion of the purest white imaginable. the head is of a glossy and most brilliant black, the feet also. the chief beauty of plumage, however, consists in two broad stripes of a gold color, which pass along from the head to the breast. the bill is long, and either pink or bright scarlet. these birds walk erect; with a stately carriage. they carry their heads high with their wings drooping like two arms, and, as their tails project from their body in a line with the legs, the resemblance to a human figure is very striking, and would be apt to deceive the spectator at a casual glance or in the gloom of the evening. the royal penguins which we met with on kerguelen’s land were rather larger than a goose. the other kinds are the macaroni, the jackass, and the rookery penguin. these are much smaller, less beautiful in plumage, and different in other respects. besides the penguin many other birds are here to be found, among which may be mentioned sea-hens, blue peterels, teal, ducks, port egmont hens, shags, cape pigeons, the nelly, sea swallows, terns, sea gulls, mother carey’s chickens, mother carey’s geese, or the great peterel, and, lastly, the albatross. the great peterel is as large as the common albatross, and is carnivorous. it is frequently called the break-bones, or osprey peterel. they are not at all shy, and, when properly cooked, are palatable food. in flying they sometimes sail very close to the surface of the water, with the wings expanded, without appearing to move them in the least degree, or make any exertion with them whatever. the albatross is one of the largest and fiercest of the south sea birds. it is of the gull species, and takes its prey on the wing, never coming on land except for the purpose of breeding. between this bird and the penguin the most singular friendship exists. their nests are constructed with great uniformity upon a plan concerted between the two species--that of the albatross being placed in the centre of a little square formed by the nests of four penguins. navigators have agreed in calling an assemblage of such encampments a rookery. these rookeries have been often described, but as my readers may not all have seen these descriptions, and as i shall have occasion hereafter to speak of the penguin and albatross, it will not be amiss to say something here of their mode of building and living. when the season for incubation arrives, the birds assemble in vast numbers, and for some days appear to be deliberating upon the proper course to be pursued. at length they proceed to action. a level piece of ground is selected, of suitable extent, usually comprising three or four acres, and situated as near the sea as possible, being still beyond its reach. the spot is chosen with reference to its evenness of surface, and that is preferred which is the least encumbered with stones. this matter being arranged, the birds proceed, with one accord, and actuated apparently by one mind, to trace out, with mathematical accuracy, either a square or other parallelogram, as may best suit the nature of the ground, and of just sufficient size to accommodate easily all the birds assembled, and no more--in this particular seeming determined upon preventing the access of future stragglers who have not participated in the labor of the encampment. one side of the place thus marked out runs parallel with the water’s edge, and is left open for ingress or egress. having defined the limits of the rookery, the colony now begin to clear it of every species of rubbish, picking up stone by stone, and carrying them outside of the lines, and close by them, so as to form a wall on the three inland sides. just within this wall a perfectly level and smooth walk is formed, from six to eight feet wide, and extending around the encampment--thus serving the purpose of a general promenade. the next process is to partition out the whole area into small squares exactly equal in size. this is done by forming narrow paths, very smooth, and crossing each other at right angles throughout the entire extent of the rookery. at each intersection of these paths the nest of an albatross is constructed, and a penguin’s nest in the centre of each square--thus every penguin is surrounded by four albatrosses, and each albatross by a like number of penguins. the penguin’s nest consists of a hole in the earth, very shallow, being only just of sufficient depth to keep her single egg from rolling. the albatross is somewhat less simple in her arrangements, erecting a hillock about a foot high and two in diameter. this is made of earth, seaweed, and shells. on its summit she builds her nest. the birds take especial care never to leave their nests unoccupied for an instant during the period of incubation, or, indeed, until the young progeny are sufficiently strong to take care of themselves. while the male is absent at sea in search of food, the female remains on duty, and it is only upon the return of her partner that she ventures abroad. the eggs are never left uncovered at all--while one bird leaves the nest the other nestling in by its side. this precaution is rendered necessary by the thieving propensities prevalent in the rookery, the inhabitants making no scruple to purloin each other’s eggs at every good opportunity. although there are some rookeries in which the penguin and albatross are the sole population, yet in most of them a variety of oceanic birds are to be met with, enjoying all the privileges of citizenship, and scattering their nests here and there, wherever they can find room, never interfering, however, with the stations of the larger species. the appearance of such encampments, when seen from a distance, is exceedingly singular. the whole atmosphere just above the settlement is darkened with the immense number of the albatross (mingled with the smaller tribes) which are continually hovering over it, either going to the ocean or returning home. at the same time a crowd of penguins are to be observed, some passing to and fro in the narrow alleys, and some marching with the military strut so peculiar to them, around the general promenade ground which encircles the rookery. in short, survey it as we will, nothing can be more astonishing than the spirit of reflection evinced by these feathered beings, and nothing surely can be better calculated to elicit reflection in every well-regulated human intellect. on the morning after our arrival in christmas harbour the chief mate, mr. patterson, took the boats, and (although it was somewhat early in the season) went in search of seal, leaving the captain and a young relation of his on a point of barren land to the westward, they having some business, whose nature i could not ascertain, to transact in the interior of the island. captain guy took with him a bottle, in which was a sealed letter, and made his way from the point on which he was set on shore toward one of the highest peaks in the place. it is probable that his design was to leave the letter on that height for some vessel which he expected to come after him. as soon as we lost sight of him we proceeded (peters and myself being in the mate’s boat) on our cruise around the coast, looking for seal. in this business we were occupied about three weeks, examining with great care every nook and corner, not only of kerguelen’s land, but of the several small islands in the vicinity. our labours, however, were not crowned with any important success. we saw a great many fur seal, but they were exceedingly shy, and with the greatest exertions, we could only procure three hundred and fifty skins in all. sea elephants were abundant, especially on the western coast of the mainland, but of these we killed only twenty, and this with great difficulty. on the smaller islands we discovered a good many of the hair seal, but did not molest them. we returned to the schooner on the eleventh, where we found captain guy and his nephew, who gave a very bad account of the interior, representing it as one of the most dreary and utterly barren countries in the world. they had remained two nights on the island, owing to some misunderstanding, on the part of the second mate, in regard to the sending a jollyboat from the schooner to take them off. chapter <UNK> on the twelfth we made sail from christmas harbour retracing our way to the westward, and leaving marion’s island, one of crozet’s group, on the larboard. we afterward passed prince edward’s island, leaving it also on our left, then, steering more to the northward, made, in fifteen days, the islands of tristan d’acunha, in latitude <UNK> degrees <UNK> s, longitude <UNK> degrees <UNK> w. this group, now so well known, and which consists of three circular islands, was first discovered by the portuguese, and was visited afterward by the dutch in <UNK> and by the french in <UNK> the three islands together form a triangle, and are distant from each other about ten miles, there being fine open passages between. the land in all of them is very high, especially in tristan d’acunha, properly so called. this is the largest of the group, being fifteen miles in circumference, and so elevated that it can be seen in clear weather at the distance of eighty or ninety miles. a part of the land toward the north rises more than a thousand feet perpendicularly from the sea. a tableland at this height extends back nearly to the centre of the island, and from this tableland arises a lofty cone like that of teneriffe. the lower half of this cone is clothed with trees of good size, but the upper region is barren rock, usually hidden among the clouds, and covered with snow during the greater part of the year. there are no shoals or other dangers about the island, the shores being remarkably bold and the water deep. on the northwestern coast is a bay, with a beach of black sand where a landing with boats can be easily effected, provided there be a southerly wind. plenty of excellent water may here be readily procured; also cod and other fish may be taken with hook and line. the next island in point of size, and the most westwardly of the group, is that called the inaccessible. its precise situation is <UNK> degrees <UNK> s. latitude, longitude <UNK> degrees <UNK> w. it is seven or eight miles in circumference, and on all sides presents a forbidding and precipitous aspect. its top is perfectly flat, and the whole region is sterile, nothing growing upon it except a few stunted shrubs. nightingale island, the smallest and most southerly, is in latitude <UNK> degrees <UNK> s., longitude <UNK> degrees <UNK> w. off its southern extremity is a high ledge of rocky islets; a few also of a similar appearance are seen to the northeast. the ground is irregular and sterile, and a deep valley partially separates it. the shores of these islands abound, in the proper season, with sea lions, sea elephants, the hair and fur seal, together with a great variety of oceanic birds. whales are also plenty in their vicinity. owing to the ease with which these various animals were here formerly taken, the group has been much visited since its discovery. the dutch and french frequented it at a very early period. in <UNK> captain patten, of the ship industry, of philadelphia, made tristan d’acunha, where he remained seven months (from august, <UNK> to april, <UNK> for the purpose of collecting sealskins. in this time he gathered no less than five thousand six hundred, and says that he would have had no difficulty in loading a large ship with oil in three weeks. upon his arrival he found no quadrupeds, with the exception of a few wild goats; the island now abounds with all our most valuable domestic animals, which have been introduced by subsequent navigators. i believe it was not long after captain patten’s visit that captain colquhoun, of the american brig betsey, touched at the largest of the islands for the purpose of refreshment. he planted onions, potatoes, cabbages, and a great many other vegetables, an abundance of all which is now to be met with. in <UNK> a captain haywood, in the nereus, visited tristan. he found there three americans, who were residing upon the island to prepare sealskins and oil. one of these men was named jonathan lambert, and he called himself the sovereign of the country. he had cleared and cultivated about sixty acres of land, and turned his attention to raising the coffee-plant and sugar-cane, with which he had been furnished by the american minister at rio janeiro. this settlement, however, was finally abandoned, and in <UNK> the islands were taken possession of by the british government, who sent a detachment for that purpose from the cape of good hope. they did not, however, retain them long; but, upon the evacuation of the country as a british possession, two or three english families took up their residence there independently of the government. on the twenty-fifth of march, <UNK> the berwick, captain jeffrey, from london to van diemen’s land, arrived at the place, where they found an englishman of the name of glass, formerly a corporal in the british artillery. he claimed to be supreme governor of the islands, and had under his control twenty-one men and three women. he gave a very favourable account of the salubrity of the climate and of the productiveness of the soil. the population occupied themselves chiefly in collecting sealskins and sea elephant oil, with which they traded to the cape of good hope, glass owning a small schooner. at the period of our arrival the governor was still a resident, but his little community had multiplied, there being fifty-six persons upon tristan, besides a smaller settlement of seven on nightingale island. we had no difficulty in procuring almost every kind of refreshment which we required--sheep, hogs, bullocks, rabbits, poultry, goats, fish in great variety, and vegetables were abundant. having come to anchor close in with the large island, in eighteen fathoms, we took all we wanted on board very conveniently. captain guy also purchased of glass five hundred sealskins and some ivory. we remained here a week, during which the prevailing winds were from the northward and westward, and the weather somewhat hazy. on the fifth of november we made sail to the southward and westward, with the intention of having a thorough search for a group of islands called the auroras, respecting whose existence a great diversity of opinion has existed. these islands are said to have been discovered as early as <UNK> by the commander of the ship aurora. in <UNK> captain manuel de oyarvido, in the ship princess, belonging to the royal philippine company, sailed, as he asserts, directly among them. in <UNK> the spanish corvette atrevida went with the determination of ascertaining their precise situation, and, in a paper published by the royal hydrographical society of madrid in the year <UNK> the following language is used respecting this expedition: “the corvette atrevida practised, in their immediate vicinity, from the twenty-first to the twenty-seventh of january, all the necessary observations, and measured by chronometers the difference of longitude between these islands and the port of soledad in the manillas. the islands are three, they are very nearly in the same meridian; the centre one is rather low, and the other two may be seen at nine leagues’ distance.” the observations made on board the atrevida give the following results as the precise situation of each island. the most northern is in latitude <UNK> degrees <UNK> <UNK> s., longitude <UNK> degrees, <UNK> <UNK> w.; the middle one in latitude <UNK> degrees <UNK> <UNK> s., longitude <UNK> degrees <UNK> <UNK> w.; and the most southern in latitude <UNK> degrees <UNK> <UNK> s., longitude <UNK> degrees <UNK> <UNK> w. on the twenty-seventh of january, <UNK> captain james weddel, of the british navy, sailed from staten land also in search of the auroras. he reports that, having made the most diligent search and passed not only immediately over the spots indicated by the commander of the atrevida, but in every direction throughout the vicinity of these spots, he could discover no indication of land. these conflicting statements have induced other navigators to look out for the islands; and, strange to say, while some have sailed through every inch of sea where they are supposed to lie without finding them, there have been not a few who declare positively that they have seen them; and even been close in with their shores. it was captain guy’s intention to make every exertion within his power to settle the question so oddly in dispute. <UNK> we kept on our course, between the south and west, with variable weather, until the twentieth of the month, when we found ourselves on the debated ground, being in latitude <UNK> degrees <UNK> s., longitude <UNK> degrees <UNK> w.--that is to say, very nearly upon the spot indicated as the situation of the most southern of the group. not perceiving any sign of land, we continued to the westward of the parallel of fifty-three degrees south, as far as the meridian of fifty degrees west. we then stood to the north as far as the parallel of fifty-two degrees south, when we turned to the eastward, and kept our parallel by double altitudes, morning and evening, and meridian altitudes of the planets and moon. having thus gone eastwardly to the meridian of the western coast of georgia, we kept that meridian until we were in the latitude from which we set out. we then took diagonal courses throughout the entire extent of sea circumscribed, keeping a lookout constantly at the masthead, and repeating our examination with the greatest care for a period of three weeks, during which the weather was remarkably pleasant and fair, with no haze whatsoever. of course we were thoroughly satisfied that, whatever islands might have existed in this vicinity at any former period, no vestige of them remained at the present day. since my return home i find that the same ground was traced over, with equal care, in <UNK> by captain johnson, of the american schooner henry, and by captain morrell in the american schooner wasp--in both cases with the same result as in our own. chapter <UNK> it had been captain guy’s original intention, after satisfying himself about the auroras, to proceed through the strait of magellan, and up along the western coast of patagonia; but information received at tristan d’acunha induced him to steer to the southward, in the hope of falling in with some small islands said to lie about the parallel of <UNK> degrees s., longitude <UNK> degrees <UNK> w. in the event of his not discovering these lands, he designed, should the season prove favourable, to push on toward the pole. accordingly, on the twelfth of december, we made sail in that direction. on the eighteenth we found ourselves about the station indicated by glass, and cruised for three days in that neighborhood without finding any traces of the islands he had mentioned. on the twenty-first, the weather being unusually pleasant, we again made sail to the southward, with the resolution of penetrating in that course as far as possible. before entering upon this portion of my narrative, it may be as well, for the information of those readers who have paid little attention to the progress of discovery in these regions, to give some brief account of the very few attempts at reaching the southern pole which have hitherto been made. that of captain cook was the first of which we have any distinct account. in <UNK> he sailed to the south in the resolution, accompanied by lieutenant furneaux in the adventure. in december he found himself as far as the fifty-eighth parallel of south latitude, and in longitude <UNK> degrees <UNK> e. here he met with narrow fields of ice, about eight or ten inches thick, and running northwest and southeast. this ice was in large cakes, and usually it was packed so closely that the vessel had great difficulty in forcing a passage. at this period captain cook supposed, from the vast number of birds to be seen, and from other indications, that he was in the near vicinity of land. he kept on to the southward, the weather being exceedingly cold, until he reached the sixty-fourth parallel, in longitude <UNK> degrees <UNK> e. here he had mild weather, with gentle breezes, for five days, the thermometer being at thirty-six. in january, <UNK> the vessels crossed the antarctic circle, but did not succeed in penetrating much farther; for upon reaching latitude <UNK> degrees <UNK> they found all farther progress impeded by an immense body of ice, extending all along the southern horizon as far as the eye could reach. this ice was of every variety--and some large floes of it, miles in extent, formed a compact mass, rising eighteen or twenty feet above the water. it being late in the season, and no hope entertained of rounding these obstructions, captain cook now reluctantly turned to the northward. in the november following he renewed his search in the antarctic. in latitude <UNK> degrees <UNK> he met with a strong current setting to the southward. in december, when the vessels were in latitude <UNK> degrees <UNK> longitude <UNK> degrees <UNK> w., the cold was excessive, with heavy gales and fog. here also birds were abundant; the albatross, the penguin, and the peterel especially. in latitude <UNK> degrees <UNK> some large islands of ice were encountered, and shortly afterward the clouds to the southward were observed to be of a snowy whiteness, indicating the vicinity of field ice. in latitude <UNK> degrees <UNK> longitude <UNK> degrees <UNK> w., the navigators were stopped, as before, by an immense frozen expanse, which filled the whole area of the southern horizon. the northern edge of this expanse was ragged and broken, so firmly wedged together as to be utterly impassible, and extending about a mile to the southward. behind it the frozen surface was comparatively smooth for some distance, until terminated in the extreme background by gigantic ranges of ice mountains, the one towering above the other. captain cook concluded that this vast field reached the southern pole or was joined to a continent. mr. j. n. reynolds, whose great exertions and perseverance have at length succeeded in getting set on foot a national expedition, partly for the purpose of exploring these regions, thus speaks of the attempt of the resolution. “we are not surprised that captain cook was unable to go beyond <UNK> degrees <UNK> but we are astonished that he did attain that point on the meridian of <UNK> degrees <UNK> west longitude. palmer’s land lies south of the shetland, latitude sixty-four degrees, and tends to the southward and westward farther than any navigator has yet penetrated. cook was standing for this land when his progress was arrested by the ice; which, we apprehend, must always be the case in that point, and so early in the season as the sixth of january--and we should not be surprised if a portion of the icy mountains described was attached to the main body of palmer’s land, or to some other portions of land lying farther to the southward and westward.” in <UNK> captains kreutzenstern and lisiausky were dispatched by alexander of russia for the purpose of circumnavigating the globe. in endeavouring to get south, they made no farther than <UNK> degrees <UNK> in longitude <UNK> degrees <UNK> w. they here met with strong currents setting eastwardly. whales were abundant, but they saw no ice. in regard to this voyage, mr. reynolds observes that, if kreutzenstern had arrived where he did earlier in the season, he must have encountered ice--it was march when he reached the latitude specified. the winds, prevailing, as they do, from the southward and westward, had carried the floes, aided by currents, into that icy region bounded on the north by georgia, east by sandwich land and the south orkneys, and west by the south shetland islands. in <UNK> captain james weddell, of the british navy, with two very small vessels, penetrated farther to the south than any previous navigator, and this, too, without encountering extraordinary difficulties. he states that although he was frequently hemmed in by ice before reaching the seventy-second parallel, yet, upon attaining it, not a particle was to be discovered, and that, upon arriving at the latitude of <UNK> degrees <UNK> no fields, and only three islands of ice were visible. it is somewhat remarkable that, although vast flocks of birds were seen, and other usual indications of land, and although, south of the shetlands, unknown coasts were observed from the masthead tending southwardly, weddell discourages the idea of land existing in the polar regions of the south. on the <UNK> of january, <UNK> captain benjamin morrell, of the american schooner wasp, sailed from kerguelen’s land with a view of penetrating as far south as possible. on the first of february he found himself in latitude <UNK> degrees <UNK> s., longitude <UNK> degrees <UNK> e. the following passage is extracted from his journal of that date. “the wind soon freshened to an eleven-knot breeze, and we embraced this opportunity of making to the west; being however convinced that the farther we went south beyond latitude sixty-four degrees, the less ice was to be apprehended, we steered a little to the southward, until we crossed the antarctic circle, and were in latitude <UNK> degrees <UNK> e. in this latitude there was no field ice, and very few ice islands in sight.” under the date of march fourteenth i find also this entry. “the sea was now entirely free of field ice, and there were not more than a dozen ice islands in sight. at the same time the temperature of the air and water was at least thirteen degrees higher (more mild) than we had ever found it between the parallels of sixty and sixty-two south. we were now in latitude <UNK> degrees <UNK> s., and the temperature of the air was forty-seven, and that of the water forty-four. in this situation i found the variation to be <UNK> degrees <UNK> easterly, per azimuth.... i have several times passed within the antarctic circle, on different meridians, and have uniformly found the temperature, both of the air and the water, to become more and more mild the farther i advanced beyond the sixty-fifth degree of south latitude, and that the variation decreases in the same proportion. while north of this latitude, say between sixty and sixty-five south, we frequently had great difficulty in finding a passage for the vessel between the immense and almost innumerable ice islands, some of which were from one to two miles in circumference, and more than five hundred feet above the surface of the water.” being nearly destitute of fuel and water, and without proper instruments, it being also late in the season, captain morrell was now obliged to put back, without attempting any further progress to the westward, although an entirely open, sea lay before him. he expresses the opinion that, had not these overruling considerations obliged him to retreat, he could have penetrated, if not to the pole itself, at least to the eighty-fifth parallel. i have given his ideas respecting these matters somewhat at length, that the reader may have an opportunity of seeing how far they were borne out by my own subsequent experience. in <UNK> captain briscoe, in the employ of the messieurs enderby, whale-ship owners of london, sailed in the brig lively for the south seas, accompanied by the cutter tula. on the twenty-eighth of february, being in latitude <UNK> degrees <UNK> s., longitude <UNK> degrees <UNK> e., he descried land, and “clearly discovered through the snow the black peaks of a range of mountains running e. s. e.” he remained in this neighbourhood during the whole of the following month, but was unable to approach the coast nearer than within ten leagues, owing to the boisterous state of the weather. finding it impossible to make further discovery during this season, he returned northward to winter in van diemen’s land. in the beginning of <UNK> he again proceeded southwardly, and on the fourth of february land was seen to the southeast in latitude <UNK> degrees <UNK> longitude <UNK> degrees <UNK> w. this was soon found to be an island near the headland of the country he had first discovered. on the twenty-first of the month he succeeded in landing on the latter, and took possession of it in the name of william iv, calling it adelaide’s island, in honour of the english queen. these particulars being made known to the royal geographical society of london, the conclusion was drawn by that body “that there is a continuous tract of land extending from <UNK> degrees <UNK> e. to <UNK> degrees <UNK> w. longitude, running the parallel of from sixty-six to sixty-seven degrees south latitude.” in respect to this conclusion mr. reynolds observes: “in the correctness of it we by no means concur; nor do the discoveries of briscoe warrant any such indifference. it was within these limits that weddel proceeded south on a meridian to the east of georgia, sandwich land, and the south orkney and shetland islands.” my own experience will be found to testify most directly to the falsity of the conclusion arrived at by the society. these are the principal attempts which have been made at penetrating to a high southern latitude, and it will now be seen that there remained, previous to the voyage of the jane, nearly three hundred degrees of longitude in which the antarctic circle had not been crossed at all. of course a wide field lay before us for discovery, and it was with feelings of most intense interest that i heard captain guy express his resolution of pushing boldly to the southward. chapter <UNK> we kept our course southwardly for four days after giving up the search for glass’s islands, without meeting with any ice at all. on the twenty-sixth, at noon, we were in latitude <UNK> degrees <UNK> s., longitude <UNK> degrees <UNK> w. we now saw several large ice islands, and a floe of field ice, not, however, of any great extent. the winds generally blew from the southeast, or the northeast, but were very light. whenever we had a westerly wind, which was seldom, it was invariably attended with a rain squall. every day we had more or less snow. the thermometer, on the twenty-seventh stood at thirty-five. january <UNK> <UNK> day we found ourselves completely hemmed in by the ice, and our prospects looked cheerless indeed. a strong gale blew, during the whole forenoon, from the northeast, and drove large cakes of the drift against the rudder and counter with such violence that we all trembled for the consequences. toward evening, the gale still blowing with fury, a large field in front separated, and we were enabled, by carrying a press of sail to force a passage through the smaller flakes into some open water beyond. as we approached this space we took in sail by degrees, and having at length got clear, lay-to under a single reefed foresail. january <UNK> had now tolerably pleasant weather. at noon we found ourselves in latitude <UNK> degrees <UNK> s, longitude <UNK> degrees <UNK> w, having crossed the antarctic circle. very little ice was to be seen to the southward, although large fields of it lay behind us. this day we rigged some sounding gear, using a large iron pot capable of holding twenty gallons, and a line of two hundred fathoms. we found the current setting to the north, about a quarter of a mile per hour. the temperature of the air was now about thirty-three. here we found the variation to be <UNK> degrees <UNK> easterly, per azimuth. january <UNK> had still held on to the southward without any very great impediments. on this morning, however, being in latitude <UNK> degrees <UNK> e., longitude <UNK> degrees <UNK> w, we were again brought to a stand by an immense expanse of firm ice. we saw, nevertheless, much open water to the southward, and felt no doubt of being able to reach it eventually. standing to the eastward along the edge of the floe, we at length came to a passage of about a mile in width, through which we warped our way by sundown. the sea in which we now were was thickly covered with ice islands, but had no field ice, and we pushed on boldly as before. the cold did not seem to increase, although we had snow very frequently, and now and then hail squalls of great violence. immense flocks of the albatross flew over the schooner this day, going from southeast to northwest. january <UNK> sea still remained pretty well open, so that we had no difficulty in holding on our course. to the westward we saw some icebergs of incredible size, and in the afternoon passed very near one whose summit could not have been less than four hundred fathoms from the surface of the ocean. its girth was probably, at the base, three-quarters of a league, and several streams of water were running from crevices in its sides. we remained in sight of this island two days, and then only lost it in a fog. january <UNK> this morning we had the misfortune to lose a man overboard. he was an american named peter vredenburgh, a native of new york, and was one of the most valuable hands on board the schooner. in going over the bows his foot slipped, and he fell between two cakes of ice, never rising again. at noon of this day we were in latitude <UNK> degrees <UNK> longitude <UNK> degrees <UNK> w. the cold was now excessive, and we had hail squalls continually from the northward and eastward. in this direction also we saw several more immense icebergs, and the whole horizon to the eastward appeared to be blocked up with field ice, rising in tiers, one mass above the other. some driftwood floated by during the evening, and a great quantity of birds flew over, among which were nellies, peterels, albatrosses, and a large bird of a brilliant blue plumage. the variation here, per azimuth, was less than it had been previously to our passing the antarctic circle. january <UNK> passage to the south again looked doubtful, as nothing was to be seen in the direction of the pole but one apparently limitless floe, backed by absolute mountains of ragged ice, one precipice of which arose frowningly above the other. we stood to the westward until the fourteenth, in the hope of finding an entrance. january <UNK> morning we reached the western extremity of the field which had impeded us, and, weathering it, came to an open sea, without a particle of ice. upon sounding with two hundred fathoms, we here found a current setting southwardly at the rate of half a mile per hour. the temperature of the air was forty-seven, that of the water thirty-four. we now sailed to the southward without meeting any interruption of moment until the sixteenth, when, at noon, we were in latitude <UNK> degrees <UNK> longitude <UNK> degrees w. we here again sounded, and found a current setting still southwardly, and at the rate of three quarters of a mile per hour. the variation per azimuth had diminished, and the temperature of the air was mild and pleasant, the thermometer being as high as fifty-one. at this period not a particle of ice was to be discovered. all hands on board now felt certain of attaining the pole. january <UNK> day was full of incident. innumerable flights of birds flew over us from the southward, and several were shot from the deck, one of them, a species of pelican, proved to be excellent eating. about midday a small floe of ice was seen from the masthead off the larboard bow, and upon it there appeared to be some large animal. as the weather was good and nearly calm, captain guy ordered out two of the boats to see what it was. dirk peters and myself accompanied the mate in the larger boat. upon coming up with the floe, we perceived that it was in the possession of a gigantic creature of the race of the arctic bear, but far exceeding in size the largest of these animals. being well armed, we made no scruple of attacking it at once. several shots were fired in quick succession, the most of which took effect, apparently, in the head and body. nothing discouraged, however, the monster threw himself from the ice, and swam with open jaws, to the boat in which were peters and myself. owing to the confusion which ensued among us at this unexpected turn of the adventure, no person was ready immediately with a second shot, and the bear had actually succeeded in getting half his vast bulk across our gunwale, and seizing one of the men by the small of his back, before any efficient means were taken to repel him. in this extremity nothing but the promptness and agility of peters saved us from destruction. leaping upon the back of the huge beast, he plunged the blade of a knife behind the neck, reaching the spinal marrow at a blow. the brute tumbled into the sea lifeless, and without a struggle, rolling over peters as he fell. the latter soon recovered himself, and a rope being thrown him, he secured the carcass before entering the boat. we then returned in triumph to the schooner, towing our trophy behind us. this bear, upon admeasurement, proved to be full fifteen feet in his greatest length. his wool was perfectly white, and very coarse, curling tightly. the eyes were of a blood red, and larger than those of the arctic bear, the snout also more rounded, rather resembling the snout of the bulldog. the meat was tender, but excessively rank and fishy, although the men devoured it with avidity, and declared it excellent eating. scarcely had we got our prize alongside, when the man at the masthead gave the joyful shout of “land on the starboard bow!” all hands were now upon the alert, and, a breeze springing up very opportunely from the northward and eastward, we were soon close in with the coast. it proved to be a low rocky islet, of about a league in circumference, and altogether destitute of vegetation, if we except a species of prickly pear. in approaching it from the northward, a singular ledge of rock is seen projecting into the sea, and bearing a strong resemblance to corded bales of cotton. around this ledge to the westward is a small bay, at the bottom of which our boats effected a convenient landing. it did not take us long to explore every portion of the island, but, with one exception, we found nothing worthy of our observation. in the southern extremity, we picked up near the shore, half buried in a pile of loose stones, a piece of wood, which seemed to have formed the prow of a canoe. there had been evidently some attempt at carving upon it, and captain guy fancied that he made out the figure of a tortoise, but the resemblance did not strike me very forcibly. besides this prow, if such it were, we found no other token that any living creature had ever been here before. around the coast we discovered occasional small floes of ice--but these were very few. the exact situation of the islet (to which captain guy gave the name of bennet’s islet, in honour of his partner in the ownership of the schooner) is <UNK> degrees <UNK> s. latitude, <UNK> degrees <UNK> w. longitude. we had now advanced to the southward more than eight degrees farther than any previous navigators, and the sea still lay perfectly open before us. we found, too, that the variation uniformly decreased as we proceeded, and, what was still more surprising, that the temperature of the air, and latterly of the water, became milder. the weather might even be called pleasant, and we had a steady but very gentle breeze always from some northern point of the compass. the sky was usually clear, with now and then a slight appearance of thin vapour in the southern horizon--this, however, was invariably of brief duration. two difficulties alone presented themselves to our view; we were getting short of fuel, and symptoms of scurvy had occurred among several of the crew. these considerations began to impress upon captain guy the necessity of returning, and he spoke of it frequently. for my own part, confident as i was of soon arriving at land of some description upon the course we were pursuing, and having every reason to believe, from present appearances, that we should not find it the sterile soil met with in the higher arctic latitudes, i warmly pressed upon him the expediency of persevering, at least for a few days longer, in the direction we were now holding. so tempting an opportunity of solving the great problem in regard to an antarctic continent had never yet been afforded to man, and i confess that i felt myself bursting with indignation at the timid and ill-timed suggestions of our commander. i believe, indeed, that what i could not refrain from saying to him on this head had the effect of inducing him to push on. while, therefore, i cannot but lament the most unfortunate and bloody events which immediately arose from my advice, i must still be allowed to feel some degree of gratification at having been instrumental, however remotely, in opening to the eye of science one of the most intensely exciting secrets which has ever engrossed its attention. chapter <UNK> january <UNK> morning <UNK> we continued to the southward, with the same pleasant weather as before. the sea was entirely smooth, the air tolerably warm and from the northeast, the temperature of the water fifty-three. we now again got our sounding-gear in order, and, with a hundred and fifty fathoms of line, found the current setting toward the pole at the rate of a mile an hour. this constant tendency to the southward, both in the wind and current, caused some degree of speculation, and even of alarm, in different quarters of the schooner, and i saw distinctly that no little impression had been made upon the mind of captain guy. he was exceedingly sensitive to ridicule, however, and i finally succeeded in laughing him out of his apprehensions. the variation was now very trivial. in the course of the day we saw several large whales of the right species, and innumerable flights of the albatross passed over the vessel. we also picked up a bush, full of red berries, like those of the hawthorn, and the carcass of a singular-looking land-animal. it was three feet in length, and but six inches in height, with four very short legs, the feet armed with long claws of a brilliant scarlet, and resembling coral in substance. the body was covered with a straight silky hair, perfectly white. the tail was peaked like that of a rat, and about a foot and a half long. the head resembled a cat’s, with the exception of the ears--these were flopped like the ears of a dog. the teeth were of the same brilliant scarlet as the claws. january <UNK> being in latitude <UNK> degrees <UNK> longitude <UNK> degrees <UNK> w. (the sea being of an extraordinarily dark colour), we again saw land from the masthead, and, upon a closer scrutiny, found it to be one of a group of very large islands. the shore was precipitous, and the interior seemed to be well wooded, a circumstance which occasioned us great joy. in about four hours from our first discovering the land we came to anchor in ten fathoms, sandy bottom, a league from the coast, as a high surf, with strong ripples here and there, rendered a nearer approach of doubtful expediency. the two largest boats were now ordered out, and a party, well armed (among whom were peters and myself), proceeded to look for an opening in the reef which appeared to encircle the island. after searching about for some time, we discovered an inlet, which we were entering, when we saw four large canoes put off from the shore, filled with men who seemed to be well armed. we waited for them to come up, and, as they moved with great rapidity, they were soon within hail. captain guy now held up a white handkerchief on the blade of an oar, when the strangers made a full stop, and commenced a loud jabbering all at once, intermingled with occasional shouts, in which we could distinguish the words anamoo-moo! and lama-lama! they continued this for at least half an hour, during which we had a good opportunity of observing their appearance. in the four canoes, which might have been fifty feet long and five broad, there were a hundred and ten savages in all. they were about the ordinary stature of europeans, but of a more muscular and brawny frame. their complexion a jet black, with thick and long woolly hair. they were clothed in skins of an unknown black animal, shaggy and silky, and made to fit the body with some degree of skill, the hair being inside, except where turned out about the neck, wrists, and ankles. their arms consisted principally of clubs, of a dark, and apparently very heavy wood. some spears, however, were observed among them, headed with flint, and a few slings. the bottoms of the canoes were full of black stones about the size of a large egg. when they had concluded their harangue (for it was clear they intended their jabbering for such), one of them who seemed to be the chief stood up in the prow of his canoe, and made signs for us to bring our boats alongside of him. this hint we pretended not to understand, thinking it the wiser plan to maintain, if possible, the interval between us, as their number more than quadrupled our own. finding this to be the case, the chief ordered the three other canoes to hold back, while he advanced toward us with his own. as soon as he came up with us he leaped on board the largest of our boats, and seated himself by the side of captain guy, pointing at the same time to the schooner, and repeating the word anamoo-moo! and lama-lama! we now put back to the vessel, the four canoes following at a little distance. upon getting alongside, the chief evinced symptoms of extreme surprise and delight, clapping his hands, slapping his thighs and breast, and laughing obstreperously. his followers behind joined in his merriment, and for some minutes the din was so excessive as to be absolutely deafening. quiet being at length restored, captain guy ordered the boats to be hoisted up, as a necessary precaution, and gave the chief (whose name we soon found to be too-wit) to understand that we could admit no more than twenty of his men on deck at one time. with this arrangement he appeared perfectly satisfied, and gave some directions to the canoes, when one of them approached, the rest remaining about fifty yards off. twenty of the savages now got on board, and proceeded to ramble over every part of the deck, and scramble about among the rigging, making themselves much at home, and examining every article with great inquisitiveness. it was quite evident that they had never before seen any of the white race--from whose complexion, indeed, they appeared to recoil. they believed the jane to be a living creature, and seemed to be afraid of hurting it with the points of their spears, carefully turning them up. our crew were much amused with the conduct of too-wit in one instance. the cook was splitting some wood near the galley, and, by accident, struck his axe into the deck, making a gash of considerable depth. the chief immediately ran up, and pushing the cook on one side rather roughly, commenced a half whine, half howl, strongly indicative of sympathy in what he considered the sufferings of the schooner, patting and smoothing the gash with his hand, and washing it from a bucket of seawater which stood by. this was a degree of ignorance for which we were not prepared, and for my part i could not help thinking some of it affected. when the visitors had satisfied, as well as they could, their curiosity in regard to our upper works, they were admitted below, when their amazement exceeded all bounds. their astonishment now appeared to be far too deep for words, for they roamed about in silence, broken only by low ejaculations. the arms afforded them much food for speculation, and they were suffered to handle and examine them at leisure. i do not believe that they had the least suspicion of their actual use, but rather took them for idols, seeing the care we had of them, and the attention with which we watched their movements while handling them. at the great guns their wonder was redoubled. they approached them with every mark of the profoundest reverence and awe, but forbore to examine them minutely. there were two large mirrors in the cabin, and here was the acme of their amazement. too-wit was the first to approach them, and he had got in the middle of the cabin, with his face to one and his back to the other, before he fairly perceived them. upon raising his eyes and seeing his reflected self in the glass, i thought the savage would go mad; but, upon turning short round to make a retreat, and beholding himself a second time in the opposite direction, i was afraid he would expire upon the spot. no persuasion could prevail upon him to take another look; throwing himself upon the floor, with his face buried in his hands, he remained thus until we were obliged to drag him upon deck. the whole of the savages were admitted on board in this manner, twenty at a time, too-wit being suffered to remain during the entire period. we saw no disposition to thievery among them, nor did we miss a single article after their departure. throughout the whole of their visit they evinced the most friendly manner. there were, however, some points in their demeanour which we found it impossible to understand; for example, we could not get them to approach several very harmless objects--such as the schooner’s sails, an egg, an open book, or a pan of flour. we endeavoured to ascertain if they had among them any articles which might be turned to account in the way of traffic, but found great difficulty in being comprehended. we made out, nevertheless, what greatly astonished us, that the islands abounded in the large tortoise of the gallipagos, one of which we saw in the canoe of too-wit. we saw also some biche de mer in the hands of one of the savages, who was greedily devouring it in its natural state. these anomalies--for they were such when considered in regard to the latitude--induced captain guy to wish for a thorough investigation of the country, in the hope of making a profitable speculation in his discovery. for my own part, anxious as i was to know something more of these islands, i was still more earnestly bent on prosecuting the voyage to the southward without delay. we had now fine weather, but there was no telling how long it would last; and being already in the eighty-fourth parallel, with an open sea before us, a current setting strongly to the southward, and the wind fair, i could not listen with any patience to a proposition of stopping longer than was absolutely necessary for the health of the crew and the taking on board a proper supply of fuel and fresh provisions. i represented to the captain that we might easily make this group on our return, and winter here in the event of being blocked up by the ice. he at length came into my views (for in some way, hardly known to myself, i had acquired much influence over him), and it was finally resolved that, even in the event of our finding biche de mer, we should only stay here a week to recruit, and then push on to the southward while we might. accordingly we made every necessary preparation, and, under the guidance of too-wit, got the jane through the reef in safety, coming to anchor about a mile from the shore, in an excellent bay, completely landlocked, on the southeastern coast of the main island, and in ten fathoms of water, black sandy bottom. at the head of this bay there were three fine springs (we were told) of good water, and we saw abundance of wood in the vicinity. the four canoes followed us in, keeping, however, at a respectful distance. too-wit himself remained on board, and, upon our dropping anchor, invited us to accompany him on shore, and visit his village in the interior. to this captain guy consented; and ten savages being left on board as hostages, a party of us, twelve in all, got in readiness to attend the chief. we took care to be well armed, yet without evincing any distrust. the schooner had her guns run out, her boarding-nettings up, and every other proper precaution was taken to guard against surprise. directions were left with the chief mate to admit no person on board during our absence, and, in the event of our not appearing in twelve hours, to send the cutter, with a swivel, around the island in search of us. at every step we took inland the conviction forced itself upon us that we were in a country differing essentially from any hitherto visited by civilized men. we saw nothing with which we had been formerly conversant. the trees resembled no growth of either the torrid, the temperate, or the northern frigid zones, and were altogether unlike those of the lower southern latitudes we had already traversed. the very rocks were novel in their mass, their color, and their stratification; and the streams themselves, utterly incredible as it may appear, had so little in common with those of other climates, that we were scrupulous of tasting them, and, indeed, had difficulty in bringing ourselves to believe that their qualities were purely those of nature. at a small brook which crossed our path (the first we had reached) too-wit and his attendants halted to drink. on account of the singular character of the water, we refused to taste it, supposing it to be polluted; and it was not until some time afterward we came to understand that such was the appearance of the streams throughout the whole group. i am at a loss to give a distinct idea of the nature of this liquid, and cannot do so without many words. although it flowed with rapidity in all declivities where common water would do so, yet never, except when falling in a cascade, had it the customary appearance of limpidity. it was, nevertheless, in point of fact, as perfectly limpid as any limestone water in existence, the difference being only in appearance. at first sight, and especially in cases where little declivity was found, it bore resemblance, as regards consistency, to a thick infusion of gum arabic in common water. but this was only the least remarkable of its extraordinary qualities. it was not colourless, nor was it of any one uniform colour--presenting to the eye, as it flowed, every possible shade of purple; like the hues of a changeable silk. this variation in shade was produced in a manner which excited as profound astonishment in the minds of our party as the mirror had done in the case of too-wit. upon collecting a basinful, and allowing it to settle thoroughly, we perceived that the whole mass of liquid was made up of a number of distinct veins, each of a distinct hue; that these veins did not commingle; and that their cohesion was perfect in regard to their own particles among themselves, and imperfect in regard to neighbouring veins. upon passing the blade of a knife athwart the veins, the water closed over it immediately, as with us, and also, in withdrawing it, all traces of the passage of the knife were instantly obliterated. if, however, the blade was passed down accurately between the two veins, a perfect separation was effected, which the power of cohesion did not immediately rectify. the phenomena of this water formed the first definite link in that vast chain of apparent miracles with which i was destined to be at length encircled. chapter <UNK> we were nearly three hours in reaching the village, it being more than nine miles in the interior, and the path lying through a rugged country. as we passed along, the party of too-wit (the whole hundred and ten savages of the canoes) was momentarily strengthened by smaller detachments, of from two to six or seven, which joined us, as if by accident, at different turns of the road. there appeared so much of system in this that i could not help feeling distrust, and i spoke to captain guy of my apprehensions. it was now too late, however, to recede, and we concluded that our best security lay in evincing a perfect confidence in the good faith of too-wit. we accordingly went on, keeping a wary eye upon the manoeuvres of the savages, and not permitting them to divide our numbers by pushing in between. in this way, passing through a precipitous ravine, we at length reached what we were told was the only collection of habitations upon the island. as we came in sight of them, the chief set up a shout, and frequently repeated the word klock-klock, which we supposed to be the name of the village, or perhaps the generic name for villages. the dwellings were of the most miserable description imaginable, and, unlike those of even the lowest of the savage races with which mankind are acquainted, were of no uniform plan. some of them (and these we found belonged to the wampoos or yampoos, the great men of the land) consisted of a tree cut down at about four feet from the root, with a large black skin thrown over it, and hanging in loose folds upon the ground. under this the savage nestled. others were formed by means of rough limbs of trees, with the withered foliage upon them, made to recline, at an angle of forty-five degrees, against a bank of clay, heaped up, without regular form, to the height of five or six feet. others, again, were mere holes dug in the earth perpendicularly, and covered over with similar branches, these being removed when the tenant was about to enter, and pulled on again when he had entered. a few were built among the forked limbs of trees as they stood, the upper limbs being partially cut through, so as to bend over upon the lower, thus forming thicker shelter from the weather. the greater number, however, consisted of small shallow caverns, apparently scratched in the face of a precipitous ledge of dark stone, resembling fuller’s earth, with which three sides of the village were bounded. at the door of each of these primitive caverns was a small rock, which the tenant carefully placed before the entrance upon leaving his residence, for what purpose i could not ascertain, as the stone itself was never of sufficient size to close up more than a third of the opening. this village, if it were worthy of the name, lay in a valley of some depth, and could only be approached from the southward, the precipitous ledge of which i have already spoken cutting off all access in other directions. through the middle of the valley ran a brawling stream of the same magical-looking water which has been described. we saw several strange animals about the dwellings, all appearing to be thoroughly domesticated. the largest of these creatures resembled our common hog in the structure of the body and snout; the tail, however, was bushy, and the legs slender as those of the antelope. its motion was exceedingly awkward and indecisive, and we never saw it attempt to run. we noticed also several animals very similar in appearance, but of a greater length of body, and covered with a black wool. there were a great variety of tame fowls running about, and these seemed to constitute the chief food of the natives. to our astonishment we saw black albatross among these birds in a state of entire domestication, going to sea periodically for food, but always returning to the village as a home, and using the southern shore in the vicinity as a place of incubation. there they were joined by their friends the pelicans as usual, but these latter never followed them to the dwellings of the savages. among the other kinds of tame fowls were ducks, differing very little from the canvass-back of our own country, black gannets, and a large bird not unlike the buzzard in appearance, but not carnivorous. of fish there seemed to be a great abundance. we saw, during our visit, a quantity of dried salmon, rock cod, blue dolphins, mackerel, blackfish, skate, conger eels, elephantfish, mullets, soles, parrotfish, leather-jackets, gurnards, hake, flounders, paracutas, and innumerable other varieties. we noticed, too, that most of them were similar to the fish about the group of lord auckland islands, in a latitude as low as fifty-one degrees south. the gallipago tortoise was also very plentiful. we saw but few wild animals, and none of a large size, or of a species with which we were familiar. one or two serpents of a formidable aspect crossed our path, but the natives paid them little attention, and we concluded that they were not venomous. as we approached the village with too-wit and his party, a vast crowd of the people rushed out to meet us, with loud shouts, among which we could only distinguish the everlasting anamoo-moo! and lama-lama! we were much surprised at perceiving that, with one or two exceptions, these new comers were entirely naked, and skins being used only by the men of the canoes. all the weapons of the country seemed also to be in the possession of the latter, for there was no appearance of any among the villagers. there were a great many women and children, the former not altogether wanting in what might be termed personal beauty. they were straight, tall, and well formed, with a grace and freedom of carriage not to be found in civilized society. their lips, however, like those of the men, were thick and clumsy, so that, even when laughing, the teeth were never disclosed. their hair was of a finer texture than that of the males. among these naked villagers there might have been ten or twelve who were clothed, like the party of too-wit, in dresses of black skin, and armed with lances and heavy clubs. these appeared to have great influence among the rest, and were always addressed by the title wampoo. these, too, were the tenants of the black skin palaces. that of too-wit was situated in the centre of the village, and was much larger and somewhat better constructed than others of its kind. the tree which formed its support was cut off at a distance of twelve feet or thereabouts from the root, and there were several branches left just below the cut, these serving to extend the covering, and in this way prevent its flapping about the trunk. the covering, too, which consisted of four very large skins fastened together with wooden skewers, was secured at the bottom with pegs driven through it and into the ground. the floor was strewed with a quantity of dry leaves by way of carpet. to this hut we were conducted with great solemnity, and as many of the natives crowded in after us as possible. too-wit seated himself on the leaves, and made signs that we should follow his example. this we did, and presently found ourselves in a situation peculiarly uncomfortable, if not indeed critical. we were on the ground, twelve in number, with the savages, as many as forty, sitting on their hams so closely around us that, if any disturbance had arisen, we should have found it impossible to make use of our arms, or indeed to have risen to our feet. the pressure was not only inside the tent, but outside, where probably was every individual on the whole island, the crowd being prevented from trampling us to death only by the incessant exertions and vociferations of too-wit. our chief security lay, however, in the presence of too-wit himself among us, and we resolved to stick by him closely, as the best chance of extricating ourselves from the dilemma, sacrificing him immediately upon the first appearance of hostile design. after some trouble a certain degree of quiet was restored, when the chief addressed us in a speech of great length, and very nearly resembling the one delivered in the canoes, with the exception that the anamoo-moos! were now somewhat more strenuously insisted upon than the lama-lamas! we listened in profound silence until the conclusion of this harangue, when captain guy replied by assuring the chief of his eternal friendship and goodwill, concluding what he had to say by a present of several strings of blue beads and a knife. at the former the monarch, much to our surprise, turned up his nose with some expression of contempt, but the knife gave him the most unlimited satisfaction, and he immediately ordered dinner. this was handed into the tent over the heads of the attendants, and consisted of the palpitating entrails of a specialis of unknown animal, probably one of the slim-legged hogs which we had observed in our approach to the village. seeing us at a loss how to proceed, he began, by way of setting us an example, to devour yard after yard of the enticing food, until we could positively stand it no longer, and evinced such manifest symptoms of rebellion of stomach as inspired his majesty with a degree of astonishment only inferior to that brought about by the looking-glasses. we declined, however, partaking of the delicacies before us, and endeavoured to make him understand that we had no appetite whatever, having just finished a hearty dejeuner. when the monarch had made an end of his meal, we commenced a series of cross-questioning in every ingenious manner we could devise, with a view of discovering what were the chief productions of the country, and whether any of them might be turned to profit. at length he seemed to have some idea of our meaning, and offered to accompany us to a part of coast where he assured us the biche de mer (pointing to a specimen of that animal) was to be found in great abundance. we were glad of this early opportunity of escaping from the oppression of the crowd, and signified our eagerness to proceed. we now left the tent, and, accompanied by the whole population of the village, followed the chief to the southeastern extremity of the island, nor far from the bay where our vessel lay at anchor. we waited here for about an hour, until the four canoes were brought around by some of the savages to our station. the whole of our party then getting into one of them, we were paddled along the edge of the reef before mentioned, and of another still farther out, where we saw a far greater quantity of biche de mer than the oldest seamen among us had ever seen in those groups of the lower latitudes most celebrated for this article of commerce. we stayed near these reefs only long enough to satisfy ourselves that we could easily load a dozen vessels with the animal if necessary, when we were taken alongside the schooner, and parted with too-wit, after obtaining from him a promise that he would bring us, in the course of twenty-four hours, as many of the canvass-back ducks and gallipago tortoises as his canoes would hold. in the whole of this adventure we saw nothing in the demeanour of the natives calculated to create suspicion, with the single exception of the systematic manner in which their party was strengthened during our route from the schooner to the village. chapter <UNK> the chief was as good as his word, and we were soon plentifully supplied with fresh provisions. we found the tortoises as fine as we had ever seen, and the ducks surpassed our best species of wild fowl, being exceedingly tender, juicy, and well-flavoured. besides these, the savages brought us, upon our making them comprehend our wishes, a vast quantity of brown celery and scurvy grass, with a canoe-load of fresh fish and some dried. the celery was a treat indeed, and the scurvy grass proved of incalculable benefit in restoring those of our men who had shown symptoms of disease. in a very short time we had not a single person on the sick-list. we had also plenty of other kinds of fresh provisions, among which may be mentioned a species of shellfish resembling the mussel in shape, but with the taste of an oyster. shrimps, too, and prawns were abundant, and albatross and other birds’ eggs with dark shells. we took in, too, a plentiful stock of the flesh of the hog which i have mentioned before. most of the men found it a palatable food, but i thought it fishy and otherwise disagreeable. in return for these good things we presented the natives with blue beads, brass trinkets, nails, knives, and pieces of red cloth, they being fully delighted in the exchange. we established a regular market on shore, just under the guns of the schooner, where our barterings were carried on with every appearance of good faith, and a degree of order which their conduct at the village of _klock-klock_ had not led us to expect from the savages. matters went on thus very amicably for several days, during which parties of the natives were frequently on board the schooner, and parties of our men frequently on shore, making long excursions into the interior, and receiving no molestation whatever. finding the ease with which the vessel might be loaded with _biche de mer_, owing to the friendly disposition of the islanders, and the readiness with which they would render us assistance in collecting it, captain guy resolved to enter into negotiations with too-wit for the erection of suitable houses in which to cure the article, and for the services of himself and tribe in gathering as much as possible, while he himself took advantage of the fine weather to prosecute his voyage to the southward. upon mentioning this project to the chief he seemed very willing to enter into an agreement. a bargain was accordingly struck, perfectly satisfactory to both parties, by which it was arranged that, after making the necessary preparations, such as laying off the proper grounds, erecting a portion of the buildings, and doing some other work in which the whole of our crew would be required, the schooner should proceed on her route, leaving three of her men on the island to superintend the fulfilment of the project, and instruct the natives in drying the _biche de mer_. in regard to terms, these were made to depend upon the exertions of the savages in our absence. they were to receive a stipulated quantity of blue beads, knives, red cloth, and so forth, for every certain number of piculs of the _biche de mer_ which should be ready on our return. a description of the nature of this important article of commerce, and the method of preparing it, may prove of some interest to my readers, and i can find no more suitable place than this for introducing an account of it. the following comprehensive notice of the substance is taken from a modern history of a voyage to the south seas. “it is that _mollusca_ from the indian seas which is known to commerce by the french name _bouche de mer_ (a nice morsel from the sea). if i am not much mistaken, the celebrated cuvier calls it _gasteropeda pulmonifera_. it is abundantly gathered in the coasts of the pacific islands, and gathered especially for the chinese market, where it commands a great price, perhaps as much as their much-talked-of edible birds’ nests, which are properly made up of the gelatinous matter picked up by a species of swallow from the body of these molluscae. they have no shell, no legs, nor any prominent part, except an _absorbing_ and an _excretory_, opposite organs; but, by their elastic wings, like caterpillars or worms, they creep in shallow waters, in which, when low, they can be seen by a kind of swallow, the sharp bill of which, inserted in the soft animal, draws a gummy and filamentous substance, which, by drying, can be wrought into the solid walls of their nest. hence the name of _gasteropeda pulmonifera_. “this mollusca is oblong, and of different sizes, from three to eighteen inches in length; and i have seen a few that were not less than two feet long. they were nearly round, a little flattish on one side, which lies next to the bottom of the sea; and they are from one to eight inches thick. they crawl up into shallow water at particular seasons of the year, probably for the purpose of gendering, as we often find them in pairs. it is when the sun has the most power on the water, rendering it tepid, that they approach the shore; and they often go up into places so shallow that, on the tide’s receding, they are left dry, exposed to the beat of the sun. but they do not bring forth their young in shallow water, as we never see any of their progeny, and full-grown ones are always observed coming in from deep water. they feed principally on that class of zoophytes which produce the coral. “the _biche de mer_ is generally taken in three or four feet of water; after which they are brought on shore, and split at one end with a knife, the incision being one inch or more, according to the size of the mollusca. through this opening the entrails are forced out by pressure, and they are much like those of any other small tenant of the deep. the article is then washed, and afterward boiled to a certain degree, which must not be too much or too little. they are then buried in the ground for four hours, then boiled again for a short time, after which they are dried, either by the fire or the sun. those cured by the sun are worth the most; but where one picul <UNK> <UNK> lbs.) can be cured that way, i can cure thirty piculs by the fire. when once properly cured, they can be kept in a dry place for two or three years without any risk; but they should be examined once in every few months, say four times a year, to see if any dampness is likely to affect them. “the chinese, as before stated, consider _biche de mer_ a very great luxury, believing that it wonderfully strengthens and nourishes the system, and renews the exhausted system of the immoderate voluptuary. the first quality commands a high price in canton, being worth ninety dollars a picul; the second quality, seventy-five dollars; the third, fifty dollars; the fourth, thirty dollars; the fifth, twenty dollars; the sixth, twelve dollars; the seventh, eight dollars; and the eighth, four dollars; small cargoes, however, will often bring more in manilla, singapore, and batavia.” an agreement having been thus entered into, we proceeded immediately to land everything necessary for preparing the buildings and clearing the ground. a large flat space near the eastern shore of the bay was selected, where there was plenty of both wood and water, and within a convenient distance of the principal reefs on which the _biche de mer_ was to be procured. we now all set to work in good earnest, and soon, to the great astonishment of the savages, had felled a sufficient number of trees for our purpose, getting them quickly in order for the framework of the houses, which in two or three days were so far under way that we could safely trust the rest of the work to the three men whom we intended to leave behind. these were john carson, alfred harris, and ___ peterson (all natives of london, i believe), who volunteered their services in this respect. by the last of the month we had everything in readiness for departure. we had agreed, however, to pay a formal visit of leave-taking to the village, and too-wit insisted so pertinaciously upon our keeping the promise that we did not think it advisable to run the risk of offending him by a final refusal. i believe that not one of us had at this time the slightest suspicion of the good faith of the savages. they had uniformly behaved with the greatest decorum, aiding us with alacrity in our work, offering us their commodities, frequently without price, and never, in any instance, pilfering a single article, although the high value they set upon the goods we had with us was evident by the extravagant demonstrations of joy always manifested upon our making them a present. the women especially were most obliging in every respect, and, upon the whole, we should have been the most suspicious of human beings had we entertained a single thought of perfidy on the part of a people who treated us so well. a very short while sufficed to prove that this apparent kindness of disposition was only the result of a deeply laid plan for our destruction, and that the islanders for whom we entertained such inordinate feelings of esteem, were among the most barbarous, subtle, and bloodthirsty wretches that ever contaminated the face of the globe. it was on the first of february that we went on shore for the purpose of visiting the village. although, as said before, we entertained not the slightest suspicion, still no proper precaution was neglected. six men were left in the schooner, with instructions to permit none of the savages to approach the vessel during our absence, under any pretence whatever, and to remain constantly on deck. the boarding-nettings were up, the guns double-shotted with grape and canister, and the swivels loaded with canisters of musket-balls. she lay, with her anchor apeak, about a mile from the shore, and no canoe could approach her in any direction without being distinctly seen and exposed to the full fire of our swivels immediately. the six men being left on board, our shore-party consisted of thirty-two persons in all. we were armed to the teeth, having with us muskets, pistols, and cutlasses; besides, each had a long kind of seaman’s knife, somewhat resembling the bowie knife now so much used throughout our western and southern country. a hundred of the black skin warriors met us at the landing for the purpose of accompanying us on our way. we noticed, however, with some surprise, that they were now entirely without arms; and, upon questioning too-wit in relation to this circumstance, he merely answered that _mattee non we pa pa si_--meaning that there was no need of arms where all were brothers. we took this in good part, and proceeded. we had passed the spring and rivulet of which i before spoke, and were now entering upon a narrow gorge leading through the chain of soapstone hills among which the village was situated. this gorge was very rocky and uneven, so much so that it was with no little difficulty we scrambled through it on our first visit to klock-klock. the whole length of the ravine might have been a mile and a half, or probably two miles. it wound in every possible direction through the hills (having apparently formed, at some remote period, the bed of a torrent), in no instance proceeding more than twenty yards without an abrupt turn. the sides of this dell would have averaged, i am sure, seventy or eighty feet in perpendicular altitude throughout the whole of their extent, and in some portions they arose to an astonishing height, overshadowing the pass so completely that but little of the light of day could penetrate. the general width was about forty feet, and occasionally it diminished so as not to allow the passage of more than five or six persons abreast. in short, there could be no place in the world better adapted for the consummation of an ambuscade, and it was no more than natural that we should look carefully to our arms as we entered upon it. when i now think of our egregious folly, the chief subject of astonishment seems to be, that we should have ever ventured, under any circumstances, so completely into the power of unknown savages as to permit them to march both before and behind us in our progress through this ravine. yet such was the order we blindly took up, trusting foolishly to the force of our party, the unarmed condition of too-wit and his men, the certain efficacy of our firearms (whose effect was yet a secret to the natives), and, more than all, to the long-sustained pretension of friendship kept up by these infamous wretches. five or six of them went on before, as if to lead the way, ostentatiously busying themselves in removing the larger stones and rubbish from the path. next came our own party. we walked closely together, taking care only to prevent separation. behind followed the main body of the savages, observing unusual order and decorum. dirk peters, a man named wilson allen, and myself were on the right of our companions, examining, as we went along, the singular stratification of the precipice which overhung us. a fissure in the soft rock attracted our attention. it was about wide enough for one person to enter without squeezing, and extended back into the hill some eighteen or twenty feet in a straight course, sloping afterward to the left. the height of the opening, is far as we could see into it from the main gorge, was perhaps sixty or seventy feet. there were one or two stunted shrubs growing from the crevices, bearing a species of filbert which i felt some curiosity to examine, and pushed in briskly for that purpose, gathering five or six of the nuts at a grasp, and then hastily retreating. as i turned, i found that peters and allen had followed me. i desired them to go back, as there was not room for two persons to pass, saying they should have some of my nuts. they accordingly turned, and were scrambling back, allen being close to the mouth of the fissure, when i was suddenly aware of a concussion resembling nothing i had ever before experienced, and which impressed me with a vague conception, if indeed i then thought of anything, that the whole foundations of the solid globe were suddenly rent asunder, and that the day of universal dissolution was at hand. chapter <UNK> as soon as i could collect my scattered senses, i found myself nearly suffocated, and grovelling in utter darkness among a quantity of loose earth, which was also falling upon me heavily in every direction, threatening to bury me entirely. horribly alarmed at this idea, i struggled to gain my feet, and at last succeeded. i then remained motionless for some moments, endeavouring to conceive what had happened to me, and where i was. presently i heard a deep groan just at my ear, and afterward the smothered voice of peters calling to me for aid in the name of god. i scrambled one or two paces forward, when i fell directly over the head and shoulders of my companion, who, i soon discovered, was buried in a loose mass of earth as far as his middle, and struggling desperately to free himself from the pressure. i tore the dirt from around him with all the energy i could command, and at length succeeded in getting him out. as soon as we sufficiently recovered from our fright and surprise to be capable of conversing rationally, we both came to the conclusion that the walls of the fissure in which we had ventured had, by some convulsion of nature, or probably from their own weight, caved in overhead, and that we were consequently lost for ever, being thus entombed alive. for a long time we gave up supinely to the most intense agony and despair, such as cannot be adequately imagined by those who have never been in a similar position. i firmly believed that no incident ever occurring in the course of human events is more adapted to inspire the supremeness of mental and bodily distress than a case like our own, of living inhumation. the blackness of darkness which envelops the victim, the terrific oppression of lungs, the stifling fumes from the damp earth, unite with the ghastly considerations that we are beyond the remotest confines of hope, and that such is the allotted portion of the dead, to carry into the human heart a degree of appalling awe and horror not to be tolerated--never to be conceived. at length peters proposed that we should endeavour to ascertain precisely the extent of our calamity, and grope about our prison; it being barely possible, he observed, that some opening might yet be left us for escape. i caught eagerly at this hope, and, arousing myself to exertion, attempted to force my way through the loose earth. hardly had i advanced a single step before a glimmer of light became perceptible, enough to convince me that, at all events, we should not immediately perish for want of air. we now took some degree of heart, and encouraged each other to hope for the best. having scrambled over a bank of rubbish which impeded our farther progress in the direction of the light, we found less difficulty in advancing and also experienced some relief from the excessive oppression of lungs which had tormented us. presently we were enabled to obtain a glimpse of the objects around, and discovered that we were near the extremity of the straight portion of the fissure, where it made a turn to the left. a few struggles more, and we reached the bend, when to our inexpressible joy, there appeared a long seam or crack extending upward a vast distance, generally at an angle of about forty-five degrees, although sometimes much more precipitous. we could not see through the whole extent of this opening; but, as a good deal of light came down it, we had little doubt of finding at the top of it (if we could by any means reach the top) a clear passage into the open air. i now called to mind that three of us had entered the fissure from the main gorge, and that our companion, allen, was still missing; we determined at once to retrace our steps and look for him. after a long search, and much danger from the farther caving in of the earth above us, peters at length cried out to me that he had hold of our companion’s foot, and that his whole body was deeply buried beneath the rubbish beyond the possibility of extricating him. i soon found that what he said was too true, and that, of course, life had been long extinct. with sorrowful hearts, therefore, we left the corpse to its fate, and again made our way to the bend. the breadth of the seam was barely sufficient to admit us, and, after one or two ineffectual efforts at getting up, we began once more to despair. i have before said that the chain of hills through which ran the main gorge was composed of a species of soft rock resembling soapstone. the sides of the cleft we were now attempting to ascend were of the same material, and so excessively slippery, being wet, that we could get but little foothold upon them even in their least precipitous parts; in some places, where the ascent was nearly perpendicular, the difficulty was, of course, much aggravated; and, indeed, for some time we thought insurmountable. we took courage, however, from despair, and what, by dint of cutting steps in the soft stone with our bowie knives, and swinging at the risk of our lives, to small projecting points of a harder species of slaty rock which now and then protruded from the general mass, we at length reached a natural platform, from which was perceptible a patch of blue sky, at the extremity of a thickly-wooded ravine. looking back now, with somewhat more leisure, at the passage through which we had thus far proceeded, we clearly saw from the appearance of its sides, that it was of late formation, and we concluded that the concussion, whatever it was, which had so unexpectedly overwhelmed us, had also, at the same moment, laid open this path for escape. being quite exhausted with exertion, and indeed, so weak that we were scarcely able to stand or articulate, peters now proposed that we should endeavour to bring our companions to the rescue by firing the pistols which still remained in our girdles--the muskets as well as cutlasses had been lost among the loose earth at the bottom of the chasm. subsequent events proved that, had we fired, we should have sorely repented it, but luckily a half suspicion of foul play had by this time arisen in my mind, and we forbore to let the savages know of our whereabouts. after having reposed for about an hour, we pushed on slowly up the ravine, and had gone no great way before we heard a succession of tremendous yells. at length we reached what might be called the surface of the ground; for our path hitherto, since leaving the platform, had lain beneath an archway of high rock and foliage, at a vast distance overhead. with great caution we stole to a narrow opening, through which we had a clear sight of the surrounding country, when the whole dreadful secret of the concussion broke upon us in one moment and at one view. the spot from which we looked was not far from the summit of the highest peak in the range of the soapstone hills. the gorge in which our party of thirty-two had entered ran within fifty feet to the left of us. but, for at least one hundred yards, the channel or bed of this gorge was entirely filled up with the chaotic ruins of more than a million tons of earth and stone that had been artificially tumbled within it. the means by which the vast mass had been precipitated were not more simple than evident, for sure traces of the murderous work were yet remaining. in several spots along the top of the eastern side of the gorge (we were now on the western) might be seen stakes of wood driven into the earth. in these spots the earth had not given way, but throughout the whole extent of the face of the precipice from which the mass had fallen, it was clear, from marks left in the soil resembling those made by the drill of the rock blaster, that stakes similar to those we saw standing had been inserted, at not more than a yard apart, for the length of perhaps three hundred feet, and ranging at about ten feet back from the edge of the gulf. strong cords of grape vine were attached to the stakes still remaining on the hill, and it was evident that such cords had also been attached to each of the other stakes. i have already spoken of the singular stratification of these soapstone hills; and the description just given of the narrow and deep fissure through which we effected our escape from inhumation will afford a further conception of its nature. this was such that almost every natural convulsion would be sure to split the soil into perpendicular layers or ridges running parallel with one another, and a very moderate exertion of art would be sufficient for effecting the same purpose. of this stratification the savages had availed themselves to accomplish their treacherous ends. there can be no doubt that, by the continuous line of stakes, a partial rupture of the soil had been brought about probably to the depth of one or two feet, when by means of a savage pulling at the end of each of the cords (these cords being attached to the tops of the stakes, and extending back from the edge of the cliff), a vast leverage power was obtained, capable of hurling the whole face of the hill, upon a given signal, into the bosom of the abyss below. the fate of our poor companions was no longer a matter of uncertainty. we alone had escaped from the tempest of that overwhelming destruction. we were the only living white men upon the island. chapter <UNK> our situation, as it now appeared, was scarcely less dreadful than when we had conceived ourselves entombed forever. we saw before us no prospect but that of being put to death by the savages, or of dragging out a miserable existence in captivity among them. we might, to be sure, conceal ourselves for a time from their observation among the fastnesses of the hills, and, as a final resort, in the chasm from which we had just issued; but we must either perish in the long polar winter through cold and famine, or be ultimately discovered in our efforts to obtain relief. the whole country around us seemed to be swarming with savages, crowds of whom, we now perceived, had come over from the islands to the southward on flat rafts, doubtless with a view of lending their aid in the capture and plunder of the jane. the vessel still lay calmly at anchor in the bay, those on board being apparently quite unconscious of any danger awaiting them. how we longed at that moment to be with them! either to aid in effecting their escape, or to perish with them in attempting a defence. we saw no chance even of warning them of their danger without bringing immediate destruction upon our own heads, with but a remote hope of benefit to them. a pistol fired might suffice to apprise them that something wrong had occurred; but the report could not possibly inform them that their only prospect of safety lay in getting out of the harbour forthwith--it could not tell them that no principles of honour now bound them to remain, that their companions were no longer among the living. upon hearing the discharge they could not be more thoroughly prepared to meet the foe, who were now getting ready to attack, than they already were, and always had been. no good, therefore, and infinite harm, would result from our firing, and after mature deliberation, we forbore. our next thought was to attempt to rush toward the vessel, to seize one of the four canoes which lay at the head of the bay, and endeavour to force a passage on board. but the utter impossibility of succeeding in this desperate task soon became evident. the country, as i said before, was literally swarming with the natives, skulking among the bushes and recesses of the hills, so as not to be observed from the schooner. in our immediate vicinity especially, and blockading the sole path by which we could hope to attain the shore at the proper point were stationed the whole party of the black skin warriors, with too-wit at their head, and apparently only waiting for some re-enforcement to commence his onset upon the jane. the canoes, too, which lay at the head of the bay, were manned with savages, unarmed, it is true, but who undoubtedly had arms within reach. we were forced, therefore, however unwillingly, to remain in our place of concealment, mere spectators of the conflict which presently ensued. in about half an hour we saw some sixty or seventy rafts, or flatboats, without riggers, filled with savages, and coming round the southern bight of the harbor. they appeared to have no arms except short clubs, and stones which lay in the bottom of the rafts. immediately afterward another detachment, still larger, appeared in an opposite direction, and with similar weapons. the four canoes, too, were now quickly filled with natives, starting up from the bushes at the head of the bay, and put off swiftly to join the other parties. thus, in less time than i have taken to tell it, and as if by magic, the jane saw herself surrounded by an immense multitude of desperadoes evidently bent upon capturing her at all hazards. that they would succeed in so doing could not be doubted for an instant. the six men left in the vessel, however resolutely they might engage in her defence, were altogether unequal to the proper management of the guns, or in any manner to sustain a contest at such odds. i could hardly imagine that they would make resistance at all, but in this was deceived; for presently i saw them get springs upon the cable, and bring the vessel’s starboard broadside to bear upon the canoes, which by this time were within pistol range, the rafts being nearly a quarter of a mile to windward. owing to some cause unknown, but most probably to the agitation of our poor friends at seeing themselves in so hopeless a situation, the discharge was an entire failure. not a canoe was hit or a single savage injured, the shots striking short and ricocheting over their heads. the only effect produced upon them was astonishment at the unexpected report and smoke, which was so excessive that for some moments i almost thought they would abandon their design entirely, and return to the shore. and this they would most likely have done had our men followed up their broadside by a discharge of small arms, in which, as the canoes were now so near at hand, they could not have failed in doing some execution, sufficient, at least, to deter this party from a farther advance, until they could have given the rafts also a broadside. but, in place of this, they left the canoe party to recover from their panic, and, by looking about them, to see that no injury had been sustained, while they flew to the larboard to get ready for the rafts. the discharge to larboard produced the most terrible effect. the star and double-headed shot of the large guns cut seven or eight of the rafts completely asunder, and killed, perhaps, thirty or forty of the savages outright, while a hundred of them, at least, were thrown into the water, the most of them dreadfully wounded. the remainder, frightened out of their senses, commenced at once a precipitate retreat, not even waiting to pick up their maimed companions, who were swimming about in every direction, screaming and yelling for aid. this great success, however, came too late for the salvation of our devoted people. the canoe party were already on board the schooner to the number of more than a hundred and fifty, the most of them having succeeded in scrambling up the chains and over the boarding-netting even before the matches had been applied to the larboard guns. nothing now could withstand their brute rage. our men were borne down at once, overwhelmed, trodden under foot, and absolutely torn to pieces in an instant. seeing this, the savages on the rafts got the better of their fears, and came up in shoals to the plunder. in five minutes the jane was a pitiable scene indeed of havoc and tumultuous outrage. the decks were split open and ripped up; the cordage, sails, and everything movable on deck demolished as if by magic, while, by dint of pushing at the stern, towing with the canoes, and hauling at the sides, as they swam in thousands around the vessel, the wretches finally forced her on shore (the cable having been slipped), and delivered her over to the good offices of too-wit, who, during the whole of the engagement, had maintained, like a skilful general, his post of security and reconnaissance among the hills, but, now that the victory was completed to his satisfaction, condescended to scamper down with his warriors of the black skin, and become a partaker in the spoils. too-wit’s descent left us at liberty to quit our hiding place and reconnoitre the hill in the vicinity of the chasm. at about fifty yards from the mouth of it we saw a small spring of water, at which we slaked the burning thirst that now consumed us. not far from the spring we discovered several of the filbert-bushes which i mentioned before. upon tasting the nuts we found them palatable, and very nearly resembling in flavour the common english filbert. we collected our hats full immediately, deposited them within the ravine, and returned for more. while we were busily employed in gathering these, a rustling in the bushes alarmed us, and we were upon the point of stealing back to our covert, when a large black bird of the bittern species strugglingly and slowly arose above the shrubs. i was so much startled that i could do nothing, but peters had sufficient presence of mind to run up to it before it could make its escape, and seize it by the neck. its struggles and screams were tremendous, and we had thoughts of letting it go, lest the noise should alarm some of the savages who might be still lurking in the neighbourhood. a stab with a bowie knife, however, at length brought it to the ground, and we dragged it into the ravine, congratulating ourselves that, at all events, we had thus obtained a supply of food enough to last us for a week. we now went out again to look about us, and ventured a considerable distance down the southern declivity of the hill, but met with nothing else which could serve us for food. we therefore collected a quantity of dry wood and returned, seeing one or two large parties of the natives on their way to the village, laden with the plunder of the vessel, and who, we were apprehensive, might discover us in passing beneath the hill. our next care was to render our place of concealment as secure as possible, and with this object, we arranged some brushwood over the aperture which i have before spoken of as the one through which we saw the patch of blue sky, on reaching the platform from the interior of the chasm. we left only a very small opening just wide enough to admit of our seeing the bay, without the risk of being discovered from below. having done this, we congratulated ourselves upon the security of the position; for we were now completely excluded from observation, as long as we chose to remain within the ravine itself, and not venture out upon the hill, we could perceive no traces of the savages having ever been within this hollow; but, indeed, when we came to reflect upon the probability that the fissure through which we attained it had been only just now created by the fall of the cliff opposite, and that no other way of attaining it could be perceived, we were not so much rejoiced at the thought of being secure from molestation as fearful lest there should be absolutely no means left us for descent. we resolved to explore the summit of the hill thoroughly, when a good opportunity should offer. in the meantime we watched the motions of the savages through our loophole. they had already made a complete wreck of the vessel, and were now preparing to set her on fire. in a little while we saw the smoke ascending in huge volumes from her main hatchway, and, shortly afterward, a dense mass of flame burst up from the forecastle. the rigging, masts and what remained of the sails caught immediately, and the fire spread rapidly along the decks. still a great many of the savages retained their stations about her, hammering with large stones, axes, and cannon balls at the bolts and other iron and copper work. on the beach, and in canoes and rafts, there were not less, altogether, in the immediate vicinity of the schooner, than ten thousand natives, besides the shoals of them who, laden with booty, were making their way inland and over to the neighbouring islands. we now anticipated a catastrophe, and were not disappointed. first of all there came a smart shock (which we felt as distinctly where we were as if we had been slightly galvanized), but unattended with any visible signs of an explosion. the savages were evidently startled, and paused for an instant from their labours and yellings. they were upon the point of recommencing, when suddenly a mass of smoke puffed up from the decks, resembling a black and heavy thundercloud--then, as if from its bowels, arose a tall stream of vivid fire to the height, apparently, of a quarter of a mile--then there came a sudden circular expansion of the flame--then the whole atmosphere was magically crowded, in a single instant, with a wild chaos of wood, and metal, and human limbs--and, lastly, came the concussion in its fullest fury, which hurled us impetuously from our feet, while the hills echoed and re-echoed the tumult, and a dense shower of the minutest fragments of the ruins tumbled headlong in every direction around us. the havoc among the savages far exceeded our utmost expectation, and they had now, indeed, reaped the full and perfect fruits of their treachery. perhaps a thousand perished by the explosion, while at least an equal number were desperately mangled. the whole surface of the bay was literally strewn with the struggling and drowning wretches, and on shore matters were even worse. they seemed utterly appalled by the suddenness and completeness of their discomfiture, and made no efforts at assisting one another. at length we observed a total change in their demeanour. from absolute stupor, they appeared to be, all at once, aroused to the highest pitch of excitement, and rushed wildly about, going to and from a certain point on the beach, with the strangest expressions of mingled horror, rage, and intense curiosity depicted on their countenances, and shouting, at the top of their voices, “tekeli-li! tekeli-li!” presently we saw a large body go off into the hills, whence they returned in a short time, carrying stakes of wood. these they brought to the station where the crowd was the thickest, which now separated so as to afford us a view of the object of all this excitement. we perceived something white lying upon the ground, but could not immediately make out what it was. at length we saw that it was the carcass of the strange animal with the scarlet teeth and claws which the schooner had picked up at sea on the eighteenth of january. captain guy had had the body preserved for the purpose of stuffing the skin and taking it to england. i remember he had given some directions about it just before our making the island, and it had been brought into the cabin and stowed away in one of the lockers. it had now been thrown on shore by the explosion; but why it had occasioned so much concern among the savages was more than we could comprehend. although they crowded around the carcass at a little distance, none of them seemed willing to approach it closely. by-and-by the men with the stakes drove them in a circle around it, and no sooner was this arrangement completed, than the whole of the vast assemblage rushed into the interior of the island, with loud screams of “tekeli-li! tekeli-li!” chapter <UNK> during the six or seven days immediately following we remained in our hiding-place upon the hill, going out only occasionally, and then with the greatest precaution, for water and filberts. we had made a kind of penthouse on the platform, furnishing it with a bed of dry leaves, and placing in it three large flat stones, which served us for both fireplace and table. we kindled a fire without difficulty by rubbing two pieces of dry wood together, the one soft, the other hard. the bird we had taken in such good season proved excellent eating, although somewhat tough. it was not an oceanic fowl, but a species of bittern, with jet black and grizzly plumage, and diminutive wings in proportion to its bulk. we afterward saw three of the same kind in the vicinity of the ravine, apparently seeking for the one we had captured; but, as they never alighted, we had no opportunity of catching them. as long as this fowl lasted we suffered nothing from our situation, but it was now entirely consumed, and it became absolutely necessary that we should look out for provision. the filberts would not satisfy the cravings of hunger, afflicting us, too, with severe gripings of the bowels, and, if freely indulged in, with violent headache. we had seen several large tortoises near the seashore to the eastward of the hill, and perceived they might be easily taken, if we could get at them without the observation of the natives. it was resolved, therefore, to make an attempt at descending. we commenced by going down the southern declivity, which seemed to offer the fewest difficulties, but had not proceeded a hundred yards before (as we had anticipated from appearances on the hilltop) our progress was entirely arrested by a branch of the gorge in which our companions had perished. we now passed along the edge of this for about a quarter of a mile, when we were again stopped by a precipice of immense depth, and, not being able to make our way along the brink of it, we were forced to retrace our steps by the main ravine. we now pushed over to the eastward, but with precisely similar fortune. after an hour’s scramble, at the risk of breaking our necks, we discovered that we had merely descended into a vast pit of black granite, with fine dust at the bottom, and whence the only egress was by the rugged path in which we had come down. toiling again up this path, we now tried the northern edge of the hill. here we were obliged to use the greatest possible caution in our maneuvers, as the least indiscretion would expose us to the full view of the savages in the village. we crawled along, therefore, on our hands and knees, and, occasionally, were even forced to throw ourselves at full length, dragging our bodies along by means of the shrubbery. in this careful manner we had proceeded but a little way, when we arrived at a chasm far deeper than any we had yet seen, and leading directly into the main gorge. thus our fears were fully confirmed, and we found ourselves cut off entirely from access to the world below. thoroughly exhausted by our exertions, we made the best of our way back to the platform, and throwing ourselves upon the bed of leaves, slept sweetly and soundly for some hours. for several days after this fruitless search we were occupied in exploring every part of the summit of the hill, in order to inform ourselves of its actual resources. we found that it would afford us no food, with the exception of the unwholesome filberts, and a rank species of scurvy grass, which grew in a little patch of not more than four rods square, and would be soon exhausted. on the fifteenth of february, as near as i can remember, there was not a blade of this left, and the nuts were growing scarce; our situation, therefore, could hardly be more lamentable. <UNK> on the sixteenth we again went round the walls of our prison, in hope of finding some avenue of escape; but to no purpose. we also descended the chasm in which we had been overwhelmed, with the faint expectation of discovering, through this channel, some opening to the main ravine. here, too, we were disappointed, although we found and brought up with us a musket. on the seventeenth we set out with the determination of examining more thoroughly the chasm of black granite into which we had made our way in the first search. we remembered that one of the fissures in the sides of this pit had been but partially looked into, and we were anxious to explore it, although with no expectation of discovering here any opening. we found no great difficulty in reaching the bottom of the hollow as before, and were now sufficiently calm to survey it with some attention. it was, indeed, one of the most singular-looking places imaginable, and we could scarcely bring ourselves to believe it altogether the work of nature. the pit, from its eastern to its western extremity, was about five hundred yards in length, when all its windings were threaded; the distance from east to west in a straight line not being more (i should suppose, having no means of accurate examination) than forty or fifty yards. upon first descending into the chasm, that is to say, for a hundred feet downward from the summit of the hill, the sides of the abyss bore little resemblance to each other, and, apparently, had at no time been connected, the one surface being of the soapstone, and the other of marl, granulated with some metallic matter. the average breadth or interval between the two cliffs was probably here sixty feet, but there seemed to be no regularity of formation. passing down, however, beyond the limit spoken of, the interval rapidly contracted, and the sides began to run parallel, although, for some distance farther, they were still dissimilar in their material and form of surface. upon arriving within fifty feet of the bottom, a perfect regularity commenced. the sides were now entirely uniform in substance, in colour, and in lateral direction, the material being a very black and shining granite, and the distance between the two sides, at all points facing each other, exactly twenty yards. the precise formation of the chasm will be best understood by means of a delineation taken upon the spot; for i had luckily with me a pocketbook and pencil, which i preserved with great care through a long series of subsequent adventure, and to which i am indebted for memoranda of many subjects which would otherwise have been crowded from my remembrance. this figure [no figures in text] gives the general outlines of the chasm, without the minor cavities in the sides, of which there were several, each cavity having a corresponding protuberance opposite. the bottom of the gulf was covered to the depth of three or four inches with a powder almost impalpable, beneath which we found a continuation of the black granite. to the right, at the lower extremity, will be noticed the appearance of a small opening; this is the fissure alluded to above, and to examine which more minutely than before was the object of our second visit. we now pushed into it with vigor, cutting away a quantity of brambles which impeded us, and removing a vast heap of sharp flints somewhat resembling arrowheads in shape. we were encouraged to persevere, however, by perceiving some little light proceeding from the farther end. we at length squeezed our way for about thirty feet, and found that the aperture was a low and regularly formed arch, having a bottom of the same impalpable powder as that in the main chasm. a strong light now broke upon us, and, turning a short bend, we found ourselves in another lofty chamber, similar to the one we had left in every respect but longitudinal form. its general figure is here given. the total length of this chasm, commencing at the opening _a_ and proceeding round the curve _b_ to the extremity _d_, is five hundred and fifty yards. at _c_ we discovered a small aperture similar to the one through which we had issued from the other chasm, and this was choked up in the same manner with brambles and a quantity of the white arrowhead flints. we forced our way through it, finding it about forty feet long, and emerged into a third chasm. this, too, was precisely like the first, except in its longitudinal shape, which was thus. we found the entire length of the third chasm three hundred and twenty yards. at the point _a_ was an opening about six feet wide, and extending fifteen feet into the rock, where it terminated in a bed of marl, there being no other chasm beyond, as we had expected. we were about leaving this fissure, into which very little light was admitted, when peters called my attention to a range of singular-looking indentures in the surface of the marl forming the termination of the _cul-de-sac_. with a very slight exertion of the imagination, the left, or most northern of these indentures might have been taken for the intentional, although rude, representation of a human figure standing erect, with outstretched arm. the rest of them bore also some little resemblance to alphabetical characters, and peters was willing, at all events, to adopt the idle opinion that they were really such. i convinced him of his error, finally, by directing his attention to the floor of the fissure, where, among the powder, we picked up, piece by piece, several large flakes of the marl, which had evidently been broken off by some convulsion from the surface where the indentures were found, and which had projecting points exactly fitting the indentures; thus proving them to have been the work of nature. after satisfying ourselves that these singular caverns afforded us no means of escape from our prison, we made our way back, dejected and dispirited, to the summit of the hill. nothing worth mentioning occurred during the next twenty-four hours, except that, in examining the ground to the eastward of the third chasm, we found two triangular holes of great depth, and also with black granite sides. into these holes we did not think it worth while to attempt descending, as they had the appearance of mere natural wells, without outlet. they were each about twenty yards in circumference, and their shape, as well as relative position in regard to the third chasm, is shown in figure <UNK> {image} chapter <UNK> on the twentieth of the month, finding it altogether impossible to subsist any longer upon the filberts, the use of which occasioned us the most excruciating torment, we resolved to make a desperate attempt at descending the southern declivity of the hill. the face of the precipice was here of the softest species of soapstone, although nearly perpendicular throughout its whole extent (a depth of a hundred and fifty feet at the least), and in many places even overarching. after a long search we discovered a narrow ledge about twenty feet below the brink of the gulf; upon this peters contrived to leap, with what assistance i could render him by means of our pocket-handkerchiefs tied together. with somewhat more difficulty i also got down; and we then saw the possibility of descending the whole way by the process in which we had clambered up from the chasm when we had been buried by the fall of the hill--that is, by cutting steps in the face of the soapstone with our knives. the extreme hazard of the attempt can scarcely be conceived; but, as there was no other resource, we determined to undertake it. upon the ledge where we stood there grew some filbert-bushes; and to one of these we made fast an end of our rope of handkerchiefs. the other end being tied round peters’ waist, i lowered him down over the edge of the precipice until the handkerchiefs were stretched tight. he now proceeded to dig a deep hole in the soapstone (as far in as eight or ten inches), sloping away the rock above to the height of a foot, or thereabout, so as to allow of his driving, with the butt of a pistol, a tolerably strong peg into the levelled surface. i then drew him up for about four feet, when he made a hole similar to the one below, driving in a peg as before, and having thus a resting-place for both feet and hands. i now unfastened the handkerchiefs from the bush, throwing him the end, which he tied to the peg in the uppermost hole, letting himself down gently to a station about three feet lower than he had yet been that is, to the full extent of the handkerchiefs. here he dug another hole, and drove another peg. he then drew himself up, so as to rest his feet in the hole just cut, taking hold with his hands upon the peg in the one above. it was now necessary to untie the handkerchiefs from the topmost peg, with the view of fastening them to the second; and here he found that an error had been committed in cutting the holes at so great a distance apart. however, after one or two unsuccessful and dangerous attempts at reaching the knot (having to hold on with his left hand while he labored to undo the fastening with his right), he at length cut the string, leaving six inches of it affixed to the peg. tying the handkerchiefs now to the second peg, he descended to a station below the third, taking care not to go too far down. by these means (means which i should never have conceived of myself, and for which we were indebted altogether to peters’ ingenuity and resolution) my companion finally succeeded, with the occasional aid of projections in the cliff, in reaching the bottom without accident. it was some time before i could summon sufficient resolution to follow him; but i did at length attempt it. peters had taken off his shirt before descending, and this, with my own, formed the rope necessary for the adventure. after throwing down the musket found in the chasm, i fastened this rope to the bushes, and let myself down rapidly, striving, by the vigor of my movements, to banish the trepidation which i could overcome in no other manner. this answered sufficiently well for the first four or five steps; but presently i found my imagination growing terribly excited by thoughts of the vast depths yet to be descended, and the precarious nature of the pegs and soapstone holes which were my only support. it was in vain i endeavored to banish these reflections, and to keep my eyes steadily bent upon the flat surface of the cliff before me. the more earnestly i struggled _not to think, _the more intensely vivid became my conceptions, and the more horribly distinct. at length arrived that crisis of fancy, so fearful in all similar cases, the crisis in which we began to anticipate the feelings with which we _shall _fall--to picture to ourselves the sickness, and dizziness, and the last struggle, and the half swoon, and the final bitterness of the rushing and headlong descent. and now i found these fancies creating their own realities, and all imagined horrors crowding upon me in fact. i felt my knees strike violently together, while my fingers were gradually but certainly relaxing their grasp. there was a ringing in my ears, and i said, “this is my knell of death!” and now i was consumed with the irrepressible desire of looking below. i could not, i would not, confine my glances to the cliff; and, with a wild, indefinable emotion, half of horror, half of a relieved oppression, i threw my vision far down into the abyss. for one moment my fingers clutched convulsively upon their hold, while, with the movement, the faintest possible idea of ultimate escape wandered, like a shadow, through my mind--in the next my whole soul was pervaded with a longing to fall; a desire, a yearning, a passion utterly uncontrollable. i let go at once my grasp upon the peg, and, turning half round from the precipice, remained tottering for an instant against its naked face. but now there came a spinning of the brain; a shrill-sounding and phantom voice screamed within my ears; a dusky, fiendish, and filmy figure stood immediately beneath me; and, sighing, i sunk down with a bursting heart, and plunged within its arms. i had swooned, and peters had caught me as i fell. he had observed my proceedings from his station at the bottom of the cliff; and perceiving my imminent danger, had endeavored to inspire me with courage by every suggestion he could devise; although my confusion of mind had been so great as to prevent my hearing what he said, or being conscious that he had even spoken to me at all. at length, seeing me totter, he hastened to ascend to my rescue, and arrived just in time for my preservation. had i fallen with my full weight, the rope of linen would inevitably have snapped, and i should have been precipitated into the abyss; as it was, he contrived to let me down gently, so as to remain suspended without danger until animation returned. this was in about fifteen minutes. on recovery, my trepidation had entirely vanished; i felt a new being, and, with some little further aid from my companion, reached the bottom also in safety. we now found ourselves not far from the ravine which had proved the tomb of our friends, and to the southward of the spot where the hill had fallen. the place was one of singular wildness, and its aspect brought to my mind the descriptions given by travellers of those dreary regions marking the site of degraded babylon. not to speak of the ruins of the disrupted cliff, which formed a chaotic barrier in the vista to the northward, the surface of the ground in every other direction was strewn with huge tumuli, apparently the wreck of some gigantic structures of art; although, in detail, no semblance of art could be detected. scoria were abundant, and large shapeless blocks of the black granite, intermingled with others of marl, <UNK> and both granulated with metal. of vegetation there were no traces whatsoever throughout the whole of the desolate area within sight. several immense scorpions were seen, and various reptiles not elsewhere to be found in the high latitudes. as food was our most immediate object, we resolved to make our way to the seacoast, distant not more than half a mile, with a view of catching turtle, several of which we had observed from our place of concealment on the hill. we had proceeded some hundred yards, threading our route cautiously between the huge rocks and tumuli, when, upon turning a corner, five savages sprung upon us from a small cavern, felling peters to the ground with a blow from a club. as he fell the whole party rushed upon him to secure their victim, leaving me time to recover from my astonishment. i still had the musket, but the barrel had received so much injury in being thrown from the precipice that i cast it aside as useless, preferring to trust my pistols, which had been carefully preserved in order. with these i advanced upon the assailants, firing one after the other in quick succession. two savages fell, and one, who was in the act of thrusting a spear into peters, sprung to his feet without accomplishing his purpose. my companion being thus released, we had no further difficulty. he had his pistols also, but prudently declined using them, confiding in his great personal strength, which far exceeded that of any person i have ever known. seizing a club from one of the savages who had fallen, he dashed out the brains of the three who remained, killing each instantaneously with a single blow of the weapon, and leaving us completely masters of the field. so rapidly had these events passed, that we could scarcely believe in their reality, and were standing over the bodies of the dead in a species of stupid contemplation, when we were brought to recollection by the sound of shouts in the distance. it was clear that the savages had been alarmed by the firing, and that we had little chance of avoiding discovery. to regain the cliff, it would be necessary to proceed in the direction of the shouts, and even should we succeed in arriving at its base, we should never be able to ascend it without being seen. our situation was one of the greatest peril, and we were hesitating in which path to commence a flight, when one of the savages _whom _i had shot, and supposed dead, sprang briskly to his feet, and attempted to make his escape. we overtook _him, _however, before he had advanced many paces, and were about to put him to death, when peters suggested that we might derive some benefit from forcing him to accompany us in our attempt to escape. we therefore dragged him with us, making him understand that we would shoot him if he offered resistance. in a few minutes he was perfectly submissive, and ran by our sides as we pushed in among the rocks, making for the seashore. so far, the irregularities of the ground we had been traversing hid the sea, except at intervals, from our sight, and, when we first had it fairly in view, it was perhaps two hundred yards distant. as we emerged into the open beach we saw, to our great dismay, an immense crowd of the natives pouring from the village, and from all visible quarters of the island, making toward us with gesticulations of extreme fury, and howling like wild beasts. we were upon the point of turning upon our steps, and trying to secure a retreat among the fastnesses of the rougher ground, when i discovered the bows of two canoes projecting from behind a large rock which ran out into the water. toward these we now ran with all speed, and, reaching them, found them unguarded, and without any other freight than three of the large gallipago turtles and the usual supply of paddles for sixty rowers. we instantly took possession of one of them, and, forcing our captive on board, pushed out to sea with all the strength we could command. we had not made, however, more than fifty yards from the shore before we became sufficiently calm to perceive the great oversight of which we had been guilty in leaving the other canoe in the power of the savages, who, by this time, were not more than twice as far from the beach as ourselves, and were rapidly advancing to the pursuit. no time was now to be lost. our hope was, at best, a forlorn one, but we had none other. it was very doubtful whether, with the utmost exertion, we could get back in time to anticipate them in taking possession of the canoe; but yet there was a chance that we could. we might save ourselves if we succeeded, while not to make the attempt was to resign ourselves to inevitable butchery. the canoe was modelled with the bow and stern alike, and, in place of turning it around, we merely changed our position in paddling. as soon as the savages perceived this they redoubled their yells, as well as their speed, and approached with inconceivable rapidity. we pulled, however, with all the energy of desperation, and arrived at the contested point before more than one of the natives had attained it. this man paid dearly for his superior agility, peters shooting him through the head with a pistol as he approached the shore. the foremost among the rest of his party were probably some twenty or thirty paces distant as we seized upon the canoe. we at first endeavored to pull her into the deep water, beyond the reach of the savages, but, finding her too firmly aground, and there being no time to spare, peters, with one or two heavy strokes from the butt of the musket, succeeded in dashing out a large portion of the bow and of one side. we then pushed off. two of the natives by this time had got hold of our boat, obstinately refusing to let go, until we were forced to despatch them with our knives. we were now clear off, and making great way out to sea. the main body of the savages, upon reaching the broken canoe, set up the most tremendous yell of rage and disappointment conceivable. in truth, from everything i could see of these wretches, they appeared to be the most wicked, hypocritical, vindictive, bloodthirsty, and altogether fiendish race of men upon the face of the globe. it is clear we should have had no mercy had we fallen into their hands. they made a mad attempt at following us in the fractured canoe, but, finding it useless, again vented their rage in a series of hideous vociferations, and rushed up into the hills. we were thus relieved from immediate danger, but our situation was still sufficiently gloomy. we knew that four canoes of the kind we had were at one time in the possession of the savages, and were not aware of the fact (afterward ascertained from our captive) that two of these had been blown to pieces in the explosion of the _jane guy. _we calculated, therefore, upon being yet pursued, as soon as our enemies could get round to the bay (distant about three miles) where the boats were usually laid up. fearing this, we made every exertion to leave the island behind us, and went rapidly through the water, forcing the prisoner to take a paddle. in about half an hour, when we had gained probably five or six miles to the southward, a large fleet of the flat-bottomed canoes or rafts were seen to emerge from the bay evidently with the design of pursuit. presently they put back, despairing to overtake us. chapter <UNK> we now found ourselves in the wide and desolate antarctic ocean, in a latitude exceeding eighty-four degrees, in a frail canoe, and with no provision but the three turtles. the long polar winter, too, could not be considered as far distant, and it became necessary that we should deliberate well upon the course to be pursued. there were six or seven islands in sight belonging to the same group, and distant from each other about five or six leagues; but upon neither of these had we any intention to venture. in coming from the northward in the _jane guy_ we had been gradually leaving behind us the severest regions of ice--this, however little it maybe in accordance with the generally received notions respecting the antarctic, was a fact--experience would not permit us to deny. to attempt, therefore, getting back would be folly--especially at so late a period of the season. only one course seemed to be left open for hope. we resolved to steer boldly to the southward, where there was at least a probability of discovering other lands, and more than a probability of finding a still milder climate. so far we had found the antarctic, like the arctic ocean, peculiarly free from violent storms or immoderately rough water; but our canoe was, at best, of frail structure, although large, and we set busily to work with a view of rendering her as safe as the limited means in our possession would admit. the body of the boat was of no better material than bark--the bark of a tree unknown. the ribs were of a tough osier, well adapted to the purpose for which it was used. we had fifty feet room from stem to stern, from four to six in breadth, and in depth throughout four feet and a half-the boats thus differing vastly in shape from those of any other inhabitants of the southern ocean with whom civilized nations are acquainted. we never did believe them the workmanship of the ignorant islanders who owned them; and some days after this period discovered, by questioning our captive, that they were in fact made by the natives of a group to the southwest of the country where we found them, having fallen accidentally into the hands of our barbarians. what we could do for the security of our boat was very little indeed. several wide rents were discovered near both ends, and these we contrived to patch up with pieces of woollen jacket. with the help of the superfluous paddles, of which there were a great many, we erected a kind of framework about the bow, so as to break the force of any seas which might threaten to fill us in that quarter. we also set up two paddle-blades for masts, placing them opposite each other, one by each gunwale, thus saving the necessity of a yard. to these masts we attached a sail made of our shirts-doing this with some difficulty, as here we could get no assistance from our prisoner whatever, although he had been willing enough to labor in all the other operations. the sight of the linen seemed to affect him in a very singular manner. he could not be prevailed upon to touch it or go near it, shuddering when we attempted to force him, and shrieking out, _“tekeli-li!”_ having completed our arrangements in regard to the security of the canoe, we now set sail to the south-southeast for the present, with the view of weathering the most southerly of the group in sight. this being done, we turned the bow full to the southward. the weather could by no means be considered disagreeable. we had a prevailing and very gentle wind from the northward, a smooth sea, and continual daylight. no ice whatever was to be seen; _nor did i ever see one particle of this after leaving the parallel of bennet’s islet. _indeed, the temperature of the water was here far too warm for its existence in any quantity. having killed the largest of our tortoises, and obtained from him not only food but a copious supply of water, we continued on our course, without any incident of moment, for perhaps seven or eight days, during which period we must have proceeded a vast distance to the southward, as the wind blew constantly with us, and a very strong current set continually in the direction we were pursuing. _march <UNK> <UNK> unusual phenomena now--indicated that we were entering upon a region of novelty and wonder. a high range of light gray vapor appeared constantly in the southern horizon, flaring up occasionally in lofty streaks, now darting from east to west, now from west to east, and again presenting a level and uniform summit--in short, having all the wild variations of the aurora borealis. the average height of this vapor, as apparent from our station, was about twenty-five degrees. the temperature of the sea seemed to be increasing momentarily, and there was a very perceptible alteration in its color. _march <UNK> by repeated questioning of our captive, we came to the knowledge of many particulars in regard to the island of the massacre, its inhabitants, and customs--but with these how can i now detain the reader? i may say, however, that we learned there were eight islands in the group--that they were governed by a common king, named _tsalemon _or _psalemoun, _who resided in one of the smallest of the islands; that the black skins forming the dress of the warriors came from an animal of huge size to be found only in a valley near the court of the king--that the inhabitants of the group fabricated no other boats than the flat-bottomed rafts; the four canoes being all of the kind in their possession, and, these having been obtained, by mere accident, from some large island in the southwest--that his own name was nu-nu--that he had no knowledge of bennet’s islet--and that the appellation of the island he had left was tsalal. the commencement of the words _tsalemon _and tsalal was given with a prolonged hissing sound, which we found it impossible to imitate, even after repeated endeavors, and which was precisely the same with the note of the black bittern we had eaten up on the summit of the hill. _march <UNK> heat of the water was now truly remarkable, and in color was undergoing a rapid change, being no longer transparent, but of a milky consistency and hue. in our immediate vicinity it was usually smooth, never so rough as to endanger the canoe--but we were frequently surprised at perceiving, to our right and left, at different distances, sudden and extensive agitations of the surface; these, we at length noticed, were always preceded by wild flickerings in the region of vapor to the southward. _march <UNK> with the view of widening our sail, the breeze from the northward dying away perceptibly, i took from my coat-pocket a white handkerchief. nu-nu was seated at my elbow, and the linen accidentally flaring in his face, he became violently affected with convulsions. these were succeeded by drowsiness and stupor, and low murmurings of _“‘tekeli-li! tekeli-li!”_ _march <UNK> wind had entirely ceased, but it was evident that we were still hurrying on to the southward, under the influence of a powerful current. and now,--indeed, it would seem reasonable that we should experience some alarm at the turn events were taking--but we felt none. the countenance of peters indicated nothing of this nature, although it wore at times an expression i could not fathom. the polar winter appeared to be coming on--but coming without its terrors. i felt a numbness of body and mind--a dreaminess of sensation but this was all. _march <UNK> gray vapor had now arisen many more degrees above the horizon, and was gradually losing its grayness of tint. the heat of the water was extreme, even unpleasant to the touch, and its milky hue was more evident than ever. today a violent agitation of the water occurred very close to the canoe. it was attended, as usual, with a wild flaring up of the vapor at its summit, and a momentary division at its base. a fine white powder, resembling ashes--but certainly not such--fell over the canoe and over a large surface of the water, as the flickering died away among the vapor and the commotion subsided in the sea. nu-nu now threw himself on his face in the bottom of the boat, and no persuasions could induce him to arise. _march <UNK> day we questioned nu-nu concerning the motives of his countrymen in destroying our companions; but he appeared to be too utterly overcome by terror to afford us any rational reply. he still obstinately lay in the bottom of the boat; and, upon reiterating the questions as to the motive, made use only of idiotic gesticulations, such as raising with his forefinger the upper lip, and displaying the teeth which lay beneath it. these were black. we had never before seen the teeth of an inhabitant of tsalal. _march <UNK> there floated by us one of the white animals whose appearance upon the beach at tsalal had occasioned so wild a commotion among the savages. i would have picked it up, but there came over me a sudden listlessness, and i forbore. the heat of the water still increased, and the hand could no longer be endured within it. peters spoke little, and i knew not what to think of his apathy. nu-nu breathed, and no more. _march <UNK> whole ashy material fell now continually around us, and in vast quantities. the range of vapor to the southward had arisen prodigiously in the horizon, and began to assume more distinctness of form. i can liken it to nothing but a limitless cataract, rolling silently into the sea from some immense and far-distant rampart in the heaven. the gigantic curtain ranged along the whole extent of the southern horizon. it emitted no sound. _march <UNK> sullen darkness now hovered above us--but from out the milky depths of the ocean a luminous glare arose, and stole up along the bulwarks of the boat. we were nearly overwhelmed by the white ashy shower which settled upon us and upon the canoe, but melted into the water as it fell. the summit of the cataract was utterly lost in the dimness and the distance. yet we were evidently approaching it with a hideous velocity. at intervals there were visible in it wide, yawning, but momentary rents, and from out these rents, within which was a chaos of flitting and indistinct images, there came rushing and mighty, but soundless winds, tearing up the enkindled ocean in their course. _march <UNK> darkness had materially increased, relieved only by the glare of the water thrown back from the white curtain before us. many gigantic and pallidly white birds flew continuously now from beyond the veil, and their scream was the eternal _tekeli-li! _as they retreated from our vision. hereupon nu-nu stirred in the bottom of the boat; but upon touching him we found his spirit departed. and now we rushed into the embraces of the cataract, where a chasm threw itself open to receive us. but there arose in our pathway a shrouded human figure, very far larger in its proportions than any dweller among men. and the hue of the skin of the figure was of the perfect whiteness of the snow. note the circumstances connected with the late sudden and distressing death of mr. pym are already well known to the public through the medium of the daily press. it is feared that the few remaining chapters which were to have completed his narrative, and which were retained by him, while the above were in type, for the purpose of revision, have been irrecoverably lost through the accident by which he perished himself. this, however, may prove not to be the case, and the papers, if ultimately found, will be given to the public. no means have been left untried to remedy the deficiency. the gentleman whose name is mentioned in the preface, and who, from the statement there made, might be supposed able to fill the vacuum, has declined the task--this, for satisfactory reasons connected with the general inaccuracy of the details afforded him, and his disbelief in the entire truth of the latter portions of the narration. peters, from whom some information might be expected, is still alive, and a resident of illinois, but cannot be met with at present. he may hereafter be found, and will, no doubt, afford material for a conclusion of mr. pym’s account. the loss of two or three final chapters (for there were but two or three) is the more deeply to be regretted, as it can not be doubted they contained matter relative to the pole itself, or at least to regions in its very near proximity; and as, too, the statements of the author in relation to these regions may shortly be verified or contradicted by means of the governmental expedition now preparing for the southern ocean. on one point in the narrative some remarks may well be offered; and it would afford the writer of this appendix much pleasure if what he may here observe should have a tendency to throw credit, in any degree, upon the very singular pages now published. we allude to the chasms found in the island of tsalal, and to the whole of the figures upon pages <UNK> {of the printed edition--ed.}. (note: no figures were included with this text) mr. pym has given the figures of the chasms without comment, and speaks decidedly of the _indentures _found at the extremity of the most easterly of these chasms as having but a fanciful resemblance to alphabetical characters, and, in short, as being positively _not such. _this assertion is made in a manner so simple, and sustained by a species of demonstration so conclusive (viz., the fitting of the projections of the fragments found among the dust into the indentures upon the wall), that we are forced to believe the writer in earnest; and no reasonable reader should suppose otherwise. but as the facts in relation to all the figures are most singular (especially when taken in connection with statements made in the body of the narrative), it may be as well to say a word or two concerning them all--this, too, the more especially as the facts in question have, beyond doubt, escaped the attention of mr. poe. figure <UNK> then, figure <UNK> figure <UNK> and figure <UNK> when conjoined with one another in the precise order which the chasms themselves presented, and when deprived of the small lateral branches or arches (which, it will be remembered, served only as a means of communication between the main chambers, and were of totally distinct character), constitute an ethiopian verbal root--the root “to be shady,’--whence all the inflections of shadow or darkness. in regard to the “left or most northwardly” of the indentures in figure <UNK> it is more than probable that the opinion of peters was correct, and that the hieroglyphical appearance was really the work of art, and intended as the representation of a human form. the delineation is before the reader, and he may, or may not, perceive the resemblance suggested; but the rest of the indentures afford strong confirmation of peters’ idea. the upper range is evidently the arabic verbal root “to be white,” whence all the inflections of brilliancy and whiteness. the lower range is not so immediately perspicuous. the characters are somewhat broken and disjointed; nevertheless, it can not be doubted that, in their perfect state, they formed the full egyptian word, “the region of the south.” it should be observed that these interpretations confirm the opinion of peters in regard to the “most northwardly” of the figures. the arm is outstretched toward the south. conclusions such as these open a wide field for speculation and exciting conjecture. they should be regarded, perhaps, in connection with some of the most faintly detailed incidents of the narrative; although in no visible manner is this chain of connection complete. tekeli-li! was the cry of the affrighted natives of tsalal upon discovering the carcase of the _white _animal picked up at sea. this also was the shuddering exclamatives of tsalal upon discovering the carcass of the _white _materials in possession of mr. pym. this also was the shriek of the swift-flying, _white, _and gigantic birds which issued from the vapory _white _curtain of the south. nothing _white _was to be found at tsalal, and nothing otherwise in the subsequent voyage to the region beyond. it is not impossible that “tsalal,” the appellation of the island of the chasms, may be found, upon minute philological scrutiny, to betray either some alliance with the chasms themselves, or some reference to the ethiopian characters so mysteriously written in their windings. _“i have graven it within the hills, and my vengeance upon the dust within the rock.”_ notes <UNK> whaling vessels are usually fitted with iron oil-tanks--why the _grampus_ was not i have never been able to ascertain. <UNK> the case of the brig _polly_, of boston, is one so much in point, and her fate, in many respects, so remarkably similar to our own, that i cannot forbear alluding to it here. this vessel, of one hundred and thirty tons burden, sailed from boston, with a cargo of lumber and provisions, for santa croix, on the twelfth of december, <UNK> under the command of captain casneau. there were eight souls on board besides the captain--the mate, four seamen, and the cook, together with a mr. hunt, and a negro girl belonging to him. on the fifteenth, having cleared the shoal of georges, she sprung a leak in a gale of wind from the southeast, and was finally capsized; but, the masts going by the board, she afterward righted. they remained in this situation, without fire, and with very little provision, for the period of one hundred and ninety-one days (from december the fifteenth to june the twentieth), when captain casneau and samuel badger, the only survivors, were taken off the wreck by the fame, of hull, captain featherstone, bound home from rio janeiro. when picked up, they were in latitude <UNK> degrees n., longitude <UNK> degrees w., having drifted above two thousand miles! on the ninth of july the fame fell in with the brig dromero, captain perkins, who landed the two sufferers in kennebeck. the narrative from which we gather these details ends in the following words: “it is natural to inquire how they could float such a vast distance, upon the most frequented part of the atlantic, and not be discovered all this time. they were passed by more than a dozen sail, one of which came so nigh them that they could distinctly see the people on deck and on the rigging looking at them; but, to the inexpressible disappointment of the starving and freezing men, they stifled the dictates of compassion, hoisted sail, and cruelly abandoned them to their fate.” <UNK> among the vessels which at various times have professed to meet with the auroras may be mentioned the ship san miguel, in <UNK> the ship aurora, in <UNK> the brig pearl, in <UNK> and the ship dolores, in <UNK> they all agree in giving the mean latitude fifty-three degrees south. <UNK> the terms morning and evening, which i have made use of to avoid confusion in my narrative, as far as possible, must not, of course, be taken in their ordinary sense. for a long time past we had had no night at all, the daylight being continual. the dates throughout are according to nautical time, and the bearing must be understood as per compass. i would also remark, in this place, that i cannot, in the first portion of what is here written, pretend to strict accuracy in respect to dates, or latitudes and longitudes, having kept no regular journal until after the period of which this first portion treats. in many instances i have relied altogether upon memory. <UNK> this day was rendered remarkable by our observing in the south several huge wreaths of the grayish vapour i have spoken of. <UNK> the marl was also black; indeed, we noticed no light colored substances of any kind upon the island. <UNK> obvious reasons i cannot pretend to strict accuracy in these dates. they are given principally with a view to perspicity of narrative, and as set down in my pencil memorandum. ligeia and the will therein lieth, which dieth not. who knoweth the mysteries of the will, with its vigor? for god is but a great will pervading all things by nature of its intentness. man doth not yield himself to the angels, nor unto death utterly, save only through the weakness of his feeble will.--joseph glanvill. i cannot, for my soul, remember how, when, or even precisely where, i first became acquainted with the lady ligeia. long years have since elapsed, and my memory is feeble through much suffering. or, perhaps, i cannot now bring these points to mind, because, in truth, the character of my beloved, her rare learning, her singular yet placid cast of beauty, and the thrilling and enthralling eloquence of her low musical language, made their way into my heart by paces so steadily and stealthily progressive that they have been unnoticed and unknown. yet i believe that i met her first and most frequently in some large, old, decaying city near the rhine. of her family--i have surely heard her speak. that it is of a remotely ancient date cannot be doubted. ligeia! ligeia! in studies of a nature more than all else adapted to deaden impressions of the outward world, it is by that sweet word alone--by ligeia--that i bring before mine eyes in fancy the image of her who is no more. and now, while i write, a recollection flashes upon me that i have never known the paternal name of her who was my friend and my betrothed, and who became the partner of my studies, and finally the wife of my bosom. was it a playful charge on the part of my ligeia? or was it a test of my strength of affection, that i should institute no inquiries upon this point? or was it rather a caprice of my own--a wildly romantic offering on the shrine of the most passionate devotion? i but indistinctly recall the fact itself--what wonder that i have utterly forgotten the circumstances which originated or attended it? and, indeed, if ever she, the wan and the misty-winged ashtophet of idolatrous egypt, presided, as they tell, over marriages ill-omened, then most surely she presided over mine. there is one dear topic, however, on which my memory fails me not. it is the person of ligeia. in stature she was tall, somewhat slender, and, in her latter days, even emaciated. i would in vain attempt to portray the majesty, the quiet ease, of her demeanor, or the incomprehensible lightness and elasticity of her footfall. she came and departed as a shadow. i was never made aware of her entrance into my closed study save by the dear music of her low sweet voice, as she placed her marble hand upon my shoulder. in beauty of face no maiden ever equalled her. it was the radiance of an opium-dream--an airy and spirit-lifting vision more wildly divine than the phantasies which hovered vision about the slumbering souls of the daughters of delos. yet her features were not of that regular mould which we have been falsely taught to worship in the classical labors of the heathen. “there is no exquisite beauty,” says bacon, lord verulam, speaking truly of all the forms and genera of beauty, “without some strangeness in the proportion.” yet, although i saw that the features of ligeia were not of a classic regularity--although i perceived that her loveliness was indeed “exquisite,” and felt that there was much of “strangeness” pervading it, yet i have tried in vain to detect the irregularity and to trace home my own perception of “the strange.” i examined the contour of the lofty and pale forehead--it was faultless--how cold indeed that word when applied to a majesty so divine!--the skin rivalling the purest ivory, the commanding extent and repose, the gentle prominence of the regions above the temples; and then the raven-black, the glossy, the luxuriant and naturally-curling tresses, setting forth the full force of the homeric epithet, “hyacinthine!” i looked at the delicate outlines of the nose--and nowhere but in the graceful medallions of the hebrews had i beheld a similar perfection. there were the same luxurious smoothness of surface, the same scarcely perceptible tendency to the aquiline, the same harmoniously curved nostrils speaking the free spirit. i regarded the sweet mouth. here was indeed the triumph of all things heavenly--the magnificent turn of the short upper lip--the soft, voluptuous slumber of the under--the dimples which sported, and the color which spoke--the teeth glancing back, with a brilliancy almost startling, every ray of the holy light which fell upon them in her serene and placid, yet most exultingly radiant of all smiles. i scrutinized the formation of the chin--and here, too, i found the gentleness of breadth, the softness and the majesty, the fullness and the spirituality, of the greek--the contour which the god apollo revealed but in a dream, to cleomenes, the son of the athenian. and then i peered into the large eyes of ligeia. for eyes we have no models in the remotely antique. it might have been, too, that in these eyes of my beloved lay the secret to which lord verulam alludes. they were, i must believe, far larger than the ordinary eyes of our own race. they were even fuller than the fullest of the gazelle eyes of the tribe of the valley of nourjahad. yet it was only at intervals--in moments of intense excitement--that this peculiarity became more than slightly noticeable in ligeia. and at such moments was her beauty--in my heated fancy thus it appeared perhaps--the beauty of beings either above or apart from the earth--the beauty of the fabulous houri of the turk. the hue of the orbs was the most brilliant of black, and, far over them, hung jetty lashes of great length. the brows, slightly irregular in outline, had the same tint. the “strangeness,” however, which i found in the eyes, was of a nature distinct from the formation, or the color, or the brilliancy of the features, and must, after all, be referred to the expression. ah, word of no meaning! behind whose vast latitude of mere sound we intrench our ignorance of so much of the spiritual. the expression of the eyes of ligeia! how for long hours have i pondered upon it! how have i, through the whole of a midsummer night, struggled to fathom it! what was it--that something more profound than the well of democritus--which lay far within the pupils of my beloved? what was it? i was possessed with a passion to discover. those eyes! those large, those shining, those divine orbs! they became to me twin stars of leda, and i to them devoutest of astrologers. there is no point, among the many incomprehensible anomalies of the science of mind, more thrillingly exciting than the fact--never, i believe, noticed in the schools--that, in our endeavors to recall to memory something long forgotten, we often find ourselves upon the very verge of remembrance, without being able, in the end, to remember. and thus how frequently, in my intense scrutiny of ligeia’s eyes, have i felt approaching the full knowledge of their expression--felt it approaching--yet not quite be mine--and so at length entirely depart! and (strange, oh strangest mystery of all!) i found, in the commonest objects of the universe, a circle of analogies to that expression. i mean to say that, subsequently to the period when ligeia’s beauty passed into my spirit, there dwelling as in a shrine, i derived, from many existences in the material world, a sentiment such as i felt always aroused within me by her large and luminous orbs. yet not the more could i define that sentiment, or analyze, or even steadily view it. i recognized it, let me repeat, sometimes in the survey of a rapidly-growing vine--in the contemplation of a moth, a butterfly, a chrysalis, a stream of running water. i have felt it in the ocean; in the falling of a meteor. i have felt it in the glances of unusually aged people. and there are one or two stars in heaven--(one especially, a star of the sixth magnitude, double and changeable, to be found near the large star in lyra) in a telescopic scrutiny of which i have been made aware of the feeling. i have been filled with it by certain sounds from stringed instruments, and not unfrequently by passages from books. among innumerable other instances, i well remember something in a volume of joseph glanvill, which (perhaps merely from its quaintness--who shall say?) never failed to inspire me with the sentiment;--“and the will therein lieth, which dieth not. who knoweth the mysteries of the will, with its vigor? for god is but a great will pervading all things by nature of its intentness. man doth not yield him to the angels, nor unto death utterly, save only through the weakness of his feeble will.” length of years, and subsequent reflection, have enabled me to trace, indeed, some remote connection between this passage in the english moralist and a portion of the character of ligeia. an intensity in thought, action, or speech, was possibly, in her, a result, or at least an index, of that gigantic volition which, during our long intercourse, failed to give other and more immediate evidence of its existence. of all the women whom i have ever known, she, the outwardly calm, the ever-placid ligeia, was the most violently a prey to the tumultuous vultures of stern passion. and of such passion i could form no estimate, save by the miraculous expansion of those eyes which at once so delighted and appalled me--by the almost magical melody, modulation, distinctness and placidity of her very low voice--and by the fierce energy (rendered doubly effective by contrast with her manner of utterance) of the wild words which she habitually uttered. i have spoken of the learning of ligeia: it was immense--such as i have never known in woman. in the classical tongues was she deeply proficient, and as far as my own acquaintance extended in regard to the modern dialects of europe, i have never known her at fault. indeed upon any theme of the most admired, because simply the most abstruse of the boasted erudition of the academy, have i ever found ligeia at fault? how singularly--how thrillingly, this one point in the nature of my wife has forced itself, at this late period only, upon my attention! i said her knowledge was such as i have never known in woman--but where breathes the man who has traversed, and successfully, all the wide areas of moral, physical, and mathematical science? i saw not then what i now clearly perceive, that the acquisitions of ligeia were gigantic, were astounding; yet i was sufficiently aware of her infinite supremacy to resign myself, with a child-like confidence, to her guidance through the chaotic world of metaphysical investigation at which i was most busily occupied during the earlier years of our marriage. with how vast a triumph--with how vivid a delight--with how much of all that is ethereal in hope--did i feel, as she bent over me in studies but little sought--but less known--that delicious vista by slow degrees expanding before me, down whose long, gorgeous, and all untrodden path, i might at length pass onward to the goal of a wisdom too divinely precious not to be forbidden! how poignant, then, must have been the grief with which, after some years, i beheld my well-grounded expectations take wings to themselves and fly away! without ligeia i was but as a child groping benighted. her presence, her readings alone, rendered vividly luminous the many mysteries of the transcendentalism in which we were immersed. wanting the radiant lustre of her eyes, letters, lambent and golden, grew duller than saturnian lead. and now those eyes shone less and less frequently upon the pages over which i pored. ligeia grew ill. the wild eyes blazed with a too--too glorious effulgence; the pale fingers became of the transparent waxen hue of the grave, and the blue veins upon the lofty forehead swelled and sank impetuously with the tides of the gentle emotion. i saw that she must die--and i struggled desperately in spirit with the grim azrael. and the struggles of the passionate wife were, to my astonishment, even more energetic than my own. there had been much in her stern nature to impress me with the belief that, to her, death would have come without its terrors;--but not so. words are impotent to convey any just idea of the fierceness of resistance with which she wrestled with the shadow. i groaned in anguish at the pitiable spectacle. i would have soothed--i would have reasoned; but, in the intensity of her wild desire for life,--for life--but for life--solace and reason were the uttermost folly. yet not until the last instance, amid the most convulsive writhings of her fierce spirit, was shaken the external placidity of her demeanor. her voice grew more gentle--grew more low--yet i would not wish to dwell upon the wild meaning of the quietly uttered words. my brain reeled as i hearkened entranced, to a melody more than mortal--to assumptions and aspirations which mortality had never before known. that she loved me i should not have doubted; and i might have been easily aware that, in a bosom such as hers, love would have reigned no ordinary passion. but in death only, was i fully impressed with the strength of her affection. for long hours, detaining my hand, would she pour out before me the overflowing of a heart whose more than passionate devotion amounted to idolatry. how had i deserved to be so blessed by such confessions?--how had i deserved to be so cursed with the removal of my beloved in the hour of her making them? but upon this subject i cannot bear to dilate. let me say only, that in ligeia’s more than womanly abandonment to a love, alas! all unmerited, all unworthily bestowed, i at length recognized the principle of her longing with so wildly earnest a desire for the life which was now fleeing so rapidly away. it is this wild longing--it is this eager vehemence of desire for life--but for life--that i have no power to portray--no utterance capable of expressing. at high noon of the night in which she departed, beckoning me, peremptorily, to her side, she bade me repeat certain verses composed by herself not many days before. i obeyed her.--they were these: lo! ‘tis a gala night within the lonesome latter years! an angel throng, bewinged, bedight in veils, and drowned in tears, sit in a theatre, to see a play of hopes and fears, while the orchestra breathes fitfully the music of the spheres. mimes, in the form of god on high, mutter and mumble low, and hither and thither fly; mere puppets they, who come and go at bidding of vast formless things that shift the scenery to and fro, flapping from out their condor wings invisible wo! that motley drama!--oh, be sure it shall not be forgot! with its phantom chased forever more, by a crowd that seize it not, through a circle that ever returneth in to the self-same spot, and much of madness and more of sin and horror the soul of the plot. but see, amid the mimic rout, a crawling shape intrude! a blood-red thing that writhes from out the scenic solitude! it writhes!--it writhes!--with mortal pangs the mimes become its food, and the seraphs sob at vermin fangs in human gore imbued. out--out are the lights--out all! and over each quivering form, the curtain, a funeral pall, comes down with the rush of a storm, and the angels, all pallid and wan, uprising, unveiling, affirm that the play is the tragedy, “man,” and its hero the conqueror worm. “o god!” half shrieked ligeia, leaping to her feet and extending her arms aloft with a spasmodic movement, as i made an end of these lines--“o god! o divine father!--shall these things be undeviatingly so?--shall this conqueror be not once conquered? are we not part and parcel in thee? who--who knoweth the mysteries of the will with its vigor? man doth not yield him to the angels, nor unto death utterly, save only through the weakness of his feeble will.” and now, as if exhausted with emotion, she suffered her white arms to fall, and returned solemnly to her bed of death. and as she breathed her last sighs, there came mingled with them a low murmur from her lips. i bent to them my ear and distinguished, again, the concluding words of the passage in glanvill--“man doth not yield him to the angels, nor unto death utterly, save only through the weakness of his feeble will.” she died;--and i, crushed into the very dust with sorrow, could no longer endure the lonely desolation of my dwelling in the dim and decaying city by the rhine. i had no lack of what the world calls wealth. ligeia had brought me far more, very far more than ordinarily falls to the lot of mortals. after a few months, therefore, of weary and aimless wandering, i purchased, and put in some repair, an abbey, which i shall not name, in one of the wildest and least frequented portions of fair england. the gloomy and dreary grandeur of the building, the almost savage aspect of the domain, the many melancholy and time-honored memories connected with both, had much in unison with the feelings of utter abandonment which had driven me into that remote and unsocial region of the country. yet although the external abbey, with its verdant decay hanging about it, suffered but little alteration, i gave way, with a child-like perversity, and perchance with a faint hope of alleviating my sorrows, to a display of more than regal magnificence within.--for such follies, even in childhood, i had imbibed a taste and now they came back to me as if in the dotage of grief. alas, i feel how much even of incipient madness might have been discovered in the gorgeous and fantastic draperies, in the solemn carvings of egypt, in the wild cornices and furniture, in the bedlam patterns of the carpets of tufted gold! i had become a bounden slave in the trammels of opium, and my labors and my orders had taken a coloring from my dreams. but these absurdities i must not pause to detail. let me speak only of that one chamber, ever accursed, whither in a moment of mental alienation, i led from the altar as my bride--as the successor of the unforgotten ligeia--the fair-haired and blue-eyed lady rowena trevanion, of tremaine. there is no individual portion of the architecture and decoration of that bridal chamber which is not now visibly before me. where were the souls of the haughty family of the bride, when, through thirst of gold, they permitted to pass the threshold of an apartment so bedecked, a maiden and a daughter so beloved? i have said that i minutely remember the details of the chamber--yet i am sadly forgetful on topics of deep moment--and here there was no system, no keeping, in the fantastic display, to take hold upon the memory. the room lay in a high turret of the castellated abbey, was pentagonal in shape, and of capacious size. occupying the whole southern face of the pentagon was the sole window--an immense sheet of unbroken glass from venice--a single pane, and tinted of a leaden hue, so that the rays of either the sun or moon, passing through it, fell with a ghastly lustre on the objects within. over the upper portion of this huge window, extended the trellice-work of an aged vine, which clambered up the massy walls of the turret. the ceiling, of gloomy-looking oak, was excessively lofty, vaulted, and elaborately fretted with the wildest and most grotesque specimens of a semi-gothic, semi-druidical device. from out the most central recess of this melancholy vaulting, depended, by a single chain of gold with long links, a huge censer of the same metal, saracenic in pattern, and with many perforations so contrived that there writhed in and out of them, as if endued with a serpent vitality, a continual succession of parti-colored fires. some few ottomans and golden candelabra, of eastern figure, were in various stations about--and there was the couch, too--bridal couch--of an indian model, and low, and sculptured of solid ebony, with a pall-like canopy above. in each of the angles of the chamber stood on end a gigantic sarcophagus of black granite, from the tombs of the kings over against luxor, with their aged lids full of immemorial sculpture. but in the draping of the apartment lay, alas! the chief phantasy of all. the lofty walls, gigantic in height--even unproportionably so--were hung from summit to foot, in vast folds, with a heavy and massive-looking tapestry--tapestry of a material which was found alike as a carpet on the floor, as a covering for the ottomans and the ebony bed, as a canopy for the bed, and as the gorgeous volutes of the curtains which partially shaded the window. the material was the richest cloth of gold. it was spotted all over, at irregular intervals, with arabesque figures, about a foot in diameter, and wrought upon the cloth in patterns of the most jetty black. but these figures partook of the true character of the arabesque only when regarded from a single point of view. by a contrivance now common, and indeed traceable to a very remote period of antiquity, they were made changeable in aspect. to one entering the room, they bore the appearance of simple monstrosities; but upon a farther advance, this appearance gradually departed; and step by step, as the visitor moved his station in the chamber, he saw himself surrounded by an endless succession of the ghastly forms which belong to the superstition of the norman, or arise in the guilty slumbers of the monk. the phantasmagoric effect was vastly heightened by the artificial introduction of a strong continual current of wind behind the draperies--giving a hideous and uneasy animation to the whole. in halls such as these--in a bridal chamber such as this--i passed, with the lady of tremaine, the unhallowed hours of the first month of our marriage--passed them with but little disquietude. that my wife dreaded the fierce moodiness of my temper--that she shunned me and loved me but little--i could not help perceiving; but it gave me rather pleasure than otherwise. i loathed her with a hatred belonging more to demon than to man. my memory flew back, (oh, with what intensity of regret!) to ligeia, the beloved, the august, the beautiful, the entombed. i revelled in recollections of her purity, of her wisdom, of her lofty, her ethereal nature, of her passionate, her idolatrous love. now, then, did my spirit fully and freely burn with more than all the fires of her own. in the excitement of my opium dreams (for i was habitually fettered in the shackles of the drug) i would call aloud upon her name, during the silence of the night, or among the sheltered recesses of the glens by day, as if, through the wild eagerness, the solemn passion, the consuming ardor of my longing for the departed, i could restore her to the pathway she had abandoned--ah, could it be forever?--upon the earth. about the commencement of the second month of the marriage, the lady rowena was attacked with sudden illness, from which her recovery was slow. the fever which consumed her rendered her nights uneasy; and in her perturbed state of half-slumber, she spoke of sounds, and of motions, in and about the chamber of the turret, which i concluded had no origin save in the distemper of her fancy, or perhaps in the phantasmagoric influences of the chamber itself. she became at length convalescent--finally well. yet but a brief period elapsed, ere a second more violent disorder again threw her upon a bed of suffering; and from this attack her frame, at all times feeble, never altogether recovered. her illnesses were, after this epoch, of alarming character, and of more alarming recurrence, defying alike the knowledge and the great exertions of her physicians. with the increase of the chronic disease which had thus, apparently, taken too sure hold upon her constitution to be eradicated by human means, i could not fail to observe a similar increase in the nervous irritation of her temperament, and in her excitability by trivial causes of fear. she spoke again, and now more frequently and pertinaciously, of the sounds--of the slight sounds--and of the unusual motions among the tapestries, to which she had formerly alluded. one night, near the closing in of september, she pressed this distressing subject with more than usual emphasis upon my attention. she had just awakened from an unquiet slumber, and i had been watching, with feelings half of anxiety, half of vague terror, the workings of her emaciated countenance. i sat by the side of her ebony bed, upon one of the ottomans of india. she partly arose, and spoke, in an earnest low whisper, of sounds which she then heard, but which i could not hear--of motions which she then saw, but which i could not perceive. the wind was rushing hurriedly behind the tapestries, and i wished to show her (what, let me confess it, i could not all believe) that those almost inarticulate breathings, and those very gentle variations of the figures upon the wall, were but the natural effects of that customary rushing of the wind. but a deadly pallor, overspreading her face, had proved to me that my exertions to reassure her would be fruitless. she appeared to be fainting, and no attendants were within call. i remembered where was deposited a decanter of light wine which had been ordered by her physicians, and hastened across the chamber to procure it. but, as i stepped beneath the light of the censer, two circumstances of a startling nature attracted my attention. i had felt that some palpable although invisible object had passed lightly by my person; and i saw that there lay upon the golden carpet, in the very middle of the rich lustre thrown from the censer, a shadow--a faint, indefinite shadow of angelic aspect--such as might be fancied for the shadow of a shade. but i was wild with the excitement of an immoderate dose of opium, and heeded these things but little, nor spoke of them to rowena. having found the wine, i recrossed the chamber, and poured out a gobletful, which i held to the lips of the fainting lady. she had now partially recovered, however, and took the vessel herself, while i sank upon an ottoman near me, with my eyes fastened upon her person. it was then that i became distinctly aware of a gentle footfall upon the carpet, and near the couch; and in a second thereafter, as rowena was in the act of raising the wine to her lips, i saw, or may have dreamed that i saw, fall within the goblet, as if from some invisible spring in the atmosphere of the room, three or four large drops of a brilliant and ruby colored fluid. if this i saw--not so rowena. she swallowed the wine unhesitatingly, and i forbore to speak to her of a circumstance which must, after all, i considered, have been but the suggestion of a vivid imagination, rendered morbidly active by the terror of the lady, by the opium, and by the hour. yet i cannot conceal it from my own perception that, immediately subsequent to the fall of the ruby-drops, a rapid change for the worse took place in the disorder of my wife; so that, on the third subsequent night, the hands of her menials prepared her for the tomb, and on the fourth, i sat alone, with her shrouded body, in that fantastic chamber which had received her as my bride.--wild visions, opium-engendered, flitted, shadow-like, before me. i gazed with unquiet eye upon the sarcophagi in the angles of the room, upon the varying figures of the drapery, and upon the writhing of the parti-colored fires in the censer overhead. my eyes then fell, as i called to mind the circumstances of a former night, to the spot beneath the glare of the censer where i had seen the faint traces of the shadow. it was there, however, no longer; and breathing with greater freedom, i turned my glances to the pallid and rigid figure upon the bed. then rushed upon me a thousand memories of ligeia--and then came back upon my heart, with the turbulent violence of a flood, the whole of that unutterable wo with which i had regarded her thus enshrouded. the night waned; and still, with a bosom full of bitter thoughts of the one only and supremely beloved, i remained gazing upon the body of rowena. it might have been midnight, or perhaps earlier, or later, for i had taken no note of time, when a sob, low, gentle, but very distinct, startled me from my revery.--i felt that it came from the bed of ebony--the bed of death. i listened in an agony of superstitious terror--but there was no repetition of the sound. i strained my vision to detect any motion in the corpse--but there was not the slightest perceptible. yet i could not have been deceived. i had heard the noise, however faint, and my soul was awakened within me. i resolutely and perseveringly kept my attention riveted upon the body. many minutes elapsed before any circumstance occurred tending to throw light upon the mystery. at length it became evident that a slight, a very feeble, and barely noticeable tinge of color had flushed up within the cheeks, and along the sunken small veins of the eyelids. through a species of unutterable horror and awe, for which the language of mortality has no sufficiently energetic expression, i felt my heart cease to beat, my limbs grow rigid where i sat. yet a sense of duty finally operated to restore my self-possession. i could no longer doubt that we had been precipitate in our preparations--that rowena still lived. it was necessary that some immediate exertion be made; yet the turret was altogether apart from the portion of the abbey tenanted by the servants--there were none within call--i had no means of summoning them to my aid without leaving the room for many minutes--and this i could not venture to do. i therefore struggled alone in my endeavors to call back the spirit ill hovering. in a short period it was certain, however, that a relapse had taken place; the color disappeared from both eyelid and cheek, leaving a wanness even more than that of marble; the lips became doubly shrivelled and pinched up in the ghastly expression of death; a repulsive clamminess and coldness overspread rapidly the surface of the body; and all the usual rigorous illness immediately supervened. i fell back with a shudder upon the couch from which i had been so startlingly aroused, and again gave myself up to passionate waking visions of ligeia. an hour thus elapsed when (could it be possible?) i was a second time aware of some vague sound issuing from the region of the bed. i listened--in extremity of horror. the sound came again--it was a sigh. rushing to the corpse, i saw--distinctly saw--a tremor upon the lips. in a minute afterward they relaxed, disclosing a bright line of the pearly teeth. amazement now struggled in my bosom with the profound awe which had hitherto reigned there alone. i felt that my vision grew dim, that my reason wandered; and it was only by a violent effort that i at length succeeded in nerving myself to the task which duty thus once more had pointed out. there was now a partial glow upon the forehead and upon the cheek and throat; a perceptible warmth pervaded the whole frame; there was even a slight pulsation at the heart. the lady lived; and with redoubled ardor i betook myself to the task of restoration. i chafed and bathed the temples and the hands, and used every exertion which experience, and no little medical reading, could suggest. but in vain. suddenly, the color fled, the pulsation ceased, the lips resumed the expression of the dead, and, in an instant afterward, the whole body took upon itself the icy chilliness, the livid hue, the intense rigidity, the sunken outline, and all the loathsome peculiarities of that which has been, for many days, a tenant of the tomb. and again i sunk into visions of ligeia--and again, (what marvel that i shudder while i write,) again there reached my ears a low sob from the region of the ebony bed. but why shall i minutely detail the unspeakable horrors of that night? why shall i pause to relate how, time after time, until near the period of the gray dawn, this hideous drama of revivification was repeated; how each terrific relapse was only into a sterner and apparently more irredeemable death; how each agony wore the aspect of a struggle with some invisible foe; and how each struggle was succeeded by i know not what of wild change in the personal appearance of the corpse? let me hurry to a conclusion. the greater part of the fearful night had worn away, and she who had been dead, once again stirred--and now more vigorously than hitherto, although arousing from a dissolution more appalling in its utter hopelessness than any. i had long ceased to struggle or to move, and remained sitting rigidly upon the ottoman, a helpless prey to a whirl of violent emotions, of which extreme awe was perhaps the least terrible, the least consuming. the corpse, i repeat, stirred, and now more vigorously than before. the hues of life flushed up with unwonted energy into the countenance--the limbs relaxed--and, save that the eyelids were yet pressed heavily together, and that the bandages and draperies of the grave still imparted their charnel character to the figure, i might have dreamed that rowena had indeed shaken off, utterly, the fetters of death. but if this idea was not, even then, altogether adopted, i could at least doubt no longer, when, arising from the bed, tottering, with feeble steps, with closed eyes, and with the manner of one bewildered in a dream, the thing that was enshrouded advanced boldly and palpably into the middle of the apartment. i trembled not--i stirred not--for a crowd of unutterable fancies connected with the air, the stature, the demeanor of the figure, rushing hurriedly through my brain, had paralyzed--had chilled me into stone. i stirred not--but gazed upon the apparition. there was a mad disorder in my thoughts--a tumult unappeasable. could it, indeed, be the living rowena who confronted me? could it indeed be rowena at all--the fair-haired, the blue-eyed lady rowena trevanion of tremaine? why, why should i doubt it? the bandage lay heavily about the mouth--but then might it not be the mouth of the breathing lady of tremaine? and the cheeks--there were the roses as in her noon of life--yes, these might indeed be the fair cheeks of the living lady of tremaine. and the chin, with its dimples, as in health, might it not be hers?--but had she then grown taller since her malady? what inexpressible madness seized me with that thought? one bound, and i had reached her feet! shrinking from my touch, she let fall from her head, unloosened, the ghastly cerements which had confined it, and there streamed forth, into the rushing atmosphere of the chamber, huge masses of long and dishevelled hair; it was blacker than the raven wings of the midnight! and now slowly opened the eyes of the figure which stood before me. “here then, at least,” i shrieked aloud, “can i never--can i never be mistaken--these are the full, and the black, and the wild eyes--of my lost love--of the lady--of the lady ligeia.” morella itself, by itself, solely, one everlasting, and single. plato: sympos. with a feeling of deep yet most singular affection i regarded my friend morella. thrown by accident into her society many years ago, my soul from our first meeting, burned with fires it had never before known; but the fires were not of eros, and bitter and tormenting to my spirit was the gradual conviction that i could in no manner define their unusual meaning or regulate their vague intensity. yet we met; and fate bound us together at the altar, and i never spoke of passion nor thought of love. she, however, shunned society, and, attaching herself to me alone rendered me happy. it is a happiness to wonder; it is a happiness to dream. morella’s erudition was profound. as i hope to live, her talents were of no common order--her powers of mind were gigantic. i felt this, and, in many matters, became her pupil. i soon, however, found that, perhaps on account of her presburg education, she placed before me a number of those mystical writings which are usually considered the mere dross of the early german literature. these, for what reason i could not imagine, were her favourite and constant study--and that in process of time they became my own, should be attributed to the simple but effectual influence of habit and example. in all this, if i err not, my reason had little to do. my convictions, or i forget myself, were in no manner acted upon by the ideal, nor was any tincture of the mysticism which i read to be discovered, unless i am greatly mistaken, either in my deeds or in my thoughts. persuaded of this, i abandoned myself implicitly to the guidance of my wife, and entered with an unflinching heart into the intricacies of her studies. and then--then, when poring over forbidden pages, i felt a forbidden spirit enkindling within me--would morella place her cold hand upon my own, and rake up from the ashes of a dead philosophy some low, singular words, whose strange meaning burned themselves in upon my memory. and then, hour after hour, would i linger by her side, and dwell upon the music of her voice, until at length its melody was tainted with terror, and there fell a shadow upon my soul, and i grew pale, and shuddered inwardly at those too unearthly tones. and thus, joy suddenly faded into horror, and the most beautiful became the most hideous, as hinnon became ge-henna. it is unnecessary to state the exact character of those disquisitions which, growing out of the volumes i have mentioned, formed, for so long a time, almost the sole conversation of morella and myself. by the learned in what might be termed theological morality they will be readily conceived, and by the unlearned they would, at all events, be little understood. the wild pantheism of fichte; the modified paliggenedia of the pythagoreans; and, above all, the doctrines of identity as urged by schelling, were generally the points of discussion presenting the most of beauty to the imaginative morella. that identity which is termed personal, mr. locke, i think, truly defines to consist in the saneness of rational being. and since by person we understand an intelligent essence having reason, and since there is a consciousness which always accompanies thinking, it is this which makes us all to be that which we call ourselves, thereby distinguishing us from other beings that think, and giving us our personal identity. but the principium indivduationis, the notion of that identity which at death is or is not lost for ever, was to me, at all times, a consideration of intense interest; not more from the perplexing and exciting nature of its consequences, than from the marked and agitated manner in which morella mentioned them. but, indeed, the time had now arrived when the mystery of my wife’s manner oppressed me as a spell. i could no longer bear the touch of her wan fingers, nor the low tone of her musical language, nor the lustre of her melancholy eyes. and she knew all this, but did not upbraid; she seemed conscious of my weakness or my folly, and, smiling, called it fate. she seemed also conscious of a cause, to me unknown, for the gradual alienation of my regard; but she gave me no hint or token of its nature. yet was she woman, and pined away daily. in time the crimson spot settled steadily upon the cheek, and the blue veins upon the pale forehead became prominent; and one instant my nature melted into pity, but in, next i met the glance of her meaning eyes, and then my soul sickened and became giddy with the giddiness of one who gazes downward into some dreary and unfathomable abyss. shall i then say that i longed with an earnest and consuming desire for the moment of morella’s decease? i did; but the fragile spirit clung to its tenement of clay for many days, for many weeks and irksome months, until my tortured nerves obtained the mastery over my mind, and i grew furious through delay, and, with the heart of a fiend, cursed the days and the hours and the bitter moments, which seemed to lengthen and lengthen as her gentle life declined, like shadows in the dying of the day. but one autumnal evening, when the winds lay still in heaven, morella called me to her bedside. there was a dim mist over all the earth, and a warm glow upon the waters, and amid the rich october leaves of the forest, a rainbow from the firmament had surely fallen. “it is a day of days,” she said, as i approached; “a day of all days either to live or die. it is a fair day for the sons of earth and life--ah, more fair for the daughters of heaven and death!” i kissed her forehead, and she continued: “i am dying, yet shall i live.” “morella!” “the days have never been when thou couldst love me--but her whom in life thou didst abhor, in death thou shalt adore.” “morella!” “i repeat i am dying. but within me is a pledge of that affection--ah, how little!--which thou didst feel for me, morella. and when my spirit departs shall the child live--thy child and mine, morella’s. but thy days shall be days of sorrow--that sorrow which is the most lasting of impressions, as the cypress is the most enduring of trees. for the hours of thy happiness are over and joy is not gathered twice in a life, as the roses of paestum twice in a year. thou shalt no longer, then, play the teian with time, but, being ignorant of the myrtle and the vine, thou shalt bear about with thee thy shroud on the earth, as do the moslemin at mecca.” “morella!” i cried, “morella! how knowest thou this?” but she turned away her face upon the pillow and a slight tremor coming over her limbs, she thus died, and i heard her voice no more. yet, as she had foretold, her child, to which in dying she had given birth, which breathed not until the mother breathed no more, her child, a daughter, lived. and she grew strangely in stature and intellect, and was the perfect resemblance of her who had departed, and i loved her with a love more fervent than i had believed it possible to feel for any denizen of earth. but, ere long the heaven of this pure affection became darkened, and gloom, and horror, and grief swept over it in clouds. i said the child grew strangely in stature and intelligence. strange, indeed, was her rapid increase in bodily size, but terrible, oh! terrible were the tumultuous thoughts which crowded upon me while watching the development of her mental being. could it be otherwise, when i daily discovered in the conceptions of the child the adult powers and faculties of the woman? when the lessons of experience fell from the lips of infancy? and when the wisdom or the passions of maturity i found hourly gleaming from its full and speculative eye? when, i say, all this became evident to my appalled senses, when i could no longer hide it from my soul, nor throw it off from those perceptions which trembled to receive it, is it to be wondered at that suspicions, of a nature fearful and exciting, crept in upon my spirit, or that my thoughts fell back aghast upon the wild tales and thrilling theories of the entombed morella? i snatched from the scrutiny of the world a being whom destiny compelled me to adore, and in the rigorous seclusion of my home, watched with an agonizing anxiety over all which concerned the beloved. and as years rolled away, and i gazed day after day upon her holy, and mild, and eloquent face, and poured over her maturing form, day after day did i discover new points of resemblance in the child to her mother, the melancholy and the dead. and hourly grew darker these shadows of similitude, and more full, and more definite, and more perplexing, and more hideously terrible in their aspect. for that her smile was like her mother’s i could bear; but then i shuddered at its too perfect identity, that her eyes were like morella’s i could endure; but then they, too, often looked down into the depths of my soul with morella’s own intense and bewildering meaning. and in the contour of the high forehead, and in the ringlets of the silken hair, and in the wan fingers which buried themselves therein, and in the sad musical tones of her speech, and above all--oh, above all, in the phrases and expressions of the dead on the lips of the loved and the living, i found food for consuming thought and horror, for a worm that would not die. thus passed away two lustra of her life, and as yet my daughter remained nameless upon the earth. “my child,” and “my love,” were the designations usually prompted by a father’s affection, and the rigid seclusion of her days precluded all other intercourse. morella’s name died with her at her death. of the mother i had never spoken to the daughter, it was impossible to speak. indeed, during the brief period of her existence, the latter had received no impressions from the outward world, save such as might have been afforded by the narrow limits of her privacy. but at length the ceremony of baptism presented to my mind, in its unnerved and agitated condition, a present deliverance from the terrors of my destiny. and at the baptismal font i hesitated for a name. and many titles of the wise and beautiful, of old and modern times, of my own and foreign lands, came thronging to my lips, with many, many fair titles of the gentle, and the happy, and the good. what prompted me then to disturb the memory of the buried dead? what demon urged me to breathe that sound, which in its very recollection was wont to make ebb the purple blood in torrents from the temples to the heart? what fiend spoke from the recesses of my soul, when amid those dim aisles, and in the silence of the night, i whispered within the ears of the holy man the syllables--morella? what more than fiend convulsed the features of my child, and overspread them with hues of death, as starting at that scarcely audible sound, she turned her glassy eyes from the earth to heaven, and falling prostrate on the black slabs of our ancestral vault, responded--“i am here!” distinct, coldly, calmly distinct, fell those few simple sounds within my ear, and thence like molten lead rolled hissingly into my brain. years--years may pass away, but the memory of that epoch never. nor was i indeed ignorant of the flowers and the vine--but the hemlock and the cypress overshadowed me night and day. and i kept no reckoning of time or place, and the stars of my fate faded from heaven, and therefore the earth grew dark, and its figures passed by me like flitting shadows, and among them all i beheld only--morella. the winds of the firmament breathed but one sound within my ears, and the ripples upon the sea murmured evermore--morella. but she died; and with my own hands i bore her to the tomb; and i laughed with a long and bitter laugh as i found no traces of the first in the channel where i laid the second.--morella. a tale of the ragged mountains during the fall of the year <UNK> while residing near charlottesville, virginia, i casually made the acquaintance of mr. augustus bedloe. this young gentleman was remarkable in every respect, and excited in me a profound interest and curiosity. i found it impossible to comprehend him either in his moral or his physical relations. of his family i could obtain no satisfactory account. whence he came, i never ascertained. even about his age--although i call him a young gentleman--there was something which perplexed me in no little degree. he certainly seemed young--and he made a point of speaking about his youth--yet there were moments when i should have had little trouble in imagining him a hundred years of age. but in no regard was he more peculiar than in his personal appearance. he was singularly tall and thin. he stooped much. his limbs were exceedingly long and emaciated. his forehead was broad and low. his complexion was absolutely bloodless. his mouth was large and flexible, and his teeth were more wildly uneven, although sound, than i had ever before seen teeth in a human head. the expression of his smile, however, was by no means unpleasing, as might be supposed; but it had no variation whatever. it was one of profound melancholy--of a phaseless and unceasing gloom. his eyes were abnormally large, and round like those of a cat. the pupils, too, upon any accession or diminution of light, underwent contraction or dilation, just such as is observed in the feline tribe. in moments of excitement the orbs grew bright to a degree almost inconceivable; seeming to emit luminous rays, not of a reflected but of an intrinsic lustre, as does a candle or the sun; yet their ordinary condition was so totally vapid, filmy, and dull as to convey the idea of the eyes of a long-interred corpse. these peculiarities of person appeared to cause him much annoyance, and he was continually alluding to them in a sort of half explanatory, half apologetic strain, which, when i first heard it, impressed me very painfully. i soon, however, grew accustomed to it, and my uneasiness wore off. it seemed to be his design rather to insinuate than directly to assert that, physically, he had not always been what he was--that a long series of neuralgic attacks had reduced him from a condition of more than usual personal beauty, to that which i saw. for many years past he had been attended by a physician, named templeton--an old gentleman, perhaps seventy years of age--whom he had first encountered at saratoga, and from whose attention, while there, he either received, or fancied that he received, great benefit. the result was that bedloe, who was wealthy, had made an arrangement with dr. templeton, by which the latter, in consideration of a liberal annual allowance, had consented to devote his time and medical experience exclusively to the care of the invalid. doctor templeton had been a traveller in his younger days, and at paris had become a convert, in great measure, to the doctrines of mesmer. it was altogether by means of magnetic remedies that he had succeeded in alleviating the acute pains of his patient; and this success had very naturally inspired the latter with a certain degree of confidence in the opinions from which the remedies had been educed. the doctor, however, like all enthusiasts, had struggled hard to make a thorough convert of his pupil, and finally so far gained his point as to induce the sufferer to submit to numerous experiments. by a frequent repetition of these, a result had arisen, which of late days has become so common as to attract little or no attention, but which, at the period of which i write, had very rarely been known in america. i mean to say, that between doctor templeton and bedloe there had grown up, little by little, a very distinct and strongly marked rapport, or magnetic relation. i am not prepared to assert, however, that this rapport extended beyond the limits of the simple sleep-producing power, but this power itself had attained great intensity. at the first attempt to induce the magnetic somnolency, the mesmerist entirely failed. in the fifth or sixth he succeeded very partially, and after long continued effort. only at the twelfth was the triumph complete. after this the will of the patient succumbed rapidly to that of the physician, so that, when i first became acquainted with the two, sleep was brought about almost instantaneously by the mere volition of the operator, even when the invalid was unaware of his presence. it is only now, in the year <UNK> when similar miracles are witnessed daily by thousands, that i dare venture to record this apparent impossibility as a matter of serious fact. the temperature of bedloe was, in the highest degree sensitive, excitable, enthusiastic. his imagination was singularly vigorous and creative; and no doubt it derived additional force from the habitual use of morphine, which he swallowed in great quantity, and without which he would have found it impossible to exist. it was his practice to take a very large dose of it immediately after breakfast each morning--or, rather, immediately after a cup of strong coffee, for he ate nothing in the forenoon--and then set forth alone, or attended only by a dog, upon a long ramble among the chain of wild and dreary hills that lie westward and southward of charlottesville, and are there dignified by the title of the ragged mountains. upon a dim, warm, misty day, toward the close of november, and during the strange interregnum of the seasons which in america is termed the indian summer, mr. bedloe departed as usual for the hills. the day passed, and still he did not return. about eight o’clock at night, having become seriously alarmed at his protracted absence, we were about setting out in search of him, when he unexpectedly made his appearance, in health no worse than usual, and in rather more than ordinary spirits. the account which he gave of his expedition, and of the events which had detained him, was a singular one indeed. “you will remember,” said he, “that it was about nine in the morning when i left charlottesville. i bent my steps immediately to the mountains, and, about ten, entered a gorge which was entirely new to me. i followed the windings of this pass with much interest. the scenery which presented itself on all sides, although scarcely entitled to be called grand, had about it an indescribable and to me a delicious aspect of dreary desolation. the solitude seemed absolutely virgin. i could not help believing that the green sods and the gray rocks upon which i trod had been trodden never before by the foot of a human being. so entirely secluded, and in fact inaccessible, except through a series of accidents, is the entrance of the ravine, that it is by no means impossible that i was indeed the first adventurer--the very first and sole adventurer who had ever penetrated its recesses. “the thick and peculiar mist, or smoke, which distinguishes the indian summer, and which now hung heavily over all objects, served, no doubt, to deepen the vague impressions which these objects created. so dense was this pleasant fog that i could at no time see more than a dozen yards of the path before me. this path was excessively sinuous, and as the sun could not be seen, i soon lost all idea of the direction in which i journeyed. in the meantime the morphine had its customary effect--that of enduing all the external world with an intensity of interest. in the quivering of a leaf--in the hue of a blade of grass--in the shape of a trefoil--in the humming of a bee--in the gleaming of a dew-drop--in the breathing of the wind--in the faint odors that came from the forest--there came a whole universe of suggestion--a gay and motley train of rhapsodical and immethodical thought. “busied in this, i walked on for several hours, during which the mist deepened around me to so great an extent that at length i was reduced to an absolute groping of the way. and now an indescribable uneasiness possessed me--a species of nervous hesitation and tremor. i feared to tread, lest i should be precipitated into some abyss. i remembered, too, strange stories told about these ragged hills, and of the uncouth and fierce races of men who tenanted their groves and caverns. a thousand vague fancies oppressed and disconcerted me--fancies the more distressing because vague. very suddenly my attention was arrested by the loud beating of a drum. “my amazement was, of course, extreme. a drum in these hills was a thing unknown. i could not have been more surprised at the sound of the trump of the archangel. but a new and still more astounding source of interest and perplexity arose. there came a wild rattling or jingling sound, as if of a bunch of large keys, and upon the instant a dusky-visaged and half-naked man rushed past me with a shriek. he came so close to my person that i felt his hot breath upon my face. he bore in one hand an instrument composed of an assemblage of steel rings, and shook them vigorously as he ran. scarcely had he disappeared in the mist before, panting after him, with open mouth and glaring eyes, there darted a huge beast. i could not be mistaken in its character. it was a hyena. “the sight of this monster rather relieved than heightened my terrors--for i now made sure that i dreamed, and endeavored to arouse myself to waking consciousness. i stepped boldly and briskly forward. i rubbed my eyes. i called aloud. i pinched my limbs. a small spring of water presented itself to my view, and here, stooping, i bathed my hands and my head and neck. this seemed to dissipate the equivocal sensations which had hitherto annoyed me. i arose, as i thought, a new man, and proceeded steadily and complacently on my unknown way. “at length, quite overcome by exertion, and by a certain oppressive closeness of the atmosphere, i seated myself beneath a tree. presently there came a feeble gleam of sunshine, and the shadow of the leaves of the tree fell faintly but definitely upon the grass. at this shadow i gazed wonderingly for many minutes. its character stupefied me with astonishment. i looked upward. the tree was a palm. “i now arose hurriedly, and in a state of fearful agitation--for the fancy that i dreamed would serve me no longer. i saw--i felt that i had perfect command of my senses--and these senses now brought to my soul a world of novel and singular sensation. the heat became all at once intolerable. a strange odor loaded the breeze. a low, continuous murmur, like that arising from a full, but gently flowing river, came to my ears, intermingled with the peculiar hum of multitudinous human voices. “while i listened in an extremity of astonishment which i need not attempt to describe, a strong and brief gust of wind bore off the incumbent fog as if by the wand of an enchanter. “i found myself at the foot of a high mountain, and looking down into a vast plain, through which wound a majestic river. on the margin of this river stood an eastern-looking city, such as we read of in the arabian tales, but of a character even more singular than any there described. from my position, which was far above the level of the town, i could perceive its every nook and corner, as if delineated on a map. the streets seemed innumerable, and crossed each other irregularly in all directions, but were rather long winding alleys than streets, and absolutely swarmed with inhabitants. the houses were wildly picturesque. on every hand was a wilderness of balconies, of verandas, of minarets, of shrines, and fantastically carved oriels. bazaars abounded; and in these were displayed rich wares in infinite variety and profusion--silks, muslins, the most dazzling cutlery, the most magnificent jewels and gems. besides these things, were seen, on all sides, banners and palanquins, litters with stately dames close veiled, elephants gorgeously caparisoned, idols grotesquely hewn, drums, banners, and gongs, spears, silver and gilded maces. and amid the crowd, and the clamor, and the general intricacy and confusion--amid the million of black and yellow men, turbaned and robed, and of flowing beard, there roamed a countless multitude of holy filleted bulls, while vast legions of the filthy but sacred ape clambered, chattering and shrieking, about the cornices of the mosques, or clung to the minarets and oriels. from the swarming streets to the banks of the river, there descended innumerable flights of steps leading to bathing places, while the river itself seemed to force a passage with difficulty through the vast fleets of deeply-burthened ships that far and wide encountered its surface. beyond the limits of the city arose, in frequent majestic groups, the palm and the cocoa, with other gigantic and weird trees of vast age, and here and there might be seen a field of rice, the thatched hut of a peasant, a tank, a stray temple, a gypsy camp, or a solitary graceful maiden taking her way, with a pitcher upon her head, to the banks of the magnificent river. “you will say now, of course, that i dreamed; but not so. what i saw--what i heard--what i felt--what i thought--had about it nothing of the unmistakable idiosyncrasy of the dream. all was rigorously self-consistent. at first, doubting that i was really awake, i entered into a series of tests, which soon convinced me that i really was. now, when one dreams, and, in the dream, suspects that he dreams, the suspicion never fails to confirm itself, and the sleeper is almost immediately aroused. thus novalis errs not in saying that ‘we are near waking when we dream that we dream.’ had the vision occurred to me as i describe it, without my suspecting it as a dream, then a dream it might absolutely have been, but, occurring as it did, and suspected and tested as it was, i am forced to class it among other phenomena.” “in this i am not sure that you are wrong,” observed dr. templeton, “but proceed. you arose and descended into the city.” “i arose,” continued bedloe, regarding the doctor with an air of profound astonishment “i arose, as you say, and descended into the city. on my way i fell in with an immense populace, crowding through every avenue, all in the same direction, and exhibiting in every action the wildest excitement. very suddenly, and by some inconceivable impulse, i became intensely imbued with personal interest in what was going on. i seemed to feel that i had an important part to play, without exactly understanding what it was. against the crowd which environed me, however, i experienced a deep sentiment of animosity. i shrank from amid them, and, swiftly, by a circuitous path, reached and entered the city. here all was the wildest tumult and contention. a small party of men, clad in garments half-indian, half-european, and officered by gentlemen in a uniform partly british, were engaged, at great odds, with the swarming rabble of the alleys. i joined the weaker party, arming myself with the weapons of a fallen officer, and fighting i knew not whom with the nervous ferocity of despair. we were soon overpowered by numbers, and driven to seek refuge in a species of kiosk. here we barricaded ourselves, and, for the present were secure. from a loop-hole near the summit of the kiosk, i perceived a vast crowd, in furious agitation, surrounding and assaulting a gay palace that overhung the river. presently, from an upper window of this place, there descended an effeminate-looking person, by means of a string made of the turbans of his attendants. a boat was at hand, in which he escaped to the opposite bank of the river. “and now a new object took possession of my soul. i spoke a few hurried but energetic words to my companions, and, having succeeded in gaining over a few of them to my purpose made a frantic sally from the kiosk. we rushed amid the crowd that surrounded it. they retreated, at first, before us. they rallied, fought madly, and retreated again. in the mean time we were borne far from the kiosk, and became bewildered and entangled among the narrow streets of tall, overhanging houses, into the recesses of which the sun had never been able to shine. the rabble pressed impetuously upon us, harrassing us with their spears, and overwhelming us with flights of arrows. these latter were very remarkable, and resembled in some respects the writhing creese of the malay. they were made to imitate the body of a creeping serpent, and were long and black, with a poisoned barb. one of them struck me upon the right temple. i reeled and fell. an instantaneous and dreadful sickness seized me. i struggled--i gasped--i died. “you will hardly persist now,” said i smiling, “that the whole of your adventure was not a dream. you are not prepared to maintain that you are dead?” when i said these words, i of course expected some lively sally from bedloe in reply, but, to my astonishment, he hesitated, trembled, became fearfully pallid, and remained silent. i looked toward templeton. he sat erect and rigid in his chair--his teeth chattered, and his eyes were starting from their sockets. “proceed!” he at length said hoarsely to bedloe. “for many minutes,” continued the latter, “my sole sentiment--my sole feeling--was that of darkness and nonentity, with the consciousness of death. at length there seemed to pass a violent and sudden shock through my soul, as if of electricity. with it came the sense of elasticity and of light. this latter i felt--not saw. in an instant i seemed to rise from the ground. but i had no bodily, no visible, audible, or palpable presence. the crowd had departed. the tumult had ceased. the city was in comparative repose. beneath me lay my corpse, with the arrow in my temple, the whole head greatly swollen and disfigured. but all these things i felt--not saw. i took interest in nothing. even the corpse seemed a matter in which i had no concern. volition i had none, but appeared to be impelled into motion, and flitted buoyantly out of the city, retracing the circuitous path by which i had entered it. when i had attained that point of the ravine in the mountains at which i had encountered the hyena, i again experienced a shock as of a galvanic battery, the sense of weight, of volition, of substance, returned. i became my original self, and bent my steps eagerly homeward--but the past had not lost the vividness of the real--and not now, even for an instant, can i compel my understanding to regard it as a dream.” “nor was it,” said templeton, with an air of deep solemnity, “yet it would be difficult to say how otherwise it should be termed. let us suppose only, that the soul of the man of to-day is upon the verge of some stupendous psychal discoveries. let us content ourselves with this supposition. for the rest i have some explanation to make. here is a watercolor drawing, which i should have shown you before, but which an unaccountable sentiment of horror has hitherto prevented me from showing.” we looked at the picture which he presented. i saw nothing in it of an extraordinary character, but its effect upon bedloe was prodigious. he nearly fainted as he gazed. and yet it was but a miniature portrait--a miraculously accurate one, to be sure--of his own very remarkable features. at least this was my thought as i regarded it. “you will perceive,” said templeton, “the date of this picture--it is here, scarcely visible, in this <UNK> in this year was the portrait taken. it is the likeness of a dead friend--a mr. oldeb--to whom i became much attached at calcutta, during the administration of warren hastings. i was then only twenty years old. when i first saw you, mr. bedloe, at saratoga, it was the miraculous similarity which existed between yourself and the painting which induced me to accost you, to seek your friendship, and to bring about those arrangements which resulted in my becoming your constant companion. in accomplishing this point, i was urged partly, and perhaps principally, by a regretful memory of the deceased, but also, in part, by an uneasy, and not altogether horrorless curiosity respecting yourself. “in your detail of the vision which presented itself to you amid the hills, you have described, with the minutest accuracy, the indian city of benares, upon the holy river. the riots, the combat, the massacre, were the actual events of the insurrection of cheyte sing, which took place in <UNK> when hastings was put in imminent peril of his life. the man escaping by the string of turbans was cheyte sing himself. the party in the kiosk were sepoys and british officers, headed by hastings. of this party i was one, and did all i could to prevent the rash and fatal sally of the officer who fell, in the crowded alleys, by the poisoned arrow of a bengalee. that officer was my dearest friend. it was oldeb. you will perceive by these manuscripts,” (here the speaker produced a note-book in which several pages appeared to have been freshly written,) “that at the very period in which you fancied these things amid the hills, i was engaged in detailing them upon paper here at home.” in about a week after this conversation, the following paragraphs appeared in a charlottesville paper: “we have the painful duty of announcing the death of mr. augustus bedlo, a gentleman whose amiable manners and many virtues have long endeared him to the citizens of charlottesville. “mr. b., for some years past, has been subject to neuralgia, which has often threatened to terminate fatally; but this can be regarded only as the mediate cause of his decease. the proximate cause was one of especial singularity. in an excursion to the ragged mountains, a few days since, a slight cold and fever were contracted, attended with great determination of blood to the head. to relieve this, dr. templeton resorted to topical bleeding. leeches were applied to the temples. in a fearfully brief period the patient died, when it appeared that in the jar containing the leeches, had been introduced, by accident, one of the venomous vermicular sangsues which are now and then found in the neighboring ponds. this creature fastened itself upon a small artery in the right temple. its close resemblance to the medicinal leech caused the mistake to be overlooked until too late. “n. b. the poisonous sangsue of charlottesville may always be distinguished from the medicinal leech by its blackness, and especially by its writhing or vermicular motions, which very nearly resemble those of a snake.” i was speaking with the editor of the paper in question, upon the topic of this remarkable accident, when it occurred to me to ask how it happened that the name of the deceased had been given as bedlo. “i presume,” i said, “you have authority for this spelling, but i have always supposed the name to be written with an e at the end.” “authority?--no,” he replied. “it is a mere typographical error. the name is bedlo with an e, all the world over, and i never knew it to be spelt otherwise in my life.” “then,” said i mutteringly, as i turned upon my heel, “then indeed has it come to pass that one truth is stranger than any fiction--for bedloe, without the e, what is it but oldeb conversed! and this man tells me that it is a typographical error.” the spectacles many years ago, it was the fashion to ridicule the idea of “love at first sight;” but those who think, not less than those who feel deeply, have always advocated its existence. modern discoveries, indeed, in what may be termed ethical magnetism or magnetoesthetics, render it probable that the most natural, and, consequently, the truest and most intense of the human affections are those which arise in the heart as if by electric sympathy--in a word, that the brightest and most enduring of the psychal fetters are those which are riveted by a glance. the confession i am about to make will add another to the already almost innumerable instances of the truth of the position. my story requires that i should be somewhat minute. i am still a very young man--not yet twenty-two years of age. my name, at present, is a very usual and rather plebeian one--simpson. i say “at present;” for it is only lately that i have been so called--having legislatively adopted this surname within the last year in order to receive a large inheritance left me by a distant male relative, adolphus simpson, esq. the bequest was conditioned upon my taking the name of the testator,--the family, not the christian name; my christian name is napoleon bonaparte--or, more properly, these are my first and middle appellations. i assumed the name, simpson, with some reluctance, as in my true patronym, froissart, i felt a very pardonable pride--believing that i could trace a descent from the immortal author of the “chronicles.” while on the subject of names, by the bye, i may mention a singular coincidence of sound attending the names of some of my immediate predecessors. my father was a monsieur froissart, of paris. his wife--my mother, whom he married at fifteen--was a mademoiselle croissart, eldest daughter of croissart the banker, whose wife, again, being only sixteen when married, was the eldest daughter of one victor voissart. monsieur voissart, very singularly, had married a lady of similar name--a mademoiselle moissart. she, too, was quite a child when married; and her mother, also, madame moissart, was only fourteen when led to the altar. these early marriages are usual in france. here, however, are moissart, voissart, croissart, and froissart, all in the direct line of descent. my own name, though, as i say, became simpson, by act of legislature, and with so much repugnance on my part, that, at one period, i actually hesitated about accepting the legacy with the useless and annoying proviso attached. as to personal endowments, i am by no means deficient. on the contrary, i believe that i am well made, and possess what nine tenths of the world would call a handsome face. in height i am five feet eleven. my hair is black and curling. my nose is sufficiently good. my eyes are large and gray; and although, in fact they are weak a very inconvenient degree, still no defect in this regard would be suspected from their appearance. the weakness itself, however, has always much annoyed me, and i have resorted to every remedy--short of wearing glasses. being youthful and good-looking, i naturally dislike these, and have resolutely refused to employ them. i know nothing, indeed, which so disfigures the countenance of a young person, or so impresses every feature with an air of demureness, if not altogether of sanctimoniousness and of age. an eyeglass, on the other hand, has a savor of downright foppery and affectation. i have hitherto managed as well as i could without either. but something too much of these merely personal details, which, after all, are of little importance. i will content myself with saying, in addition, that my temperament is sanguine, rash, ardent, enthusiastic--and that all my life i have been a devoted admirer of the women. one night last winter i entered a box at the p---theatre, in company with a friend, mr. talbot. it was an opera night, and the bills presented a very rare attraction, so that the house was excessively crowded. we were in time, however, to obtain the front seats which had been reserved for us, and into which, with some little difficulty, we elbowed our way. for two hours my companion, who was a musical fanatico, gave his undivided attention to the stage; and, in the meantime, i amused myself by observing the audience, which consisted, in chief part, of the very elite of the city. having satisfied myself upon this point, i was about turning my eyes to the prima donna, when they were arrested and riveted by a figure in one of the private boxes which had escaped my observation. if i live a thousand years, i can never forget the intense emotion with which i regarded this figure. it was that of a female, the most exquisite i had ever beheld. the face was so far turned toward the stage that, for some minutes, i could not obtain a view of it--but the form was divine; no other word can sufficiently express its magnificent proportion--and even the term “divine” seems ridiculously feeble as i write it. the magic of a lovely form in woman--the necromancy of female gracefulness--was always a power which i had found it impossible to resist, but here was grace personified, incarnate, the beau ideal of my wildest and most enthusiastic visions. the figure, almost all of which the construction of the box permitted to be seen, was somewhat above the medium height, and nearly approached, without positively reaching, the majestic. its perfect fullness and tournure were delicious. the head of which only the back was visible, rivalled in outline that of the greek psyche, and was rather displayed than concealed by an elegant cap of gaze aerienne, which put me in mind of the ventum textilem of apuleius. the right arm hung over the balustrade of the box, and thrilled every nerve of my frame with its exquisite symmetry. its upper portion was draperied by one of the loose open sleeves now in fashion. this extended but little below the elbow. beneath it was worn an under one of some frail material, close-fitting, and terminated by a cuff of rich lace, which fell gracefully over the top of the hand, revealing only the delicate fingers, upon one of which sparkled a diamond ring, which i at once saw was of extraordinary value. the admirable roundness of the wrist was well set off by a bracelet which encircled it, and which also was ornamented and clasped by a magnificent aigrette of jewels--telling, in words that could not be mistaken, at once of the wealth and fastidious taste of the wearer. i gazed at this queenly apparition for at least half an hour, as if i had been suddenly converted to stone; and, during this period, i felt the full force and truth of all that has been said or sung concerning “love at first sight.” my feelings were totally different from any which i had hitherto experienced, in the presence of even the most celebrated specimens of female loveliness. an unaccountable, and what i am compelled to consider a magnetic, sympathy of soul for soul, seemed to rivet, not only my vision, but my whole powers of thought and feeling, upon the admirable object before me. i saw--i felt--i knew that i was deeply, madly, irrevocably in love--and this even before seeing the face of the person beloved. so intense, indeed, was the passion that consumed me, that i really believe it would have received little if any abatement had the features, yet unseen, proved of merely ordinary character, so anomalous is the nature of the only true love--of the love at first sight--and so little really dependent is it upon the external conditions which only seem to create and control it. while i was thus wrapped in admiration of this lovely vision, a sudden disturbance among the audience caused her to turn her head partially toward me, so that i beheld the entire profile of the face. its beauty even exceeded my anticipations--and yet there was something about it which disappointed me without my being able to tell exactly what it was. i said “disappointed,” but this is not altogether the word. my sentiments were at once quieted and exalted. they partook less of transport and more of calm enthusiasm of enthusiastic repose. this state of feeling arose, perhaps, from the madonna-like and matronly air of the face; and yet i at once understood that it could not have arisen entirely from this. there was something else--some mystery which i could not develope--some expression about the countenance which slightly disturbed me while it greatly heightened my interest. in fact, i was just in that condition of mind which prepares a young and susceptible man for any act of extravagance. had the lady been alone, i should undoubtedly have entered her box and accosted her at all hazards; but, fortunately, she was attended by two companions--a gentleman, and a strikingly beautiful woman, to all appearance a few years younger than herself. i revolved in my mind a thousand schemes by which i might obtain, hereafter, an introduction to the elder lady, or, for the present, at all events, a more distinct view of her beauty. i would have removed my position to one nearer her own, but the crowded state of the theatre rendered this impossible; and the stern decrees of fashion had, of late, imperatively prohibited the use of the opera-glass in a case such as this, even had i been so fortunate as to have one with me--but i had not--and was thus in despair. at length i bethought me of applying to my companion. “talbot,” i said, “you have an opera-glass. let me have it.” “an opera-glass!--no!--what do you suppose i would be doing with an opera-glass?” here he turned impatiently toward the stage. “but, talbot,” i continued, pulling him by the shoulder, “listen to me will you? do you see the stage--box?--there!--no, the next.--did you ever behold as lovely a woman?” “she is very beautiful, no doubt,” he said. “i wonder who she can be?” “why, in the name of all that is angelic, don’t you know who she is? ‘not to know her argues yourself unknown.’ she is the celebrated madame lalande--the beauty of the day par excellence, and the talk of the whole town. immensely wealthy too--a widow, and a great match--has just arrived from paris.” “do you know her?” “yes; i have the honor.” “will you introduce me?” “assuredly, with the greatest pleasure; when shall it be?” “to-morrow, at one, i will call upon you at b--’s.” “very good; and now do hold your tongue, if you can.” in this latter respect i was forced to take talbot’s advice; for he remained obstinately deaf to every further question or suggestion, and occupied himself exclusively for the rest of the evening with what was transacting upon the stage. in the meantime i kept my eyes riveted on madame lalande, and at length had the good fortune to obtain a full front view of her face. it was exquisitely lovely--this, of course, my heart had told me before, even had not talbot fully satisfied me upon the point--but still the unintelligible something disturbed me. i finally concluded that my senses were impressed by a certain air of gravity, sadness, or, still more properly, of weariness, which took something from the youth and freshness of the countenance, only to endow it with a seraphic tenderness and majesty, and thus, of course, to my enthusiastic and romantic temperment, with an interest tenfold. while i thus feasted my eyes, i perceived, at last, to my great trepidation, by an almost imperceptible start on the part of the lady, that she had become suddenly aware of the intensity of my gaze. still, i was absolutely fascinated, and could not withdraw it, even for an instant. she turned aside her face, and again i saw only the chiselled contour of the back portion of the head. after some minutes, as if urged by curiosity to see if i was still looking, she gradually brought her face again around and again encountered my burning gaze. her large dark eyes fell instantly, and a deep blush mantled her cheek. but what was my astonishment at perceiving that she not only did not a second time avert her head, but that she actually took from her girdle a double eyeglass--elevated it--adjusted it--and then regarded me through it, intently and deliberately, for the space of several minutes. had a thunderbolt fallen at my feet i could not have been more thoroughly astounded--astounded only--not offended or disgusted in the slightest degree; although an action so bold in any other woman would have been likely to offend or disgust. but the whole thing was done with so much quietude--so much nonchalance--so much repose--with so evident an air of the highest breeding, in short--that nothing of mere effrontery was perceptible, and my sole sentiments were those of admiration and surprise. i observed that, upon her first elevation of the glass, she had seemed satisfied with a momentary inspection of my person, and was withdrawing the instrument, when, as if struck by a second thought, she resumed it, and so continued to regard me with fixed attention for the space of several minutes--for five minutes, at the very least, i am sure. this action, so remarkable in an american theatre, attracted very general observation, and gave rise to an indefinite movement, or buzz, among the audience, which for a moment filled me with confusion, but produced no visible effect upon the countenance of madame lalande. having satisfied her curiosity--if such it was--she dropped the glass, and quietly gave her attention again to the stage; her profile now being turned toward myself, as before. i continued to watch her unremittingly, although i was fully conscious of my rudeness in so doing. presently i saw the head slowly and slightly change its position; and soon i became convinced that the lady, while pretending to look at the stage was, in fact, attentively regarding myself. it is needless to say what effect this conduct, on the part of so fascinating a woman, had upon my excitable mind. having thus scrutinized me for perhaps a quarter of an hour, the fair object of my passion addressed the gentleman who attended her, and while she spoke, i saw distinctly, by the glances of both, that the conversation had reference to myself. upon its conclusion, madame lalande again turned toward the stage, and, for a few minutes, seemed absorbed in the performance. at the expiration of this period, however, i was thrown into an extremity of agitation by seeing her unfold, for the second time, the eye-glass which hung at her side, fully confront me as before, and, disregarding the renewed buzz of the audience, survey me, from head to foot, with the same miraculous composure which had previously so delighted and confounded my soul. this extraordinary behavior, by throwing me into a perfect fever of excitement--into an absolute delirium of love--served rather to embolden than to disconcert me. in the mad intensity of my devotion, i forgot everything but the presence and the majestic loveliness of the vision which confronted my gaze. watching my opportunity, when i thought the audience were fully engaged with the opera, i at length caught the eyes of madame lalande, and, upon the instant, made a slight but unmistakable bow. she blushed very deeply--then averted her eyes--then slowly and cautiously looked around, apparently to see if my rash action had been noticed--then leaned over toward the gentleman who sat by her side. i now felt a burning sense of the impropriety i had committed, and expected nothing less than instant exposure; while a vision of pistols upon the morrow floated rapidly and uncomfortably through my brain. i was greatly and immediately relieved, however, when i saw the lady merely hand the gentleman a play-bill, without speaking, but the reader may form some feeble conception of my astonishment--of my profound amazement--my delirious bewilderment of heart and soul--when, instantly afterward, having again glanced furtively around, she allowed her bright eyes to set fully and steadily upon my own, and then, with a faint smile, disclosing a bright line of her pearly teeth, made two distinct, pointed, and unequivocal affirmative inclinations of the head. it is useless, of course, to dwell upon my joy--upon my transport--upon my illimitable ecstasy of heart. if ever man was mad with excess of happiness, it was myself at that moment. i loved. this was my first love--so i felt it to be. it was love supreme--indescribable. it was “love at first sight;” and at first sight, too, it had been appreciated and returned. yes, returned. how and why should i doubt it for an instant. what other construction could i possibly put upon such conduct, on the part of a lady so beautiful--so wealthy--evidently so accomplished--of so high breeding--of so lofty a position in society--in every regard so entirely respectable as i felt assured was madame lalande? yes, she loved me--she returned the enthusiasm of my love, with an enthusiasm as blind--as uncompromising--as uncalculating--as abandoned--and as utterly unbounded as my own! these delicious fancies and reflections, however, were now interrupted by the falling of the drop-curtain. the audience arose; and the usual tumult immediately supervened. quitting talbot abruptly, i made every effort to force my way into closer proximity with madame lalande. having failed in this, on account of the crowd, i at length gave up the chase, and bent my steps homeward; consoling myself for my disappointment in not having been able to touch even the hem of her robe, by the reflection that i should be introduced by talbot, in due form, upon the morrow. this morrow at last came, that is to say, a day finally dawned upon a long and weary night of impatience; and then the hours until “one” were snail-paced, dreary, and innumerable. but even stamboul, it is said, shall have an end, and there came an end to this long delay. the clock struck. as the last echo ceased, i stepped into b--‘s and inquired for talbot. “out,” said the footman--talbot’s own. “out!” i replied, staggering back half a dozen paces--“let me tell you, my fine fellow, that this thing is thoroughly impossible and impracticable; mr. talbot is not out. what do you mean?” “nothing, sir; only mr. talbot is not in, that’s all. he rode over to s--, immediately after breakfast, and left word that he would not be in town again for a week.” i stood petrified with horror and rage. i endeavored to reply, but my tongue refused its office. at length i turned on my heel, livid with wrath, and inwardly consigning the whole tribe of the talbots to the innermost regions of erebus. it was evident that my considerate friend, il fanatico, had quite forgotten his appointment with myself--had forgotten it as soon as it was made. at no time was he a very scrupulous man of his word. there was no help for it; so smothering my vexation as well as i could, i strolled moodily up the street, propounding futile inquiries about madame lalande to every male acquaintance i met. by report she was known, i found, to all--to many by sight--but she had been in town only a few weeks, and there were very few, therefore, who claimed her personal acquaintance. these few, being still comparatively strangers, could not, or would not, take the liberty of introducing me through the formality of a morning call. while i stood thus in despair, conversing with a trio of friends upon the all absorbing subject of my heart, it so happened that the subject itself passed by. “as i live, there she is!” cried one. “surprisingly beautiful!” exclaimed a second. “an angel upon earth!” ejaculated a third. i looked; and in an open carriage which approached us, passing slowly down the street, sat the enchanting vision of the opera, accompanied by the younger lady who had occupied a portion of her box. “her companion also wears remarkably well,” said the one of my trio who had spoken first. “astonishingly,” said the second; “still quite a brilliant air, but art will do wonders. upon my word, she looks better than she did at paris five years ago. a beautiful woman still;--don’t you think so, froissart?--simpson, i mean.” “still!” said i, “and why shouldn’t she be? but compared with her friend she is as a rush-light to the evening star--a glow-worm to antares. “ha! ha! ha!--why, simpson, you have an astonishing tact at making discoveries--original ones, i mean.” and here we separated, while one of the trio began humming a gay vaudeville, of which i caught only the lines-- ninon, ninon, ninon a bas-- a bas ninon de l’enclos! during this little scene, however, one thing had served greatly to console me, although it fed the passion by which i was consumed. as the carriage of madame lalande rolled by our group, i had observed that she recognized me; and more than this, she had blessed me, by the most seraphic of all imaginable smiles, with no equivocal mark of the recognition. as for an introduction, i was obliged to abandon all hope of it until such time as talbot should think proper to return from the country. in the meantime i perseveringly frequented every reputable place of public amusement; and, at length, at the theatre, where i first saw her, i had the supreme bliss of meeting her, and of exchanging glances with her once again. this did not occur, however, until the lapse of a fortnight. every day, in the interim, i had inquired for talbot at his hotel, and every day had been thrown into a spasm of wrath by the everlasting “not come home yet” of his footman. upon the evening in question, therefore, i was in a condition little short of madness. madame lalande, i had been told, was a parisian--had lately arrived from paris--might she not suddenly return?--return before talbot came back--and might she not be thus lost to me forever? the thought was too terrible to bear. since my future happiness was at issue, i resolved to act with a manly decision. in a word, upon the breaking up of the play, i traced the lady to her residence, noted the address, and the next morning sent her a full and elaborate letter, in which i poured out my whole heart. i spoke boldly, freely--in a word, i spoke with passion. i concealed nothing--nothing even of my weakness. i alluded to the romantic circumstances of our first meeting--even to the glances which had passed between us. i went so far as to say that i felt assured of her love; while i offered this assurance, and my own intensity of devotion, as two excuses for my otherwise unpardonable conduct. as a third, i spoke of my fear that she might quit the city before i could have the opportunity of a formal introduction. i concluded the most wildly enthusiastic epistle ever penned, with a frank declaration of my worldly circumstances--of my affluence--and with an offer of my heart and of my hand. in an agony of expectation i awaited the reply. after what seemed the lapse of a century it came. yes, actually came. romantic as all this may appear, i really received a letter from madame lalande--the beautiful, the wealthy, the idolized madame lalande. her eyes--her magnificent eyes, had not belied her noble heart. like a true frenchwoman as she was she had obeyed the frank dictates of her reason--the generous impulses of her nature--despising the conventional pruderies of the world. she had not scorned my proposals. she had not sheltered herself in silence. she had not returned my letter unopened. she had even sent me, in reply, one penned by her own exquisite fingers. it ran thus: “monsieur simpson vill pardonne me for not compose de butefulle tong of his contree so vell as might. it is only de late dat i am arrive, and not yet ave do opportunite for to--l’etudier. “vid dis apologie for the maniere, i vill now say dat, helas!--monsieur simpson ave guess but de too true. need i say de more? helas! am i not ready speak de too moshe? “eugenie laland.” this noble--spirited note i kissed a million times, and committed, no doubt, on its account, a thousand other extravagances that have now escaped my memory. still talbot would not return. alas! could he have formed even the vaguest idea of the suffering his absence had occasioned his friend, would not his sympathizing nature have flown immediately to my relief? still, however, he came not. i wrote. he replied. he was detained by urgent business--but would shortly return. he begged me not to be impatient--to moderate my transports--to read soothing books--to drink nothing stronger than hock--and to bring the consolations of philosophy to my aid. the fool! if he could not come himself, why, in the name of every thing rational, could he not have enclosed me a letter of presentation? i wrote him again, entreating him to forward one forthwith. my letter was returned by that footman, with the following endorsement in pencil. the scoundrel had joined his master in the country: “left s---yesterday, for parts unknown--did not say where--or when be back--so thought best to return letter, knowing your handwriting, and as how you is always, more or less, in a hurry. “yours sincerely, “stubbs.” after this, it is needless to say, that i devoted to the infernal deities both master and valet:--but there was little use in anger, and no consolation at all in complaint. but i had yet a resource left, in my constitutional audacity. hitherto it had served me well, and i now resolved to make it avail me to the end. besides, after the correspondence which had passed between us, what act of mere informality could i commit, within bounds, that ought to be regarded as indecorous by madame lalande? since the affair of the letter, i had been in the habit of watching her house, and thus discovered that, about twilight, it was her custom to promenade, attended only by a negro in livery, in a public square overlooked by her windows. here, amid the luxuriant and shadowing groves, in the gray gloom of a sweet midsummer evening, i observed my opportunity and accosted her. the better to deceive the servant in attendance, i did this with the assured air of an old and familiar acquaintance. with a presence of mind truly parisian, she took the cue at once, and, to greet me, held out the most bewitchingly little of hands. the valet at once fell into the rear, and now, with hearts full to overflowing, we discoursed long and unreservedly of our love. as madame lalande spoke english even less fluently than she wrote it, our conversation was necessarily in french. in this sweet tongue, so adapted to passion, i gave loose to the impetuous enthusiasm of my nature, and, with all the eloquence i could command, besought her to consent to an immediate marriage. at this impatience she smiled. she urged the old story of decorum--that bug-bear which deters so many from bliss until the opportunity for bliss has forever gone by. i had most imprudently made it known among my friends, she observed, that i desired her acquaintance--thus that i did not possess it--thus, again, there was no possibility of concealing the date of our first knowledge of each other. and then she adverted, with a blush, to the extreme recency of this date. to wed immediately would be improper--would be indecorous--would be outre. all this she said with a charming air of naivete which enraptured while it grieved and convinced me. she went even so far as to accuse me, laughingly, of rashness--of imprudence. she bade me remember that i really even knew not who she was--what were her prospects, her connections, her standing in society. she begged me, but with a sigh, to reconsider my proposal, and termed my love an infatuation--a will o’ the wisp--a fancy or fantasy of the moment--a baseless and unstable creation rather of the imagination than of the heart. these things she uttered as the shadows of the sweet twilight gathered darkly and more darkly around us--and then, with a gentle pressure of her fairy-like hand, overthrew, in a single sweet instant, all the argumentative fabric she had reared. i replied as best i could--as only a true lover can. i spoke at length, and perseveringly of my devotion, of my passion--of her exceeding beauty, and of my own enthusiastic admiration. in conclusion, i dwelt, with a convincing energy, upon the perils that encompass the course of love--that course of true love that never did run smooth--and thus deduced the manifest danger of rendering that course unnecessarily long. this latter argument seemed finally to soften the rigor of her determination. she relented; but there was yet an obstacle, she said, which she felt assured i had not properly considered. this was a delicate point--for a woman to urge, especially so; in mentioning it, she saw that she must make a sacrifice of her feelings; still, for me, every sacrifice should be made. she alluded to the topic of age. was i aware--was i fully aware of the discrepancy between us? that the age of the husband, should surpass by a few years--even by fifteen or twenty--the age of the wife, was regarded by the world as admissible, and, indeed, as even proper, but she had always entertained the belief that the years of the wife should never exceed in number those of the husband. a discrepancy of this unnatural kind gave rise, too frequently, alas! to a life of unhappiness. now she was aware that my own age did not exceed two and twenty; and i, on the contrary, perhaps, was not aware that the years of my eugenie extended very considerably beyond that sum. about all this there was a nobility of soul--a dignity of candor--which delighted--which enchanted me--which eternally riveted my chains. i could scarcely restrain the excessive transport which possessed me. “my sweetest eugenie,” i cried, “what is all this about which you are discoursing? your years surpass in some measure my own. but what then? the customs of the world are so many conventional follies. to those who love as ourselves, in what respect differs a year from an hour? i am twenty-two, you say, granted: indeed, you may as well call me, at once, twenty-three. now you yourself, my dearest eugenie, can have numbered no more than--can have numbered no more than--no more than--than--than--than--” here i paused for an instant, in the expectation that madame lalande would interrupt me by supplying her true age. but a frenchwoman is seldom direct, and has always, by way of answer to an embarrassing query, some little practical reply of her own. in the present instance, eugenie, who for a few moments past had seemed to be searching for something in her bosom, at length let fall upon the grass a miniature, which i immediately picked up and presented to her. “keep it!” she said, with one of her most ravishing smiles. “keep it for my sake--for the sake of her whom it too flatteringly represents. besides, upon the back of the trinket you may discover, perhaps, the very information you seem to desire. it is now, to be sure, growing rather dark--but you can examine it at your leisure in the morning. in the meantime, you shall be my escort home to-night. my friends are about holding a little musical levee. i can promise you, too, some good singing. we french are not nearly so punctilious as you americans, and i shall have no difficulty in smuggling you in, in the character of an old acquaintance.” with this, she took my arm, and i attended her home. the mansion was quite a fine one, and, i believe, furnished in good taste. of this latter point, however, i am scarcely qualified to judge; for it was just dark as we arrived; and in american mansions of the better sort lights seldom, during the heat of summer, make their appearance at this, the most pleasant period of the day. in about an hour after my arrival, to be sure, a single shaded solar lamp was lit in the principal drawing-room; and this apartment, i could thus see, was arranged with unusual good taste and even splendor; but two other rooms of the suite, and in which the company chiefly assembled, remained, during the whole evening, in a very agreeable shadow. this is a well-conceived custom, giving the party at least a choice of light or shade, and one which our friends over the water could not do better than immediately adopt. the evening thus spent was unquestionably the most delicious of my life. madame lalande had not overrated the musical abilities of her friends; and the singing i here heard i had never heard excelled in any private circle out of vienna. the instrumental performers were many and of superior talents. the vocalists were chiefly ladies, and no individual sang less than well. at length, upon a peremptory call for “madame lalande,” she arose at once, without affectation or demur, from the chaise longue upon which she had sat by my side, and, accompanied by one or two gentlemen and her female friend of the opera, repaired to the piano in the main drawing-room. i would have escorted her myself, but felt that, under the circumstances of my introduction to the house, i had better remain unobserved where i was. i was thus deprived of the pleasure of seeing, although not of hearing, her sing. the impression she produced upon the company seemed electrical but the effect upon myself was something even more. i know not how adequately to describe it. it arose in part, no doubt, from the sentiment of love with which i was imbued; but chiefly from my conviction of the extreme sensibility of the singer. it is beyond the reach of art to endow either air or recitative with more impassioned expression than was hers. her utterance of the romance in otello--the tone with which she gave the words “sul mio sasso,” in the capuletti--is ringing in my memory yet. her lower tones were absolutely miraculous. her voice embraced three complete octaves, extending from the contralto d to the d upper soprano, and, though sufficiently powerful to have filled the san carlos, executed, with the minutest precision, every difficulty of vocal composition--ascending and descending scales, cadences, or fiorituri. in the final of the somnambula, she brought about a most remarkable effect at the words: ah! non guinge uman pensiero al contento ond ‘io son piena. here, in imitation of malibran, she modified the original phrase of bellini, so as to let her voice descend to the tenor g, when, by a rapid transition, she struck the g above the treble stave, springing over an interval of two octaves. upon rising from the piano after these miracles of vocal execution, she resumed her seat by my side; when i expressed to her, in terms of the deepest enthusiasm, my delight at her performance. of my surprise i said nothing, and yet was i most unfeignedly surprised; for a certain feebleness, or rather a certain tremulous indecision of voice in ordinary conversation, had prepared me to anticipate that, in singing, she would not acquit herself with any remarkable ability. our conversation was now long, earnest, uninterrupted, and totally unreserved. she made me relate many of the earlier passages of my life, and listened with breathless attention to every word of the narrative. i concealed nothing--felt that i had a right to conceal nothing--from her confiding affection. encouraged by her candor upon the delicate point of her age, i entered, with perfect frankness, not only into a detail of my many minor vices, but made full confession of those moral and even of those physical infirmities, the disclosure of which, in demanding so much higher a degree of courage, is so much surer an evidence of love. i touched upon my college indiscretions--upon my extravagances--upon my carousals--upon my debts--upon my flirtations. i even went so far as to speak of a slightly hectic cough with which, at one time, i had been troubled--of a chronic rheumatism--of a twinge of hereditary gout--and, in conclusion, of the disagreeable and inconvenient, but hitherto carefully concealed, weakness of my eyes. “upon this latter point,” said madame lalande, laughingly, “you have been surely injudicious in coming to confession; for, without the confession, i take it for granted that no one would have accused you of the crime. by the by,” she continued, “have you any recollection--” and here i fancied that a blush, even through the gloom of the apartment, became distinctly visible upon her cheek--“have you any recollection, mon cher ami of this little ocular assistant, which now depends from my neck?” as she spoke she twirled in her fingers the identical double eye-glass which had so overwhelmed me with confusion at the opera. “full well--alas! do i remember it,” i exclaimed, pressing passionately the delicate hand which offered the glasses for my inspection. they formed a complex and magnificent toy, richly chased and filigreed, and gleaming with jewels, which, even in the deficient light, i could not help perceiving were of high value. “eh bien! mon ami” she resumed with a certain empressment of manner that rather surprised me--“eh bien! mon ami, you have earnestly besought of me a favor which you have been pleased to denominate priceless. you have demanded of me my hand upon the morrow. should i yield to your entreaties--and, i may add, to the pleadings of my own bosom--would i not be entitled to demand of you a very--a very little boon in return?” “name it!” i exclaimed with an energy that had nearly drawn upon us the observation of the company, and restrained by their presence alone from throwing myself impetuously at her feet. “name it, my beloved, my eugenie, my own!--name it!--but, alas! it is already yielded ere named.” “you shall conquer, then, mon ami,” said she, “for the sake of the eugenie whom you love, this little weakness which you have at last confessed--this weakness more moral than physical--and which, let me assure you, is so unbecoming the nobility of your real nature--so inconsistent with the candor of your usual character--and which, if permitted further control, will assuredly involve you, sooner or later, in some very disagreeable scrape. you shall conquer, for my sake, this affectation which leads you, as you yourself acknowledge, to the tacit or implied denial of your infirmity of vision. for, this infirmity you virtually deny, in refusing to employ the customary means for its relief. you will understand me to say, then, that i wish you to wear spectacles;--ah, hush!--you have already consented to wear them, for my sake. you shall accept the little toy which i now hold in my hand, and which, though admirable as an aid to vision, is really of no very immense value as a gem. you perceive that, by a trifling modification thus--or thus--it can be adapted to the eyes in the form of spectacles, or worn in the waistcoat pocket as an eye-glass. it is in the former mode, however, and habitually, that you have already consented to wear it for my sake.” this request--must i confess it?--confused me in no little degree. but the condition with which it was coupled rendered hesitation, of course, a matter altogether out of the question. “it is done!” i cried, with all the enthusiasm that i could muster at the moment. “it is done--it is most cheerfully agreed. i sacrifice every feeling for your sake. to-night i wear this dear eye-glass, as an eye-glass, and upon my heart; but with the earliest dawn of that morning which gives me the pleasure of calling you wife, i will place it upon my--upon my nose,--and there wear it ever afterward, in the less romantic, and less fashionable, but certainly in the more serviceable, form which you desire.” our conversation now turned upon the details of our arrangements for the morrow. talbot, i learned from my betrothed, had just arrived in town. i was to see him at once, and procure a carriage. the soiree would scarcely break up before two; and by this hour the vehicle was to be at the door, when, in the confusion occasioned by the departure of the company, madame l. could easily enter it unobserved. we were then to call at the house of a clergyman who would be in waiting; there be married, drop talbot, and proceed on a short tour to the east, leaving the fashionable world at home to make whatever comments upon the matter it thought best. having planned all this, i immediately took leave, and went in search of talbot, but, on the way, i could not refrain from stepping into a hotel, for the purpose of inspecting the miniature; and this i did by the powerful aid of the glasses. the countenance was a surpassingly beautiful one! those large luminous eyes!--that proud grecian nose!--those dark luxuriant curls!--“ah!” said i, exultingly to myself, “this is indeed the speaking image of my beloved!” i turned the reverse, and discovered the words--“eugenie lalande--aged twenty-seven years and seven months.” i found talbot at home, and proceeded at once to acquaint him with my good fortune. he professed excessive astonishment, of course, but congratulated me most cordially, and proffered every assistance in his power. in a word, we carried out our arrangement to the letter, and, at two in the morning, just ten minutes after the ceremony, i found myself in a close carriage with madame lalande--with mrs. simpson, i should say--and driving at a great rate out of town, in a direction northeast by north, half-north. it had been determined for us by talbot, that, as we were to be up all night, we should make our first stop at c--, a village about twenty miles from the city, and there get an early breakfast and some repose, before proceeding upon our route. at four precisely, therefore, the carriage drew up at the door of the principal inn. i handed my adored wife out, and ordered breakfast forthwith. in the meantime we were shown into a small parlor, and sat down. it was now nearly if not altogether daylight; and, as i gazed, enraptured, at the angel by my side, the singular idea came, all at once, into my head, that this was really the very first moment since my acquaintance with the celebrated loveliness of madame lalande, that i had enjoyed a near inspection of that loveliness by daylight at all. “and now, mon ami,” said she, taking my hand, and so interrupting this train of reflection, “and now, mon cher ami, since we are indissolubly one--since i have yielded to your passionate entreaties, and performed my portion of our agreement--i presume you have not forgotten that you also have a little favor to bestow--a little promise which it is your intention to keep. ah! let me see! let me remember! yes; full easily do i call to mind the precise words of the dear promise you made to eugenie last night. listen! you spoke thus: ‘it is done!--it is most cheerfully agreed! i sacrifice every feeling for your sake. to-night i wear this dear eye-glass as an eye-glass, and upon my heart; but with the earliest dawn of that morning which gives me the privilege of calling you wife, i will place it upon my--upon my nose,--and there wear it ever afterward, in the less romantic, and less fashionable, but certainly in the more serviceable, form which you desire.’ these were the exact words, my beloved husband, were they not?” “they were,” i said; “you have an excellent memory; and assuredly, my beautiful eugenie, there is no disposition on my part to evade the performance of the trivial promise they imply. see! behold! they are becoming--rather--are they not?” and here, having arranged the glasses in the ordinary form of spectacles, i applied them gingerly in their proper position; while madame simpson, adjusting her cap, and folding her arms, sat bolt upright in her chair, in a somewhat stiff and prim, and indeed, in a somewhat undignified position. “goodness gracious me!” i exclaimed, almost at the very instant that the rim of the spectacles had settled upon my nose--“my goodness gracious me!--why, what can be the matter with these glasses?” and taking them quickly off, i wiped them carefully with a silk handkerchief, and adjusted them again. but if, in the first instance, there had occurred something which occasioned me surprise, in the second, this surprise became elevated into astonishment; and this astonishment was profound--was extreme--indeed i may say it was horrific. what, in the name of everything hideous, did this mean? could i believe my eyes?--could i?--that was the question. was that--was that--was that rouge? and were those--and were those--were those wrinkles, upon the visage of eugenie lalande? and oh! jupiter, and every one of the gods and goddesses, little and big! what--what--what--what had become of her teeth? i dashed the spectacles violently to the ground, and, leaping to my feet, stood erect in the middle of the floor, confronting mrs. simpson, with my arms set a-kimbo, and grinning and foaming, but, at the same time, utterly speechless with terror and with rage. now i have already said that madame eugenie lalande--that is to say, simpson--spoke the english language but very little better than she wrote it, and for this reason she very properly never attempted to speak it upon ordinary occasions. but rage will carry a lady to any extreme; and in the present care it carried mrs. simpson to the very extraordinary extreme of attempting to hold a conversation in a tongue that she did not altogether understand. “vell, monsieur,” said she, after surveying me, in great apparent astonishment, for some moments--“vell, monsieur?--and vat den?--vat de matter now? is it de dance of de saint itusse dat you ave? if not like me, vat for vy buy de pig in the poke?” “you wretch!” said i, catching my breath--“you--you--you villainous old hag!” “ag?--ole?--me not so ver ole, after all! me not one single day more dan de eighty-doo.” “eighty-two!” i ejaculated, staggering to the wall--“eighty-two hundred thousand baboons! the miniature said twenty-seven years and seven months!” “to be sure!--dat is so!--ver true! but den de portraite has been take for dese fifty-five year. ven i go marry my segonde usbande, monsieur lalande, at dat time i had de portraite take for my daughter by my first usbande, monsieur moissart!” “moissart!” said i. “yes, moissart,” said she, mimicking my pronunciation, which, to speak the truth, was none of the best,--“and vat den? vat you know about de moissart?” “nothing, you old fright!--i know nothing about him at all; only i had an ancestor of that name, once upon a time.” “dat name! and vat you ave for say to dat name? ‘tis ver goot name; and so is voissart--dat is ver goot name too. my daughter, mademoiselle moissart, she marry von monsieur voissart,--and de name is bot ver respectaable name.” “moissart?” i exclaimed, “and voissart! why, what is it you mean?” “vat i mean?--i mean moissart and voissart; and for de matter of dat, i mean croissart and froisart, too, if i only tink proper to mean it. my daughter’s daughter, mademoiselle voissart, she marry von monsieur croissart, and den again, my daughter’s grande daughter, mademoiselle croissart, she marry von monsieur froissart; and i suppose you say dat dat is not von ver respectaable name.-” “froissart!” said i, beginning to faint, “why, surely you don’t say moissart, and voissart, and croissart, and froissart?” “yes,” she replied, leaning fully back in her chair, and stretching out her lower limbs at great length; “yes, moissart, and voissart, and croissart, and froissart. but monsieur froissart, he vas von ver big vat you call fool--he vas von ver great big donce like yourself--for he lef la belle france for come to dis stupide amerique--and ven he get here he went and ave von ver stupide, von ver, ver stupide sonn, so i hear, dough i not yet av ad de plaisir to meet vid him--neither me nor my companion, de madame stephanie lalande. he is name de napoleon bonaparte froissart, and i suppose you say dat dat, too, is not von ver respectable name.” either the length or the nature of this speech, had the effect of working up mrs. simpson into a very extraordinary passion indeed; and as she made an end of it, with great labor, she lumped up from her chair like somebody bewitched, dropping upon the floor an entire universe of bustle as she lumped. once upon her feet, she gnashed her gums, brandished her arms, rolled up her sleeves, shook her fist in my face, and concluded the performance by tearing the cap from her head, and with it an immense wig of the most valuable and beautiful black hair, the whole of which she dashed upon the ground with a yell, and there trammpled and danced a fandango upon it, in an absolute ecstasy and agony of rage. meantime i sank aghast into the chair which she had vacated. “moissart and voissart!” i repeated, thoughtfully, as she cut one of her pigeon-wings, and “croissart and froissart!” as she completed another--“moissart and voissart and croissart and napoleon bonaparte froissart!--why, you ineffable old serpent, that’s me--that’s me--d’ye hear? that’s me”--here i screamed at the top of my voice--“that’s me-e-e! i am napoleon bonaparte froissart! and if i havn’t married my great, great, grandmother, i wish i may be everlastingly confounded!” madame eugenie lalande, quasi simpson--formerly moissart--was, in sober fact, my great, great, grandmother. in her youth she had been beautiful, and even at eighty-two, retained the majestic height, the sculptural contour of head, the fine eyes and the grecian nose of her girlhood. by the aid of these, of pearl-powder, of rouge, of false hair, false teeth, and false tournure, as well as of the most skilful modistes of paris, she contrived to hold a respectable footing among the beauties en peu passees of the french metropolis. in this respect, indeed, she might have been regarded as little less than the equal of the celebrated ninon de l’enclos. she was immensely wealthy, and being left, for the second time, a widow without children, she bethought herself of my existence in america, and for the purpose of making me her heir, paid a visit to the united states, in company with a distant and exceedingly lovely relative of her second husband’s--a madame stephanie lalande. at the opera, my great, great, grandmother’s attention was arrested by my notice; and, upon surveying me through her eye-glass, she was struck with a certain family resemblance to herself. thus interested, and knowing that the heir she sought was actually in the city, she made inquiries of her party respecting me. the gentleman who attended her knew my person, and told her who i was. the information thus obtained induced her to renew her scrutiny; and this scrutiny it was which so emboldened me that i behaved in the absurd manner already detailed. she returned my bow, however, under the impression that, by some odd accident, i had discovered her identity. when, deceived by my weakness of vision, and the arts of the toilet, in respect to the age and charms of the strange lady, i demanded so enthusiastically of talbot who she was, he concluded that i meant the younger beauty, as a matter of course, and so informed me, with perfect truth, that she was “the celebrated widow, madame lalande.” in the street, next morning, my great, great, grandmother encountered talbot, an old parisian acquaintance; and the conversation, very naturally turned upon myself. my deficiencies of vision were then explained; for these were notorious, although i was entirely ignorant of their notoriety, and my good old relative discovered, much to her chagrin, that she had been deceived in supposing me aware of her identity, and that i had been merely making a fool of myself in making open love, in a theatre, to an old woman unknown. by way of punishing me for this imprudence, she concocted with talbot a plot. he purposely kept out of my way to avoid giving me the introduction. my street inquiries about “the lovely widow, madame lalande,” were supposed to refer to the younger lady, of course, and thus the conversation with the three gentlemen whom i encountered shortly after leaving talbot’s hotel will be easily explained, as also their allusion to ninon de l’enclos. i had no opportunity of seeing madame lalande closely during daylight; and, at her musical soiree, my silly weakness in refusing the aid of glasses effectually prevented me from making a discovery of her age. when “madame lalande” was called upon to sing, the younger lady was intended; and it was she who arose to obey the call; my great, great, grandmother, to further the deception, arising at the same moment and accompanying her to the piano in the main drawing-room. had i decided upon escorting her thither, it had been her design to suggest the propriety of my remaining where i was; but my own prudential views rendered this unnecessary. the songs which i so much admired, and which so confirmed my impression of the youth of my mistress, were executed by madame stephanie lalande. the eyeglass was presented by way of adding a reproof to the hoax--a sting to the epigram of the deception. its presentation afforded an opportunity for the lecture upon affectation with which i was so especially edified. it is almost superfluous to add that the glasses of the instrument, as worn by the old lady, had been exchanged by her for a pair better adapted to my years. they suited me, in fact, to a t. the clergyman, who merely pretended to tie the fatal knot, was a boon companion of talbot’s, and no priest. he was an excellent “whip,” however; and having doffed his cassock to put on a great-coat, he drove the hack which conveyed the “happy couple” out of town. talbot took a seat at his side. the two scoundrels were thus “in at the death,” and through a half-open window of the back parlor of the inn, amused themselves in grinning at the denouement of the drama. i believe i shall be forced to call them both out. nevertheless, i am not the husband of my great, great, grandmother; and this is a reflection which affords me infinite relief,--but i am the husband of madame lalande--of madame stephanie lalande--with whom my good old relative, besides making me her sole heir when she dies--if she ever does--has been at the trouble of concocting me a match. in conclusion: i am done forever with billets doux and am never to be met without spectacles. king pest. a tale containing an allegory. the gods do bear and will allow in kings the things which they abhor in rascal routes. _buckhurst’s tragedy of ferrex and porrex._ about twelve o’clock, one night in the month of october, and during the chivalrous reign of the third edward, two seamen belonging to the crew of the “free and easy,” a trading schooner plying between sluys and the thames, and then at anchor in that river, were much astonished to find themselves seated in the tap-room of an ale-house in the parish of st. andrews, london--which ale-house bore for sign the portraiture of a “jolly tar.” the room, although ill-contrived, smoke-blackened, low-pitched, and in every other respect agreeing with the general character of such places at the period--was, nevertheless, in the opinion of the grotesque groups scattered here and there within it, sufficiently well adapted to its purpose. of these groups our two seamen formed, i think, the most interesting, if not the most conspicuous. the one who appeared to be the elder, and whom his companion addressed by the characteristic appellation of “legs,” was at the same time much the taller of the two. he might have measured six feet and a half, and an habitual stoop in the shoulders seemed to have been the necessary consequence of an altitude so enormous.--superfluities in height were, however, more than accounted for by deficiencies in other respects. he was exceedingly thin; and might, as his associates asserted, have answered, when drunk, for a pennant at the mast-head, or, when sober, have served for a jib-boom. but these jests, and others of a similar nature, had evidently produced, at no time, any effect upon the cachinnatory muscles of the tar. with high cheek-bones, a large hawk-nose, retreating chin, fallen under-jaw, and huge protruding white eyes, the expression of his countenance, although tinged with a species of dogged indifference to matters and things in general, was not the less utterly solemn and serious beyond all attempts at imitation or description. the younger seaman was, in all outward appearance, the converse of his companion. his stature could not have exceeded four feet. a pair of stumpy bow-legs supported his squat, unwieldy figure, while his unusually short and thick arms, with no ordinary fists at their extremities, swung off dangling from his sides like the fins of a sea-turtle. small eyes, of no particular color, twinkled far back in his head. his nose remained buried in the mass of flesh which enveloped his round, full, and purple face; and his thick upper-lip rested upon the still thicker one beneath with an air of complacent self-satisfaction, much heightened by the owner’s habit of licking them at intervals. he evidently regarded his tall shipmate with a feeling half-wondrous, half-quizzical; and stared up occasionally in his face as the red setting sun stares up at the crags of ben nevis. various and eventful, however, had been the peregrinations of the worthy couple in and about the different tap-houses of the neighbourhood during the earlier hours of the night. funds even the most ample, are not always everlasting: and it was with empty pockets our friends had ventured upon the present hostelrie. at the precise period, then, when this history properly commences, legs, and his fellow hugh tarpaulin, sat, each with both elbows resting upon the large oaken table in the middle of the floor, and with a hand upon either cheek. they were eyeing, from behind a huge flagon of unpaid-for “humming-stuff,” the portentous words, “no chalk,” which to their indignation and astonishment were scored over the doorway by means of that very mineral whose presence they purported to deny. not that the gift of decyphering written characters--a gift among the commonalty of that day considered little less cabalistical than the art of inditing--could, in strict justice, have been laid to the charge of either disciple of the sea; but there was, to say the truth, a certain twist in the formation of the letters--an indescribable lee-lurch about the whole--which foreboded, in the opinion of both seamen, a long run of dirty weather; and determined them at once, in the allegorical words of legs himself, to “pump ship, clew up all sail, and scud before the wind.” having accordingly disposed of what remained of the ale, and looped up the points of their short doublets, they finally made a bolt for the street. although tarpaulin rolled twice into the fire-place, mistaking it for the door, yet their escape was at length happily effected--and half after twelve o’clock found our heroes ripe for mischief, and running for life down a dark alley in the direction of st. andrew’s stair, hotly pursued by the landlady of the “jolly tar.” at the epoch of this eventful tale, and periodically, for many years before and after, all england, but more especially the metropolis, resounded with the fearful cry of “plague!” the city was in a great measure depopulated--and in those horrible regions, in the vicinity of the thames, where amid the dark, narrow, and filthy lanes and alleys, the demon of disease was supposed to have had his nativity, awe, terror, and superstition were alone to be found stalking abroad. by authority of the king such districts were placed under ban, and all persons forbidden, under pain of death, to intrude upon their dismal solitude. yet neither the mandate of the monarch, nor the huge barriers erected at the entrances of the streets, nor the prospect of that loathsome death which, with almost absolute certainty, overwhelmed the wretch whom no peril could deter from the adventure, prevented the unfurnished and untenanted dwellings from being stripped, by the hand of nightly rapine, of every article, such as iron, brass, or lead-work, which could in any manner be turned to a profitable account. above all, it was usually found, upon the annual winter opening of the barriers, that locks, bolts, and secret cellars, had proved but slender protection to those rich stores of wines and liquors which, in consideration of the risk and trouble of removal, many of the numerous dealers having shops in the neighbourhood had consented to trust, during the period of exile, to so insufficient a security. but there were very few of the terror-stricken people who attributed these doings to the agency of human hands. pest-spirits, plague-goblins, and fever-demons, were the popular imps of mischief; and tales so blood-chilling were hourly told, that the whole mass of forbidden buildings was, at length, enveloped in terror as in a shroud, and the plunderer himself was often scared away by the horrors his own depreciations had created; leaving the entire vast circuit of prohibited district to gloom, silence, pestilence, and death. it was by one of the terrific barriers already mentioned, and which indicated the region beyond to be under the pest-ban, that, in scrambling down an alley, legs and the worthy hugh tarpaulin found their progress suddenly impeded. to return was out of the question, and no time was to be lost, as their pursuers were close upon their heels. with thorough-bred seamen to clamber up the roughly fashioned plank-work was a trifle; and, maddened with the twofold excitement of exercise and liquor, they leaped unhesitatingly down within the enclosure, and holding on their drunken course with shouts and yellings, were soon bewildered in its noisome and intricate recesses. had they not, indeed, been intoxicated beyond moral sense, their reeling footsteps must have been palsied by the horrors of their situation. the air was cold and misty. the paving-stones, loosened from their beds, lay in wild disorder amid the tall, rank grass, which sprang up around the feet and ankles. fallen houses choked up the streets. the most fetid and poisonous smells everywhere prevailed;--and by the aid of that ghastly light which, even at midnight, never fails to emanate from a vapory and pestilential atmosphere, might be discerned lying in the by-paths and alleys, or rotting in the windowless habitations, the carcass of many a nocturnal plunderer arrested by the hand of the plague in the very perpetration of his robbery. --but it lay not in the power of images, or sensations, or impediments such as these, to stay the course of men who, naturally brave, and at that time especially, brimful of courage and of “humming-stuff!” would have reeled, as straight as their condition might have permitted, undauntedly into the very jaws of death. onward--still onward stalked the grim legs, making the desolate solemnity echo and re-echo with yells like the terrific war-whoop of the indian: and onward, still onward rolled the dumpy tarpaulin, hanging on to the doublet of his more active companion, and far surpassing the latter’s most strenuous exertions in the way of vocal music, by bull-roarings in basso, from the profundity of his stentorian lungs. they had now evidently reached the strong hold of the pestilence. their way at every step or plunge grew more noisome and more horrible--the paths more narrow and more intricate. huge stones and beams falling momently from the decaying roofs above them, gave evidence, by their sullen and heavy descent, of the vast height of the surrounding houses; and while actual exertion became necessary to force a passage through frequent heaps of rubbish, it was by no means seldom that the hand fell upon a skeleton or rested upon a more fleshly corpse. suddenly, as the seamen stumbled against the entrance of a tall and ghastly-looking building, a yell more than usually shrill from the throat of the excited legs, was replied to from within, in a rapid succession of wild, laughter-like, and fiendish shrieks. nothing daunted at sounds which, of such a nature, at such a time, and in such a place, might have curdled the very blood in hearts less irrevocably on fire, the drunken couple rushed headlong against the door, burst it open, and staggered into the midst of things with a volley of curses. the room within which they found themselves proved to be the shop of an undertaker; but an open trap-door, in a corner of the floor near the entrance, looked down upon a long range of wine-cellars, whose depths the occasional sound of bursting bottles proclaimed to be well stored with their appropriate contents. in the middle of the room stood a table--in the centre of which again arose a huge tub of what appeared to be punch. bottles of various wines and cordials, together with jugs, pitchers, and flagons of every shape and quality, were scattered profusely upon the board. around it, upon coffin-tressels, was seated a company of six. this company i will endeavor to delineate one by one. fronting the entrance, and elevated a little above his companions, sat a personage who appeared to be the president of the table. his stature was gaunt and tall, and legs was confounded to behold in him a figure more emaciated than himself. his face was as yellow as saffron--but no feature excepting one alone, was sufficiently marked to merit a particular description. this one consisted in a forehead so unusually and hideously lofty, as to have the appearance of a bonnet or crown of flesh superadded upon the natural head. his mouth was puckered and dimpled into an expression of ghastly affability, and his eyes, as indeed the eyes of all at table, were glazed over with the fumes of intoxication. this gentleman was clothed from head to foot in a richly-embroidered black silk-velvet pall, wrapped negligently around his form after the fashion of a spanish cloak.--his head was stuck full of sable hearse-plumes, which he nodded to and fro with a jaunty and knowing air; and, in his right hand, he held a huge human thigh-bone, with which he appeared to have been just knocking down some member of the company for a song. opposite him, and with her back to the door, was a lady of no whit the less extraordinary character. although quite as tall as the person just described, she had no right to complain of his unnatural emaciation. she was evidently in the last stage of a dropsy; and her figure resembled nearly that of the huge puncheon of october beer which stood, with the head driven in, close by her side, in a corner of the chamber. her face was exceedingly round, red, and full; and the same peculiarity, or rather want of peculiarity, attached itself to her countenance, which i before mentioned in the case of the president--that is to say, only one feature of her face was sufficiently distinguished to need a separate characterization: indeed the acute tarpaulin immediately observed that the same remark might have applied to each individual person of the party; every one of whom seemed to possess a monopoly of some particular portion of physiognomy. with the lady in question this portion proved to be the mouth. commencing at the right ear, it swept with a terrific chasm to the left--the short pendants which she wore in either auricle continually bobbing into the aperture. she made, however, every exertion to keep her mouth closed and look dignified, in a dress consisting of a newly starched and ironed shroud coming up close under her chin, with a crimpled ruffle of cambric muslin. at her right hand sat a diminutive young lady whom she appeared to patronise. this delicate little creature, in the trembling of her wasted fingers, in the livid hue of her lips, and in the slight hectic spot which tinged her otherwise leaden complexion, gave evident indications of a galloping consumption. an air of gave extreme haut ton, however, pervaded her whole appearance; she wore in a graceful and degage manner, a large and beautiful winding-sheet of the finest india lawn; her hair hung in ringlets over her neck; a soft smile played about her mouth; but her nose, extremely long, thin, sinuous, flexible and pimpled, hung down far below her under lip, and in spite of the delicate manner in which she now and then moved it to one side or the other with her tongue, gave to her countenance a somewhat equivocal expression. over against her, and upon the left of the dropsical lady, was seated a little puffy, wheezing, and gouty old man, whose cheeks reposed upon the shoulders of their owner, like two huge bladders of oporto wine. with his arms folded, and with one bandaged leg deposited upon the table, he seemed to think himself entitled to some consideration. he evidently prided himself much upon every inch of his personal appearance, but took more especial delight in calling attention to his gaudy-colored surtout. this, to say the truth, must have cost him no little money, and was made to fit him exceedingly well--being fashioned from one of the curiously embroidered silken covers appertaining to those glorious escutcheons which, in england and elsewhere, are customarily hung up, in some conspicuous place, upon the dwellings of departed aristocracy. next to him, and at the right hand of the president, was a gentleman in long white hose and cotton drawers. his frame shook, in a ridiculous manner, with a fit of what tarpaulin called “the horrors.” his jaws, which had been newly shaved, were tightly tied up by a bandage of muslin; and his arms being fastened in a similar way at the wrists, i prevented him from helping himself too freely to the liquors upon the table; a precaution rendered necessary, in the opinion of legs, by the peculiarly sottish and wine-bibbing cast of his visage. a pair of prodigious ears, nevertheless, which it was no doubt found impossible to confine, towered away into the atmosphere of the apartment, and were occasionally pricked up in a spasm, at the sound of the drawing of a cork. fronting him, sixthly and lastly, was situated a singularly stiff-looking personage, who, being afflicted with paralysis, must, to speak seriously, have felt very ill at ease in his unaccommodating habiliments. he was habited, somewhat uniquely, in a new and handsome mahogany coffin. its top or head-piece pressed upon the skull of the wearer, and extended over it in the fashion of a hood, giving to the entire face an air of indescribable interest. arm-holes had been cut in the sides, for the sake not more of elegance than of convenience; but the dress, nevertheless, prevented its proprietor from sitting as erect as his associates; and as he lay reclining against his tressel, at an angle of forty-five degrees, a pair of huge goggle eyes rolled up their awful whites towards the ceiling in absolute amazement at their own enormity. before each of the party lay a portion of a skull, which was used as a drinking cup. overhead was suspended a human skeleton, by means of a rope tied round one of the legs and fastened to a ring in the ceiling. the other limb, confined by no such fetter, stuck off from the body at right angles, causing the whole loose and rattling frame to dangle and twirl about at the caprice of every occasional puff of wind which found its way into the apartment. in the cranium of this hideous thing lay quantity of ignited charcoal, which threw a fitful but vivid light over the entire scene; while coffins, and other wares appertaining to the shop of an undertaker, were piled high up around the room, and against the windows, preventing any ray from escaping into the street. at sight of this extraordinary assembly, and of their still more extraordinary paraphernalia, our two seamen did not conduct themselves with that degree of decorum which might have been expected. legs, leaning against the wall near which he happened to be standing, dropped his lower jaw still lower than usual, and spread open his eyes to their fullest extent: while hugh tarpaulin, stooping down so as to bring his nose upon a level with the table, and spreading out a palm upon either knee, burst into a long, loud, and obstreperous roar of very ill-timed and immoderate laughter. without, however, taking offence at behaviour so excessively rude, the tall president smiled very graciously upon the intruders--nodded to them in a dignified manner with his head of sable plumes--and, arising, took each by an arm, and led him to a seat which some others of the company had placed in the meantime for his accommodation. legs to all this offered not the slightest resistance, but sat down as he was directed; while the gallant hugh, removing his coffin tressel from its station near the head of the table, to the vicinity of the little consumptive lady in the winding sheet, plumped down by her side in high glee, and pouring out a skull of red wine, quaffed it to their better acquaintance. but at this presumption the stiff gentleman in the coffin seemed exceedingly nettled; and serious consequences might have ensued, had not the president, rapping upon the table with his truncheon, diverted the attention of all present to the following speech: “it becomes our duty upon the present happy occasion”-- “avast there!” interrupted legs, looking very serious, “avast there a bit, i say, and tell us who the devil ye all are, and what business ye have here, rigged off like the foul fiends, and swilling the snug blue ruin stowed away for the winter by my honest shipmate, will wimble the undertaker!” at this unpardonable piece of ill-breeding, all the original company half started to their feet, and uttered the same rapid succession of wild fiendish shrieks which had before caught the attention of the seamen. the president, however, was the first to recover his composure, and at length, turning to legs with great dignity, recommenced: “most willingly will we gratify any reasonable curiosity on the part of guests so illustrious, unbidden though they be. know then that in these dominions i am monarch, and here rule with undivided empire under the title of ‘king pest the first.’ “this apartment, which you no doubt profanely suppose to be the shop of will wimble the undertaker--a man whom we know not, and whose plebeian appellation has never before this night thwarted our royal ears--this apartment, i say, is the dais-chamber of our palace, devoted to the councils of our kingdom, and to other sacred and lofty purposes. “the noble lady who sits opposite is queen pest, our serene consort. the other exalted personages whom you behold are all of our family, and wear the insignia of the blood royal under the respective titles of ‘his grace the arch duke pest-iferous’--‘his grace the duke pest-ilential’--‘his grace the duke tem-pest’--and ‘her serene highness the arch duchess ana-pest.’ “as regards,” continued he, “your demand of the business upon which we sit here in council, we might be pardoned for replying that it concerns, and concerns alone, our own private and regal interest, and is in no manner important to any other than ourself. but in consideration of those rights to which as guests and strangers you may feel yourselves entitled, we will furthermore explain that we are here this night, prepared by deep research and accurate investigation, to examine, analyze, and thoroughly determine the indefinable spirit--the incomprehensible qualities and nature--of those inestimable treasures of the palate, the wines, ales, and liqueurs of this goodly metropolis: by so doing to advance not more our own designs than the true welfare of that unearthly sovereign whose reign is over us all, whose dominions are unlimited, and whose name is ‘death’.” “whose name is davy jones!” ejaculated tarpaulin, helping the lady by his side to a skull of liqueur, and pouring out a second for himself. “profane varlet!” said the president, now turning his attention to the worthy hugh, “profane and execrable wretch!--we have said, that in consideration of those rights which, even in thy filthy person, we feel no inclination to violate, we have condescended to make reply to thy rude and unseasonable inquiries. we nevertheless, for your unhallowed intrusion upon our councils, believe it our duty to mulct thee and thy companion in each a gallon of black strap--having imbibed which to the prosperity of our kingdom--at a single draught--and upon your bended knees--ye shall be forthwith free either to proceed upon your way, or remain and be admitted to the privileges of our table, according to your respective and individual pleasures.” “it would be a matter of utter impossibility,” replied legs, whom the assumptions and dignity of king pest the first had evidently inspired some feelings of respect, and who arose and steadied himself by the table as he spoke--“it would, please your majesty, be a matter of utter impossibility to stow away in my hold even one-fourth part of the same liquor which your majesty has just mentioned. to say nothing of the stuffs placed on board in the forenoon by way of ballast, and not to mention the various ales and liqueurs shipped this evening at different sea-ports, i have, at present, a full cargo of ‘humming stuff’ taken in and duly paid for at the sign of the ‘jolly tar.’ you will, therefore, please your majesty, be so good as to take the will for the deed--for by no manner of means either can i or will i swallow another drop--least of all a drop of that villainous bilge-water that answers to the hall of ‘black strap.’” “belay that!” interrupted tarpaulin, astonished not more at the length of his companion’s speech than at the nature of his refusal--“belay that you tubber!--and i say, legs, none of your palaver! my hull is still light, although i confess you yourself seem to be a little top-heavy; and as for the matter of your share of the cargo, why rather than raise a squall i would find stowageroom for it myself, but”-- “this proceeding,” interposed the president, “is by no means in accordance with the terms of the mulct or sentence, which is in its nature median, and not to be altered or recalled. the conditions we have imposed must be fulfilled to the letter, and that without a moment’s hesitation--in failure of which fulfilment we decree that you do here be tied neck and heels together, and duly drowned as rebels in yon hogshead of october beer!” “a sentence!--a sentence!--a righteous and just sentence!--a glorious decree!--a most worthy and upright, and holy condemnation!” shouted the pest family altogether. the king elevated his forehead into innumerable wrinkles; the gouty little old man puffed like a pair of bellows; the lady of the winding sheet waved her nose to and fro; the gentleman in the cotton drawers pricked up his ears; she of the shroud gasped like a dying fish; and he of the coffin looked stiff and rolled up his eyes. “ugh! ugh! ugh!” chuckled tarpaulin without heeding the general excitation, “ugh! ugh! ugh!--ugh! ugh! ugh!--ugh! ugh! ugh!--i was saying,” said he, “i was saying when mr. king pest poked in his marlin-spike, that as for the matter of two or three gallons more or less of black strap, it was a trifle to a tight sea-boat like myself not overstowed--but when it comes to drinking the health of the devil (whom god assoilzie) and going down upon my marrow bones to his ill-favored majesty there, whom i know, as well as i know myself to be a sinner, to be nobody in the whole world, but tim hurlygurly the stage-player--why! it’s quite another guess sort of a thing, and utterly and altogether past my comprehension.” he was not allowed to finish this speech in tranquillity. at the name tim hurlygurly the whole assembly leaped from their name seats. “treason!” shouted his majesty king pest the first. “treason!” said the little man with the gout. “treason!” screamed the arch duchess ana-pest. “treason!” muttered the gentleman with his jaws tied up. “treason!” growled he of the coffin. “treason! treason!” shrieked her majesty of the mouth; and, seizing by the hinder part of his breeches the unfortunate tarpaulin, who had just commenced pouring out for himself a skull of liqueur, she lifted him high into the air, and let him fall without ceremony into the huge open puncheon of his beloved ale. bobbing up and down, for a few seconds, like an apple in a bowl of toddy, he, at length, finally disappeared amid the whirlpool of foam which, in the already effervescent liquor, his struggles easily succeeded in creating. not tamely, however, did the tall seaman behold the discomfiture of his companion. jostling king pest through the open trap, the valiant legs slammed the door down upon him with an oath, and strode towards the centre of the room. here tearing down the skeleton which swung over the table, he laid it about him with so much energy and good will, that, as the last glimpses of light died away within the apartment, he succeeded in knocking out the brains of the little gentleman with the gout. rushing then with all his force against the fatal hogshead full of october ale and hugh tarpaulin, he rolled it over and over in an instant. out burst a deluge of liquor so fierce--so impetuous--so overwhelming--that the room was flooded from wall to wall--the loaded table was overturned--the tressels were thrown upon their backs--the tub of punch into the fire-place--and the ladies into hysterics. piles of death-furniture floundered about. jugs, pitchers, and carboys mingled promiscuously in the melee, and wicker flagons encountered desperately with bottles of junk. the man with the horrors was drowned upon the spot-the little stiff gentleman floated off in his coffin--and the victorious legs, seizing by the waist the fat lady in the shroud, rushed out with her into the street, and made a bee-line for the “free and easy,” followed under easy sail by the redoubtable hugh tarpaulin, who, having sneezed three or four times, panted and puffed after him with the arch duchess ana-pest. three sundays in a week “you hard-headed, dunder-headed, obstinate, rusty, crusty, musty, fusty, old savage!” said i, in fancy, one afternoon, to my grand uncle rumgudgeon--shaking my fist at him in imagination. only in imagination. the fact is, some trivial discrepancy did exist, just then, between what i said and what i had not the courage to say--between what i did and what i had half a mind to do. the old porpoise, as i opened the drawing-room door, was sitting with his feet upon the mantel-piece, and a bumper of port in his paw, making strenuous efforts to accomplish the ditty. remplis ton verre vide! vide ton verre plein! “my dear uncle,” said i, closing the door gently, and approaching him with the blandest of smiles, “you are always so very kind and considerate, and have evinced your benevolence in so many--so very many ways--that--that i feel i have only to suggest this little point to you once more to make sure of your full acquiescence.” “hem!” said he, “good boy! go on!” “i am sure, my dearest uncle (you confounded old rascal!), that you have no design really, seriously, to oppose my union with kate. this is merely a joke of yours, i know--ha! ha! ha!--how very pleasant you are at times.” “ha! ha! ha!” said he, “curse you! yes!” “to be sure--of course! i knew you were jesting. now, uncle, all that kate and myself wish at present, is that you would oblige us with your advice as--as regards the time--you know, uncle--in short, when will it be most convenient for yourself, that the wedding shall--shall come off, you know?” “come off, you scoundrel!--what do you mean by that?--better wait till it goes on.” “ha! ha! ha!--he! he! he!--hi! hi! hi!--ho! ho! ho!--hu! hu! hu!--that’s good!--oh that’s capital--such a wit! but all we want just now, you know, uncle, is that you would indicate the time precisely.” “ah!--precisely?” “yes, uncle--that is, if it would be quite agreeable to yourself.” “wouldn’t it answer, bobby, if i were to leave it at random--some time within a year or so, for example?--must i say precisely?” “if you please, uncle--precisely.” “well, then, bobby, my boy--you’re a fine fellow, aren’t you?--since you will have the exact time i’ll--why i’ll oblige you for once:” “dear uncle!” “hush, sir!” (drowning my voice)--“i’ll oblige you for once. you shall have my consent--and the plum, we mus’n’t forget the plum--let me see! when shall it be? to-day’s sunday--isn’t it? well, then, you shall be married precisely--precisely, now mind!--when three sundays come together in a week! do you hear me, sir! what are you gaping at? i say, you shall have kate and her plum when three sundays come together in a week--but not till then--you young scapegrace--not till then, if i die for it. you know me--i’m a man of my word--now be off!” here he swallowed his bumper of port, while i rushed from the room in despair. a very “fine old english gentleman,” was my grand-uncle rumgudgeon, but unlike him of the song, he had his weak points. he was a little, pursy, pompous, passionate semicircular somebody, with a red nose, a thick scull, (sic) a long purse, and a strong sense of his own consequence. with the best heart in the world, he contrived, through a predominant whim of contradiction, to earn for himself, among those who only knew him superficially, the character of a curmudgeon. like many excellent people, he seemed possessed with a spirit of tantalization, which might easily, at a casual glance, have been mistaken for malevolence. to every request, a positive “no!” was his immediate answer, but in the end--in the long, long end--there were exceedingly few requests which he refused. against all attacks upon his purse he made the most sturdy defence; but the amount extorted from him, at last, was generally in direct ratio with the length of the siege and the stubbornness of the resistance. in charity no one gave more liberally or with a worse grace. for the fine arts, and especially for the belles-lettres, he entertained a profound contempt. with this he had been inspired by casimir perier, whose pert little query “a quoi un poete est il bon?” he was in the habit of quoting, with a very droll pronunciation, as the ne plus ultra of logical wit. thus my own inkling for the muses had excited his entire displeasure. he assured me one day, when i asked him for a new copy of horace, that the translation of “poeta nascitur non fit” was “a nasty poet for nothing fit”--a remark which i took in high dudgeon. his repugnance to “the humanities” had, also, much increased of late, by an accidental bias in favor of what he supposed to be natural science. somebody had accosted him in the street, mistaking him for no less a personage than doctor dubble l. dee, the lecturer upon quack physics. this set him off at a tangent; and just at the epoch of this story--for story it is getting to be after all--my grand-uncle rumgudgeon was accessible and pacific only upon points which happened to chime in with the caprioles of the hobby he was riding. for the rest, he laughed with his arms and legs, and his politics were stubborn and easily understood. he thought, with horsley, that “the people have nothing to do with the laws but to obey them.” i had lived with the old gentleman all my life. my parents, in dying, had bequeathed me to him as a rich legacy. i believe the old villain loved me as his own child--nearly if not quite as well as he loved kate--but it was a dog’s existence that he led me, after all. from my first year until my fifth, he obliged me with very regular floggings. from five to fifteen, he threatened me, hourly, with the house of correction. from fifteen to twenty, not a day passed in which he did not promise to cut me off with a shilling. i was a sad dog, it is true--but then it was a part of my nature--a point of my faith. in kate, however, i had a firm friend, and i knew it. she was a good girl, and told me very sweetly that i might have her (plum and all) whenever i could badger my grand-uncle rumgudgeon, into the necessary consent. poor girl!--she was barely fifteen, and without this consent, her little amount in the funds was not come-at-able until five immeasurable summers had “dragged their slow length along.” what, then, to do? at fifteen, or even at twenty-one (for i had now passed my fifth olympiad) five years in prospect are very much the same as five hundred. in vain we besieged the old gentleman with importunities. here was a piece de resistance (as messieurs ude and careme would say) which suited his perverse fancy to a t. it would have stiffed the indignation of job himself, to see how much like an old mouser he behaved to us two poor wretched little mice. in his heart he wished for nothing more ardently than our union. he had made up his mind to this all along. in fact, he would have given ten thousand pounds from his own pocket (kate’s plum was her own) if he could have invented any thing like an excuse for complying with our very natural wishes. but then we had been so imprudent as to broach the subject ourselves. not to oppose it under such circumstances, i sincerely believe, was not in his power. i have said already that he had his weak points; but in speaking of these, i must not be understood as referring to his obstinacy: which was one of his strong points--“assurement ce n’ etait pas sa foible.” when i mention his weakness i have allusion to a bizarre old-womanish superstition which beset him. he was great in dreams, portents, et id genus omne of rigmarole. he was excessively punctilious, too, upon small points of honor, and, after his own fashion, was a man of his word, beyond doubt. this was, in fact, one of his hobbies. the spirit of his vows he made no scruple of setting at naught, but the letter was a bond inviolable. now it was this latter peculiarity in his disposition, of which kate’s ingenuity enabled us one fine day, not long after our interview in the dining-room, to take a very unexpected advantage, and, having thus, in the fashion of all modern bards and orators, exhausted in prolegomena, all the time at my command, and nearly all the room at my disposal, i will sum up in a few words what constitutes the whole pith of the story. it happened then--so the fates ordered it--that among the naval acquaintances of my betrothed, were two gentlemen who had just set foot upon the shores of england, after a year’s absence, each, in foreign travel. in company with these gentlemen, my cousin and i, preconcertedly paid uncle rumgudgeon a visit on the afternoon of sunday, october the tenth,--just three weeks after the memorable decision which had so cruelly defeated our hopes. for about half an hour the conversation ran upon ordinary topics, but at last, we contrived, quite naturally, to give it the following turn: capt. pratt. “well i have been absent just one year.--just one year to-day, as i live--let me see! yes!--this is october the tenth. you remember, mr. rumgudgeon, i called, this day year to bid you good-bye. and by the way, it does seem something like a coincidence, does it not--that our friend, captain smitherton, here, has been absent exactly a year also--a year to-day!” smitherton. “yes! just one year to a fraction. you will remember, mr. rumgudgeon, that i called with capt. pratol on this very day, last year, to pay my parting respects.” uncle. “yes, yes, yes--i remember it very well--very queer indeed! both of you gone just one year. a very strange coincidence, indeed! just what doctor dubble l. dee would denominate an extraordinary concurrence of events. doctor dub-” kate. (interrupting.) “to be sure, papa, it is something strange; but then captain pratt and captain smitherton didn’t go altogether the same route, and that makes a difference, you know.” uncle. “i don’t know any such thing, you huzzy! how should i? i think it only makes the matter more remarkable, doctor dubble l. dee--” kate. “why, papa, captain pratt went round cape horn, and captain smitherton doubled the cape of good hope.” uncle. “precisely!--the one went east and the other went west, you jade, and they both have gone quite round the world. by the by, doctor dubble l. dee--” myself. (hurriedly.) “captain pratt, you must come and spend the evening with us to-morrow--you and smitherton--you can tell us all about your voyage, and we’ll have a game of whist and--” pratt. “wist, my dear fellow--you forget. to-morrow will be sunday. some other evening--” kate. “oh, no, fie!--robert’s not quite so bad as that. to-day’s sunday.” pratt. “i beg both your pardons--but i can’t be so much mistaken. i know to-morrow’s sunday, because-” smitherton. (much surprised.) “what are you all thinking about? wasn’t yesterday, sunday, i should like to know?” all. “yesterday indeed! you are out!” uncle. “to-day’s sunday, i say--don’t i know?” pratt. “oh no!--to-morrow’s sunday.” smitherton. “you are all mad--every one of you. i am as positive that yesterday was sunday as i am that i sit upon this chair.” kate. (jumping up eagerly.) “i see it--i see it all. papa, this is a judgment upon you, about--about you know what. let me alone, and i’ll explain it all in a minute. it’s a very simple thing, indeed. captain smitherton says that yesterday was sunday: so it was; he is right. cousin bobby, and uncle and i say that to-day is sunday: so it is; we are right. captain pratt maintains that to-morrow will be sunday: so it will; he is right, too. the fact is, we are all right, and thus three sundays have come together in a week.” smitherton. (after a pause.) “by the by, pratt, kate has us completely. what fools we two are! mr. rumgudgeon, the matter stands thus: the earth, you know, is twenty-four thousand miles in circumference. now this globe of the earth turns upon its own axis--revolves--spins round--these twenty-four thousand miles of extent, going from west to east, in precisely twenty-four hours. do you understand mr. rumgudgeon?-” uncle. “to be sure--to be sure--doctor dub-” smitherton. (drowning his voice.) “well, sir; that is at the rate of one thousand miles per hour. now, suppose that i sail from this position a thousand miles east. of course i anticipate the rising of the sun here at london by just one hour. i see the sun rise one hour before you do. proceeding, in the same direction, yet another thousand miles, i anticipate the rising by two hours--another thousand, and i anticipate it by three hours, and so on, until i go entirely round the globe, and back to this spot, when, having gone twenty-four thousand miles east, i anticipate the rising of the london sun by no less than twenty-four hours; that is to say, i am a day in advance of your time. understand, eh?” uncle. “but double l. dee-” smitherton. (speaking very loud.) “captain pratt, on the contrary, when he had sailed a thousand miles west of this position, was an hour, and when he had sailed twenty-four thousand miles west, was twenty-four hours, or one day, behind the time at london. thus, with me, yesterday was sunday--thus, with you, to-day is sunday--and thus, with pratt, to-morrow will be sunday. and what is more, mr. rumgudgeon, it is positively clear that we are all right; for there can be no philosophical reason assigned why the idea of one of us should have preference over that of the other.” uncle. “my eyes!--well, kate--well, bobby!--this is a judgment upon me, as you say. but i am a man of my word--mark that! you shall have her, boy, (plum and all), when you please. done up, by jove! three sundays all in a row! i’ll go, and take dubble l. dee’s opinion upon that.”

wherein consult, also, marginal notes in the autograph of stuffundpuff, with the sub-commentaries of gruntundguzzell. notwithstanding the obscurity which thus envelops the date of the foundation of vondervotteimittis, and the derivation of its name, there can be no doubt, as i said before, that it has always existed as we find it at this epoch. the oldest man in the borough can remember not the slightest difference in the appearance of any portion of it; and, indeed, the very suggestion of such a possibility is considered an insult. the site of the village is in a perfectly circular valley, about a quarter of a mile in circumference, and entirely surrounded by gentle hills, over whose summit the people have never yet ventured to pass. for this they assign the very good reason that they do not believe there is anything at all on the other side. round the skirts of the valley (which is quite level, and paved throughout with flat tiles), extends a continuous row of sixty little houses. these, having their backs on the hills, must look, of course, to the centre of the plain, which is just sixty yards from the front door of each dwelling. every house has a small garden before it, with a circular path, a sun-dial, and twenty-four cabbages. the buildings themselves are so precisely alike, that one can in no manner be distinguished from the other. owing to the vast antiquity, the style of architecture is somewhat odd, but it is not for that reason the less strikingly picturesque. they are fashioned of hard-burned little bricks, red, with black ends, so that the walls look like a chess-board upon a great scale. the gables are turned to the front, and there are cornices, as big as all the rest of the house, over the eaves and over the main doors. the windows are narrow and deep, with very tiny panes and a great deal of sash. on the roof is a vast quantity of tiles with long curly ears. the woodwork, throughout, is of a dark hue and there is much carving about it, with but a trifling variety of pattern for, time out of mind, the carvers of vondervotteimittiss have never been able to carve more than two objects--a time-piece and a cabbage. but these they do exceedingly well, and intersperse them, with singular ingenuity, wherever they find room for the chisel. the dwellings are as much alike inside as out, and the furniture is all upon one plan. the floors are of square tiles, the chairs and tables of black-looking wood with thin crooked legs and puppy feet. the mantelpieces are wide and high, and have not only time-pieces and cabbages sculptured over the front, but a real time-piece, which makes a prodigious ticking, on the top in the middle, with a flower-pot containing a cabbage standing on each extremity by way of outrider. between each cabbage and the time-piece, again, is a little china man having a large stomach with a great round hole in it, through which is seen the dial-plate of a watch. the fireplaces are large and deep, with fierce crooked-looking fire-dogs. there is constantly a rousing fire, and a huge pot over it, full of sauer-kraut and pork, to which the good woman of the house is always busy in attending. she is a little fat old lady, with blue eyes and a red face, and wears a huge cap like a sugar-loaf, ornamented with purple and yellow ribbons. her dress is of orange-colored linsey-woolsey, made very full behind and very short in the waist--and indeed very short in other respects, not reaching below the middle of her leg. this is somewhat thick, and so are her ankles, but she has a fine pair of green stockings to cover them. her shoes--of pink leather--are fastened each with a bunch of yellow ribbons puckered up in the shape of a cabbage. in her left hand she has a little heavy dutch watch; in her right she wields a ladle for the sauerkraut and pork. by her side there stands a fat tabby cat, with a gilt toy-repeater tied to its tail, which “the boys” have there fastened by way of a quiz. the boys themselves are, all three of them, in the garden attending the pig. they are each two feet in height. they have three-cornered cocked hats, purple waistcoats reaching down to their thighs, buckskin knee-breeches, red stockings, heavy shoes with big silver buckles, long surtout coats with large buttons of mother-of-pearl. each, too, has a pipe in his mouth, and a little dumpy watch in his right hand. he takes a puff and a look, and then a look and a puff. the pig--which is corpulent and lazy--is occupied now in picking up the stray leaves that fall from the cabbages, and now in giving a kick behind at the gilt repeater, which the urchins have also tied to his tail in order to make him look as handsome as the cat. right at the front door, in a high-backed leather-bottomed armed chair, with crooked legs and puppy feet like the tables, is seated the old man of the house himself. he is an exceedingly puffy little old gentleman, with big circular eyes and a huge double chin. his dress resembles that of the boys--and i need say nothing farther about it. all the difference is, that his pipe is somewhat bigger than theirs and he can make a greater smoke. like them, he has a watch, but he carries his watch in his pocket. to say the truth, he has something of more importance than a watch to attend to--and what that is, i shall presently explain. he sits with his right leg upon his left knee, wears a grave countenance, and always keeps one of his eyes, at least, resolutely bent upon a certain remarkable object in the centre of the plain. this object is situated in the steeple of the house of the town council. the town council are all very little, round, oily, intelligent men, with big saucer eyes and fat double chins, and have their coats much longer and their shoe-buckles much bigger than the ordinary inhabitants of vondervotteimittiss. since my sojourn in the borough, they have had several special meetings, and have adopted these three important resolutions: “that it is wrong to alter the good old course of things:” “that there is nothing tolerable out of vondervotteimittiss:” and-- “that we will stick by our clocks and our cabbages.” above the session-room of the council is the steeple, and in the steeple is the belfry, where exists, and has existed time out of mind, the pride and wonder of the village--the great clock of the borough of vondervotteimittiss. and this is the object to which the eyes of the old gentlemen are turned who sit in the leather-bottomed arm-chairs. the great clock has seven faces--one in each of the seven sides of the steeple--so that it can be readily seen from all quarters. its faces are large and white, and its hands heavy and black. there is a belfry-man whose sole duty is to attend to it; but this duty is the most perfect of sinecures--for the clock of vondervotteimittis was never yet known to have anything the matter with it. until lately, the bare supposition of such a thing was considered heretical. from the remotest period of antiquity to which the archives have reference, the hours have been regularly struck by the big bell. and, indeed the case was just the same with all the other clocks and watches in the borough. never was such a place for keeping the true time. when the large clapper thought proper to say “twelve o’clock!” all its obedient followers opened their throats simultaneously, and responded like a very echo. in short, the good burghers were fond of their sauer-kraut, but then they were proud of their clocks. all people who hold sinecure offices are held in more or less respect, and as the belfry--man of vondervotteimittiss has the most perfect of sinecures, he is the most perfectly respected of any man in the world. he is the chief dignitary of the borough, and the very pigs look up to him with a sentiment of reverence. his coat-tail is very far longer--his pipe, his shoe--buckles, his eyes, and his stomach, very far bigger--than those of any other old gentleman in the village; and as to his chin, it is not only double, but triple. i have thus painted the happy estate of vondervotteimittiss: alas, that so fair a picture should ever experience a reverse! there has been long a saying among the wisest inhabitants, that “no good can come from over the hills”; and it really seemed that the words had in them something of the spirit of prophecy. it wanted five minutes of noon, on the day before yesterday, when there appeared a very odd-looking object on the summit of the ridge of the eastward. such an occurrence, of course, attracted universal attention, and every little old gentleman who sat in a leather-bottomed arm-chair turned one of his eyes with a stare of dismay upon the phenomenon, still keeping the other upon the clock in the steeple. by the time that it wanted only three minutes to noon, the droll object in question was perceived to be a very diminutive foreign-looking young man. he descended the hills at a great rate, so that every body had soon a good look at him. he was really the most finicky little personage that had ever been seen in vondervotteimittiss. his countenance was of a dark snuff-color, and he had a long hooked nose, pea eyes, a wide mouth, and an excellent set of teeth, which latter he seemed anxious of displaying, as he was grinning from ear to ear. what with mustachios and whiskers, there was none of the rest of his face to be seen. his head was uncovered, and his hair neatly done up in papillotes. his dress was a tight-fitting swallow-tailed black coat (from one of whose pockets dangled a vast length of white handkerchief), black kerseymere knee-breeches, black stockings, and stumpy-looking pumps, with huge bunches of black satin ribbon for bows. under one arm he carried a huge chapeau-de-bras, and under the other a fiddle nearly five times as big as himself. in his left hand was a gold snuff-box, from which, as he capered down the hill, cutting all manner of fantastic steps, he took snuff incessantly with an air of the greatest possible self-satisfaction. god bless me!--here was a sight for the honest burghers of vondervotteimittiss! to speak plainly, the fellow had, in spite of his grinning, an audacious and sinister kind of face; and as he curvetted right into the village, the old stumpy appearance of his pumps excited no little suspicion; and many a burgher who beheld him that day would have given a trifle for a peep beneath the white cambric handkerchief which hung so obtrusively from the pocket of his swallow-tailed coat. but what mainly occasioned a righteous indignation was, that the scoundrelly popinjay, while he cut a fandango here, and a whirligig there, did not seem to have the remotest idea in the world of such a thing as keeping time in his steps. the good people of the borough had scarcely a chance, however, to get their eyes thoroughly open, when, just as it wanted half a minute of noon, the rascal bounced, as i say, right into the midst of them; gave a chassez here, and a balancez there; and then, after a pirouette and a pas-de-zephyr, pigeon-winged himself right up into the belfry of the house of the town council, where the wonder-stricken belfry-man sat smoking in a state of dignity and dismay. but the little chap seized him at once by the nose; gave it a swing and a pull; clapped the big chapeau de-bras upon his head; knocked it down over his eyes and mouth; and then, lifting up the big fiddle, beat him with it so long and so soundly, that what with the belfry-man being so fat, and the fiddle being so hollow, you would have sworn that there was a regiment of double-bass drummers all beating the devil’s tattoo up in the belfry of the steeple of vondervotteimittiss. there is no knowing to what desperate act of vengeance this unprincipled attack might have aroused the inhabitants, but for the important fact that it now wanted only half a second of noon. the bell was about to strike, and it was a matter of absolute and pre-eminent necessity that every body should look well at his watch. it was evident, however, that just at this moment the fellow in the steeple was doing something that he had no business to do with the clock. but as it now began to strike, nobody had any time to attend to his manoeuvres, for they had all to count the strokes of the bell as it sounded. “one!” said the clock. “von!” echoed every little old gentleman in every leather-bottomed arm-chair in vondervotteimittiss. “von!” said his watch also; “von!” said the watch of his vrow; and “von!” said the watches of the boys, and the little gilt repeaters on the tails of the cat and pig. “two!” continued the big bell; and “doo!” repeated all the repeaters. “three! four! five! six! seven! eight! nine! ten!” said the bell. “dree! vour! fibe! sax! seben! aight! noin! den!” answered the others. “eleven!” said the big one. “eleben!” assented the little ones. “twelve!” said the bell. “dvelf!” they replied perfectly satisfied, and dropping their voices. “und dvelf it is!” said all the little old gentlemen, putting up their watches. but the big bell had not done with them yet. “thirteen!” said he. “der teufel!” gasped the little old gentlemen, turning pale, dropping their pipes, and putting down all their right legs from over their left knees. “der teufel!” groaned they, “dirteen! dirteen!!--mein gott, it is dirteen o’clock!!” why attempt to describe the terrible scene which ensued? all vondervotteimittiss flew at once into a lamentable state of uproar. “vot is cum’d to mein pelly?” roared all the boys--“i’ve been ongry for dis hour!” “vot is com’d to mein kraut?” screamed all the vrows, “it has been done to rags for this hour!” “vot is cum’d to mein pipe?” swore all the little old gentlemen, “donder and blitzen; it has been smoked out for dis hour!”--and they filled them up again in a great rage, and sinking back in their arm-chairs, puffed away so fast and so fiercely that the whole valley was immediately filled with impenetrable smoke. meantime the cabbages all turned very red in the face, and it seemed as if old nick himself had taken possession of every thing in the shape of a timepiece. the clocks carved upon the furniture took to dancing as if bewitched, while those upon the mantel-pieces could scarcely contain themselves for fury, and kept such a continual striking of thirteen, and such a frisking and wriggling of their pendulums as was really horrible to see. but, worse than all, neither the cats nor the pigs could put up any longer with the behavior of the little repeaters tied to their tails, and resented it by scampering all over the place, scratching and poking, and squeaking and screeching, and caterwauling and squalling, and flying into the faces, and running under the petticoats of the people, and creating altogether the most abominable din and confusion which it is possible for a reasonable person to conceive. and to make matters still more distressing, the rascally little scape-grace in the steeple was evidently exerting himself to the utmost. every now and then one might catch a glimpse of the scoundrel through the smoke. there he sat in the belfry upon the belfry-man, who was lying flat upon his back. in his teeth the villain held the bell-rope, which he kept jerking about with his head, raising such a clatter that my ears ring again even to think of it. on his lap lay the big fiddle, at which he was scraping, out of all time and tune, with both hands, making a great show, the nincompoop! of playing “judy o’flannagan and paddy o’rafferty.” affairs being thus miserably situated, i left the place in disgust, and now appeal for aid to all lovers of correct time and fine kraut. let us proceed in a body to the borough, and restore the ancient order of things in vondervotteimittiss by ejecting that little fellow from the steeple. lionizing -------- all people went upon their ten toes in wild wonderment. --_bishop hall’s satires_. i am--that is to say i was--a great man; but i am neither the author of junius nor the man in the mask; for my name, i believe, is robert jones, and i was born somewhere in the city of fum-fudge. the first action of my life was the taking hold of my nose with both hands. my mother saw this and called me a genius: my father wept for joy and presented me with a treatise on nosology. this i mastered before i was breeched. i now began to feel my way in the science, and soon came to understand that, provided a man had a nose sufficiently conspicuous he might, by merely following it, arrive at a lionship. but my attention was not confined to theories alone. every morning i gave my proboscis a couple of pulls and swallowed a half dozen of drams. when i came of age my father asked me, one day, if i would step with him into his study. “my son,” said he, when we were seated, “what is the chief end of your existence?” “my father,” i answered, “it is the study of nosology.” “and what, robert,” he inquired, “is nosology?” “sir,” i said, “it is the science of noses.” “and can you tell me,” he demanded, “what is the meaning of a nose?” “a nose, my father;” i replied, greatly softened, “has been variously defined by about a thousand different authors.” [here i pulled out my watch.] “it is now noon or thereabouts--we shall have time enough to get through with them all before midnight. to commence then:--the nose, according to bartholinus, is that protuberance--that bump--that excrescence--that--” “will do, robert,” interrupted the good old gentleman. “i am thunderstruck at the extent of your information--i am positively--upon my soul.” [here he closed his eyes and placed his hand upon his heart.] “come here!” [here he took me by the arm.] “your education may now be considered as finished--it is high time you should scuffle for yourself--and you cannot do a better thing than merely follow your nose--so--so--so--” [here he kicked me down stairs and out of the door]--“so get out of my house, and god bless you!” as i felt within me the divine afflatus, i considered this accident rather fortunate than otherwise. i resolved to be guided by the paternal advice. i determined to follow my nose. i gave it a pull or two upon the spot, and wrote a pamphlet on nosology forthwith. all fum-fudge was in an uproar. “wonderful genius!” said the quarterly. “superb physiologist!” said the westminster. “clever fellow!” said the foreign. “fine writer!” said the edinburgh. “profound thinker!” said the dublin. “great man!” said bentley. “divine soul!” said fraser. “one of us!” said blackwood. “who can he be?” said mrs. bas-bleu. “what can he be?” said big miss bas-bleu. “where can he be?” said little miss bas-bleu.--but i paid these people no attention whatever--i just stepped into the shop of an artist. the duchess of bless-my-soul was sitting for her portrait; the marquis of so-and-so was holding the duchess’ poodle; the earl of this-and-that was flirting with her salts; and his royal highness of touch-me-not was leaning upon the back of her chair. i approached the artist and turned up my nose. “oh, beautiful!” sighed her grace. “oh my!” lisped the marquis. “oh, shocking!” groaned the earl. “oh, abominable!” growled his royal highness. “what will you take for it?” asked the artist. “for his nose!” shouted her grace. “a thousand pounds,” said i, sitting down. “a thousand pounds?” inquired the artist, musingly. “a thousand pounds,” said i. “beautiful!” said he, entranced. “a thousand pounds,” said i. “do you warrant it?” he asked, turning the nose to the light. “i do,” said i, blowing it well. “is it quite original?” he inquired; touching it with reverence. “humph!” said i, twisting it to one side. “has no copy been taken?” he demanded, surveying it through a microscope. “none,” said i, turning it up. “admirable!” he ejaculated, thrown quite off his guard by the beauty of the manoeuvre. “a thousand pounds,” said i. “a thousand pounds?” said he. “precisely,” said i. “a thousand pounds?” said he. “just so,” said i. “you shall have them,” said he. “what a piece of virtu!” so he drew me a check upon the spot, and took a sketch of my nose. i engaged rooms in jermyn street, and sent her majesty the ninety-ninth edition of the “nosology,” with a portrait of the proboscis.--that sad little rake, the prince of wales, invited me to dinner. we were all lions and recherchés. there was a modern platonist. he quoted porphyry, iamblicus, plotinus, proclus, hierocles, maximus tyrius, and syrianus. there was a human-perfectibility man. he quoted turgot, price, priestly, condorcet, de stael, and the “ambitious student in ill health.” there was sir positive paradox. he observed that all fools were philosophers, and that all philosophers were fools. there was æstheticus ethix. he spoke of fire, unity, and atoms; bi-part and pre-existent soul; affinity and discord; primitive intelligence and homöomeria. there was theologos theology. he talked of eusebius and arianus; heresy and the council of nice; puseyism and consubstantialism; homousios and homouioisios. there was fricassée from the rocher de cancale. he mentioned muriton of red tongue; cauliflowers with velouté sauce; veal à la st. menehoult; marinade à la st. florentin; and orange jellies en mosäiques. there was bibulus o’bumper. he touched upon latour and markbrünnen; upon mousseux and chambertin; upon richbourg and st. george; upon haubrion, leonville, and medoc; upon barac and preignac; upon grâve, upon sauterne, upon lafitte, and upon st. peray. he shook his head at clos de vougeot, and told, with his eyes shut, the difference between sherry and amontillado. there was signor tintontintino from florence. he discoursed of cimabué, arpino, carpaccio, and argostino--of the gloom of caravaggio, of the amenity of albano, of the colors of titian, of the frows of rubens, and of the waggeries of jan steen. there was the president of the fum-fudge university. he was of opinion that the moon was called bendis in thrace, bubastis in egypt, dian in rome, and artemis in greece. there was a grand turk from stamboul. he could not help thinking that the angels were horses, cocks, and bulls; that somebody in the sixth heaven had seventy thousand heads; and that the earth was supported by a sky-blue cow with an incalculable number of green horns. there was delphinus polyglott. he told us what had become of the eighty-three lost tragedies of æschylus; of the fifty-four orations of isæus; of the three hundred and ninety-one speeches of lysias; of the hundred and eighty treatises of theophrastus; of the eighth book of the conic sections of apollonius; of pindar’s hymns and dithyrambics; and of the five and forty tragedies of homer junior. there was ferdinand fitz-fossillus feltspar. he informed us all about internal fires and tertiary formations; about äeriforms, fluidiforms, and solidiforms; about quartz and marl; about schist and schorl; about gypsum and trap; about talc and calc; about blende and horn-blende; about mica-slate and pudding-stone; about cyanite and lepidolite; about hematite and tremolite; about antimony and calcedony; about manganese and whatever you please. there was myself. i spoke of myself;--of myself, of myself, of myself;--of nosology, of my pamphlet, and of myself. i turned up my nose, and i spoke of myself. “marvellous clever man!” said the prince. “superb!” said his guests:--and next morning her grace of bless-my-soul paid me a visit. “will you go to almack’s, pretty creature?” she said, tapping me under the chin. “upon honor,” said i. “nose and all?” she asked. “as i live,” i replied. “here then is a card, my life. shall i say you will be there?” “dear duchess, with all my heart.” “pshaw, no!--but with all your nose?” “every bit of it, my love,” said i: so i gave it a twist or two, and found myself at almack’s. the rooms were crowded to suffocation. “he is coming!” said somebody on the staircase. “he is coming!” said somebody farther up. “he is coming!” said somebody farther still. “he is come!” exclaimed the duchess. “he is come, the little love!”--and, seizing me firmly by both hands, she kissed me thrice upon the nose. a marked sensation immediately ensued. “diavolo!” cried count capricornutti. “dios guarda!” muttered don stiletto. “mille tonnerres!” ejaculated the prince de grenouille. “tousand teufel!” growled the elector of bluddennuff. it was not to be borne. i grew angry. i turned short upon bluddennuff. “sir!” said i to him, “you are a baboon.” “sir,” he replied, after a pause, “donner und blitzen!” this was all that could be desired. we exchanged cards. at chalk-farm, the next morning, i shot off his nose--and then called upon my friends. “bête!” said the first. “fool!” said the second. “dolt!” said the third. “ass!” said the fourth. “ninny!” said the fifth. “noodle!” said the sixth. “be off!” said the seventh. at all this i felt mortified, and so called upon my father. “father,” i asked, “what is the chief end of my existence?” “my son,” he replied, “it is still the study of nosology; but in hitting the elector upon the nose you have overshot your mark. you have a fine nose, it is true; but then bluddennuff has none. you are damned, and he has become the hero of the day. i grant you that in fum-fudge the greatness of a lion is in proportion to the size of his proboscis--but, good heavens! there is no competing with a lion who has no proboscis at all.” x-ing a paragraph as it is well known that the ‘wise men’ came ‘from the east,’ and as mr. touch-and-go bullet-head came from the east, it follows that mr. bullet-head was a wise man; and if collateral proof of the matter be needed, here we have it--mr. b. was an editor. irascibility was his sole foible, for in fact the obstinacy of which men accused him was anything but his foible, since he justly considered it his forte. it was his strong point--his virtue; and it would have required all the logic of a brownson to convince him that it was ‘anything else.’ i have shown that touch-and-go bullet-head was a wise man; and the only occasion on which he did not prove infallible, was when, abandoning that legitimate home for all wise men, the east, he migrated to the city of alexander-the-great-o-nopolis, or some place of a similar title, out west. i must do him the justice to say, however, that when he made up his mind finally to settle in that town, it was under the impression that no newspaper, and consequently no editor, existed in that particular section of the country. in establishing ‘the tea-pot’ he expected to have the field all to himself. i feel confident he never would have dreamed of taking up his residence in alexander-the-great-o-nopolis had he been aware that, in alexander-the-great-o-nopolis, there lived a gentleman named john smith (if i rightly remember), who for many years had there quietly grown fat in editing and publishing the ‘alexander-the-great-o-nopolis gazette.’ it was solely, therefore, on account of having been misinformed, that mr. bullet-head found himself in alex-suppose we call it nopolis, ‘for short’--but, as he did find himself there, he determined to keep up his character for obst--for firmness, and remain. so remain he did; and he did more; he unpacked his press, type, etc., etc., rented an office exactly opposite to that of the ‘gazette,’ and, on the third morning after his arrival, issued the first number of ‘the alexan’--that is to say, of ‘the nopolis tea-pot’--as nearly as i can recollect, this was the name of the new paper. the leading article, i must admit, was brilliant--not to say severe. it was especially bitter about things in general--and as for the editor of ‘the gazette,’ he was torn all to pieces in particular. some of bullethead’s remarks were really so fiery that i have always, since that time, been forced to look upon john smith, who is still alive, in the light of a salamander. i cannot pretend to give all the ‘tea-pot’s’ paragraphs verbatim, but one of them runs thus: ‘oh, yes!--oh, we perceive! oh, no doubt! the editor over the way is a genius--o, my! oh, goodness, gracious!--what is this world coming to? oh, tempora! oh, moses!’ a philippic at once so caustic and so classical, alighted like a bombshell among the hitherto peaceful citizens of nopolis. groups of excited individuals gathered at the corners of the streets. every one awaited, with heartfelt anxiety, the reply of the dignified smith. next morning it appeared as follows: ‘we quote from “the tea-pot” of yesterday the subjoined paragraph: “oh, yes! oh, we perceive! oh, no doubt! oh, my! oh, goodness! oh, tempora! oh, moses!” why, the fellow is all o! that accounts for his reasoning in a circle, and explains why there is neither beginning nor end to him, nor to anything he says. we really do not believe the vagabond can write a word that hasn’t an o in it. wonder if this o-ing is a habit of his? by-the-by, he came away from down-east in a great hurry. wonder if he o’s as much there as he does here? “o! it is pitiful.”’ the indignation of mr. bullet-head at these scandalous insinuations, i shall not attempt to describe. on the eel-skinning principle, however, he did not seem to be so much incensed at the attack upon his integrity as one might have imagined. it was the sneer at his style that drove him to desperation. what!--he touch-and-go bullet-head!--not able to write a word without an o in it! he would soon let the jackanapes see that he was mistaken. yes! he would let him see how much he was mistaken, the puppy! he, touch-and-go bullet-head, of frogpondium, would let mr. john smith perceive that he, bullet-head, could indite, if it so pleased him, a whole paragraph--aye! a whole article--in which that contemptible vowel should not once--not even once--make its appearance. but no;--that would be yielding a point to the said john smith. he, bullet-head, would make no alteration in his style, to suit the caprices of any mr. smith in christendom. perish so vile a thought! the o forever; he would persist in the o. he would be as o-wy as o-wy could be. burning with the chivalry of this determination, the great touch-and-go, in the next ‘tea-pot,’ came out merely with this simple but resolute paragraph, in reference to this unhappy affair: ‘the editor of the “tea-pot” has the honor of advising the editor of the “gazette” that he (the “tea-pot”) will take an opportunity in tomorrow morning’s paper, of convincing him (the “gazette”) that he (the “tea-pot”) both can and will be his own master, as regards style; he (the “tea-pot”) intending to show him (the “gazette”) the supreme, and indeed the withering contempt with which the criticism of him (the “gazette”) inspires the independent bosom of him (the “teapot”) by composing for the especial gratification (?) of him (the “gazette”) a leading article, of some extent, in which the beautiful vowel--the emblem of eternity--yet so offensive to the hyper-exquisite delicacy of him (the “gazette”) shall most certainly not be avoided by his (the “gazette’s”) most obedient, humble servant, the “tea-pot.” “so much for buckingham!”’ in fulfilment of the awful threat thus darkly intimated rather than decidedly enunciated, the great bullet-head, turning a deaf ear to all entreaties for ‘copy,’ and simply requesting his foreman to ‘go to the d----l,’ when he (the foreman) assured him (the ‘tea-pot’!) that it was high time to ‘go to press’: turning a deaf ear to everything, i say, the great bullet-head sat up until day-break, consuming the midnight oil, and absorbed in the composition of the really unparalleled paragraph, which follows:-- ‘so ho, john! how now? told you so, you know. don’t crow, another time, before you’re out of the woods! does your mother know you’re out? oh, no, no!--so go home at once, now, john, to your odious old woods of concord! go home to your woods, old owl--go! you won’t! oh, poh, poh, don’t do so! you’ve got to go, you know! so go at once, and don’t go slow, for nobody owns you here, you know! oh! john, john, if you don’t go you’re no homo--no! you’re only a fowl, an owl, a cow, a sow,--a doll, a poll; a poor, old, good-for-nothing-to-nobody, log, dog, hog, or frog, come out of a concord bog. cool, now--cool! do be cool, you fool! none of your crowing, old cock! don’t frown so--don’t! don’t hollo, nor howl nor growl, nor bow-wow-wow! good lord, john, how you do look! told you so, you know--but stop rolling your goose of an old poll about so, and go and drown your sorrows in a bowl!’ exhausted, very naturally, by so stupendous an effort, the great touch-and-go could attend to nothing farther that night. firmly, composedly, yet with an air of conscious power, he handed his ms. to the devil in waiting, and then, walking leisurely home, retired, with ineffable dignity to bed. meantime the devil, to whom the copy was entrusted, ran up stairs to his ‘case,’ in an unutterable hurry, and forthwith made a commencement at ‘setting’ the ms. ‘up.’ in the first place, of course,--as the opening word was ‘so,’--he made a plunge into the capital s hole and came out in triumph with a capital s. elated by this success, he immediately threw himself upon the little-o box with a blindfold impetuosity--but who shall describe his horror when his fingers came up without the anticipated letter in their clutch? who shall paint his astonishment and rage at perceiving, as he rubbed his knuckles, that he had been only thumping them to no purpose, against the bottom of an empty box. not a single little-o was in the little-o hole; and, glancing fearfully at the capital-o partition, he found that to his extreme terror, in a precisely similar predicament. awe--stricken, his first impulse was to rush to the foreman. ‘sir!’ said he, gasping for breath, ‘i can’t never set up nothing without no o’s.’ ‘what do you mean by that?’ growled the foreman, who was in a very ill humor at being kept so late. ‘why, sir, there beant an o in the office, neither a big un nor a little un!’ ‘what--what the d-l has become of all that were in the case?’ ‘i don’t know, sir,’ said the boy, ‘but one of them ere “g’zette” devils is bin prowling ‘bout here all night, and i spect he’s gone and cabbaged ‘em every one.’ ‘dod rot him! i haven’t a doubt of it,’ replied the foreman, getting purple with rage ‘but i tell you what you do, bob, that’s a good boy--you go over the first chance you get and hook every one of their i’s and (d----n them!) their izzards.’ ‘jist so,’ replied bob, with a wink and a frown--‘i’ll be into ‘em, i’ll let ‘em know a thing or two; but in de meantime, that ere paragrab? mus go in to-night, you know--else there’ll be the d-l to pay, and-’ ‘and not a bit of pitch hot,’ interrupted the foreman, with a deep sigh, and an emphasis on the ‘bit.’ ‘is it a long paragraph, bob?’ ‘shouldn’t call it a wery long paragrab,’ said bob. ‘ah, well, then! do the best you can with it! we must get to press,’ said the foreman, who was over head and ears in work; ‘just stick in some other letter for o; nobody’s going to read the fellow’s trash anyhow.’ ‘wery well,’ replied bob, ‘here goes it!’ and off he hurried to his case, muttering as he went: ‘considdeble vell, them ere expressions, perticcler for a man as doesn’t swar. so i’s to gouge out all their eyes, eh? and d-n all their gizzards! vell! this here’s the chap as is just able for to do it.’ the fact is that although bob was but twelve years old and four feet high, he was equal to any amount of fight, in a small way. the exigency here described is by no means of rare occurrence in printing-offices; and i cannot tell how to account for it, but the fact is indisputable, that when the exigency does occur, it almost always happens that x is adopted as a substitute for the letter deficient. the true reason, perhaps, is that x is rather the most superabundant letter in the cases, or at least was so in the old times--long enough to render the substitution in question an habitual thing with printers. as for bob, he would have considered it heretical to employ any other character, in a case of this kind, than the x to which he had been accustomed. ‘i shell have to x this ere paragrab,’ said he to himself, as he read it over in astonishment, ‘but it’s jest about the awfulest o-wy paragrab i ever did see’: so x it he did, unflinchingly, and to press it went x-ed. next morning the population of nopolis were taken all aback by reading in ‘the tea-pot,’ the following extraordinary leader: ‘sx hx, jxhn! hxw nxw? txld yxu sx, yxu knxw. dxn’t crxw, anxther time, befxre yxu’re xut xf the wxxds! dxes yxur mxther knxw yxu’re xut? xh, nx, nx!--sx gx hxme at xnce, nxw, jxhn, tx yxur xdixus xld wxxds xf cxncxrd! gx hxme tx yxur wxxds, xld xwl,--gx! yxu wxn’t? xh, pxh, pxh, jxhn, dxn’t dx sx! yxu’ve gxt tx gx, yxu knxw, sx gx at xnce, and dxn’t gx slxw;

and there was a general rush to bullet-head’s residence, for the purpose of riding him on a rail; but that gentleman was nowhere to be found. he had vanished, no one could tell how; and not even the ghost of him has ever been seen since. unable to discover its legitimate object, the popular fury at length subsided; leaving behind it, by way of sediment, quite a medley of opinion about this unhappy affair. one gentleman thought the whole an x-ellent joke. another said that, indeed, bullet-head had shown much x-uberance of fancy. a third admitted him x-entric, but no more. a fourth could only suppose it the yankee’s design to x-press, in a general way, his x-asperation. ‘say, rather, to set an x-ample to posterity,’ suggested a fifth. that bullet-head had been driven to an extremity, was clear to all; and in fact, since that editor could not be found, there was some talk about lynching the other one. the more common conclusion, however, was that the affair was, simply, x-traordinary and in-x-plicable. even the town mathematician confessed that he could make nothing of so dark a problem. x, every. body knew, was an unknown quantity; but in this case (as he properly observed), there was an unknown quantity of x. the opinion of bob, the devil (who kept dark about his having ‘x-ed the paragrab’), did not meet with so much attention as i think it deserved, although it was very openly and very fearlessly expressed. he said that, for his part, he had no doubt about the matter at all, that it was a clear case, that mr. bullet-head ‘never could be persuaded fur to drink like other folks, but vas continually a-svigging o’ that ere blessed xxx ale, and as a naiteral consekvence, it just puffed him up savage, and made him x (cross) in the x-treme.’ metzengerstein pestis eram vivus--moriens tua mors ero. --_martin luther_ horror and fatality have been stalking abroad in all ages. why then give a date to this story i have to tell? let it suffice to say, that at the period of which i speak, there existed, in the interior of hungary, a settled although hidden belief in the doctrines of the metempsychosis. of the doctrines themselves--that is, of their falsity, or of their probability--i say nothing. i assert, however, that much of our incredulity--as la bruyère says of all our unhappiness--“_vient de ne pouvoir être seuls_.” <UNK> but there are some points in the hungarian superstition which were fast verging to absurdity. they--the hungarians--differed very essentially from their eastern authorities. for example, “_the soul_,” said the former--i give the words of an acute and intelligent parisian--“_ne demeure qu’un seul fois dans un corps sensible: au reste--un cheval, un chien, un homme même, n’est que la ressemblance peu tangible de ces animaux._” the families of berlifitzing and metzengerstein had been at variance for centuries. never before were two houses so illustrious, mutually embittered by hostility so deadly. the origin of this enmity seems to be found in the words of an ancient prophecy--“a lofty name shall have a fearful fall when, as the rider over his horse, the mortality of metzengerstein shall triumph over the immortality of berlifitzing.” to be sure the words themselves had little or no meaning. but more trivial causes have given rise--and that no long while ago--to consequences equally eventful. besides, the estates, which were contiguous, had long exercised a rival influence in the affairs of a busy government. moreover, near neighbors are seldom friends; and the inhabitants of the castle berlifitzing might look, from their lofty buttresses, into the very windows of the palace metzengerstein. least of all had the more than feudal magnificence, thus discovered, a tendency to allay the irritable feelings of the less ancient and less wealthy berlifitzings. what wonder then, that the words, however silly, of that prediction, should have succeeded in setting and keeping at variance two families already predisposed to quarrel by every instigation of hereditary jealousy? the prophecy seemed to imply--if it implied anything--a final triumph on the part of the already more powerful house; and was of course remembered with the more bitter animosity by the weaker and less influential. wilhelm, count berlifitzing, although loftily descended, was, at the epoch of this narrative, an infirm and doting old man, remarkable for nothing but an inordinate and inveterate personal antipathy to the family of his rival, and so passionate a love of horses, and of hunting, that neither bodily infirmity, great age, nor mental incapacity, prevented his daily participation in the dangers of the chase. frederick, baron metzengerstein, was, on the other hand, not yet of age. his father, the minister g--, died young. his mother, the lady mary, followed him quickly after. frederick was, at that time, in his fifteenth year. in a city, fifteen years are no long period--a child may be still a child in his third lustrum: but in a wilderness--in so magnificent a wilderness as that old principality, fifteen years have a far deeper meaning. from some peculiar circumstances attending the administration of his father, the young baron, at the decease of the former, entered immediately upon his vast possessions. such estates were seldom held before by a nobleman of hungary. his castles were without number. the chief in point of splendor and extent was the “château metzengerstein.” the boundary line of his dominions was never clearly defined; but his principal park embraced a circuit of fifty miles. upon the succession of a proprietor so young, with a character so well known, to a fortune so unparalleled, little speculation was afloat in regard to his probable course of conduct. and, indeed, for the space of three days, the behavior of the heir out-heroded herod, and fairly surpassed the expectations of his most enthusiastic admirers. shameful debaucheries--flagrant treacheries--unheard-of atrocities--gave his trembling vassals quickly to understand that no servile submission on their part--no punctilios of conscience on his own--were thenceforward to prove any security against the remorseless fangs of a petty caligula. on the night of the fourth day, the stables of the castle berlifitzing were discovered to be on fire; and the unanimous opinion of the neighborhood added the crime of the incendiary to the already hideous list of the baron’s misdemeanors and enormities. but during the tumult occasioned by this occurrence, the young nobleman himself sat apparently buried in meditation, in a vast and desolate upper apartment of the family palace of metzengerstein. the rich although faded tapestry hangings which swung gloomily upon the walls, represented the shadowy and majestic forms of a thousand illustrious ancestors. _here_, rich-ermined priests, and pontifical dignitaries, familiarly seated with the autocrat and the sovereign, put a veto on the wishes of a temporal king, or restrained with the fiat of papal supremacy the rebellious sceptre of the arch-enemy. _there_, the dark, tall statures of the princes metzengerstein--their muscular war-coursers plunging over the carcasses of fallen foes--startled the steadiest nerves with their vigorous expression; and _here_, again, the voluptuous and swan-like figures of the dames of days gone by, floated away in the mazes of an unreal dance to the strains of imaginary melody. but as the baron listened, or affected to listen, to the gradually increasing uproar in the stables of berlifitzing--or perhaps pondered upon some more novel, some more decided act of audacity--his eyes became unwittingly rivetted to the figure of an enormous, and unnaturally colored horse, represented in the tapestry as belonging to a saracen ancestor of the family of his rival. the horse itself, in the foreground of the design, stood motionless and statue-like--while farther back, its discomfited rider perished by the dagger of a metzengerstein. on frederick’s lip arose a fiendish expression, as he became aware of the direction which his glance had, without his consciousness, assumed. yet he did not remove it. on the contrary, he could by no means account for the overwhelming anxiety which appeared falling like a pall upon his senses. it was with difficulty that he reconciled his dreamy and incoherent feelings with the certainty of being awake. the longer he gazed the more absorbing became the spell--the more impossible did it appear that he could ever withdraw his glance from the fascination of that tapestry. but the tumult without becoming suddenly more violent, with a compulsory exertion he diverted his attention to the glare of ruddy light thrown full by the flaming stables upon the windows of the apartment. the action, however, was but momentary, his gaze returned mechanically to the wall. to his extreme horror and astonishment, the head of the gigantic steed had, in the meantime, altered its position. the neck of the animal, before arched, as if in compassion, over the prostrate body of its lord, was now extended, at full length, in the direction of the baron. the eyes, before invisible, now wore an energetic and human expression, while they gleamed with a fiery and unusual red; and the distended lips of the apparently enraged horse left in full view his gigantic and disgusting teeth. stupified with terror, the young nobleman tottered to the door. as he threw it open, a flash of red light, streaming far into the chamber, flung his shadow with a clear outline against the quivering tapestry, and he shuddered to perceive that shadow--as he staggered awhile upon the threshold--assuming the exact position, and precisely filling up the contour, of the relentless and triumphant murderer of the saracen berlifitzing. to lighten the depression of his spirits, the baron hurried into the open air. at the principal gate of the palace he encountered three equerries. with much difficulty, and at the imminent peril of their lives, they were restraining the convulsive plunges of a gigantic and fiery-colored horse. “whose horse? where did you get him?” demanded the youth, in a querulous and husky tone of voice, as he became instantly aware that the mysterious steed in the tapestried chamber was the very counterpart of the furious animal before his eyes. “he is your own property, sire,” replied one of the equerries, “at least he is claimed by no other owner. we caught him flying, all smoking and foaming with rage, from the burning stables of the castle berlifitzing. supposing him to have belonged to the old count’s stud of foreign horses, we led him back as an estray. but the grooms there disclaim any title to the creature; which is strange, since he bears evident marks of having made a narrow escape from the flames. “the letters w. v. b. are also branded very distinctly on his forehead,” interrupted a second equerry, “i supposed them, of course, to be the initials of wilhelm von berlifitzing--but all at the castle are positive in denying any knowledge of the horse.” “extremely singular!” said the young baron, with a musing air, and apparently unconscious of the meaning of his words. “he is, as you say, a remarkable horse--a prodigious horse! although, as you very justly observe, of a suspicious and untractable character, let him be mine, however,” he added, after a pause, “perhaps a rider like frederick of metzengerstein, may tame even the devil from the stables of berlifitzing.” “you are mistaken, my lord; the horse, as i think we mentioned, is _not_ from the stables of the count. if such had been the case, we know our duty better than to bring him into the presence of a noble of your family.” “true!” observed the baron, dryly, and at that instant a page of the bedchamber came from the palace with a heightened color, and a precipitate step. he whispered into his master’s ear an account of the sudden disappearance of a small portion of the tapestry, in an apartment which he designated; entering, at the same time, into particulars of a minute and circumstantial character; but from the low tone of voice in which these latter were communicated, nothing escaped to gratify the excited curiosity of the equerries. the young frederick, during the conference, seemed agitated by a variety of emotions. he soon, however, recovered his composure, and an expression of determined malignancy settled upon his countenance, as he gave peremptory orders that a certain chamber should be immediately locked up, and the key placed in his own possession. “have you heard of the unhappy death of the old hunter berlifitzing?” said one of his vassals to the baron, as, after the departure of the page, the huge steed which that nobleman had adopted as his own, plunged and curvetted, with redoubled fury, down the long avenue which extended from the chateau to the stables of metzengerstein. “no!” said the baron, turning abruptly toward the speaker, “dead! say you?” “it is indeed true, my lord; and, to a noble of your name, will be, i imagine, no unwelcome intelligence.” a rapid smile shot over the countenance of the listener. “how died he?” “in his rash exertions to rescue a favorite portion of his hunting stud, he has himself perished miserably in the flames.” “i-n-d-e-e-d-!” ejaculated the baron, as if slowly and deliberately impressed with the truth of some exciting idea. “indeed;” repeated the vassal. “shocking!” said the youth, calmly, and turned quietly into the chateau. from this date a marked alteration took place in the outward demeanor of the dissolute young baron frederick von metzengerstein. indeed, his behavior disappointed every expectation, and proved little in accordance with the views of many a manoeuvering mamma; while his habits and manner, still less than formerly, offered any thing congenial with those of the neighboring aristocracy. he was never to be seen beyond the limits of his own domain, and, in this wide and social world, was utterly companionless--unless, indeed, that unnatural, impetuous, and fiery-colored horse, which he henceforward continually bestrode, had any mysterious right to the title of his friend. numerous invitations on the part of the neighborhood for a long time, however, periodically came in. “will the baron honor our festivals with his presence?” “will the baron join us in a hunting of the boar?”--“metzengerstein does not hunt;” “metzengerstein will not attend,” were the haughty and laconic answers. these repeated insults were not to be endured by an imperious nobility. such invitations became less cordial--less frequent--in time they ceased altogether. the widow of the unfortunate count berlifitzing was even heard to express a hope “that the baron might be at home when he did not wish to be at home, since he disdained the company of his equals; and ride when he did not wish to ride, since he preferred the society of a horse.” this to be sure was a very silly explosion of hereditary pique; and merely proved how singularly unmeaning our sayings are apt to become, when we desire to be unusually energetic. the charitable, nevertheless, attributed the alteration in the conduct of the young nobleman to the natural sorrow of a son for the untimely loss of his parents--forgetting, however, his atrocious and reckless behavior during the short period immediately succeeding that bereavement. some there were, indeed, who suggested a too haughty idea of self-consequence and dignity. others again (among them may be mentioned the family physician) did not hesitate in speaking of morbid melancholy, and hereditary ill-health; while dark hints, of a more equivocal nature, were current among the multitude. indeed, the baron’s perverse attachment to his lately-acquired charger--an attachment which seemed to attain new strength from every fresh example of the animal’s ferocious and demon-like propensities--at length became, in the eyes of all reasonable men, a hideous and unnatural fervor. in the glare of noon--at the dead hour of night--in sickness or in health--in calm or in tempest--the young metzengerstein seemed rivetted to the saddle of that colossal horse, whose intractable audacities so well accorded with his own spirit. there were circumstances, moreover, which coupled with late events, gave an unearthly and portentous character to the mania of the rider, and to the capabilities of the steed. the space passed over in a single leap had been accurately measured, and was found to exceed, by an astounding difference, the wildest expectations of the most imaginative. the baron, besides, had no particular _name_ for the animal, although all the rest in his collection were distinguished by characteristic appellations. his stable, too, was appointed at a distance from the rest; and with regard to grooming and other necessary offices, none but the owner in person had ventured to officiate, or even to enter the enclosure of that particular stall. it was also to be observed, that although the three grooms, who had caught the steed as he fled from the conflagration at berlifitzing, had succeeded in arresting his course, by means of a chain-bridle and noose--yet no one of the three could with any certainty affirm that he had, during that dangerous struggle, or at any period thereafter, actually placed his hand upon the body of the beast. instances of peculiar intelligence in the demeanor of a noble and high-spirited horse are not to be supposed capable of exciting unreasonable attention--especially among men who, daily trained to the labors of the chase, might appear well acquainted with the sagacity of a horse--but there were certain circumstances which intruded themselves per force upon the most skeptical and phlegmatic; and it is said there were times when the animal caused the gaping crowd who stood around to recoil in horror from the deep and impressive meaning of his terrible stamp--times when the young metzengerstein turned pale and shrunk away from the rapid and searching expression of his earnest and human-looking eye. among all the retinue of the baron, however, none were found to doubt the ardor of that extraordinary affection which existed on the part of the young nobleman for the fiery qualities of his horse; at least, none but an insignificant and misshapen little page, whose deformities were in everybody’s way, and whose opinions were of the least possible importance. he--if his ideas are worth mentioning at all--had the effrontery to assert that his master never vaulted into the saddle without an unaccountable and almost imperceptible shudder, and that, upon his return from every long-continued and habitual ride, an expression of triumphant malignity distorted every muscle in his countenance. one tempestuous night, metzengerstein, awaking from a heavy slumber, descended like a maniac from his chamber, and, mounting in hot haste, bounded away into the mazes of the forest. an occurrence so common attracted no particular attention, but his return was looked for with intense anxiety on the part of his domestics, when, after some hours’ absence, the stupendous and magnificent battlements of the chateau metzengerstein, were discovered crackling and rocking to their very foundation, under the influence of a dense and livid mass of ungovernable fire. as the flames, when first seen, had already made so terrible a progress that all efforts to save any portion of the building were evidently futile, the astonished neighborhood stood idly around in silent and pathetic wonder. but a new and fearful object soon rivetted the attention of the multitude, and proved how much more intense is the excitement wrought in the feelings of a crowd by the contemplation of human agony, than that brought about by the most appalling spectacles of inanimate matter. up the long avenue of aged oaks which led from the forest to the main entrance of the château metzengerstein, a steed, bearing an unbonneted and disordered rider, was seen leaping with an impetuosity which outstripped the very demon of the tempest. the career of the horseman was indisputably, on his own part, uncontrollable. the agony of his countenance, the convulsive struggle of his frame, gave evidence of superhuman exertion: but no sound, save a solitary shriek, escaped from his lacerated lips, which were bitten through and through in the intensity of terror. one instant, and the clattering of hoofs resounded sharply and shrilly above the roaring of the flames and the shrieking of the winds--another, and, clearing at a single plunge the gate-way and the moat, the steed bounded far up the tottering staircases of the palace, and, with its rider, disappeared amid the whirlwind of chaotic fire. the fury of the tempest immediately died away, and a dead calm sullenly succeeded. a white flame still enveloped the building like a shroud, and, streaming far away into the quiet atmosphere, shot forth a glare of preternatural light; while a cloud of smoke settled heavily over the battlements in the distinct colossal figure of--_a horse_. the system of doctor tarr and professor fether during the autumn of <UNK> while on a tour through the extreme southern provinces of france, my route led me within a few miles of a certain maison de sante or private mad-house, about which i had heard much in paris from my medical friends. as i had never visited a place of the kind, i thought the opportunity too good to be lost; and so proposed to my travelling companion (a gentleman with whom i had made casual acquaintance a few days before) that we should turn aside, for an hour or so, and look through the establishment. to this he objected--pleading haste in the first place, and, in the second, a very usual horror at the sight of a lunatic. he begged me, however, not to let any mere courtesy towards himself interfere with the gratification of my curiosity, and said that he would ride on leisurely, so that i might overtake him during the day, or, at all events, during the next. as he bade me good-bye, i bethought me that there might be some difficulty in obtaining access to the premises, and mentioned my fears on this point. he replied that, in fact, unless i had personal knowledge of the superintendent, monsieur maillard, or some credential in the way of a letter, a difficulty might be found to exist, as the regulations of these private mad-houses were more rigid than the public hospital laws. for himself, he added, he had, some years since, made the acquaintance of maillard, and would so far assist me as to ride up to the door and introduce me; although his feelings on the subject of lunacy would not permit of his entering the house. i thanked him, and, turning from the main road, we entered a grass-grown by-path, which, in half an hour, nearly lost itself in a dense forest, clothing the base of a mountain. through this dank and gloomy wood we rode some two miles, when the maison de sante came in view. it was a fantastic chateau, much dilapidated, and indeed scarcely tenantable through age and neglect. its aspect inspired me with absolute dread, and, checking my horse, i half resolved to turn back. i soon, however, grew ashamed of my weakness, and proceeded. as we rode up to the gate-way, i perceived it slightly open, and the visage of a man peering through. in an instant afterward, this man came forth, accosted my companion by name, shook him cordially by the hand, and begged him to alight. it was monsieur maillard himself. he was a portly, fine-looking gentleman of the old school, with a polished manner, and a certain air of gravity, dignity, and authority which was very impressive. my friend, having presented me, mentioned my desire to inspect the establishment, and received monsieur maillard’s assurance that he would show me all attention, now took leave, and i saw him no more. when he had gone, the superintendent ushered me into a small and exceedingly neat parlor, containing, among other indications of refined taste, many books, drawings, pots of flowers, and musical instruments. a cheerful fire blazed upon the hearth. at a piano, singing an aria from bellini, sat a young and very beautiful woman, who, at my entrance, paused in her song, and received me with graceful courtesy. her voice was low, and her whole manner subdued. i thought, too, that i perceived the traces of sorrow in her countenance, which was excessively, although to my taste, not unpleasingly, pale. she was attired in deep mourning, and excited in my bosom a feeling of mingled respect, interest, and admiration. i had heard, at paris, that the institution of monsieur maillard was managed upon what is vulgarly termed the “system of soothing”--that all punishments were avoided--that even confinement was seldom resorted to--that the patients, while secretly watched, were left much apparent liberty, and that most of them were permitted to roam about the house and grounds in the ordinary apparel of persons in right mind. keeping these impressions in view, i was cautious in what i said before the young lady; for i could not be sure that she was sane; and, in fact, there was a certain restless brilliancy about her eyes which half led me to imagine she was not. i confined my remarks, therefore, to general topics, and to such as i thought would not be displeasing or exciting even to a lunatic. she replied in a perfectly rational manner to all that i said; and even her original observations were marked with the soundest good sense, but a long acquaintance with the metaphysics of mania, had taught me to put no faith in such evidence of sanity, and i continued to practise, throughout the interview, the caution with which i commenced it. presently a smart footman in livery brought in a tray with fruit, wine, and other refreshments, of which i partook, the lady soon afterward leaving the room. as she departed i turned my eyes in an inquiring manner toward my host. “no,” he said, “oh, no--a member of my family--my niece, and a most accomplished woman.” “i beg a thousand pardons for the suspicion,” i replied, “but of course you will know how to excuse me. the excellent administration of your affairs here is well understood in paris, and i thought it just possible, you know-- “yes, yes--say no more--or rather it is myself who should thank you for the commendable prudence you have displayed. we seldom find so much of forethought in young men; and, more than once, some unhappy contre-temps has occurred in consequence of thoughtlessness on the part of our visitors. while my former system was in operation, and my patients were permitted the privilege of roaming to and fro at will, they were often aroused to a dangerous frenzy by injudicious persons who called to inspect the house. hence i was obliged to enforce a rigid system of exclusion; and none obtained access to the premises upon whose discretion i could not rely.” “while your former system was in operation!” i said, repeating his words--“do i understand you, then, to say that the ‘soothing system’ of which i have heard so much is no longer in force?” “it is now,” he replied, “several weeks since we have concluded to renounce it forever.” “indeed! you astonish me!” “we found it, sir,” he said, with a sigh, “absolutely necessary to return to the old usages. the danger of the soothing system was, at all times, appalling; and its advantages have been much overrated. i believe, sir, that in this house it has been given a fair trial, if ever in any. we did every thing that rational humanity could suggest. i am sorry that you could not have paid us a visit at an earlier period, that you might have judged for yourself. but i presume you are conversant with the soothing practice--with its details.” “not altogether. what i have heard has been at third or fourth hand.” “i may state the system, then, in general terms, as one in which the patients were menages-humored. we contradicted no fancies which entered the brains of the mad. on the contrary, we not only indulged but encouraged them; and many of our most permanent cures have been thus effected. there is no argument which so touches the feeble reason of the madman as the argumentum ad absurdum. we have had men, for example, who fancied themselves chickens. the cure was, to insist upon the thing as a fact--to accuse the patient of stupidity in not sufficiently perceiving it to be a fact--and thus to refuse him any other diet for a week than that which properly appertains to a chicken. in this manner a little corn and gravel were made to perform wonders.” “but was this species of acquiescence all?” “by no means. we put much faith in amusements of a simple kind, such as music, dancing, gymnastic exercises generally, cards, certain classes of books, and so forth. we affected to treat each individual as if for some ordinary physical disorder, and the word ‘lunacy’ was never employed. a great point was to set each lunatic to guard the actions of all the others. to repose confidence in the understanding or discretion of a madman, is to gain him body and soul. in this way we were enabled to dispense with an expensive body of keepers.” “and you had no punishments of any kind?” “none.” “and you never confined your patients?” “very rarely. now and then, the malady of some individual growing to a crisis, or taking a sudden turn of fury, we conveyed him to a secret cell, lest his disorder should infect the rest, and there kept him until we could dismiss him to his friends--for with the raging maniac we have nothing to do. he is usually removed to the public hospitals.” “and you have now changed all this--and you think for the better?” “decidedly. the system had its disadvantages, and even its dangers. it is now, happily, exploded throughout all the maisons de sante of france.” “i am very much surprised,” i said, “at what you tell me; for i made sure that, at this moment, no other method of treatment for mania existed in any portion of the country.” “you are young yet, my friend,” replied my host, “but the time will arrive when you will learn to judge for yourself of what is going on in the world, without trusting to the gossip of others. believe nothing you hear, and only one-half that you see. now about our maisons de sante, it is clear that some ignoramus has misled you. after dinner, however, when you have sufficiently recovered from the fatigue of your ride, i will be happy to take you over the house, and introduce to you a system which, in my opinion, and in that of every one who has witnessed its operation, is incomparably the most effectual as yet devised.” “your own?” i inquired--“one of your own invention?” “i am proud,” he replied, “to acknowledge that it is--at least in some measure.” in this manner i conversed with monsieur maillard for an hour or two, during which he showed me the gardens and conservatories of the place. “i cannot let you see my patients,” he said, “just at present. to a sensitive mind there is always more or less of the shocking in such exhibitions; and i do not wish to spoil your appetite for dinner. we will dine. i can give you some veal a la menehoult, with cauliflowers in veloute sauce--after that a glass of clos de vougeot--then your nerves will be sufficiently steadied.” at six, dinner was announced; and my host conducted me into a large salle a manger, where a very numerous company were assembled--twenty-five or thirty in all. they were, apparently, people of rank-certainly of high breeding--although their habiliments, i thought, were extravagantly rich, partaking somewhat too much of the ostentatious finery of the vielle cour. i noticed that at least two-thirds of these guests were ladies; and some of the latter were by no means accoutred in what a parisian would consider good taste at the present day. many females, for example, whose age could not have been less than seventy were bedecked with a profusion of jewelry, such as rings, bracelets, and earrings, and wore their bosoms and arms shamefully bare. i observed, too, that very few of the dresses were well made--or, at least, that very few of them fitted the wearers. in looking about, i discovered the interesting girl to whom monsieur maillard had presented me in the little parlor; but my surprise was great to see her wearing a hoop and farthingale, with high-heeled shoes, and a dirty cap of brussels lace, so much too large for her that it gave her face a ridiculously diminutive expression. when i had first seen her, she was attired, most becomingly, in deep mourning. there was an air of oddity, in short, about the dress of the whole party, which, at first, caused me to recur to my original idea of the “soothing system,” and to fancy that monsieur maillard had been willing to deceive me until after dinner, that i might experience no uncomfortable feelings during the repast, at finding myself dining with lunatics; but i remembered having been informed, in paris, that the southern provincialists were a peculiarly eccentric people, with a vast number of antiquated notions; and then, too, upon conversing with several members of the company, my apprehensions were immediately and fully dispelled. the dining-room itself, although perhaps sufficiently comfortable and of good dimensions, had nothing too much of elegance about it. for example, the floor was uncarpeted; in france, however, a carpet is frequently dispensed with. the windows, too, were without curtains; the shutters, being shut, were securely fastened with iron bars, applied diagonally, after the fashion of our ordinary shop-shutters. the apartment, i observed, formed, in itself, a wing of the chateau, and thus the windows were on three sides of the parallelogram, the door being at the other. there were no less than ten windows in all. the table was superbly set out. it was loaded with plate, and more than loaded with delicacies. the profusion was absolutely barbaric. there were meats enough to have feasted the anakim. never, in all my life, had i witnessed so lavish, so wasteful an expenditure of the good things of life. there seemed very little taste, however, in the arrangements; and my eyes, accustomed to quiet lights, were sadly offended by the prodigious glare of a multitude of wax candles, which, in silver candelabra, were deposited upon the table, and all about the room, wherever it was possible to find a place. there were several active servants in attendance; and, upon a large table, at the farther end of the apartment, were seated seven or eight people with fiddles, fifes, trombones, and a drum. these fellows annoyed me very much, at intervals, during the repast, by an infinite variety of noises, which were intended for music, and which appeared to afford much entertainment to all present, with the exception of myself. upon the whole, i could not help thinking that there was much of the bizarre about every thing i saw--but then the world is made up of all kinds of persons, with all modes of thought, and all sorts of conventional customs. i had travelled, too, so much, as to be quite an adept at the nil admirari; so i took my seat very coolly at the right hand of my host, and, having an excellent appetite, did justice to the good cheer set before me. the conversation, in the meantime, was spirited and general. the ladies, as usual, talked a great deal. i soon found that nearly all the company were well educated; and my host was a world of good-humored anecdote in himself. he seemed quite willing to speak of his position as superintendent of a maison de sante; and, indeed, the topic of lunacy was, much to my surprise, a favorite one with all present. a great many amusing stories were told, having reference to the whims of the patients. “we had a fellow here once,” said a fat little gentleman, who sat at my right,--“a fellow that fancied himself a tea-pot; and by the way, is it not especially singular how often this particular crotchet has entered the brain of the lunatic? there is scarcely an insane asylum in france which cannot supply a human tea-pot. our gentleman was a britannia--ware tea-pot, and was careful to polish himself every morning with buckskin and whiting.” “and then,” said a tall man just opposite, “we had here, not long ago, a person who had taken it into his head that he was a donkey--which allegorically speaking, you will say, was quite true. he was a troublesome patient; and we had much ado to keep him within bounds. for a long time he would eat nothing but thistles; but of this idea we soon cured him by insisting upon his eating nothing else. then he was perpetually kicking out his heels-so-so-” “mr. de kock! i will thank you to behave yourself!” here interrupted an old lady, who sat next to the speaker. “please keep your feet to yourself! you have spoiled my brocade! is it necessary, pray, to illustrate a remark in so practical a style? our friend here can surely comprehend you without all this. upon my word, you are nearly as great a donkey as the poor unfortunate imagined himself. your acting is very natural, as i live.” “mille pardons! ma’m’selle!” replied monsieur de kock, thus addressed--“a thousand pardons! i had no intention of offending. ma’m’selle laplace--monsieur de kock will do himself the honor of taking wine with you.” here monsieur de kock bowed low, kissed his hand with much ceremony, and took wine with ma’m’selle laplace. “allow me, mon ami,” now said monsieur maillard, addressing myself, “allow me to send you a morsel of this veal a la st. menhoult--you will find it particularly fine.” at this instant three sturdy waiters had just succeeded in depositing safely upon the table an enormous dish, or trencher, containing what i supposed to be the “monstrum horrendum, informe, ingens, cui lumen ademptum.” a closer scrutiny assured me, however, that it was only a small calf roasted whole, and set upon its knees, with an apple in its mouth, as is the english fashion of dressing a hare. “thank you, no,” i replied; “to say the truth, i am not particularly partial to veal a la st.--what is it?--for i do not find that it altogether agrees with me. i will change my plate, however, and try some of the rabbit.” there were several side-dishes on the table, containing what appeared to be the ordinary french rabbit--a very delicious morceau, which i can recommend. “pierre,” cried the host, “change this gentleman’s plate, and give him a side-piece of this rabbit au-chat.” “this what?” said i. “this rabbit au-chat.” “why, thank you--upon second thoughts, no. i will just help myself to some of the ham.” there is no knowing what one eats, thought i to myself, at the tables of these people of the province. i will have none of their rabbit au-chat--and, for the matter of that, none of their cat-au-rabbit either. “and then,” said a cadaverous looking personage, near the foot of the table, taking up the thread of the conversation where it had been broken off,--“and then, among other oddities, we had a patient, once upon a time, who very pertinaciously maintained himself to be a cordova cheese, and went about, with a knife in his hand, soliciting his friends to try a small slice from the middle of his leg.” “he was a great fool, beyond doubt,” interposed some one, “but not to be compared with a certain individual whom we all know, with the exception of this strange gentleman. i mean the man who took himself for a bottle of champagne, and always went off with a pop and a fizz, in this fashion.” here the speaker, very rudely, as i thought, put his right thumb in his left cheek, withdrew it with a sound resembling the popping of a cork, and then, by a dexterous movement of the tongue upon the teeth, created a sharp hissing and fizzing, which lasted for several minutes, in imitation of the frothing of champagne. this behavior, i saw plainly, was not very pleasing to monsieur maillard; but that gentleman said nothing, and the conversation was resumed by a very lean little man in a big wig. “and then there was an ignoramus,” said he, “who mistook himself for a frog, which, by the way, he resembled in no little degree. i wish you could have seen him, sir,”--here the speaker addressed myself--“it would have done your heart good to see the natural airs that he put on. sir, if that man was not a frog, i can only observe that it is a pity he was not. his croak thus--o-o-o-o-gh--o-o-o-o-gh! was the finest note in the world--b flat; and when he put his elbows upon the table thus--after taking a glass or two of wine--and distended his mouth, thus, and rolled up his eyes, thus, and winked them with excessive rapidity, thus, why then, sir, i take it upon myself to say, positively, that you would have been lost in admiration of the genius of the man.” “i have no doubt of it,” i said. “and then,” said somebody else, “then there was petit gaillard, who thought himself a pinch of snuff, and was truly distressed because he could not take himself between his own finger and thumb.” “and then there was jules desoulieres, who was a very singular genius, indeed, and went mad with the idea that he was a pumpkin. he persecuted the cook to make him up into pies--a thing which the cook indignantly refused to do. for my part, i am by no means sure that a pumpkin pie a la desoulieres would not have been very capital eating indeed!” “you astonish me!” said i; and i looked inquisitively at monsieur maillard. “ha! ha! ha!” said that gentleman--“he! he! he!--hi! hi! hi!--ho! ho! ho!--hu! hu! hu! hu!--very good indeed! you must not be astonished, mon ami; our friend here is a wit--a drole--you must not understand him to the letter.” “and then,” said some other one of the party,--“then there was bouffon le grand--another extraordinary personage in his way. he grew deranged through love, and fancied himself possessed of two heads. one of these he maintained to be the head of cicero; the other he imagined a composite one, being demosthenes’ from the top of the forehead to the mouth, and lord brougham’s from the mouth to the chin. it is not impossible that he was wrong; but he would have convinced you of his being in the right; for he was a man of great eloquence. he had an absolute passion for oratory, and could not refrain from display. for example, he used to leap upon the dinner-table thus, and--and-” here a friend, at the side of the speaker, put a hand upon his shoulder and whispered a few words in his ear, upon which he ceased talking with great suddenness, and sank back within his chair. “and then,” said the friend who had whispered, “there was boullard, the tee-totum. i call him the tee-totum because, in fact, he was seized with the droll but not altogether irrational crotchet, that he had been converted into a tee-totum. you would have roared with laughter to see him spin. he would turn round upon one heel by the hour, in this manner--so--” here the friend whom he had just interrupted by a whisper, performed an exactly similar office for himself. “but then,” cried the old lady, at the top of her voice, “your monsieur boullard was a madman, and a very silly madman at best; for who, allow me to ask you, ever heard of a human tee-totum? the thing is absurd. madame joyeuse was a more sensible person, as you know. she had a crotchet, but it was instinct with common sense, and gave pleasure to all who had the honor of her acquaintance. she found, upon mature deliberation, that, by some accident, she had been turned into a chicken-cock; but, as such, she behaved with propriety. she flapped her wings with prodigious effect--so--so--and, as for her crow, it was delicious! cock-a-doodle-doo!--cock-a-doodle-doo!--cock-a-doodle-de-doo dooo-do-o-o-o-o-o-o!” “madame joyeuse, i will thank you to behave yourself!” here interrupted our host, very angrily. “you can either conduct yourself as a lady should do, or you can quit the table forthwith-take your choice.” the lady (whom i was much astonished to hear addressed as madame joyeuse, after the description of madame joyeuse she had just given) blushed up to the eyebrows, and seemed exceedingly abashed at the reproof. she hung down her head, and said not a syllable in reply. but another and younger lady resumed the theme. it was my beautiful girl of the little parlor. “oh, madame joyeuse was a fool!” she exclaimed, “but there was really much sound sense, after all, in the opinion of eugenie salsafette. she was a very beautiful and painfully modest young lady, who thought the ordinary mode of habiliment indecent, and wished to dress herself, always, by getting outside instead of inside of her clothes. it is a thing very easily done, after all. you have only to do so--and then so--so--so--and then so--so--so--and then so--so--and then-- “mon dieu! ma’m’selle salsafette!” here cried a dozen voices at once. “what are you about?--forbear!--that is sufficient!--we see, very plainly, how it is done!--hold! hold!” and several persons were already leaping from their seats to withhold ma’m’selle salsafette from putting herself upon a par with the medicean venus, when the point was very effectually and suddenly accomplished by a series of loud screams, or yells, from some portion of the main body of the chateau. my nerves were very much affected, indeed, by these yells; but the rest of the company i really pitied. i never saw any set of reasonable people so thoroughly frightened in my life. they all grew as pale as so many corpses, and, shrinking within their seats, sat quivering and gibbering with terror, and listening for a repetition of the sound. it came again--louder and seemingly nearer--and then a third time very loud, and then a fourth time with a vigor evidently diminished. at this apparent dying away of the noise, the spirits of the company were immediately regained, and all was life and anecdote as before. i now ventured to inquire the cause of the disturbance. “a mere bagtelle,” said monsieur maillard. “we are used to these things, and care really very little about them. the lunatics, every now and then, get up a howl in concert; one starting another, as is sometimes the case with a bevy of dogs at night. it occasionally happens, however, that the concerto yells are succeeded by a simultaneous effort at breaking loose, when, of course, some little danger is to be apprehended.” “and how many have you in charge?” “at present we have not more than ten, altogether.” “principally females, i presume?” “oh, no--every one of them men, and stout fellows, too, i can tell you.” “indeed! i have always understood that the majority of lunatics were of the gentler sex.” “it is generally so, but not always. some time ago, there were about twenty-seven patients here; and, of that number, no less than eighteen were women; but, lately, matters have changed very much, as you see.” “yes--have changed very much, as you see,” here interrupted the gentleman who had broken the shins of ma’m’selle laplace. “yes--have changed very much, as you see!” chimed in the whole company at once. “hold your tongues, every one of you!” said my host, in a great rage. whereupon the whole company maintained a dead silence for nearly a minute. as for one lady, she obeyed monsieur maillard to the letter, and thrusting out her tongue, which was an excessively long one, held it very resignedly, with both hands, until the end of the entertainment. “and this gentlewoman,” said i, to monsieur maillard, bending over and addressing him in a whisper--“this good lady who has just spoken, and who gives us the cock-a-doodle-de-doo--she, i presume, is harmless--quite harmless, eh?” “harmless!” ejaculated he, in unfeigned surprise, “why--why, what can you mean?” “only slightly touched?” said i, touching my head. “i take it for granted that she is not particularly not dangerously affected, eh?” “mon dieu! what is it you imagine? this lady, my particular old friend madame joyeuse, is as absolutely sane as myself. she has her little eccentricities, to be sure--but then, you know, all old women--all very old women--are more or less eccentric!” “to be sure,” said i,--“to be sure--and then the rest of these ladies and gentlemen-” “are my friends and keepers,” interupted monsieur maillard, drawing himself up with hauteur,--“my very good friends and assistants.” “what! all of them?” i asked,--“the women and all?” “assuredly,” he said,--“we could not do at all without the women; they are the best lunatic nurses in the world; they have a way of their own, you know; their bright eyes have a marvellous effect;--something like the fascination of the snake, you know.” “to be sure,” said i,--“to be sure! they behave a little odd, eh?--they are a little queer, eh?--don’t you think so?” “odd!--queer!--why, do you really think so? we are not very prudish, to be sure, here in the south--do pretty much as we please--enjoy life, and all that sort of thing, you know-” “to be sure,” said i,--“to be sure.” “and then, perhaps, this clos de vougeot is a little heady, you know--a little strong--you understand, eh?” “to be sure,” said i,--“to be sure. by the bye, monsieur, did i understand you to say that the system you have adopted, in place of the celebrated soothing system, was one of very rigorous severity?” “by no means. our confinement is necessarily close; but the treatment--the medical treatment, i mean--is rather agreeable to the patients than otherwise.” “and the new system is one of your own invention?” “not altogether. some portions of it are referable to professor tarr, of whom you have, necessarily, heard; and, again, there are modifications in my plan which i am happy to acknowledge as belonging of right to the celebrated fether, with whom, if i mistake not, you have the honor of an intimate acquaintance.” “i am quite ashamed to confess,” i replied, “that i have never even heard the names of either gentleman before.” “good heavens!” ejaculated my host, drawing back his chair abruptly, and uplifting his hands. “i surely do not hear you aright! you did not intend to say, eh? that you had never heard either of the learned doctor tarr, or of the celebrated professor fether?” “i am forced to acknowledge my ignorance,” i replied; “but the truth should be held inviolate above all things. nevertheless, i feel humbled to the dust, not to be acquainted with the works of these, no doubt, extraordinary men. i will seek out their writings forthwith, and peruse them with deliberate care. monsieur maillard, you have really--i must confess it--you have really--made me ashamed of myself!” and this was the fact. “say no more, my good young friend,” he said kindly, pressing my hand,--“join me now in a glass of sauterne.” we drank. the company followed our example without stint. they chatted--they jested--they laughed--they perpetrated a thousand absurdities--the fiddles shrieked--the drum row-de-dowed--the trombones bellowed like so many brazen bulls of phalaris--and the whole scene, growing gradually worse and worse, as the wines gained the ascendancy, became at length a sort of pandemonium in petto. in the meantime, monsieur maillard and myself, with some bottles of sauterne and vougeot between us, continued our conversation at the top of the voice. a word spoken in an ordinary key stood no more chance of being heard than the voice of a fish from the bottom of niagara falls. “and, sir,” said i, screaming in his ear, “you mentioned something before dinner about the danger incurred in the old system of soothing. how is that?” “yes,” he replied, “there was, occasionally, very great danger indeed. there is no accounting for the caprices of madmen; and, in my opinion as well as in that of dr. tarr and professor fether, it is never safe to permit them to run at large unattended. a lunatic may be ‘soothed,’ as it is called, for a time, but, in the end, he is very apt to become obstreperous. his cunning, too, is proverbial and great. if he has a project in view, he conceals his design with a marvellous wisdom; and the dexterity with which he counterfeits sanity, presents, to the metaphysician, one of the most singular problems in the study of mind. when a madman appears thoroughly sane, indeed, it is high time to put him in a straitjacket.” “but the danger, my dear sir, of which you were speaking, in your own experience--during your control of this house--have you had practical reason to think liberty hazardous in the case of a lunatic?” “here?--in my own experience?--why, i may say, yes. for example:--no very long while ago, a singular circumstance occurred in this very house. the ‘soothing system,’ you know, was then in operation, and the patients were at large. they behaved remarkably well-especially so, any one of sense might have known that some devilish scheme was brewing from that particular fact, that the fellows behaved so remarkably well. and, sure enough, one fine morning the keepers found themselves pinioned hand and foot, and thrown into the cells, where they were attended, as if they were the lunatics, by the lunatics themselves, who had usurped the offices of the keepers.” “you don’t tell me so! i never heard of any thing so absurd in my life!” “fact--it all came to pass by means of a stupid fellow--a lunatic--who, by some means, had taken it into his head that he had invented a better system of government than any ever heard of before--of lunatic government, i mean. he wished to give his invention a trial, i suppose, and so he persuaded the rest of the patients to join him in a conspiracy for the overthrow of the reigning powers.” “and he really succeeded?” “no doubt of it. the keepers and kept were soon made to exchange places. not that exactly either--for the madmen had been free, but the keepers were shut up in cells forthwith, and treated, i am sorry to say, in a very cavalier manner.” “but i presume a counter-revolution was soon effected. this condition of things could not have long existed. the country people in the neighborhood-visitors coming to see the establishment--would have given the alarm.” “there you are out. the head rebel was too cunning for that. he admitted no visitors at all--with the exception, one day, of a very stupid-looking young gentleman of whom he had no reason to be afraid. he let him in to see the place--just by way of variety,--to have a little fun with him. as soon as he had gammoned him sufficiently, he let him out, and sent him about his business.” “and how long, then, did the madmen reign?” “oh, a very long time, indeed--a month certainly--how much longer i can’t precisely say. in the meantime, the lunatics had a jolly season of it--that you may swear. they doffed their own shabby clothes, and made free with the family wardrobe and jewels. the cellars of the chateau were well stocked with wine; and these madmen are just the devils that know how to drink it. they lived well, i can tell you.” “and the treatment--what was the particular species of treatment which the leader of the rebels put into operation?” “why, as for that, a madman is not necessarily a fool, as i have already observed; and it is my honest opinion that his treatment was a much better treatment than that which it superseded. it was a very capital system indeed--simple--neat--no trouble at all--in fact it was delicious it was.” here my host’s observations were cut short by another series of yells, of the same character as those which had previously disconcerted us. this time, however, they seemed to proceed from persons rapidly approaching. “gracious heavens!” i ejaculated--“the lunatics have most undoubtedly broken loose.” “i very much fear it is so,” replied monsieur maillard, now becoming excessively pale. he had scarcely finished the sentence, before loud shouts and imprecations were heard beneath the windows; and, immediately afterward, it became evident that some persons outside were endeavoring to gain entrance into the room. the door was beaten with what appeared to be a sledge-hammer, and the shutters were wrenched and shaken with prodigious violence. a scene of the most terrible confusion ensued. monsieur maillard, to my excessive astonishment threw himself under the side-board. i had expected more resolution at his hands. the members of the orchestra, who, for the last fifteen minutes, had been seemingly too much intoxicated to do duty, now sprang all at once to their feet and to their instruments, and, scrambling upon their table, broke out, with one accord, into, “yankee doodle,” which they performed, if not exactly in tune, at least with an energy superhuman, during the whole of the uproar. meantime, upon the main dining-table, among the bottles and glasses, leaped the gentleman who, with such difficulty, had been restrained from leaping there before. as soon as he fairly settled himself, he commenced an oration, which, no doubt, was a very capital one, if it could only have been heard. at the same moment, the man with the teetotum predilection, set himself to spinning around the apartment, with immense energy, and with arms outstretched at right angles with his body; so that he had all the air of a tee-totum in fact, and knocked everybody down that happened to get in his way. and now, too, hearing an incredible popping and fizzing of champagne, i discovered at length, that it proceeded from the person who performed the bottle of that delicate drink during dinner. and then, again, the frog-man croaked away as if the salvation of his soul depended upon every note that he uttered. and, in the midst of all this, the continuous braying of a donkey arose over all. as for my old friend, madame joyeuse, i really could have wept for the poor lady, she appeared so terribly perplexed. all she did, however, was to stand up in a corner, by the fireplace, and sing out incessantly at the top of her voice, “cock-a-doodle-de-dooooooh!” and now came the climax--the catastrophe of the drama. as no resistance, beyond whooping and yelling and cock-a-doodling, was offered to the encroachments of the party without, the ten windows were very speedily, and almost simultaneously, broken in. but i shall never forget the emotions of wonder and horror with which i gazed, when, leaping through these windows, and down among us pele-mele, fighting, stamping, scratching, and howling, there rushed a perfect army of what i took to be chimpanzees, ourang-outangs, or big black baboons of the cape of good hope. i received a terrible beating--after which i rolled under a sofa and lay still. after lying there some fifteen minutes, during which time i listened with all my ears to what was going on in the room, i came to same satisfactory denouement of this tragedy. monsieur maillard, it appeared, in giving me the account of the lunatic who had excited his fellows to rebellion, had been merely relating his own exploits. this gentleman had, indeed, some two or three years before, been the superintendent of the establishment, but grew crazy himself, and so became a patient. this fact was unknown to the travelling companion who introduced me. the keepers, ten in number, having been suddenly overpowered, were first well tarred, then--carefully feathered, and then shut up in underground cells. they had been so imprisoned for more than a month, during which period monsieur maillard had generously allowed them not only the tar and feathers (which constituted his “system”), but some bread and abundance of water. the latter was pumped on them daily. at length, one escaping through a sewer, gave freedom to all the rest. the “soothing system,” with important modifications, has been resumed at the chateau; yet i cannot help agreeing with monsieur maillard, that his own “treatment” was a very capital one of its kind. as he justly observed, it was “simple--neat--and gave no trouble at all--not the least.” i have only to add that, although i have searched every library in europe for the works of doctor tarr and professor fether, i have, up to the present day, utterly failed in my endeavors at procuring an edition. the literary life of thingum bob, esq. late editor of the “goosetherumfoodle.” by himself i am now growing in years, and--since i understand that shakespeare and mr. emmons are deceased--it is not impossible that i may even die. it has occurred to me, therefore, that i may as well retire from the field of letters and repose upon my laurels. but i am ambitious of signalizing my abdication of the literary sceptre by some important bequest to posterity; and, perhaps, i cannot do a better thing than just pen for it an account of my earlier career. my name, indeed, has been so long and so constantly before the public eye, that i am not only willing to admit the naturalness of the interest which it has everywhere excited, but ready to satisfy the extreme curiosity which it has inspired. in fact, it is no more than the duty of him who achieves greatness to leave behind him, in his ascent, such landmarks as may guide others to be great. i propose, therefore, in the present paper, (which i had some idea of calling “memoranda to serve for the literary history of america,”) to give a detail of those important, yet feeble and tottering first steps, by which, at length, i attained the high road to the pinnacle of human renown. of one’s very remote ancestors it is superfluous to say much. my father, thomas bob, esq., stood for many years at the summit of his profession, which was that of a merchant-barber, in the city of smug. his warehouse was the resort of all the principal people of the place, and especially of the editorial corps--a body which inspires all about it with profound veneration and awe. for my own part, i regarded them as gods, and drank in with avidity the rich wit and wisdom which continuously flowed from their august mouths during the process of what is styled “lather.” my first moment of positive inspiration must be dated from that ever-memorable epoch, when the brilliant conductor of the “gad-fly,” in the intervals of the important process just mentioned, recited aloud, before a conclave of our apprentices, an inimitable poem in honor of the “only genuine oil-of-bob,” (so called from its talented inventor, my father,) and for which effusion the editor of the “fly” was remunerated with a regal liberality by the firm of thomas bob and company, merchant-barbers. the genius of the stanzas to the “oil-of-bob” first breathed into me, i say, the divine _afflatus_. i resolved at once to become a great man and to commence by becoming a great poet. that very evening i fell upon my knees at the feet of my father. “father,” i said, “pardon me!--but i have a soul above lather. it is my firm intention to cut the shop. i would be an editor--i would be a poet--i would pen stanzas to the ‘oil-of-bob.’ pardon me and aid me to be great!” “my dear thingum,” replied my father, (i had been christened thingum after a wealthy relative so surnamed,) “my dear thingum,” he said, raising me from my knees by the ears--“thingum, my boy, you’re a trump, and take after your father in having a soul. you have an immense head, too, and it must hold a great many brains. this i have long seen, and therefore had thoughts of making you a lawyer. the business, however, has grown ungenteel, and that of a politician don’t pay. upon the whole you judge wisely;--the trade of editor is best:--and if you can be a poet at the same time,--as most of the editors are, by the by,--why you will kill two birds with one stone. to encourage you in the beginning of things, i will allow you a garret; pen, ink and paper; a rhyming dictionary; and a copy of the ‘gad-fly.’ i suppose you would scarcely demand any more.” “i would be an ungrateful villain if i did,” i replied with enthusiasm. “your generosity is boundless. i will repay it by making you the father of a genius.” thus ended my conference with the best of men, and immediately upon its termination, i betook myself with zeal to my poetical labors; as upon these, chiefly, i founded my hopes of ultimate elevation to the editorial chair. in my first attempts at composition i found the stanzas to “the oil-of-bob” rather a draw-back than otherwise. their splendor more dazzled than enlightened me. the contemplation of their excellence tended, naturally, to discourage me by comparison with my own abortions; so that for a long time i labored in vain. at length there came into my head one of those exquisitely original ideas which now and then _will_ permeate the brain of a man of genius. it was this:--or, rather, thus was it carried into execution. from the rubbish of an old book-stall, in a very remote corner of the town, i got together several antique and altogether unknown or forgotten volumes. the bookseller sold them to me for a song. from one of these, which purported to be a translation of one dante’s “inferno,” i copied with remarkable neatness a long passage about a man named ugolino, who had a parcel of brats. from another which contained a good many old plays by some person whose name i forget, i extracted in the same manner, and with the same care, a great number of lines about “angels” and “ministers saying grace,” and “goblins damned,” and more besides of that sort. from a third, which was the composition of some blind man or other, either a greek or a choctaw--i cannot be at the pains of remembering every trifle exactly--i took about fifty verses beginning with “achilles’ wrath,” and “grease,” and something else. from a fourth, which i recollect was also the work of a blind man, i selected a page or two all about “hail” and “holy light”; and although a blind man has no business to write about light, still the verses were sufficiently good in their way. having made fair copies of these poems’ i signed every one of them “oppodeldoc,” (a fine sonorous name,) and, doing each up nicely in a separate envelope, i despatched one to each of the four principal magazines, with a request for speedy insertion and prompt pay. the result of this well conceived plan, however, (the success of which would have saved me much trouble in after life,) served to convince me that some editors are not to be bamboozled, and gave the _coup-de-grace_ (as they say in france,) to my nascent hopes, (as they say in the city of the transcendentals.) the fact is, that each and every one of the magazines in question, gave mr. “oppodeldoc” a complete using-up, in the “monthly notices to correspondents.” the “hum-drum” gave him a dressing after this fashion: “‘oppodeldoc,’ (whoever he is,) has sent us a long _tirade_ concerning a bedlamite whom he styles ‘ugolino,’ who had a great many children that should have been all whipped and sent to bed without their suppers. the whole affair is exceedingly tame--not to say _flat_. ‘oppodeldoc,’ (whoever he is,) is entirely devoid of imagination--and imagination, in our humble opinion, is not only the soul of poesy, but also its very heart. ‘oppodeldoc,’ (whoever he is,) has the audacity to demand of us, for his twattle, a ‘speedy insertion and prompt pay.’ we neither insert nor purchase any stuff of the sort. there can be no doubt, however, that he would meet with a ready sale for all the balderdash he can scribble, at the office of either the ‘rowdy-dow,’ the ‘lollipop,’ or the ‘goosetherumfoodle.’” all this, it must be acknowledged, was very severe upon “oppodeldoc”--but the unkindest cut was putting the word poesy in small caps. in those five pre-eminent letters what a world of bitterness is there not involved! but “oppodeldoc” was punished with equal severity in the “rowdy-dow,” which spoke thus: “we have received a most singular and insolent communication from a person (whoever he is,) signing himself ‘oppodeldoc’--thus desecrating the greatness of the illustrious roman emperor so named. accompanying the letter of ‘oppodeldoc,’ (whoever he is,) we find sundry lines of most disgusting and unmeaning rant about ‘angels and ministers of grace’--rant such as no madman short of a nat lee, or an ‘oppodeldoc,’ could possibly perpetrate. and for this trash of trash, we are modestly requested to ‘pay promptly.’ no sir--no! we pay for nothing of _that_ sort. apply to the ‘hum-drum,’ the ‘lollipop,’ or the ‘goosetherumfoodle.’ these _periodicals_ will undoubtedly accept any literary offal you may send them--and as undoubtedly _promise_ to pay for it.” this was bitter indeed upon poor “oppodeldoc”; but, in this instance, the weight of the satire falls upon the “humdrum,” the “lollipop,” and the “goosetherumfoodle,” who are pungently styled “_periodicals_”--in italics, too--a thing that must have cut them to the heart. scarcely less savage was the “lollipop,” which thus discoursed: “some _individual_, who rejoices in the appellation ‘oppodeldoc,’ (to what low uses are the names of the illustrious dead too often applied!) has enclosed us some fifty or sixty _verses_ commencing after this fashion:= ````achilles’ wrath, to greece the direful spring ````of woes unnumbered, &c., &c., &c., &c.= “‘oppodeldoc,’ (whoever he is,) is respectfully informed that there is not a printer’s devil in our office who is not in the daily habit of composing better _lines_. those of ‘oppodeldoc’ will not _scan_. ‘oppodeldoc’ should learn to _count_. but why he should have conceived the idea that _we_, (of all others, _we!_) would disgrace our pages with his ineffable nonsense, is utterly beyond comprehension. why, the absurd twattle is scarcely good enough for the ‘hum-drum,’ the ‘rowdy-dow,’ the ‘goosetherumfoodle’--things that are in the practice of publishing ‘mother goose’s melodies’ as original lyrics. and ‘oppodeldoc’ (whoever he is,) has even the assurance to demand _pay_ for this drivel. does ‘oppodeldoc,’ (whoever he is,) know--is he aware that we could not be paid to insert it?” as i perused this i felt myself growing gradually smaller and smaller, and when i came to the point at which the editor sneered at the poem as “verses” there was little more than an ounce of me left. as for “oppodeldoc,” i began to experience _compassion_ for the poor fellow. but the “goosetherumfoodle” showed, if possible, less mercy than the “lollipop.” it was the “goosetherumfoodle” that said: “a wretched poetaster, who signs himself ‘oppodeldoc,’ is silly enough to fancy that _we_ will print and _pay for_ a medley of incoherent and ungrammatical bombast which he has transmitted to us, and which commences with the following most _intelligible_ line:= ````'hail, holy light! offspring of heaven, first born.’= “we say, ‘most _intelligible_’ ‘oppodeldoc,’ (whoever he is,) will be kind enough to tell us, perhaps, how ‘_hail_’ can be ‘_holy light_’ we always regarded it as _frozen rain_. will he inform us, also, how frozen rain can be, at one and the same time, both ‘holy light,’ (whatever that is,) and an ‘offspring?’--which latter term, (if we understand any thing about english,) is only employed, with propriety, in reference to small babies of about six weeks old. but it is preposterous to descant upon such absurdity--although ‘oppodeldoc,’ (whoever he is,) has the unparalleled effrontery to suppose that we will not only ‘insert’ his ignorant ravings, but (absolutely) _pay for them!_ “now this is fine--it is rich!--and we have half a mind to punish this young scribbler for his egotism, by really publishing his effusion, _verbatim et literatim_, as he has written it. we could inflict no punishment so severe, and we _would_ inflict it, but for the boredom which we should cause our readers in so doing. “let ‘oppodeldoc,’ (whoever he is,) send any future _composition_ of like character to the ‘hum-drum,’ the ‘lollipop,’ or the ‘rowdy-dow,’ _they_ will ‘insert’ it. _they_ ‘insert’ every month just such stuff. send it to them. we are not to be insulted with impunity.” this made an end of me; and as for the “humdrum,” the “rowdy-dow,” and the “lollipop,” i never could comprehend how they survived it. the putting _them_ in the smallest possible _minion_, (that was the rub--thereby insinuating their lowness--their baseness,) while we stood looking down upon them in gigantic capitals!--oh it was _too_ bitter!--it was wormwood--it was gall. had i been either of these periodicals i would have spared no pains to have the “goosetherumfoodle” prosecuted. it might have been done under the act for the “prevention of cruelty to animals.” as for “oppodeldoc,” (whoever he was), i had by this time lost all patience with the fellow, and sympathized with him no longer. he was a fool, beyond doubt, (whoever he was,) and got not a kick more than he deserved. the result of my experiment with the old books, convinced me, in the first place, that “honesty is the best policy,” and, in the second, that if i could not write better than mr. dante, and the two blind men, and the rest of the old set, it would, at least, be a difficult matter to write worse. i took heart, therefore, and determined to prosecute the “entirely original,” (as they say on the covers of the magazines,) at whatever cost of study and pains. i again placed before my eyes, as a model, the brilliant stanzas on “the oil-of-bob” by the editor of the “gad-fly,” and resolved to construct an ode on the same sublime theme, in rivalry of what had already been done. with my first verse i had no material difficulty. it ran thus: “to pen an ode upon the ‘oil-of-bob.’” having carefully looked out, however, all the legitimate rhymes to “bob,” i found it impossible to proceed. in this dilemma i had recourse to paternal aid; and, after some hours of mature thought, my father and myself thus constructed the poem:= `````_“to pen an ode upon the “oil-of-bob” `````is all sorts of a job. ``````(signed.) snob._= to be sure, this composition was of no very great length--but i “have yet to learn” as they say in the edinburgh review, that the mere extent of a literary work has any thing to do with its merit. as for the quarterly cant about “sustained effort,” it is impossible to see the sense of it. upon the whole, therefore, i was satisfied with the success of my maiden attempt, and now the only question regarded the disposal i should make of it. my father suggested that i should send it to the “gad-fly”--but there were two reasons which operated to prevent me from so doing. i dreaded the jealousy of the editor--and i had ascertained that he did not pay for original contributions. i therefore, after due deliberation, consigned the article to the more dignified pages of the “lollipop,” and awaited the event in anxiety, but with resignation. in the very next published number i had the proud satisfaction of seeing my poem printed at length, as the leading article, with the following significant words, prefixed in italics and between brackets: _we call the attention of our readers to the subjoined admirable stanza on “the oil of bob.” we need say nothing of their sublimity, or their pathos:--it is impossible to peruse them without tears. those who have been nauseated with a sad dose on the same august topic from the goose quill of the editor of the “gad fly” will do well to compare the two compositions. p. s. we are consumed with anxiety to probe the mystery which envelops the evident pseudonym “snob.” may we hope for a personal interview?_ all this was scarcely more than justice, but it was, i confess, rather more than i had expected:--i acknowledged this, be it observed, to the everlasting disgrace of my country and of mankind. i lost no time, however, in calling upon the editor of the “lollipop,” and had the good fortune to find this gentleman at home. he saluted me with an air of profound respect, slightly blended with a fatherly and patronizing admiration, wrought in him, no doubt, by my appearance of extreme youth and inexperience. begging me to be seated, he entered at once upon the subject of my poem;--but modesty will ever forbid me to repeat the thousand compliments which he lavished upon me. the eulogies of mr. crab, (such was the editor’s name,) were, however, by no means fulsomely indiscriminate. he analyzed my composition with much freedom and great ability--not hesitating to point out a few trivial defects--a circumstance which elevated him highly in my esteem. the “gad-fly” was, of course, brought upon the _tapis_, and i hope never to be subjected to a criticism so searching, or to rebukes so withering, as were bestowed by mr. crab upon that unhappy effusion. i had been accustomed to regard the editor of the “gad-fly” as something superhuman; but mr. crab soon disabused me of that idea. he set the literary as well as the personal character of the fly (so mr. c. satirically designated the rival editor,) in its true light. he, the fly, was very little better than he should be. he had written infamous things. he was a penny-a-liner, and a buffoon. he was a villain. he had composed a tragedy which set the whole country in a guffaw, and a farce which deluged the universe in tears. besides all this, he had the impudence to pen what he meant for a lampoon upon himself, (mr. crab,) and the temerity to style him “an ass.” should i at any time wish to express my opinion of mr. fry, the pages of the “lollipop,” mr. crab assured me, were at my unlimited disposal. in the meantime, as it was very certain that i would be attacked in the fly for my attempt at composing a rival poem on the “oil-of-bob,” he (mr. crab,) would take it upon himself to attend, pointedly, to my private and personal interests. if i were not made a man of at once, it should not be the fault of himself, (mr. crab.) mr. crab having now paused in his discourse, (the latter portion of which i found it impossible to comprehend,) i ventured to suggest something about the remuneration which i had been taught to expect for my poem, by an announcement on the cover of the “lollipop,” declaring that it, (the “lollipop,”) “insisted upon being permitted to pay exorbitant prices for all accepted contributions;--frequently expending more money for a single brief poem than the whole annual cost of the ‘humdrum,’ the ‘rowdy-dow,’ and the ‘goosetherumfoodle’ combined.” as i mentioned the word “remuneration,” mr. crab first opened his eyes, and then his mouth, to quite a remarkable extent; causing his personal appearance to resemble that of a highly-agitated elderly duck in the act of quacking;--and in this condition he remained, (ever and anon pressing his hands tightly to his forehead, as if in a state of desperate bewilderment) until i had nearly made an end of what i had to say. upon my conclusion, he sank back into his seat, as if much overcome, letting his arms fall lifelessly by his side, but keeping his mouth still rigorously open, after the fashion of the duck. while i remained in speechless astonishment at behavior so alarming, he suddenly leaped to his feet and made a rush at the bell-rope; but just as he reached this, he appeared to have altered his intention, whatever it was, for he dived under a table and immediately re-appeared with a cudgel. this he was in the act of uplifting, (for what purpose i am at a loss to imagine,) when, all at once, there came a benign smile over his features, and he sank placidly back in his chair. “mr. bob,” he said, (for i had sent up my card before ascending myself,) “mr. bob, you are a young man, i presume--_very?_” i assented; adding that i had not yet concluded my third lustrum. “ah!” he replied, “very good! i see how it is--say no more! touching this matter of compensation, what you observe is very just: in fact it is excessively so. but ah--ah--the _first_ contribution--the _first_, i say,--it is never the magazine custom to pay for--you comprehend, eh? the truth is, we are usually the _recipients_ in such case.” [mr. crab smiled blandly as he emphasized the word “recipients.”] “for the most part, we are _paid_ for the insertion of a maiden attempt--especially in verse. in the second place, mr. bob, the magazine rule is never to disburse what we term in france the _argent comptant_--i have no doubt you understand. in a quarter or two after publication of the article--or in a year or two--we make no objection to giving our note at nine months:--provided always that we can so arrange our affairs as to be quite certain of a ‘burst up’ in six. i really _do_ hope, mr. bob, that you will look upon this explanation as satisfactory.” here mr. crab concluded, and the tears stood in his eyes. grieved to the soul at having been, however innocently, the cause of pain to so eminent and so sensitive a man, i hastened to apologize, and to reassure him, by expressing my perfect coincidence with his views, as well as my entire appreciation of the delicacy of his position. having done all this in a neat speech, i took leave. one fine morning, very shortly afterwards, “i awoke and found myself famous.” the extent of my renown will be best estimated by reference to the editorial opinions of the day. these opinions, it will be seen, were embodied in critical notices of the number of the “lollipop” containing my poem, and are perfectly satisfactory, conclusive and clear with the exception, perhaps, of the hieroglyphical marks, “_sep_. <UNK> t.” appended to each of the critiques. the “owl,” a journal of profound sagacity, and well known for the deliberate gravity of its literary decisions--the “owl,” i say, spoke as follows: _“‘the lollipop!’ the october number of this delicious magazine surpasses its predecessors, and sets competition at defiance. in the beauty of its typography and paper--in the number and excellence of its steel plates--as well as in the literary merit of its contributions--the ‘lollipop’ compares with its slow-paced rivals as hyperion with a satyr. the ‘hum-drum,’ the ‘rowdy-dow,’ and the ‘goosetherumfoodle,’ excel, it is true, in braggadocio, but, in all other points, give us the ‘lollipop!’ how this celebrated journal can sustain its evidently tremendous expenses, is more than we can understand. to be sure, it has a circulation of <UNK> and its subscription-list has increased one-fourth during the last month; but, on the other hand, the sums it disburses constantly for contributions are inconceivable. it is reported that mr. slyass received no less than thirty-seven and a half cents for his inimitable paper on ‘pigs.’ with mr. crab, as editor, and with such names upon the list of contributors as snob and slyass, there can be no such word as ‘fail’ for the lollipop.’ go and subscribe. sep. <UNK> t.”_ i must say that i was gratified with this high-toned notice from a paper so respectable as the “owl.” the placing my name--that is to say, my _nom de guerre_--in priority of station to that of the great slyass, was a compliment as happy as i felt it to be deserved. my attention was next arrested by these paragraphs in the “toad”--a print highly distinguished for its uprightness, and independence--for its entire freedom from sycophancy and subservience to the givers of dinners: _“the ‘lollipop’ for october is out in advance of all its contemporaries, and infinitely surpasses them, of course, in the splendor of its embellishments, as well as in the richness of its literary contents. the ‘hum-drum,’ the ‘rowdy-dow,’ and the ‘goosetherumfoodle’ excel, we admit, in braggadocio, but, in all other points, give us the ‘lollipop. how this celebrated magazine can sustain its evidently tremendous expenses, is more than we can understand. to be sure, it has a circulation of <UNK> and its subscription list has increased one-third during the last fortnight, but on the other hand, the sums it disburses, monthly, for contributions, are fearfully great. we learn that mr. mumblethumb received no less than fifty cents for his late ‘monody in a mud-puddle.’ “among the original contributors to the present number we notice, (besides the eminent editor, mr. crab,) such men as snob, slyass, and mumblethumb. apart from the editorial matter, the most valuable paper, nevertheless, is, we think, a poetical gem by ‘snob, on the ‘oil-of-bob’--but our readers must not suppose from the title of this incomparable _bijou_, that it bears any similitude to some balderdash on the same subject by a certain contemptible individual whose name is unmentionable to ears polite. the _present_ poem ‘on the oil-of-bob,’ has excited universal anxiety and curiosity in respect to the owner of the evident pseudonym, ‘snob’--a curiosity which, happily, we have it in our power to satisfy. ‘snob’ is the nom de plume of mr. thingum bob, of this city,--a relative of the great mr. thingum, (after whom he is named,) and otherwise connected with the most illustrious families of the state. his father, thomas bob, esq., is an opulent merchant in smug. _sep_. <UNK> this generous approbation touched me to the heart--the more especially as it emanated from a source so avowedly--so proverbially pure as the “toad.” the word “balderdash,” as applied to the “oil-of-bob” of the fly, i considered singularly pungent and appropriate. the words “gem” and “_bijou_,” however, used in reference to my composition, struck me as being, in some degree, feeble, and seemed to me to be deficient in force. they were not sufficiently _prononcés_, (as we have it in france). i had hardly finished reading the “toad,” when a friend placed in my hands a copy of the “mole,” a daily, enjoying high reputation for the keenness of its perception about matters in general, and for the open, honest, above-ground style of its editorials. the “mole” spoke of the “lollipop” as follows: _“we have just received the ‘lollipop’ for october, and must say that never before have we perused any single number of any periodical which afforded us a felicity so supreme. we speak advisedly. the ‘hum-drum,’ the ‘rowdy-dow’ and the ‘goosetherumfoodle’ must look well to their laurels. these prints, no doubt, surpass every thing in loudness of pretension, but, in all other points, give us the ‘lollipop!’ how this celebrated magazine can sustain its evidently tremendous expenses, is more than we can comprehend. to be sure, it has a circulation of <UNK> and its subscription-list has increased one-half within the last week, but then the sum it disburses, monthly, for contributions, is astoundingly enormous. we have it upon good authority, that mr. fatquack received no less than sixty-two cents and a half for his late domestic nouvelette, the ‘dish-clout.’ “the contributors to the number before us are mr. crab, (the eminent editor,) snob, mumblethumb, fatquack, and others; but, after the inimitable compositions of the editor himself, we prefer a diamond-like effusion from the pen of a rising poet who writes over the signature ‘snob’--a nom de guerre which we predict will one day extinguish the radiance of ‘boz.’ ‘snob,’ we learn, is a mr. thingum bob, esq., sole heir of a wealthy merchant of this city, thomas bob, esq., and a near relative of the distinguished mr. thingum. the title of mr. b.’s admirable poem is the ‘oil-of-bob’--a somewhat unfortunate name, by-the-by, as some contemptible vagabond connected with the penny press has already disgusted the town with a great deal of drivel upon the same topic. there will be no danger, however, of confounding the compositions. sep. <UNK> t.”_ the generous approbation of so clear-sighted a journal as the “mole” penetrated my soul with delight. the only objection which occurred to me was, that the terms “contemptible vagabond” might have been better written “_odious and_ contemptible, _wretch, villain_ and _vagabond_.” this would have sounded more gracefully, i think. “diamond-like,” also, was scarcely, it will be admitted, of sufficient intensity to express what the “mole” evidently _thought_ of the brilliancy of the “oil-of-bob.” on the same afternoon in which i saw these notices in the “owl,” the “toad,” and the “mole” i happened to meet with a copy of the “daddy-long-legs,” a periodical proverbial for the extreme extent of its understanding. and it was the “daddy-long-legs” which spoke thus: _“the ‘lollipop,’! this gorgeous magazine is already before the public for october. the question of preeminence is forever put to rest, and hereafter it will be excessively preposterous in the ‘hum-drum,’ the ‘rowdy-dow,’ or the ‘goosetherumfoodle,’ to make any farther spasmodic attempts at competition. these journals may excel the ‘lollipop’ in outcry, but, in all other points, give us the ‘lollipop!’ how this celebrated magazine can sustain its evidently tremendous expenses, is past comprehension. to be sure it has a circulation of precisely half a million, and its subscription-list has increased seventy-five per cent, within the last couple of days; but then the sums it disburses, monthly, for contributions, are scarcely credible; we are cognizant of the fact, that mademoiselle cribalittle received no less than eighty-seven cents and a half for her late valuable revolutionary tale, entitled ‘the york-town katy-did, and the bunker-hill katy-didn’t.’ “the most able papers in the present number, are, of course, those furnished by the editor, (the eminent mr. crab,) but there are numerous magnificent contributions from such names as snob, mademoiselle cribalittle, slyass, mrs. fibalittle, mumblethumb, mrs. squibalittle, and last, though not least, fatquack. the world may well be challenged to produce so rich a galaxy of genius. “the poem over the signature ‘snob’ is, we find, attracting universal commendation, and, we are constrained to say, deserves, if possible, even more applause than it has received. the ‘oil-of-bob’ is the title of this masterpiece of eloquence and art. one or two of our readers _may_ have a _very_ faint, although sufficiently disgusting recollection of a poem (?) similarly entitled, the perpetration of a miserable penny-a-liner, mendicant, and cut-throat, connected in the capacity of scullion, we believe, with one of the indecent prints about the purlieus of the city; we beg them, for god’s sake, not to confound the compositions. the author of the ‘oil-of-bob’ is, we hear, thingum bob, esq., a gentleman of high genius, and a scholar. ‘snob’ is merely a _nom-de-guerre. sept_. <UNK> t.”_ i could scarcely restrain my indignation while i perused the concluding portions of this diatribe. it was clear to me that the yea-nay manner--not to say the gentleness--the positive forbearance with which the “daddy-long-legs” spoke of that pig, the editor of the “gad-fly”--it was evident to me, i say, that this gentleness of speech could proceed from nothing else than a partiality for the fly--whom it was clearly the intention of the “daddy-long-legs” to elevate into reputation at my expense. any one, indeed, might perceive, with half an eye, that, had the real design of the “daddy” been what it wished to appear, it, (the “daddy,”) might have expressed itself in terms more direct, more pungent, and altogether more to the purpose. the words “penny-a-liner,” “mendicant,” “scullion,” and “cut-throat,” were epithets so intentionally inexpressive and equivocal, as to be worse than nothing when applied to the author of the very worst stanzas ever penned by one of the human race. we all know what is meant by “damning with faint praise,” and, on the other hand, who could fail seeing through the covert purpose of the “daddy”--that of glorifying with feeble abuse? what the “daddy” chose to say of the fly, however, was no business of mine. what it said of myself _was_. after the noble manner in which the “owl,” the “toad,” the “mole,” had expressed themselves in respect to my ability, it was rather too much to be coolly spoken of by a thing like the “daddy-long-legs,” as merely “a gentleman of high genius and a scholar.” gentleman indeed! i made up my mind at once, either to get a written apology from the “daddy-long-legs,” or to call it out. full of this purpose, i looked about me to find a friend whom i could entrust with a message to his daddyship, and as the editor of the “lollipop” had given me marked tokens of regard, i at length concluded to seek assistance upon the present occasion. i have never yet been able to account, in a manner satisfactory to my own understanding, for the _very_ peculiar countenance and demeanor with which mr. crab listened to me, as i unfolded to him my design. he again went through the scene of the bell-rope and cudgel, and did not omit the duck. at one period i thought he really intended to quack. his fit, nevertheless, finally subsided as before, and he began to act and speak in a rational way. he declined bearing the cartel, however, and in fact, dissuaded me from sending it at all; but was candid enough to admit that the “daddy-long-legs” had been disgracefully in the wrong--more especially in what related to the epithets “gentleman and scholar.” towards the end of this interview with mr. crab, who really appeared to take a paternal interest in my welfare, he suggested to me that i might turn an honest penny, and, at the same time, advance my reputation, by occasionally playing thomas hawk for the “lollipop.” i begged mr. crab to inform me who was mr. thomas hawk, and how it was expected that i should play him. here mr. crab again “made great eyes,” (as we say in germany,) but at length, recovering himself from a profound attack of astonishment, he assured me that he employed the words “thomas hawk” to avoid the colloquialism, tommy, which was low--but that the true idea was tommy hawk--or tomahawk--and that by “playing tomahawk” he referred to scalping, brow-beating and otherwise using-up the herd of poor-devil authors. i assured my patron that, if this was all, i was perfectly resigned to the task of playing thomas hawk. hereupon mr. crab desired me to use-up the editor of the “gad-fly” forthwith, in the fiercest style within the scope of my ability, and as a specimen of my powers. this i did, upon the spot, in a review of the original “oil-of-bob,” occupying thirty-six pages of the “lollipop.” i found playing thomas hawk, indeed, a far less onerous occupation than poetizing; for i went upon _system_ altogether, and thus it was easy to do the thing thoroughly and well. my practice was this. i bought auction copies (cheap) of “lord brougham’s speeches,” “cobbett’s complete works,” the “new slang-syllabus,” the “whole art of snubbing,” “prentice’s billingsgate,” (folio edition,) and “lewis g. clarke on tongue.” these works i cut up thoroughly with a currycomb, and then, throwing the shreds into a sieve, sifted out carefully all that might be thought decent, (a mere trifle); reserving the hard phrases, which i threw into a large tin pepper-castor with longitudinal holes, so that an entire sentence could get through without material injury. the mixture was then ready for use. when called upon to play thomas hawk, i anointed a sheet of fools-cap with the white of a gander’s egg; then, shredding the thing to be reviewed as i had previously shredded the books,--only with more care, so as to get every word separate--i threw the latter shreds in with the former, screwed on the lid of the castor, gave it a shake, and so dusted out the mixture upon the egg’d foolscap; where it stuck. the effect was beautiful to behold. it was captivating. indeed, the reviews i brought to pass by this simple expedient have never been approached, and were the wonder of the world. at first, through bashfulness--the result of inexperience--i was a little put out by a certain inconsistency--a certain air of the _bizarre_, (as we say in france,) worn by the composition as a whole. all the phrases did not _fit_, (as we say in the anglo-saxon). many were quite awry. some, even, were up-side-down; and there were none of them which were not, in some measure, injured in regard to effect, by this latter species of accident, when it occurred;--with the exception of mr. lewis clarke’s paragraphs, which were so vigorous, and altogether stout, that they seemed not particularly disconcerted by any extreme of position, but looked equally happy and satisfactory, whether on their heads, or on their heels. what became of the editor of the “gad-fly,” after the publication of my criticism on his “oil-of-bob,” it is somewhat difficult to determine. the most reasonable conclusion is, that he wept himself to death. at all events he disappeared instantaneously from the face of the earth, and no man has seen even the ghost of him since. this matter having been properly accomplished, and the furies appeased, i grew at once into high favor with mr. crab. he took me into his confidence, gave me a permanent situation as thomas hawk of the “lollipop,” and, as for the present, he could afford me no salary, allowed me to profit, at discretion, by his advice. “my dear thingum,” said he to me one day after dinner, “i respect your abilities and love you as a son. you shall be my heir. when i die i will bequeath you the ‘lollipop.’ in the meantime i will make a man of you--i _will_--provided always that you follow my counsel. the first thing to do is to get rid of the old bore.” “boar?” said i inquiringly--“pig, eh?--_aper?_ (as we say in latin)--who?--where?” “your father,” said he. “precisely,” i replied,--“pig.” “you have your fortune to make, thingum,” resumed mr. crab, “and that governor of yours is a millstone about your neck. we must cut him at once.” [here i took out my knife.] “we must cut him,” continued mr. crab, “decidedly and forever. he won’t do--he _won’t_. upon second thoughts, you had better kick him, or cane him, or something of that kind.” “what do you say,” i suggested modestly, “to my kicking him in the first instance, caning him afterwards, and winding up by tweaking his nose?” mr. crab looked at me musingly for some moments, and then answered: “i think, mr. bob, that what you propose would answer sufficiently well--indeed remarkably well--that is to say, as far as it went--but barbers are exceedingly hard to cut, and i think, upon the whole, that, having performed upon thomas bob the operations you suggest, it would be advisable to blacken, with your fists, both his eyes, very carefully and thoroughly, to prevent his ever seeing you again in fashionable promenades. after doing this, i really do not perceive that you can do any more. however--it might be just as well to roll him once or twice in the gutter, and then put him in charge of the police. any time the next morning you can call at the watch-house and swear an assault.” i was much affected by the kindness of feeling towards me personally, which was evinced in this excellent advice of mr. crab, and i did not fail to profit by it forthwith. the result was, that i got rid of the old bore, and began to feel a little independent and gentleman-like. the want of money, however, was, for a few weeks, a source of some discomfort; but at length, by carefully putting to use my two eyes, and observing how matters went just in front of my nose, i perceived how the thing was to be brought about. i say “thing”--be it observed--for they tell me the latin for it is _rem_. by the way, talking of latin, can any one tell me the meaning of _quocunque_--or what is the meaning of _modo?_ my plan was exceedingly simple. i bought, for a song, a sixteenth of the “snapping-turtle”:--that was all. the thing was _done_, and i put money in my purse. there were some trivial arrangements afterwards, to be sure; but these formed no portion of the plan. they were a consequence--a result. for example, i bought pen, ink and paper, and put them into furious activity. having thus completed a magazine article, i gave it, for appellation, “fol-lol, _by the author of_ ‘the oil-of-bob,’” and enveloped it to the “goosetherumfoodle.” that journal, however, having pronounced it “twattle” in the “monthly notices to correspondents,” i reheaded the paper “‘hey-diddle-diddle,’ by thingumbob, esq., author of the ode on ‘the oil-of-bob,’ _and_ editor of the ‘snapping-turtle.’ “with this amendment, i re-enclosed it to the “goosetherumfoodle,” and, while i awaited a reply, published daily, in the “turtle,” six columns of what may be termed philosophical and analytical investigation of the literary merits of the “goosetherumfoodle,” as well as of the personal character of the editor of the “goosetherumfoodle.” at the end of a week the “goosetherumfoodle” discovered that it had, by some odd mistake, “confounded a stupid article, headed ‘hey-diddle-diddle’ and composed by some unknown ignoramus, with a gem of resplendent lustre similarly entitled, the work of thingum bob, esq., the celebrated author of ‘the oil-of-bob.’” the “goosetherumfoodle” deeply “regretted this very natural accident,” and promised, moreover, an insertion of the _genuine_ “hey-diddle-diddle” in the very next number of the magazine. the fact is, i _thought_--i _really_ thought--i thought at the time--i thought _then_--and have no reason for thinking otherwise _now_--that the “goosetherumfoodle” _did_ make a mistake. with the best intentions in the world, i never knew any thing that made as many singular mistakes as the “goosetherumfoodle.” from that day i took a liking to the “goosetherumfoodle,” and the result was i soon saw into the very depths of its literary merits, and did not fail to expatiate upon them, in the “turtle,” whenever a fitting opportunity occurred. and it is to be regarded as a very peculiar coincidence--as one of those positively _remarkable_ coincidences which set a man to serious thinking--that just such a total revolution of opinion--just such entire _bouleversement_, (as we say in french,)--just such thorough _topsiturviness_, (if i may be permitted to employ a rather forcible term of the choctaws,) as happened, _pro_ and _con_, between myself on the one part, and the “goosetherumfoodle” on the other, did actually again happen, in a brief period afterwards, and with precisely similar circumstances, in the case of myself and the “rowdy-dow,” and in the case of myself and the “humdrum.” thus it was that, by a master-stroke of genius, i at length consummated my triumphs by “putting money in my purse,” and thus may be said really and fairly to have commenced that brilliant and eventful career which rendered me illustrious, and which now enables me to say, with chateaubriand, “i have made history”--“_i’ai fait l’histoire_.” i have indeed “made history.” from the bright epoch which i now record, my actions--my works--are the property of mankind. they are familiar to the world. it is, then, needless for me to detail how, soaring rapidly, i fell heir to the “lollipop”--how i merged this journal in the “hum-drum”--how again i made purchase of the “rowdy-dow,” thus combining the three periodicals--how, lastly, i effected a bargain for the sole remaining rival, and united all the literature of the country in one magnificent magazine, known everywhere as the= ````“rowdy-dow, lollipop, hum-drum, `````and `````goosetherumfoodlb"= yes; i have made history. my fame is universal. it extends to the uttermost ends of the earth. you cannot take up a common newspaper in which you shall not see some allusion to the immortal thingum bob. it is mr. thingum bob said so, and mr. thingum bob wrote this, and mr. thingum bob did that. but i am meek and expire with an humble heart. after all, what is it?--this indescribable something which men will persist in terming “genius?” i agree with buffon--with hogarth--it is but _diligence_ after all. look at _me!_--how i labored--how i toiled--how i wrote! ye gods, did i _not_ write? i knew not the word “ease.” by day i adhered to my desk, and at night, a pale student, i consumed the midnight oil. you should have seen me--you _should_. i leaned to the right. i leaned to the left. i sat forward. i sat backward. i sat upon end. i sat _tete baissée_, (as they have it in the kickapoo,) bowing my head close to the alabaster page. and, through all, i--_wrote_. through joy and through sorrow, i--_wrote_. through hunger and through thirst, i--_wrote_. through good report and through ill report, i--_wrote_. through sunshine and through moonshine, i--_wrote. what_ i wrote it is unnecessary to say. the _style!_--that was the thing. i caught it from fatquack--whizz!--fizz!---- and i am giving you a specimen of it now. how to write a blackwood article. “in the name of the prophet--figs!!” cry of the turkish fig-peddler. i presume everybody has heard of me. my name is the signora psyche zenobia. this i know to be a fact. nobody but my enemies ever calls me suky snobbs. i have been assured that suky is but a vulgar corruption of psyche, which is good greek, and means “the soul” (that’s me, i’m all soul) and sometimes “a butterfly,” which latter meaning undoubtedly alludes to my appearance in my new crimson satin dress, with the sky-blue arabian mantelet, and the trimmings of green agraffas, and the seven flounces of orange-colored auriculas. as for snobbs--any person who should look at me would be instantly aware that my name wasn’t snobbs. miss tabitha turnip propagated that report through sheer envy. tabitha turnip indeed! oh the little wretch! but what can we expect from a turnip? wonder if she remembers the old adage about “blood out of a turnip,” &c.? [mem. put her in mind of it the first opportunity.] [mem. again--pull her nose.] where was i? ah! i have been assured that snobbs is a mere corruption of zenobia, and that zenobia was a queen--(so am i. dr. moneypenny always calls me the queen of the hearts)--and that zenobia, as well as psyche, is good greek, and that my father was “a greek,” and that consequently i have a right to our patronymic, which is zenobia and not by any means snobbs. nobody but tabitha turnip calls me suky snobbs. i am the signora psyche zenobia. as i said before, everybody has heard of me. i am that very signora psyche zenobia, so justly celebrated as corresponding secretary to the “philadelphia, regular, exchange, tea, total, young, belles, lettres, universal, experimental, bibliographical, association, to, civilize, humanity.” dr. moneypenny made the title for us, and says he chose it because it sounded big like an empty rum-puncheon. (a vulgar man that sometimes--but he’s deep.) we all sign the initials of the society after our names, in the fashion of the r. s. a., royal society of arts--the s. d. u. k., society for the diffusion of useful knowledge, &c, &c. dr. moneypenny says that s. stands for stale, and that d. u. k. spells duck, (but it don’t,) that s. d. u. k. stands for stale duck and not for lord brougham’s society--but then dr. moneypenny is such a queer man that i am never sure when he is telling me the truth. at any rate we always add to our names the initials p. r. e. t. t. y. b. l. u. e. b. a. t. c. h.--that is to say, philadelphia, regular, exchange, tea, total, young, belles, lettres, universal, experimental, bibliographical, association, to, civilize, humanity--one letter for each word, which is a decided improvement upon lord brougham. dr. moneypenny will have it that our initials give our true character--but for my life i can’t see what he means. notwithstanding the good offices of the doctor, and the strenuous exertions of the association to get itself into notice, it met with no very great success until i joined it. the truth is, the members indulged in too flippant a tone of discussion. the papers read every saturday evening were characterized less by depth than buffoonery. they were all whipped syllabub. there was no investigation of first causes, first principles. there was no investigation of any thing at all. there was no attention paid to that great point, the “fitness of things.” in short there was no fine writing like this. it was all low--very! no profundity, no reading, no metaphysics--nothing which the learned call spirituality, and which the unlearned choose to stigmatize as cant. [dr. m. says i ought to spell “cant” with a capital k--but i know better.] when i joined the society it was my endeavor to introduce a better style of thinking and writing, and all the world knows how well i have succeeded. we get up as good papers now in the p. r. e. t. t. y. b. l. u. e. b. a. t. c. h. as any to be found even in blackwood. i say, blackwood, because i have been assured that the finest writing, upon every subject, is to be discovered in the pages of that justly celebrated magazine. we now take it for our model upon all themes, and are getting into rapid notice accordingly. and, after all, it’s not so very difficult a matter to compose an article of the genuine blackwood stamp, if one only goes properly about it. of course i don’t speak of the political articles. everybody knows how they are managed, since dr. moneypenny explained it. mr. blackwood has a pair of tailor’s-shears, and three apprentices who stand by him for orders. one hands him the “times,” another the “examiner” and a third a “culley’s new compendium of slang-whang.” mr. b. merely cuts out and intersperses. it is soon done--nothing but “examiner,” “slang-whang,” and “times”--then “times,” “slang-whang,” and “examiner”--and then “times,” “examiner,” and “slang-whang.” but the chief merit of the magazine lies in its miscellaneous articles; and the best of these come under the head of what dr. moneypenny calls the bizarreries (whatever that may mean) and what everybody else calls the intensities. this is a species of writing which i have long known how to appreciate, although it is only since my late visit to mr. blackwood (deputed by the society) that i have been made aware of the exact method of composition. this method is very simple, but not so much so as the politics. upon my calling at mr. b.’s, and making known to him the wishes of the society, he received me with great civility, took me into his study, and gave me a clear explanation of the whole process. “my dear madam,” said he, evidently struck with my majestic appearance, for i had on the crimson satin, with the green agraffas, and orange-colored auriclas. “my dear madam,” said he, “sit down. the matter stands thus: in the first place your writer of intensities must have very black ink, and a very big pen, with a very blunt nib. and, mark me, miss psyche zenobia!” he continued, after a pause, with the most expressive energy and solemnity of manner, “mark me!--that pen--must--never be mended! herein, madam, lies the secret, the soul, of intensity. i assume upon myself to say, that no individual, of however great genius ever wrote with a good pen--understand me,--a good article. you may take, it for granted, that when manuscript can be read it is never worth reading. this is a leading principle in our faith, to which if you cannot readily assent, our conference is at an end.” he paused. but, of course, as i had no wish to put an end to the conference, i assented to a proposition so very obvious, and one, too, of whose truth i had all along been sufficiently aware. he seemed pleased, and went on with his instructions. “it may appear invidious in me, miss psyche zenobia, to refer you to any article, or set of articles, in the way of model or study, yet perhaps i may as well call your attention to a few cases. let me see. there was ‘the dead alive,’ a capital thing!--the record of a gentleman’s sensations when entombed before the breath was out of his body--full of tastes, terror, sentiment, metaphysics, and erudition. you would have sworn that the writer had been born and brought up in a coffin. then we had the ‘confessions of an opium-eater’--fine, very fine!--glorious imagination--deep philosophy acute speculation--plenty of fire and fury, and a good spicing of the decidedly unintelligible. that was a nice bit of flummery, and went down the throats of the people delightfully. they would have it that coleridge wrote the paper--but not so. it was composed by my pet baboon, juniper, over a rummer of hollands and water, ‘hot, without sugar.’” [this i could scarcely have believed had it been anybody but mr. blackwood, who assured me of it.] “then there was ‘the involuntary experimentalist,’ all about a gentleman who got baked in an oven, and came out alive and well, although certainly done to a turn. and then there was ‘the diary of a late physician,’ where the merit lay in good rant, and indifferent greek--both of them taking things with the public. and then there was ‘the man in the bell,’ a paper by-the-by, miss zenobia, which i cannot sufficiently recommend to your attention. it is the history of a young person who goes to sleep under the clapper of a church bell, and is awakened by its tolling for a funeral. the sound drives him mad, and, accordingly, pulling out his tablets, he gives a record of his sensations. sensations are the great things after all. should you ever be drowned or hung, be sure and make a note of your sensations--they will be worth to you ten guineas a sheet. if you wish to write forcibly, miss zenobia, pay minute attention to the sensations.” “that i certainly will, mr. blackwood,” said i. “good!” he replied. “i see you are a pupil after my own heart. but i must put you au fait to the details necessary in composing what may be denominated a genuine blackwood article of the sensation stamp--the kind which you will understand me to say i consider the best for all purposes. “the first thing requisite is to get yourself into such a scrape as no one ever got into before. the oven, for instance,--that was a good hit. but if you have no oven or big bell, at hand, and if you cannot conveniently tumble out of a balloon, or be swallowed up in an earthquake, or get stuck fast in a chimney, you will have to be contented with simply imagining some similar misadventure. i should prefer, however, that you have the actual fact to bear you out. nothing so well assists the fancy, as an experimental knowledge of the matter in hand. ‘truth is strange,’ you know, ‘stranger than fiction’--besides being more to the purpose.” here i assured him i had an excellent pair of garters, and would go and hang myself forthwith. “good!” he replied, “do so;--although hanging is somewhat hacknied. perhaps you might do better. take a dose of brandreth’s pills, and then give us your sensations. however, my instructions will apply equally well to any variety of misadventure, and in your way home you may easily get knocked in the head, or run over by an omnibus, or bitten by a mad dog, or drowned in a gutter. but to proceed. “having determined upon your subject, you must next consider the tone, or manner, of your narration. there is the tone didactic, the tone enthusiastic, the tone natural--all common--place enough. but then there is the tone laconic, or curt, which has lately come much into use. it consists in short sentences. somehow thus: can’t be too brief. can’t be too snappish. always a full stop. and never a paragraph. “then there is the tone elevated, diffusive, and interjectional. some of our best novelists patronize this tone. the words must be all in a whirl, like a humming-top, and make a noise very similar, which answers remarkably well instead of meaning. this is the best of all possible styles where the writer is in too great a hurry to think. “the tone metaphysical is also a good one. if you know any big words this is your chance for them. talk of the ionic and eleatic schools--of archytas, gorgias, and alcmaeon. say something about objectivity and subjectivity. be sure and abuse a man named locke. turn up your nose at things in general, and when you let slip any thing a little too absurd, you need not be at the trouble of scratching it out, but just add a footnote and say that you are indebted for the above profound observation to the ‘kritik der reinem vernunft,’ or to the ‘metaphysithe anfongsgrunde der noturwissenchaft.’ this would look erudite and--and--and frank. “there are various other tones of equal celebrity, but i shall mention only two more--the tone transcendental and the tone heterogeneous. in the former the merit consists in seeing into the nature of affairs a very great deal farther than anybody else. this second sight is very efficient when properly managed. a little reading of the ‘dial’ will carry you a great way. eschew, in this case, big words; get them as small as possible, and write them upside down. look over channing’s poems and quote what he says about a ‘fat little man with a delusive show of can.’ put in something about the supernal oneness. don’t say a syllable about the infernal twoness. above all, study innuendo. hint everything--assert nothing. if you feel inclined to say ‘bread and butter,’ do not by any means say it outright. you may say any thing and every thing approaching to ‘bread and butter.’ you may hint at buck-wheat cake, or you may even go so far as to insinuate oat-meal porridge, but if bread and butter be your real meaning, be cautious, my dear miss psyche, not on any account to say ‘bread and butter!’” i assured him that i should never say it again as long as i lived. he kissed me and continued: “as for the tone heterogeneous, it is merely a judicious mixture, in equal proportions, of all the other tones in the world, and is consequently made up of every thing deep, great, odd, piquant, pertinent, and pretty. “let us suppose now you have determined upon your incidents and tone. the most important portion--in fact, the soul of the whole business, is yet to be attended to--i allude to the filling up. it is not to be supposed that a lady, or gentleman either, has been leading the life of a book worm. and yet above all things it is necessary that your article have an air of erudition, or at least afford evidence of extensive general reading. now i’ll put you in the way of accomplishing this point. see here!” (pulling down some three or four ordinary-looking volumes, and opening them at random). “by casting your eye down almost any page of any book in the world, you will be able to perceive at once a host of little scraps of either learning or bel-espritism, which are the very thing for the spicing of a blackwood article. you might as well note down a few while i read them to you. i shall make two divisions: first, piquant facts for the manufacture of similes, and, second, piquant expressions to be introduced as occasion may require. write now!”--and i wrote as he dictated. “piquant facts for similes. ‘there were originally but three muses--melete, mneme, aoede--meditation, memory, and singing.’ you may make a good deal of that little fact if properly worked. you see it is not generally known, and looks recherche. you must be careful and give the thing with a downright improviso air. “again. ‘the river alpheus passed beneath the sea, and emerged without injury to the purity of its waters.’ rather stale that, to be sure, but, if properly dressed and dished up, will look quite as fresh as ever. “here is something better. ‘the persian iris appears to some persons to possess a sweet and very powerful perfume, while to others it is perfectly scentless.’ fine that, and very delicate! turn it about a little, and it will do wonders. we’ll have some thing else in the botanical line. there’s nothing goes down so well, especially with the help of a little latin. write! “‘the epidendrum flos aeris, of java, bears a very beautiful flower, and will live when pulled up by the roots. the natives suspend it by a cord from the ceiling, and enjoy its fragrance for years.’ that’s capital! that will do for the similes. now for the piquant expressions. “piquant expressions. ‘the venerable chinese novel ju-kiao-li.’ good! by introducing these few words with dexterity you will evince your intimate acquaintance with the language and literature of the chinese. with the aid of this you may either get along without either arabic, or sanscrit, or chickasaw. there is no passing muster, however, without spanish, italian, german, latin, and greek. i must look you out a little specimen of each. any scrap will answer, because you must depend upon your own ingenuity to make it fit into your article. now write! “‘aussi tendre que zaire’--as tender as zaire-french. alludes to the frequent repetition of the phrase, la tendre zaire, in the french tragedy of that name. properly introduced, will show not only your knowledge of the language, but your general reading and wit. you can say, for instance, that the chicken you were eating (write an article about being choked to death by a chicken-bone) was not altogether aussi tendre que zaire. write! ‘van muerte tan escondida, que no te sienta venir, porque el plazer del morir, no mestorne a dar la vida.’ “that’s spanish--from miguel de cervantes. ‘come quickly, o death! but be sure and don’t let me see you coming, lest the pleasure i shall feel at your appearance should unfortunately bring me back again to life.’ this you may slip in quite a propos when you are struggling in the last agonies with the chicken-bone. write! _‘il pover ‘huomo che non se’n era accorto, andava combattendo, e era morto.’_ “that’s italian, you perceive--from ariosto. it means that a great hero, in the heat of combat, not perceiving that he had been fairly killed, continued to fight valiantly, dead as he was. the application of this to your own case is obvious--for i trust, miss psyche, that you will not neglect to kick for at least an hour and a half after you have been choked to death by that chicken-bone. please to write! _‘und sterb’ich doch, no sterb’ich denn_ _durch sie--durch sie!’_ “that’s german--from schiller. ‘and if i die, at least i die--for thee--for thee!’ here it is clear that you are apostrophizing the cause of your disaster, the chicken. indeed what gentleman (or lady either) of sense, wouldn’t die, i should like to know, for a well fattened capon of the right molucca breed, stuffed with capers and mushrooms, and served up in a salad-bowl, with orange-jellies en mosaiques. write! (you can get them that way at tortoni’s)--write, if you please! “here is a nice little latin phrase, and rare too, (one can’t be too recherche or brief in one’s latin, it’s getting so common--ignoratio elenchi. he has committed an ignoratio elenchi--that is to say, he has understood the words of your proposition, but not the idea. the man was a fool, you see. some poor fellow whom you address while choking with that chicken-bone, and who therefore didn’t precisely understand what you were talking about. throw the ignoratio elenchi in his teeth, and, at once, you have him annihilated. if he dares to reply, you can tell him from lucan (here it is) that speeches are mere anemonae verborum, anemone words. the anemone, with great brilliancy, has no smell. or, if he begins to bluster, you may be down upon him with insomnia jovis, reveries of jupiter--a phrase which silius italicus (see here!) applies to thoughts pompous and inflated. this will be sure and cut him to the heart. he can do nothing but roll over and die. will you be kind enough to write? “in greek we must have some thing pretty--from demosthenes, for example. [greek phrase] [anerh o pheugoen kai palin makesetai] there is a tolerably good translation of it in hudibras ‘for he that flies may fight again, which he can never do that’s slain.’ “in a blackwood article nothing makes so fine a show as your greek. the very letters have an air of profundity about them. only observe, madam, the astute look of that epsilon! that phi ought certainly to be a bishop! was ever there a smarter fellow than that omicron? just twig that tau! in short, there is nothing like greek for a genuine sensation-paper. in the present case your application is the most obvious thing in the world. rap out the sentence, with a huge oath, and by way of ultimatum at the good-for-nothing dunder-headed villain who couldn’t understand your plain english in relation to the chicken-bone. he’ll take the hint and be off, you may depend upon it.” these were all the instructions mr. b. could afford me upon the topic in question, but i felt they would be entirely sufficient. i was, at length, able to write a genuine blackwood article, and determined to do it forthwith. in taking leave of me, mr. b. made a proposition for the purchase of the paper when written; but as he could offer me only fifty guineas a sheet, i thought it better to let our society have it, than sacrifice it for so paltry a sum. notwithstanding this niggardly spirit, however, the gentleman showed his consideration for me in all other respects, and indeed treated me with the greatest civility. his parting words made a deep impression upon my heart, and i hope i shall always remember them with gratitude. “my dear miss zenobia,” he said, while the tears stood in his eyes, “is there anything else i can do to promote the success of your laudable undertaking? let me reflect! it is just possible that you may not be able, so soon as convenient, to--to--get yourself drowned, or--choked with a chicken-bone, or--or hung,--or--bitten by a--but stay! now i think me of it, there are a couple of very excellent bull-dogs in the yard--fine fellows, i assure you--savage, and all that--indeed just the thing for your money--they’ll have you eaten up, auricula and all, in less than five minutes (here’s my watch!)--and then only think of the sensations! here! i say--tom!--peter!--dick, you villain!--let out those”--but as i was really in a great hurry, and had not another moment to spare, i was reluctantly forced to expedite my departure, and accordingly took leave at once--somewhat more abruptly, i admit, than strict courtesy would have otherwise allowed. it was my primary object upon quitting mr. blackwood, to get into some immediate difficulty, pursuant to his advice, and with this view i spent the greater part of the day in wandering about edinburgh, seeking for desperate adventures--adventures adequate to the intensity of my feelings, and adapted to the vast character of the article i intended to write. in this excursion i was attended by one negro--servant, pompey, and my little lap-dog diana, whom i had brought with me from philadelphia. it was not, however, until late in the afternoon that i fully succeeded in my arduous undertaking. an important event then happened of which the following blackwood article, in the tone heterogeneous, is the substance and result. a predicament what chance, good lady, hath bereft you thus? --comus. it was a quiet and still afternoon when i strolled forth in the goodly city of edina. the confusion and bustle in the streets were terrible. men were talking. women were screaming. children were choking. pigs were whistling. carts they rattled. bulls they bellowed. cows they lowed. horses they neighed. cats they caterwauled. dogs they danced. danced! could it then be possible? danced! alas, thought i, my dancing days are over! thus it is ever. what a host of gloomy recollections will ever and anon be awakened in the mind of genius and imaginative contemplation, especially of a genius doomed to the everlasting and eternal, and continual, and, as one might say, the--continued--yes, the continued and continuous, bitter, harassing, disturbing, and, if i may be allowed the expression, the very disturbing influence of the serene, and godlike, and heavenly, and exalted, and elevated, and purifying effect of what may be rightly termed the most enviable, the most truly enviable--nay! the most benignly beautiful, the most deliciously ethereal, and, as it were, the most pretty (if i may use so bold an expression) thing (pardon me, gentle reader!) in the world--but i am always led away by my feelings. in such a mind, i repeat, what a host of recollections are stirred up by a trifle! the dogs danced! i--i could not! they frisked--i wept. they capered--i sobbed aloud. touching circumstances! which cannot fail to bring to the recollection of the classical reader that exquisite passage in relation to the fitness of things, which is to be found in the commencement of the third volume of that admirable and venerable chinese novel the jo-go-slow. in my solitary walk through, the city i had two humble but faithful companions. diana, my poodle! sweetest of creatures! she had a quantity of hair over her one eye, and a blue ribband tied fashionably around her neck. diana was not more than five inches in height, but her head was somewhat bigger than her body, and her tail being cut off exceedingly close, gave an air of injured innocence to the interesting animal which rendered her a favorite with all. and pompey, my negro!--sweet pompey! how shall i ever forget thee? i had taken pompey’s arm. he was three feet in height (i like to be particular) and about seventy, or perhaps eighty, years of age. he had bow-legs and was corpulent. his mouth should not be called small, nor his ears short. his teeth, however, were like pearl, and his large full eyes were deliciously white. nature had endowed him with no neck, and had placed his ankles (as usual with that race) in the middle of the upper portion of the feet. he was clad with a striking simplicity. his sole garments were a stock of nine inches in height, and a nearly--new drab overcoat which had formerly been in the service of the tall, stately, and illustrious dr. moneypenny. it was a good overcoat. it was well cut. it was well made. the coat was nearly new. pompey held it up out of the dirt with both hands. there were three persons in our party, and two of them have already been the subject of remark. there was a third--that person was myself. i am the signora psyche zenobia. i am not suky snobbs. my appearance is commanding. on the memorable occasion of which i speak i was habited in a crimson satin dress, with a sky-blue arabian mantelet. and the dress had trimmings of green agraffas, and seven graceful flounces of the orange-colored auricula. i thus formed the third of the party. there was the poodle. there was pompey. there was myself. we were three. thus it is said there were originally but three furies--melty, nimmy, and hetty--meditation, memory, and fiddling. leaning upon the arm of the gallant pompey, and attended at a respectable distance by diana, i proceeded down one of the populous and very pleasant streets of the now deserted edina. on a sudden, there presented itself to view a church--a gothic cathedral--vast, venerable, and with a tall steeple, which towered into the sky. what madness now possessed me? why did i rush upon my fate? i was seized with an uncontrollable desire to ascend the giddy pinnacle, and then survey the immense extent of the city. the door of the cathedral stood invitingly open. my destiny prevailed. i entered the ominous archway. where then was my guardian angel?--if indeed such angels there be. if! distressing monosyllable! what world of mystery, and meaning, and doubt, and uncertainty is there involved in thy two letters! i entered the ominous archway! i entered; and, without injury to my orange-colored auriculas, i passed beneath the portal, and emerged within the vestibule. thus it is said the immense river alfred passed, unscathed, and unwetted, beneath the sea. i thought the staircase would never have an end. round! yes, they went round and up, and round and up and round and up, until i could not help surmising, with the sagacious pompey, upon whose supporting arm i leaned in all the confidence of early affection--i could not help surmising that the upper end of the continuous spiral ladder had been accidentally, or perhaps designedly, removed. i paused for breath; and, in the meantime, an accident occurred of too momentous a nature in a moral, and also in a metaphysical point of view, to be passed over without notice. it appeared to me--indeed i was quite confident of the fact--i could not be mistaken--no! i had, for some moments, carefully and anxiously observed the motions of my diana--i say that i could not be mistaken--diana smelt a rat! at once i called pompey’s attention to the subject, and he--he agreed with me. there was then no longer any reasonable room for doubt. the rat had been smelled--and by diana. heavens! shall i ever forget the intense excitement of the moment? alas! what is the boasted intellect of man? the rat!--it was there--that is to say, it was somewhere. diana smelled the rat. i--i could not! thus it is said the prussian isis has, for some persons, a sweet and very powerful perfume, while to others it is perfectly scentless. the staircase had been surmounted, and there were now only three or four more upward steps intervening between us and the summit. we still ascended, and now only one step remained. one step! one little, little step! upon one such little step in the great staircase of human life how vast a sum of human happiness or misery depends! i thought of myself, then of pompey, and then of the mysterious and inexplicable destiny which surrounded us. i thought of pompey!--alas, i thought of love! i thought of my many false steps which have been taken, and may be taken again. i resolved to be more cautious, more reserved. i abandoned the arm of pompey, and, without his assistance, surmounted the one remaining step, and gained the chamber of the belfry. i was followed immediately afterward by my poodle. pompey alone remained behind. i stood at the head of the staircase, and encouraged him to ascend. he stretched forth to me his hand, and unfortunately in so doing was forced to abandon his firm hold upon the overcoat. will the gods never cease their persecution? the overcoat is dropped, and, with one of his feet, pompey stepped upon the long and trailing skirt of the overcoat. he stumbled and fell--this consequence was inevitable. he fell forward, and, with his accursed head, striking me full in the--in the breast, precipitated me headlong, together with himself, upon the hard, filthy, and detestable floor of the belfry. but my revenge was sure, sudden, and complete. seizing him furiously by the wool with both hands, i tore out a vast quantity of black, and crisp, and curling material, and tossed it from me with every manifestation of disdain. it fell among the ropes of the belfry and remained. pompey arose, and said no word. but he regarded me piteously with his large eyes and--sighed. ye gods--that sigh! it sunk into my heart. and the hair--the wool! could i have reached that wool i would have bathed it with my tears, in testimony of regret. but alas! it was now far beyond my grasp. as it dangled among the cordage of the bell, i fancied it alive. i fancied that it stood on end with indignation. thus the happy-dandy flos aeris of java bears, it is said, a beautiful flower, which will live when pulled up by the roots. the natives suspend it by a cord from the ceiling and enjoy its fragrance for years. our quarrel was now made up, and we looked about the room for an aperture through which to survey the city of edina. windows there were none. the sole light admitted into the gloomy chamber proceeded from a square opening, about a foot in diameter, at a height of about seven feet from the floor. yet what will the energy of true genius not effect? i resolved to clamber up to this hole. a vast quantity of wheels, pinions, and other cabalistic--looking machinery stood opposite the hole, close to it; and through the hole there passed an iron rod from the machinery. between the wheels and the wall where the hole lay there was barely room for my body--yet i was desperate, and determined to persevere. i called pompey to my side. “you perceive that aperture, pompey. i wish to look through it. you will stand here just beneath the hole--so. now, hold out one of your hands, pompey, and let me step upon it--thus. now, the other hand, pompey, and with its aid i will get upon your shoulders.” he did every thing i wished, and i found, upon getting up, that i could easily pass my head and neck through the aperture. the prospect was sublime. nothing could be more magnificent. i merely paused a moment to bid diana behave herself, and assure pompey that i would be considerate and bear as lightly as possible upon his shoulders. i told him i would be tender of his feelings--ossi tender que beefsteak. having done this justice to my faithful friend, i gave myself up with great zest and enthusiasm to the enjoyment of the scene which so obligingly spread itself out before my eyes. upon this subject, however, i shall forbear to dilate. i will not describe the city of edinburgh. every one has been to the city of edinburgh. every one has been to edinburgh--the classic edina. i will confine myself to the momentous details of my own lamentable adventure. having, in some measure, satisfied my curiosity in regard to the extent, situation, and general appearance of the city, i had leisure to survey the church in which i was, and the delicate architecture of the steeple. i observed that the aperture through which i had thrust my head was an opening in the dial-plate of a gigantic clock, and must have appeared, from the street, as a large key-hole, such as we see in the face of the french watches. no doubt the true object was to admit the arm of an attendant, to adjust, when necessary, the hands of the clock from within. i observed also, with surprise, the immense size of these hands, the longest of which could not have been less than ten feet in length, and, where broadest, eight or nine inches in breadth. they were of solid steel apparently, and their edges appeared to be sharp. having noticed these particulars, and some others, i again turned my eyes upon the glorious prospect below, and soon became absorbed in contemplation. from this, after some minutes, i was aroused by the voice of pompey, who declared that he could stand it no longer, and requested that i would be so kind as to come down. this was unreasonable, and i told him so in a speech of some length. he replied, but with an evident misunderstanding of my ideas upon the subject. i accordingly grew angry, and told him in plain words, that he was a fool, that he had committed an ignoramus e-clench-eye, that his notions were mere insommary bovis, and his words little better than an ennemywerrybor’em. with this he appeared satisfied, and i resumed my contemplations. it might have been half an hour after this altercation when, as i was deeply absorbed in the heavenly scenery beneath me, i was startled by something very cold which pressed with a gentle pressure on the back of my neck. it is needless to say that i felt inexpressibly alarmed. i knew that pompey was beneath my feet, and that diana was sitting, according to my explicit directions, upon her hind legs, in the farthest corner of the room. what could it be? alas! i but too soon discovered. turning my head gently to one side, i perceived, to my extreme horror, that the huge, glittering, scimetar-like minute-hand of the clock had, in the course of its hourly revolution, descended upon my neck. there was, i knew, not a second to be lost. i pulled back at once--but it was too late. there was no chance of forcing my head through the mouth of that terrible trap in which it was so fairly caught, and which grew narrower and narrower with a rapidity too horrible to be conceived. the agony of that moment is not to be imagined. i threw up my hands and endeavored, with all my strength, to force upward the ponderous iron bar. i might as well have tried to lift the cathedral itself. down, down, down it came, closer and yet closer. i screamed to pompey for aid; but he said that i had hurt his feelings by calling him ‘an ignorant old squint-eye:’ i yelled to diana; but she only said ‘bow-wow-wow,’ and that i had told her ‘on no account to stir from the corner.’ thus i had no relief to expect from my associates. meantime the ponderous and terrific scythe of time (for i now discovered the literal import of that classical phrase) had not stopped, nor was it likely to stop, in its career. down and still down, it came. it had already buried its sharp edge a full inch in my flesh, and my sensations grew indistinct and confused. at one time i fancied myself in philadelphia with the stately dr. moneypenny, at another in the back parlor of mr. blackwood receiving his invaluable instructions. and then again the sweet recollection of better and earlier times came over me, and i thought of that happy period when the world was not all a desert, and pompey not altogether cruel. the ticking of the machinery amused me. amused me, i say, for my sensations now bordered upon perfect happiness, and the most trifling circumstances afforded me pleasure. the eternal click-clak, click-clak, click-clak of the clock was the most melodious of music in my ears, and occasionally even put me in mind of the graceful sermonic harangues of dr. ollapod. then there were the great figures upon the dial-plate--how intelligent how intellectual, they all looked! and presently they took to dancing the mazurka, and i think it was the figure v. who performed the most to my satisfaction. she was evidently a lady of breeding. none of your swaggerers, and nothing at all indelicate in her motions. she did the pirouette to admiration--whirling round upon her apex. i made an endeavor to hand her a chair, for i saw that she appeared fatigued with her exertions--and it was not until then that i fully perceived my lamentable situation. lamentable indeed! the bar had buried itself two inches in my neck. i was aroused to a sense of exquisite pain. i prayed for death, and, in the agony of the moment, could not help repeating those exquisite verses of the poet miguel de cervantes: vanny buren, tan escondida query no te senty venny pork and pleasure, delly morry nommy, torny, darry, widdy! but now a new horror presented itself, and one indeed sufficient to startle the strongest nerves. my eyes, from the cruel pressure of the machine, were absolutely starting from their sockets. while i was thinking how i should possibly manage without them, one actually tumbled out of my head, and, rolling down the steep side of the steeple, lodged in the rain gutter which ran along the eaves of the main building. the loss of the eye was not so much as the insolent air of independence and contempt with which it regarded me after it was out. there it lay in the gutter just under my nose, and the airs it gave itself would have been ridiculous had they not been disgusting. such a winking and blinking were never before seen. this behavior on the part of my eye in the gutter was not only irritating on account of its manifest insolence and shameful ingratitude, but was also exceedingly inconvenient on account of the sympathy which always exists between two eyes of the same head, however far apart. i was forced, in a manner, to wink and to blink, whether i would or not, in exact concert with the scoundrelly thing that lay just under my nose. i was presently relieved, however, by the dropping out of the other eye. in falling it took the same direction (possibly a concerted plot) as its fellow. both rolled out of the gutter together, and in truth i was very glad to get rid of them. the bar was now four inches and a half deep in my neck, and there was only a little bit of skin to cut through. my sensations were those of entire happiness, for i felt that in a few minutes, at farthest, i should be relieved from my disagreeable situation. and in this expectation i was not at all deceived. at twenty-five minutes past five in the afternoon, precisely, the huge minute-hand had proceeded sufficiently far on its terrible revolution to sever the small remainder of my neck. i was not sorry to see the head which had occasioned me so much embarrassment at length make a final separation from my body. it first rolled down the side of the steeple, then lodge, for a few seconds, in the gutter, and then made its way, with a plunge, into the middle of the street. i will candidly confess that my feelings were now of the most singular--nay, of the most mysterious, the most perplexing and incomprehensible character. my senses were here and there at one and the same moment. with my head i imagined, at one time, that i, the head, was the real signora psyche zenobia--at another i felt convinced that myself, the body, was the proper identity. to clear my ideas on this topic i felt in my pocket for my snuff-box, but, upon getting it, and endeavoring to apply a pinch of its grateful contents in the ordinary manner, i became immediately aware of my peculiar deficiency, and threw the box at once down to my head. it took a pinch with great satisfaction, and smiled me an acknowledgement in return. shortly afterward it made me a speech, which i could hear but indistinctly without ears. i gathered enough, however, to know that it was astonished at my wishing to remain alive under such circumstances. in the concluding sentences it quoted the noble words of ariosto-- il pover hommy che non sera corty and have a combat tenty erry morty; thus comparing me to the hero who, in the heat of the combat, not perceiving that he was dead, continued to contest the battle with inextinguishable valor. there was nothing now to prevent my getting down from my elevation, and i did so. what it was that pompey saw so very peculiar in my appearance i have never yet been able to find out. the fellow opened his mouth from ear to ear, and shut his two eyes as if he were endeavoring to crack nuts between the lids. finally, throwing off his overcoat, he made one spring for the staircase and disappeared. i hurled after the scoundrel these vehement words of demosthenes-- andrew o’phlegethon, you really make haste to fly, and then turned to the darling of my heart, to the one-eyed! the shaggy-haired diana. alas! what a horrible vision affronted my eyes? was that a rat i saw skulking into his hole? are these the picked bones of the little angel who has been cruelly devoured by the monster? ye gods! and what do i behold--is that the departed spirit, the shade, the ghost, of my beloved puppy, which i perceive sitting with a grace so melancholy, in the corner? hearken! for she speaks, and, heavens! it is in the german of schiller-- “unt stubby duk, so stubby dun duk she! duk she!” alas! and are not her words too true? “and if i died, at least i died for thee--for thee.” sweet creature! she too has sacrificed herself in my behalf. dogless, niggerless, headless, what now remains for the unhappy signora psyche zenobia? alas--nothing! i have done. mystification slid, if these be your “passados” and “montantes,” i’ll have none o’ them. --ned knowles. the baron ritzner von jung was a noble hungarian family, every member of which (at least as far back into antiquity as any certain records extend) was more or less remarkable for talent of some description--the majority for that species of grotesquerie in conception of which tieck, a scion of the house, has given a vivid, although by no means the most vivid exemplifications. my acquaintance with ritzner commenced at the magnificent château jung, into which a train of droll adventures, not to be made public, threw a place in his regard, and here, with somewhat more difficulty, a partial insight into his mental conformation. in later days this insight grew more clear, as the intimacy which had at first permitted it became more close; and when, after three years of the character of the baron ritzner von jung. i remember the buzz of curiosity which his advent excited within the college precincts on the night of the twenty-fifth of june. i remember still more distinctly, that while he was pronounced by all parties at first sight “the most remarkable man in the world,” no person made any attempt at accounting for his opinion. that he was unique appeared so undeniable, that it was deemed impertinent to inquire wherein the uniquity consisted. but, letting this matter pass for the present, i will merely observe that, from the first moment of his setting foot within the limits of the university, he began to exercise over the habits, manners, persons, purses, and propensities of the whole community which surrounded him, an influence the most extensive and despotic, yet at the same time the most indefinite and altogether unaccountable. thus the brief period of his residence at the university forms an era in its annals, and is characterized by all classes of people appertaining to it or its dependencies as “that very extraordinary epoch forming the domination of the baron ritzner von jung.” then of no particular age, by which i mean that it was impossible to form a guess respecting his age by any data personally afforded. he might have been fifteen or fifty, and was twenty-one years and seven months. he was by no means a handsome man--perhaps the reverse. the contour of his face was somewhat angular and harsh. his forehead was lofty and very fair; his nose a snub; his eyes large, heavy, glassy, and meaningless. about the mouth there was more to be observed. the lips were gently protruded, and rested the one upon the other, after such a fashion that it is impossible to conceive any, even the most complex, combination of human features, conveying so entirely, and so singly, the idea of unmitigated gravity, solemnity and repose. it will be perceived, no doubt, from what i have already said, that the baron was one of those human anomalies now and then to be found, who make the science of mystification the study and the business of their lives. for this science a peculiar turn of mind gave him instinctively the cue, while his physical appearance afforded him unusual facilities for carrying his prospects into effect. i quaintly termed the domination of the baron ritzner von jung, ever rightly entered into the mystery which overshadowed his character. i truly think that no person at the university, with the exception of myself, ever suspected him to be capable of a joke, verbal or practical:--the old bull-dog at the garden-gate would sooner have been accused,--the ghost of heraclitus,--or the wig of the emeritus professor of theology. this, too, when it was evident that the most egregious and unpardonable of all conceivable tricks, whimsicalities and buffooneries were brought about, if not directly by him, at least plainly through his intermediate agency or connivance. the beauty, if i may so call it, of his art mystifique, lay in that consummate ability (resulting from an almost intuitive knowledge of human nature, and a most wonderful self-possession,) by means of which he never failed to make it appear that the drolleries he was occupied in bringing to a point, arose partly in spite, and partly in consequence of the laudable efforts he was making for their prevention, and for the preservation of the good order and dignity of alma mater. the deep, the poignant, the overwhelming mortification, which upon each such failure of his praise worthy endeavors, would suffuse every lineament of his countenance, left not the slightest room for doubt of his sincerity in the bosoms of even his most skeptical companions. the adroitness, too, was no less worthy of observation by which he contrived to shift the sense of the grotesque from the creator to the created--from his own person to the absurdities to which he had given rise. in no instance before that of which i speak, have i known the habitual mystific escape the natural consequence of his manoevres--an attachment of the ludicrous to his own character and person. continually enveloped in an atmosphere of whim, my friend appeared to live only for the severities of society; and not even his own household have for a moment associated other ideas than those of the rigid and august with the memory of the baron ritzner von jung, the demon of the dolce far niente lay like an incubus upon the university. nothing, at least, was done beyond eating and drinking and making merry. the apartments of the students were converted into so many pot-houses, and there was no pot-house of them all more famous or more frequented than that of the baron. our carousals here were many, and boisterous, and long, and never unfruitful of events. upon one occasion we had protracted our sitting until nearly daybreak, and an unusual quantity of wine had been drunk. the company consisted of seven or eight individuals besides the baron and myself. most of these were young men of wealth, of high connection, of great family pride, and all alive with an exaggerated sense of honor. they abounded in the most ultra german opinions respecting the duello. to these quixotic notions some recent parisian publications, backed by three or four desperate and fatal conversation, during the greater part of the night, had run wild upon the all--engrossing topic of the times. the baron, who had been unusually silent and abstracted in the earlier portion of the evening, at length seemed to be aroused from his apathy, took a leading part in the discourse, and dwelt upon the benefits, and more especially upon the beauties, of the received code of etiquette in passages of arms with an ardor, an eloquence, an impressiveness, and an affectionateness of manner, which elicited the warmest enthusiasm from his hearers in general, and absolutely staggered even myself, who well knew him to be at heart a ridiculer of those very points for which he contended, and especially to hold the entire fanfaronade of duelling etiquette in the sovereign contempt which it deserves. looking around me during a pause in the baron’s discourse (of which my readers may gather some faint idea when i say that it bore resemblance to the fervid, chanting, monotonous, yet musical sermonic manner of coleridge), i perceived symptoms of even more than the general interest in the countenance of one of the party. this gentleman, whom i shall call hermann, was an original in every respect--except, perhaps, in the single particular that he was a very great fool. he contrived to bear, however, among a particular set at the university, a reputation for deep metaphysical thinking, and, i believe, for some logical talent. as a duellist he had acquired who had fallen at his hands; but they were many. he was a man of courage undoubtedly. but it was upon his minute acquaintance with the etiquette of the duello, and the nicety of his sense of honor, that he most especially prided himself. these things were a hobby which he rode to the death. to ritzner, ever upon the lookout for the grotesque, his peculiarities had for a long time past afforded food for mystification. of this, however, i was not aware; although, in the present instance, i saw clearly that something of a whimsical nature was upon the tapis with my friend, and that hermann was its especial object. as the former proceeded in his discourse, or rather monologue i perceived the excitement of the latter momently increasing. at length he spoke; offering some objection to a point insisted upon by r., and giving his reasons in detail. to these the baron replied at length (still maintaining his exaggerated tone of sentiment) and concluding, in what i thought very bad taste, with a sarcasm and a sneer. the hobby of hermann now took the bit in his teeth. this i could discern by the studied hair-splitting farrago of his rejoinder. his last words i distinctly remember. “your opinions, allow me to say, baron von jung, although in the main correct, are, in many nice points, discreditable to yourself and to the university of which you are a member. in a few respects they are even unworthy of serious refutation. i would say more than this, sir, were it not for the fear of giving you offence (here the speaker smiled blandly), i would say, sir, that your opinions are not the opinions to be expected from a gentleman.” as hermann completed this equivocal sentence, all eyes were turned upon the baron. he became pale, then excessively red; then, dropping his pocket-handkerchief, stooped to recover it, when i caught a glimpse of his countenance, while it could be seen by no one else at the table. it was radiant with the quizzical expression which was its natural character, but which i had never seen it assume except when we were alone together, and when he unbent himself freely. in an instant afterward he stood erect, confronting hermann; and so total an alteration of countenance in so short a period i certainly never saw before. for a moment i even fancied that i had misconceived him, and that he was in sober earnest. he appeared to be stifling with passion, and his face was cadaverously white. for a short time he remained silent, apparently striving to master his emotion. having at length seemingly succeeded, he reached a decanter which stood near him, saying as he held it firmly clenched “the language you have thought proper to employ, mynheer hermann, in addressing yourself to me, is objectionable in so many particulars, that i have neither temper nor time for specification. that my opinions, however, are not the opinions to be expected from a gentleman, is an observation so directly offensive as to allow me but one line of conduct. some courtesy, nevertheless, is due to the presence of this company, and to yourself, at this moment, as my guest. you will pardon me, therefore, if, upon this consideration, i deviate slightly from the general usage among gentlemen in similar cases of personal affront. you will forgive me for the moderate tax i shall make upon your imagination, and endeavor to consider, for an instant, the reflection of your person in yonder mirror as the living mynheer hermann himself. this being done, there will be no difficulty whatever. i shall discharge this decanter of wine at your image in yonder mirror, and thus fulfil all the spirit, if not the exact letter, of resentment for your insult, while the necessity of physical violence to your real person will be obviated.” with these words he hurled the decanter, full of wine, against the mirror which hung directly opposite hermann; striking the reflection of his person with great precision, and of course shattering the glass into fragments. the whole company at once started to their feet, and, with the exception of myself and ritzner, took their departure. as hermann went out, the baron whispered me that i should follow him and make an offer of my services. to this i agreed; not knowing precisely what to make of so ridiculous a piece of business. the duellist accepted my aid with his stiff and ultra recherche air, and, taking my arm, led me to his apartment. i could hardly forbear laughing in his face while he proceeded to discuss, with the profoundest gravity, what he termed “the refinedly peculiar character” of the insult he had received. after a tiresome harangue in his ordinary style, he took down from his book shelves a number of musty volumes on the subject of the duello, and entertained me for a long time with their contents; reading aloud, and commenting earnestly as he read. i can just remember the titles of some of the works. there were the “ordonnance of philip le bel on single combat”; the “theatre of honor,” by favyn, and a treatise “on the permission of duels,” by andiguier. he displayed, also, with much pomposity, brantome’s “memoirs of duels,”--published at cologne, <UNK> in the types of elzevir--a precious and unique vellum-paper volume, with a fine margin, and bound by derome. but he requested my attention particularly, and with an air of mysterious sagacity, to a thick octavo, written in barbarous latin by one hedelin, a frenchman, and having the quaint title, “duelli lex scripta, et non; aliterque.” from this he read me one of the drollest chapters in the world concerning “injuriae per applicationem, per constructionem, et per se,” about half of which, he averred, was strictly applicable to his own “refinedly peculiar” case, although not one syllable of the whole matter could i understand for the life of me. having finished the chapter, he closed the book, and demanded what i thought necessary to be done. i replied that i had entire confidence in his superior delicacy of feeling, and would abide by what he proposed. with this answer he seemed flattered, and sat down to write a note to the baron. it ran thus: sir,--my friend, m. p.-, will hand you this note. i find it incumbent upon me to request, at your earliest convenience, an explanation of this evening’s occurrences at your chambers. in the event of your declining this request, mr. p. will be happy to arrange, with any friend whom you may appoint, the steps preliminary to a meeting. with sentiments of perfect respect, your most humble servant, johann herman. to the baron ritzner von jung, not knowing what better to do, i called upon ritzner with this epistle. he bowed as i presented it; then, with a grave countenance, motioned me to a seat. having perused the cartel, he wrote the following reply, which i carried to hermann. sir,--through our common friend, mr. p., i have received your note of this evening. upon due reflection i frankly admit the propriety of the explanation you suggest. this being admitted, i still find great difficulty, (owing to the refinedly peculiar nature of our disagreement, and of the personal affront offered on my part,) in so wording what i have to say by way of apology, as to meet all the minute exigencies, and all the variable shadows, of the case. i have great reliance, however, on that extreme delicacy of discrimination, in matters appertaining to the rules of etiquette, for which you have been so long and so pre-eminently distinguished. with perfect certainty, therefore, of being comprehended, i beg leave, in lieu of offering any sentiments of my own, to refer you to the opinions of sieur hedelin, as set forth in the ninth paragraph of the chapter of “injuriae per applicationem, per constructionem, et per se,” in his “duelli lex scripta, et non; aliterque.” the nicety of your discernment in all the matters here treated, will be sufficient, i am assured, to convince you that the mere circumstance of me referring you to this admirable passage, ought to satisfy your request, as a man of honor, for explanation. with sentiments of profound respect, your most obedient servant, von jung. the herr johann hermann hermann commenced the perusal of this epistle with a scowl, which, however, was converted into a smile of the most ludicrous self-complacency as he came to the rigmarole about injuriae per applicationem, per constructionem, et per se. having finished reading, he begged me, with the blandest of all possible smiles, to be seated, while he made reference to the treatise in question. turning to the passage specified, he read it with great care to himself, then closed the book, and desired me, in my character of confidential acquaintance, to express to the baron von jung his exalted sense of his chivalrous behavior, and, in that of second, to assure him that the explanation offered was of the fullest, the most honorable, and the most unequivocally satisfactory nature. somewhat amazed at all this, i made my retreat to the baron. he seemed to receive hermann’s amicable letter as a matter of course, and after a few words of general conversation, went to an inner room and brought out the everlasting treatise “duelli lex scripta, et non; aliterque.” he handed me the volume and asked me to look over some portion of it. i did so, but to little purpose, not being able to gather the least particle of meaning. he then took the book himself, and read me a chapter aloud. to my surprise, what he read proved to be a most horribly absurd account of a duel between two baboons. he now explained the mystery; showing that the volume, as it appeared prima facie, was written upon the plan of the nonsense verses of du bartas; that is to say, the language was ingeniously framed so as to present to the ear all the outward signs of intelligibility, and even of profundity, while in fact not a shadow of meaning existed. the key to the whole was found in leaving out every second and third word alternately, when there appeared a series of ludicrous quizzes upon a single combat as practised in modern times. the baron afterwards informed me that he had purposely thrown the treatise in hermann’s way two or three weeks before the adventure, and that he was satisfied, from the general tenor of his conversation, that he had studied it with the deepest attention, and firmly believed it to be a work of unusual merit. upon this hint he proceeded. hermann would have died a thousand deaths rather than acknowledge his inability to understand anything and everything in the universe that had ever been written about the duello. littleton barry. diddling considered as one of the exact sciences. hey, diddle diddle the cat and the fiddle since the world began there have been two jeremys. the one wrote a jeremiad about usury, and was called jeremy bentham. he has been much admired by mr. john neal, and was a great man in a small way. the other gave name to the most important of the exact sciences, and was a great man in a great way--i may say, indeed, in the very greatest of ways. diddling--or the abstract idea conveyed by the verb to diddle--is sufficiently well understood. yet the fact, the deed, the thing diddling, is somewhat difficult to define. we may get, however, at a tolerably distinct conception of the matter in hand, by defining--not the thing, diddling, in itself--but man, as an animal that diddles. had plato but hit upon this, he would have been spared the affront of the picked chicken. very pertinently it was demanded of plato, why a picked chicken, which was clearly “a biped without feathers,” was not, according to his own definition, a man? but i am not to be bothered by any similar query. man is an animal that diddles, and there is no animal that diddles but man. it will take an entire hen-coop of picked chickens to get over that. what constitutes the essence, the nare, the principle of diddling is, in fact, peculiar to the class of creatures that wear coats and pantaloons. a crow thieves; a fox cheats; a weasel outwits; a man diddles. to diddle is his destiny. “man was made to mourn,” says the poet. but not so:--he was made to diddle. this is his aim--his object--his end. and for this reason when a man’s diddled we say he’s “done.” diddling, rightly considered, is a compound, of which the ingredients are minuteness, interest, perseverance, ingenuity, audacity, nonchalance, originality, impertinence, and grin. minuteness:--your diddler is minute. his operations are upon a small scale. his business is retail, for cash, or approved paper at sight. should he ever be tempted into magnificent speculation, he then, at once, loses his distinctive features, and becomes what we term “financier.” this latter word conveys the diddling idea in every respect except that of magnitude. a diddler may thus be regarded as a banker in petto--a “financial operation,” as a diddle at brobdignag. the one is to the other, as homer to “flaccus”--as a mastodon to a mouse--as the tail of a comet to that of a pig. interest:--your diddler is guided by self-interest. he scorns to diddle for the mere sake of the diddle. he has an object in view--his pocket--and yours. he regards always the main chance. he looks to number one. you are number two, and must look to yourself. perseverance:--your diddler perseveres. he is not readily discouraged. should even the banks break, he cares nothing about it. he steadily pursues his end, and ‘ut canis a corio nunquam absterrebitur uncto,’ so he never lets go of his game. ingenuity:--your diddler is ingenious. he has constructiveness large. he understands plot. he invents and circumvents. were he not alexander he would be diogenes. were he not a diddler, he would be a maker of patent rat-traps or an angler for trout. audacity:--your diddler is audacious.--he is a bold man. he carries the war into africa. he conquers all by assault. he would not fear the daggers of frey herren. with a little more prudence dick turpin would have made a good diddler; with a trifle less blarney, daniel o’connell; with a pound or two more brains charles the twelfth. nonchalance:--your diddler is nonchalant. he is not at all nervous. he never had any nerves. he is never seduced into a flurry. he is never put out--unless put out of doors. he is cool--cool as a cucumber. he is calm--“calm as a smile from lady bury.” he is easy--easy as an old glove, or the damsels of ancient baiae. originality:--your diddler is original--conscientiously so. his thoughts are his own. he would scorn to employ those of another. a stale trick is his aversion. he would return a purse, i am sure, upon discovering that he had obtained it by an unoriginal diddle. impertinence.--your diddler is impertinent. he swaggers. he sets his arms a-kimbo. he thrusts his hands in his trowsers’ pockets. he sneers in your face. he treads on your corns. he eats your dinner, he drinks your wine, he borrows your money, he pulls your nose, he kicks your poodle, and he kisses your wife. grin:--your true diddler winds up all with a grin. but this nobody sees but himself. he grins when his daily work is done--when his allotted labors are accomplished--at night in his own closet, and altogether for his own private entertainment. he goes home. he locks his door. he divests himself of his clothes. he puts out his candle. he gets into bed. he places his head upon the pillow. all this done, and your diddler grins. this is no hypothesis. it is a matter of course. i reason a priori, and a diddle would be no diddle without a grin. the origin of the diddle is referrable to the infancy of the human race. perhaps the first diddler was adam. at all events, we can trace the science back to a very remote period of antiquity. the moderns, however, have brought it to a perfection never dreamed of by our thick-headed progenitors. without pausing to speak of the “old saws,” therefore, i shall content myself with a compendious account of some of the more “modern instances.” a very good diddle is this. a housekeeper in want of a sofa, for instance, is seen to go in and out of several cabinet warehouses. at length she arrives at one offering an excellent variety. she is accosted, and invited to enter, by a polite and voluble individual at the door. she finds a sofa well adapted to her views, and upon inquiring the price, is surprised and delighted to hear a sum named at least twenty per cent. lower than her expectations. she hastens to make the purchase, gets a bill and receipt, leaves her address, with a request that the article be sent home as speedily as possible, and retires amid a profusion of bows from the shopkeeper. the night arrives and no sofa. a servant is sent to make inquiry about the delay. the whole transaction is denied. no sofa has been sold--no money received--except by the diddler, who played shop-keeper for the nonce. our cabinet warehouses are left entirely unattended, and thus afford every facility for a trick of this kind. visiters enter, look at furniture, and depart unheeded and unseen. should any one wish to purchase, or to inquire the price of an article, a bell is at hand, and this is considered amply sufficient. again, quite a respectable diddle is this. a well-dressed individual enters a shop, makes a purchase to the value of a dollar; finds, much to his vexation, that he has left his pocket-book in another coat pocket; and so says to the shopkeeper-- “my dear sir, never mind; just oblige me, will you, by sending the bundle home? but stay! i really believe that i have nothing less than a five dollar bill, even there. however, you can send four dollars in change with the bundle, you know.” “very good, sir,” replies the shop-keeper, who entertains, at once, a lofty opinion of the high-mindedness of his customer. “i know fellows,” he says to himself, “who would just have put the goods under their arm, and walked off with a promise to call and pay the dollar as they came by in the afternoon.” a boy is sent with the parcel and change. on the route, quite accidentally, he is met by the purchaser, who exclaims: “ah! this is my bundle, i see--i thought you had been home with it, long ago. well, go on! my wife, mrs. trotter, will give you the five dollars--i left instructions with her to that effect. the change you might as well give to me--i shall want some silver for the post office. very good! one, two, is this a good quarter?--three, four--quite right! say to mrs. trotter that you met me, and be sure now and do not loiter on the way.” the boy doesn’t loiter at all--but he is a very long time in getting back from his errand--for no lady of the precise name of mrs. trotter is to be discovered. he consoles himself, however, that he has not been such a fool as to leave the goods without the money, and re-entering his shop with a self-satisfied air, feels sensibly hurt and indignant when his master asks him what has become of the change. a very simple diddle, indeed, is this. the captain of a ship, which is about to sail, is presented by an official looking person with an unusually moderate bill of city charges. glad to get off so easily, and confused by a hundred duties pressing upon him all at once, he discharges the claim forthwith. in about fifteen minutes, another and less reasonable bill is handed him by one who soon makes it evident that the first collector was a diddler, and the original collection a diddle. and here, too, is a somewhat similar thing. a steamboat is casting loose from the wharf. a traveller, portmanteau in hand, is discovered running toward the wharf, at full speed. suddenly, he makes a dead halt, stoops, and picks up something from the ground in a very agitated manner. it is a pocket-book, and--“has any gentleman lost a pocketbook?” he cries. no one can say that he has exactly lost a pocket-book; but a great excitement ensues, when the treasure trove is found to be of value. the boat, however, must not be detained. “time and tide wait for no man,” says the captain. “for god’s sake, stay only a few minutes,” says the finder of the book--“the true claimant will presently appear.” “can’t wait!” replies the man in authority; “cast off there, d’ye hear?” “what am i to do?” asks the finder, in great tribulation. “i am about to leave the country for some years, and i cannot conscientiously retain this large amount in my possession. i beg your pardon, sir,” [here he addresses a gentleman on shore,] “but you have the air of an honest man. will you confer upon me the favor of taking charge of this pocket-book--i know i can trust you--and of advertising it? the notes, you see, amount to a very considerable sum. the owner will, no doubt, insist upon rewarding you for your trouble-- “me!--no, you!--it was you who found the book.” “well, if you must have it so--i will take a small reward--just to satisfy your scruples. let me see--why these notes are all hundreds--bless my soul! a hundred is too much to take--fifty would be quite enough, i am sure-- “cast off there!” says the captain. “but then i have no change for a hundred, and upon the whole, you had better-- “cast off there!” says the captain. “never mind!” cries the gentleman on shore, who has been examining his own pocket-book for the last minute or so--“never mind! i can fix it--here is a fifty on the bank of north america--throw the book.” and the over-conscientious finder takes the fifty with marked reluctance, and throws the gentleman the book, as desired, while the steamboat fumes and fizzes on her way. in about half an hour after her departure, the “large amount” is seen to be a “counterfeit presentment,” and the whole thing a capital diddle. a bold diddle is this. a camp-meeting, or something similar, is to be held at a certain spot which is accessible only by means of a free bridge. a diddler stations himself upon this bridge, respectfully informs all passers by of the new county law, which establishes a toll of one cent for foot passengers, two for horses and donkeys, and so forth, and so forth. some grumble but all submit, and the diddler goes home a wealthier man by some fifty or sixty dollars well earned. this taking a toll from a great crowd of people is an excessively troublesome thing. a neat diddle is this. a friend holds one of the diddler’s promises to pay, filled up and signed in due form, upon the ordinary blanks printed in red ink. the diddler purchases one or two dozen of these blanks, and every day dips one of them in his soup, makes his dog jump for it, and finally gives it to him as a bonne bouche. the note arriving at maturity, the diddler, with the diddler’s dog, calls upon the friend, and the promise to pay is made the topic of discussion. the friend produces it from his escritoire, and is in the act of reaching it to the diddler, when up jumps the diddler’s dog and devours it forthwith. the diddler is not only surprised but vexed and incensed at the absurd behavior of his dog, and expresses his entire readiness to cancel the obligation at any moment when the evidence of the obligation shall be forthcoming. a very mean diddle is this. a lady is insulted in the street by a diddler’s accomplice. the diddler himself flies to her assistance, and, giving his friend a comfortable thrashing, insists upon attending the lady to her own door. he bows, with his hand upon his heart, and most respectfully bids her adieu. she entreats him, as her deliverer, to walk in and be introduced to her big brother and her papa. with a sigh, he declines to do so. “is there no way, then, sir,” she murmurs, “in which i may be permitted to testify my gratitude?” “why, yes, madam, there is. will you be kind enough to lend me a couple of shillings?” in the first excitement of the moment the lady decides upon fainting outright. upon second thought, however, she opens her purse-strings and delivers the specie. now this, i say, is a diddle minute--for one entire moiety of the sum borrowed has to be paid to the gentleman who had the trouble of performing the insult, and who had then to stand still and be thrashed for performing it. rather a small but still a scientific diddle is this. the diddler approaches the bar of a tavern, and demands a couple of twists of tobacco. these are handed to him, when, having slightly examined them, he says: “i don’t much like this tobacco. here, take it back, and give me a glass of brandy and water in its place.” the brandy and water is furnished and imbibed, and the diddler makes his way to the door. but the voice of the tavern-keeper arrests him. “i believe, sir, you have forgotten to pay for your brandy and water.” “pay for my brandy and water!--didn’t i give you the tobacco for the brandy and water? what more would you have?” “but, sir, if you please, i don’t remember that you paid me for the tobacco.” “what do you mean by that, you scoundrel?--didn’t i give you back your tobacco? isn’t that your tobacco lying there? do you expect me to pay for what i did not take?” “but, sir,” says the publican, now rather at a loss what to say, “but sir-” “but me no buts, sir,” interrupts the diddler, apparently in very high dudgeon, and slamming the door after him, as he makes his escape.--“but me no buts, sir, and none of your tricks upon travellers.” here again is a very clever diddle, of which the simplicity is not its least recommendation. a purse, or pocket-book, being really lost, the loser inserts in one of the daily papers of a large city a fully descriptive advertisement. whereupon our diddler copies the facts of this advertisement, with a change of heading, of general phraseology and address. the original, for instance, is long, and verbose, is headed “a pocket-book lost!” and requires the treasure, when found, to be left at no. <UNK> tom street. the copy is brief, and being headed with “lost” only, indicates no. <UNK> dick, or no. <UNK> harry street, as the locality at which the owner may be seen. moreover, it is inserted in at least five or six of the daily papers of the day, while in point of time, it makes its appearance only a few hours after the original. should it be read by the loser of the purse, he would hardly suspect it to have any reference to his own misfortune. but, of course, the chances are five or six to one, that the finder will repair to the address given by the diddler, rather than to that pointed out by the rightful proprietor. the former pays the reward, pockets the treasure and decamps. quite an analogous diddle is this. a lady of ton has dropped, some where in the street, a diamond ring of very unusual value. for its recovery, she offers some forty or fifty dollars reward--giving, in her advertisement, a very minute description of the gem, and of its settings, and declaring that, on its restoration at no. so and so, in such and such avenue, the reward would be paid instanter, without a single question being asked. during the lady’s absence from home, a day or two afterwards, a ring is heard at the door of no. so and so, in such and such avenue; a servant appears; the lady of the house is asked for and is declared to be out, at which astounding information, the visitor expresses the most poignant regret. his business is of importance and concerns the lady herself. in fact, he had the good fortune to find her diamond ring. but perhaps it would be as well that he should call again. “by no means!” says the servant; and “by no means!” says the lady’s sister and the lady’s sister-in-law, who are summoned forthwith. the ring is clamorously identified, the reward is paid, and the finder nearly thrust out of doors. the lady returns and expresses some little dissatisfaction with her sister and sister-in-law, because they happen to have paid forty or fifty dollars for a fac-simile of her diamond ring--a fac-simile made out of real pinch-beck and unquestionable paste. but as there is really no end to diddling, so there would be none to this essay, were i even to hint at half the variations, or inflections, of which this science is susceptible. i must bring this paper, perforce, to a conclusion, and this i cannot do better than by a summary notice of a very decent, but rather elaborate diddle, of which our own city was made the theatre, not very long ago, and which was subsequently repeated with success, in other still more verdant localities of the union. a middle-aged gentleman arrives in town from parts unknown. he is remarkably precise, cautious, staid, and deliberate in his demeanor. his dress is scrupulously neat, but plain, unostentatious. he wears a white cravat, an ample waistcoat, made with an eye to comfort alone; thick-soled cosy-looking shoes, and pantaloons without straps. he has the whole air, in fact, of your well-to-do, sober-sided, exact, and respectable “man of business,” par excellence--one of the stern and outwardly hard, internally soft, sort of people that we see in the crack high comedies--fellows whose words are so many bonds, and who are noted for giving away guineas, in charity, with the one hand, while, in the way of mere bargain, they exact the uttermost fraction of a farthing with the other. he makes much ado before he can get suited with a boarding house. he dislikes children. he has been accustomed to quiet. his habits are methodical--and then he would prefer getting into a private and respectable small family, piously inclined. terms, however, are no object--only he must insist upon settling his bill on the first of every month, (it is now the second) and begs his landlady, when he finally obtains one to his mind, not on any account to forget his instructions upon this point--but to send in a bill, and receipt, precisely at ten o’clock, on the first day of every month, and under no circumstances to put it off to the second. these arrangements made, our man of business rents an office in a reputable rather than a fashionable quarter of the town. there is nothing he more despises than pretense. “where there is much show,” he says, “there is seldom any thing very solid behind”--an observation which so profoundly impresses his landlady’s fancy, that she makes a pencil memorandum of it forthwith, in her great family bible, on the broad margin of the proverbs of solomon. the next step is to advertise, after some such fashion as this, in the principal business six-pennies of the city--the pennies are eschewed as not “respectable”--and as demanding payment for all advertisements in advance. our man of business holds it as a point of his faith that work should never be paid for until done. “wanted--the advertisers, being about to commence extensive business operations in this city, will require the services of three or four intelligent and competent clerks, to whom a liberal salary will be paid. the very best recommendations, not so much for capacity, as for integrity, will be expected. indeed, as the duties to be performed involve high responsibilities, and large amounts of money must necessarily pass through the hands of those engaged, it is deemed advisable to demand a deposit of fifty dollars from each clerk employed. no person need apply, therefore, who is not prepared to leave this sum in the possession of the advertisers, and who cannot furnish the most satisfactory testimonials of morality. young gentlemen piously inclined will be preferred. application should be made between the hours of ten and eleven a. m., and four and five p. m., of messrs. “bogs, hogs logs, frogs & co., “no. <UNK> dog street” by the thirty-first day of the month, this advertisement has brought to the office of messrs. bogs, hogs, logs, frogs, and company, some fifteen or twenty young gentlemen piously inclined. but our man of business is in no hurry to conclude a contract with any--no man of business is ever precipitate--and it is not until the most rigid catechism in respect to the piety of each young gentleman’s inclination, that his services are engaged and his fifty dollars receipted for, just by way of proper precaution, on the part of the respectable firm of bogs, hogs, logs, frogs, and company. on the morning of the first day of the next month, the landlady does not present her bill, according to promise--a piece of neglect for which the comfortable head of the house ending in ogs would no doubt have chided her severely, could he have been prevailed upon to remain in town a day or two for that purpose. as it is, the constables have had a sad time of it, running hither and thither, and all they can do is to declare the man of business most emphatically, a “hen knee high”--by which some persons imagine them to imply that, in fact, he is n. e. i.--by which again the very classical phrase non est inventus, is supposed to be understood. in the meantime the young gentlemen, one and all, are somewhat less piously inclined than before, while the landlady purchases a shilling’s worth of the indian rubber, and very carefully obliterates the pencil memorandum that some fool has made in her great family bible, on the broad margin of the proverbs of solomon. the angel of the odd an extravaganza. it was a chilly november afternoon. i had just consummated an unusually hearty dinner, of which the dyspeptic _truffe_ formed not the least important item, and was sitting alone in the dining-room, with my feet upon the fender, and at my elbow a small table which i had rolled up to the fire, and upon which were some apologies for dessert, with some miscellaneous bottles of wine, spirit and _liqueur_. in the morning i had been reading glover’s “leonidas,” wilkie’s “epigoniad,” lamartine’s “pilgrimage,” barlow’s “columbiad,” tuckermann’s “sicily,” and griswold’s “curiosities”; i am willing to confess, therefore, that i now felt a little stupid. i made effort to arouse myself by aid of frequent lafitte, and, all failing, i betook myself to a stray newspaper in despair. having carefully perused the column of “houses to let,” and the column of “dogs lost,” and then the two columns of “wives and apprentices runaway,” i attacked with great resolution the editorial matter, and, reading it from beginning to end without understanding a syllable, conceived the possibility of its being chinese, and so re-read it from the end to the beginning, but with no more satisfactory result. i was about throwing away, in disgust, “this folio of four pages, happy work which not even critics criticise,” when i felt my attention somewhat aroused by the paragraph which follows: “the avenues to death are numerous and strange. a london paper mentions the decease of a person from a singular cause. he was playing at ‘puff the dart,’ which is played with a long needle inserted in some worsted, and blown at a target through a tin tube. he placed the needle at the wrong end of the tube, and drawing his breath strongly to puff the dart forward with force, drew the needle into his throat. it entered the lungs, and in a few days killed him.” upon seeing this i fell into a great rage, without exactly knowing why. “this thing,” i exclaimed, “is a contemptible falsehood--a poor hoax--the lees of the invention of some pitiable penny-a-liner--of some wretched concoctor of accidents in cocaigne. these fellows, knowing the extravagant gullibility of the age, set their wits to work in the imagination of improbable possibilities---of odd accidents, as they term them; but to a reflecting intellect (like mine,” i added, in parenthesis, putting my forefinger unconsciously to the side of my nose,) “to a contemplative understanding such as i myself possess, it seems evident at once that the marvelous increase of late in these ‘odd accidents’ is by far the oddest accident of all. for my own part, i intend to believe nothing henceforward that has anything of the ‘singular’ about it.” “mein gott, den, vat a vool you bees for dat!” replied one of the most remarkable voices i ever heard. at first i took it for a rumbling in my ears--such as a man sometimes experiences when getting very drunk--but, upon second thought, i considered the sound as more nearly resembling that which proceeds from an empty barrel beaten with a big stick; and, in fact, this i should have concluded it to be, but for the articulation of the syllables and words. i am by no means naturally nervous, and the very few glasses of lafitte which i had sipped served to embolden me no little, so that i felt nothing of trepidation, but merely uplifted my eyes with a leisurely movement, and looked carefully around the room for the intruder. i could not, however, perceive any one at all. “humph!” resumed the voice, as i continued my survey, “you mus pe so dronk as de pig, den, for not zee me as i zit here at your zide.” hereupon i bethought me of looking immediately before my nose, and there, sure enough, confronting me at the table sat a personage nondescript, although not altogether indescribable. his body was a wine-pipe, or a rum-puncheon, or something of that character, and had a truly falstaffian air. in its nether extremity were inserted two kegs, which seemed to answer all the purposes of legs. for arms there dangled from the upper portion of the carcass two tolerably long bottles, with the necks outward for hands. all the head that i saw the monster possessed of was one of those hessian canteens which resemble a large snuff-box with a hole in the middle of the lid. this canteen (with a funnel on its top, like a cavalier cap slouched over the eyes) was set on edge upon the puncheon, with the hole toward myself; and through this hole, which seemed puckered up like the mouth of a very precise old maid, the creature was emitting certain rumbling and grumbling noises which he evidently intended for intelligible talk. “i zay,” said he, “you mos pe dronk as de pig, vor zit dare and not zee me zit ere; and i zay, doo, you mos pe pigger vool as de goose, vor to dispelief vat iz print in de print. ‘tiz de troof---dat it iz--eberry vord ob it.” “who are you, pray?” said i, with much dignity, although somewhat puzzled; “how did you get here? and what is it you are talking about?” “az vor ow i com’d ere,” replied the figure, “dat iz none of your pizzness; and as vor vat i be talking apout, i be talk apout vat i tink proper; and as vor who i be, vy dat is de very ting i com’d here for to let you zee for yourzelf.” “you are a drunken vagabond,” said i, “and i shall ring the bell and order my footman to kick you into the street.” “he! he! he!” said the fellow, “hu! hu! hu! dat you can’t do.” “can’t do!” said i, “what do you mean?--i can’t do what?” “ring de pell;” he replied, attempting a grin with his little villanous mouth. upon this i made an effort to get up, in order to put my threat into execution; but the ruffian just reached across the table very deliberately, and hitting me a tap on the forehead with the neck of one of the long bottles, knocked me back into the arm-chair from which i had half arisen. i was utterly astounded; and, for a moment, was quite at a loss what to do. in the meantime, he continued his talk. “you zee,” said he, “it iz te bess vor zit still; and now you shall know who i pe. look at me! zee! i am te _angel ov te odd_.” “and odd enough, too,” i ventured to reply; “but i was always under the impression that an angel had wings.” “te wing!” he cried, highly incensed, “vat i pe do mit te wing? mein gott! do you take me vor a shicken?” “no--oh no!” i replied, much alarmed, “you are no chicken--certainly not.” “well, den, zit still and pehabe yourself, or i’ll rap you again mid me vist. it iz te shicken ab te wing, und te owl ab te wing, und te imp ab te wing, und te head-teuffel ab te wing. te angel ab _not_ te wing, and i am te _angel ov te odd_.” “and your business with me at present is--is”-- “my pizzness!” ejaculated the thing, “vy vat a low bred buppy you mos pe vor to ask a gentleman und an angel apout his pizziness!” this language was rather more than i could bear, even from an angel; so, plucking up courage, i seized a salt-cellar which lay within reach, and hurled it at the head of the intruder. either he dodged, however, or my aim was inaccurate; for all i accomplished was the demolition of the crystal which protected the dial of the clock upon the mantel-piece. as for the angel, he evinced his sense of my assault by giving me two or three hard consecutive raps upon the forehead as before. these reduced me at once to submission, and i am almost ashamed to confess that either through pain or vexation, there came a few tears into my eyes. “mein gott!” said the angel of the odd, apparently much softened at my distress; “mein gott, te man is eder ferry dronk or ferry zorry. you mos not trink it so strong--you mos put te water in te wine. here, trink dis, like a goot veller, und don’t gry now--don’t!” hereupon the angel of the odd replenished my goblet (which was about a third full of port) with a colorless fluid that he poured from one of his hand bottles. i observed that these bottles had labels about their necks, and that these labels were inscribed “kirschenwasser.” the considerate kindness of the angel mollified me in no little measure; and, aided by the water with which he diluted my port more than once, i at length regained sufficient temper to listen to his very extraordinary discourse. i cannot pretend to recount all that he told me, but i gleaned from what he said that he was the genius who presided over the _contretemps_ of mankind, and whose business it was to bring about the _odd accidents_ which are continually astonishing the skeptic. once or twice, upon my venturing to express my total incredulity in respect to his pretensions, he grew very angry indeed, so that at length i considered it the wiser policy to say nothing at all, and let him have his own way. he talked on, therefore, at great length, while i merely leaned back in my chair with my eyes shut, and amused myself with munching raisins and filliping the stems about the room. but, by-and-by, the angel suddenly construed this behavior of mine into contempt. he arose in a terrible passion, slouched his funnel down over his eyes, swore a vast oath, uttered a threat of some character which i did not precisely comprehend, and finally made me a low bow and departed, wishing me, in the language of the archbishop in gil-blas, “_beaucoup de bonheur et un peu plus de bon sens_.” his departure afforded me relief. the _very_ few glasses of lafitte that i had sipped had the effect of rendering me drowsy, and i felt inclined to take a nap of some fifteen or twenty minutes, as is my custom after dinner. at six i had an appointment of consequence, which it was quite indispensable that i should keep. the policy of insurance for my dwelling house had expired the day before; and, some dispute having arisen, it was agreed that, at six, i should meet the board of directors of the company and settle the terms of a renewal. glancing upward at the clock on the mantel-piece, (for i felt too drowsy to take out my watch), i had the pleasure to find that i had still twenty-five minutes to spare. it was half past five; i could easily walk to the insurance office in five minutes; and my usual siestas had never been known to exceed five and twenty. i felt sufficiently safe, therefore, and composed myself to my slumbers forthwith. having completed them to my satisfaction, i again looked toward the time-piece and was half inclined to believe in the possibility of odd accidents when i found that, instead of my ordinary fifteen or twenty minutes, i had been dozing only three; for it still wanted seven and twenty of the appointed hour. i betook myself again to my nap, and at length a second time awoke, when, to my utter amazement, it _still_ wanted twenty-seven minutes of six. i jumped up to examine the clock, and found that it had ceased running. my watch informed me that it was half past seven; and, of course, having slept two hours, i was too late for my appointment. “it will make no difference,” i said: “i can call at the office in the morning and apologize; in the meantime what can be the matter with the clock?” upon examining it i discovered that one of the raisin stems which i had been filliping about the room during the discourse of the angel of the odd, had flown through the fractured crystal, and lodging, singularly enough, in the key-hole, with an end projecting outward, had thus arrested the revolution of the minute hand. “ah!” said i, “i see how it is. this thing speaks for itself. a natural accident, such as _will_ happen now and then!” i gave the matter no further consideration, and at my usual hour retired to bed. here, having placed a candle upon a reading stand at the bed head, and having made an attempt to peruse some pages of the “omnipresence of the deity,” i unfortunately fell asleep in less than twenty seconds, leaving the light burning as it was. my dreams were terrifically disturbed by visions of the angel of the odd. methought he stood at the foot of the couch, drew aside the curtains, and, in the hollow, detestable tones of a rum puncheon, menaced me with the bitterest vengeance for the contempt with which i had treated him. he concluded a long harangue by taking off his funnel-cap, inserting the tube into my gullet, and thus deluging me with an ocean of kirschenwässer, which he poured, in a continuous flood, from one of the long necked bottles that stood him instead of an arm. my agony was at length insufferable, and i awoke just in time to perceive that a rat had ran off with the lighted candle from the stand, but _not_ in season to prevent his making his escape with it through the hole. very soon, a strong suffocating odor assailed my nostrils; the house, i clearly perceived, was on fire. in a few minutes the blaze broke forth with violence, and in an incredibly brief period the entire building was wrapped in flames. all egress from my chamber, except through a window, was cut off. the crowd, however, quickly procured and raised a long ladder. by means of this i was descending rapidly, and in apparent safety, when a huge hog, about whose rotund stomach, and indeed about whose whole air and physiognomy, there was something which reminded me of the angel of the odd,--when this hog, i say, which hitherto had been quietly slumbering in the mud, took it suddenly into his head that his left shoulder needed scratching, and could find no more convenient rubbing-post than that afforded by the foot of the ladder. in an instant i was precipitated and had the misfortune to fracture my arm. this accident, with the loss of my insurance, and with the more serious loss of my hair, the whole of which had been singed off by the fire, predisposed me to serious impressions, so that, finally, i made up my mind to take a wife. there was a rich widow disconsolate for the loss of her seventh husband, and to her wounded spirit i offered the balm of my vows. she yielded a reluctant consent to my prayers. i knelt at her feet in gratitude and adoration. she blushed and bowed her luxuriant tresses into close contact with those supplied me, temporarily, by grandjean. i know not how the entanglement took place, but so it was. i arose with a shining pate, wigless; she in disdain and wrath, half buried in alien hair. thus ended my hopes of the widow by an accident which could not have been anticipated, to be sure, but which the natural sequence of events had brought about. without despairing, however, i undertook the siege of a less implacable heart. the fates were again propitious for a brief period; but again a trivial incident interfered. meeting my betrothed in an avenue thronged with the _élite_ of the city, i was hastening to greet her with one of my best considered bows, when a small particle of some foreign matter, lodging in the corner of my eye, rendered me, for the moment, completely blind. before i could recover my sight, the lady of my love had disappeared--irreparably affronted at what she chose to consider my premeditated rudeness in passing her by ungreeted. while i stood bewildered at the suddenness of this accident, (which might have happened, nevertheless, to any one under the sun), and while i still continued incapable of sight, i was accosted by the angel of the odd, who proffered me his aid with a civility which i had no reason to expect. he examined my disordered eye with much gentleness and skill, informed me that i had a drop in it, and (whatever a “drop” was) took it out, and afforded me relief. i now considered it high time to die, (since fortune had so determined to persecute me,) and accordingly made my way to the nearest river. here, divesting myself of my clothes, (for there is no reason why we cannot die as we were born), i threw myself headlong into the current; the sole witness of my fate being a solitary crow that had been seduced into the eating of brandy-saturated corn, and so had staggered away from his fellows. no sooner had i entered the water than this bird took it into its head to fly away with the most indispensable portion of my apparel. postponing, therefore, for the present, my suicidal design, i just slipped my nether extremities into the sleeves of my coat, and betook myself to a pursuit of the felon with all the nimbleness which the case required and its circumstances would admit. but my evil destiny attended me still. as i ran at full speed, with my nose up in the atmosphere, and intent only upon the purloiner of my property, i suddenly perceived that my feet rested no longer upon _terra-firma_; the fact is, i had thrown myself over a precipice, and should inevitably have been dashed to pieces but for my good fortune in grasping the end of a long guide-rope, which depended from a passing balloon. as soon as i sufficiently recovered my senses to comprehend the terrific predicament in which i stood or rather hung, i exerted all the power of my lungs to make that predicament known to the æronaut overhead. but for a long time i exerted myself in vain. either the fool could not, or the villain would not perceive me. meantime the machine rapidly soared, while my strength even more rapidly failed. i was soon upon the point of resigning myself to my fate, and dropping quietly into the sea, when my spirits were suddenly revived by hearing a hollow voice from above, which seemed to be lazily humming an opera air. looking up, i perceived the angel of the odd. he was leaning with his arms folded, over the rim of the car; and with a pipe in his mouth, at which he puffed leisurely, seemed to be upon excellent terms with himself and the universe. i was too much exhausted to speak, so i merely regarded him with an imploring air. for several minutes, although he looked me full in the face, he said nothing. at length removing carefully his meerschaum from the right to the left corner of his mouth, he condescended to speak. “who pe you,” he asked, “und what der teuffel you pe do dare?” to this piece of impudence, cruelty and affectation, i could reply only by ejaculating the monosyllable “help!” “elp!” echoed the ruffian--“not i. dare iz te pottle--elp yourself, und pe tam’d!” with these words he let fall a heavy bottle of kirschenwasser which, dropping precisely upon the crown of my head, caused me to imagine that my brains were entirely knocked out. impressed with this idea, i was about to relinquish my hold and give up the ghost with a good grace, when i was arrested by the cry of the angel, who bade me hold on. “old on!” he said; “don’t pe in te urry--don’t. will you pe take de odder pottle, or ave you pe got zober yet and come to your zenzes?” i made haste, hereupon, to nod my head twice--once in the negative, meaning thereby that i would prefer not taking the other bottle at present--and once in the affirmative, intending thus to imply that i _was_ sober and _had_ positively come to my senses. by these means i somewhat softened the angel. “und you pelief, ten,” he inquired, “at te last? you pelief, ten, in te possibilty of te odd?” i again nodded my head in assent. “und you ave pelief in _me_, te angel of te odd?” i nodded again. “und you acknowledge tat you pe te blind dronk and te vool?” i nodded once more. “put your right hand into your left hand preeches pocket, ten, in token ov your vull zubmizzion unto te angel ov te odd.” this thing, for very obvious reasons, i found it quite impossible to do. in the first place, my left arm had been broken in my fall from the ladder, and, therefore, had i let go my hold with the right hand, i must have let go altogether. in the second place, i could have no breeches until i came across the crow. i was therefore obliged, much to my regret, to shake my head in the negative--intending thus to give the angel to understand that i found it inconvenient, just at that moment, to comply with his very reasonable demand! no sooner, however, had i ceased shaking my head than-- “go to der teuffel, ten!” roared the angel of the odd. in pronouncing these words, he drew a sharp knife across the guide-rope by which i was suspended, and as we then happened to be precisely over my own house, (which, during my peregrinations, had been handsomely rebuilt,) it so occurred that i tumbled headlong down the ample chimney and alit upon the dining-room hearth. upon coming to my senses, (for the fall had very thoroughly stunned me,) i found it about four o’clock in the morning. i lay outstretched where i had fallen from the balloon. my head grovelled in the ashes of an extinguished fire, while my feet reposed upon the wreck of a small table, overthrown, and amid the fragments of a miscellaneous dessert, intermingled with a newspaper, some broken glass and shattered bottles, and an empty jug of the schiedam kirschenwasser. thus revenged himself the angel of the odd. [mabbott states that griswold “obviously had a revised form” for use in the <UNK> volume of poe’s works. mabbott does not substantiate this claim, but it is surely not unreasonable. an editor, and even typographical errors, may have produced nearly all of the very minor changes made in this version. (indeed, two very necessary words were clearly dropped by accident.) an editor might have corrected “wickliffe’s ‘epigoniad’” to “wilkie’s ‘epigoniad’,” but is unlikely to have added “tuckerman’s ‘sicily’” to the list of books read by the narrator. griswold was not above forgery (in poe’s letters) when it suited his purpose, but would have too little to gain by such an effort in this instance.] mellonta tauta to the editors of the lady’s book: i have the honor of sending you, for your magazine, an article which i hope you will be able to comprehend rather more distinctly than i do myself. it is a translation, by my friend, martin van buren mavis, (sometimes called the “poughkeepsie seer”) of an odd-looking ms. which i found, about a year ago, tightly corked up in a jug floating in the mare tenebrarum--a sea well described by the nubian geographer, but seldom visited now-a-days, except for the transcendentalists and divers for crotchets. truly yours, edgar a. poe {this paragraph not in the volume--ed} on board balloon “skylark” april, <UNK> <UNK> now, my dear friend--now, for your sins, you are to suffer the infliction of a long gossiping letter. i tell you distinctly that i am going to punish you for all your impertinences by being as tedious, as discursive, as incoherent and as unsatisfactory as possible. besides, here i am, cooped up in a dirty balloon, with some one or two hundred of the canaille, all bound on a pleasure excursion, (what a funny idea some people have of pleasure!) and i have no prospect of touching terra firma for a month at least. nobody to talk to. nothing to do. when one has nothing to do, then is the time to correspond with ones friends. you perceive, then, why it is that i write you this letter--it is on account of my ennui and your sins. get ready your spectacles and make up your mind to be annoyed. i mean to write at you every day during this odious voyage. heigho! when will any invention visit the human pericranium? are we forever to be doomed to the thousand inconveniences of the balloon? will nobody contrive a more expeditious mode of progress? the jog-trot movement, to my thinking, is little less than positive torture. upon my word we have not made more than a hundred miles the hour since leaving home! the very birds beat us--at least some of them. i assure you that i do not exaggerate at all. our motion, no doubt, seems slower than it actually is--this on account of our having no objects about us by which to estimate our velocity, and on account of our going with the wind. to be sure, whenever we meet a balloon we have a chance of perceiving our rate, and then, i admit, things do not appear so very bad. accustomed as i am to this mode of travelling, i cannot get over a kind of giddiness whenever a balloon passes us in a current directly overhead. it always seems to me like an immense bird of prey about to pounce upon us and carry us off in its claws. one went over us this morning about sunrise, and so nearly overhead that its drag-rope actually brushed the network suspending our car, and caused us very serious apprehension. our captain said that if the material of the bag had been the trumpery varnished “silk” of five hundred or a thousand years ago, we should inevitably have been damaged. this silk, as he explained it to me, was a fabric composed of the entrails of a species of earth-worm. the worm was carefully fed on mulberries--kind of fruit resembling a water-melon--and, when sufficiently fat, was crushed in a mill. the paste thus arising was called papyrus in its primary state, and went through a variety of processes until it finally became “silk.” singular to relate, it was once much admired as an article of female dress! balloons were also very generally constructed from it. a better kind of material, it appears, was subsequently found in the down surrounding the seed-vessels of a plant vulgarly called euphorbium, and at that time botanically termed milk-weed. this latter kind of silk was designated as silk-buckingham, on account of its superior durability, and was usually prepared for use by being varnished with a solution of gum caoutchouc--a substance which in some respects must have resembled the gutta percha now in common use. this caoutchouc was occasionally called indian rubber or rubber of twist, and was no doubt one of the numerous fungi. never tell me again that i am not at heart an antiquarian. talking of drag-ropes--our own, it seems, has this moment knocked a man overboard from one of the small magnetic propellers that swarm in ocean below us--a boat of about six thousand tons, and, from all accounts, shamefully crowded. these diminutive barques should be prohibited from carrying more than a definite number of passengers. the man, of course, was not permitted to get on board again, and was soon out of sight, he and his life-preserver. i rejoice, my dear friend, that we live in an age so enlightened that no such a thing as an individual is supposed to exist. it is the mass for which the true humanity cares. by-the-by, talking of humanity, do you know that our immortal wiggins is not so original in his views of the social condition and so forth, as his contemporaries are inclined to suppose? pundit assures me that the same ideas were put nearly in the same way, about a thousand years ago, by an irish philosopher called furrier, on account of his keeping a retail shop for cat peltries and other furs. pundit knows, you know; there can be no mistake about it. how very wonderfully do we see verified every day, the profound observation of the hindoo aries tottle (as quoted by pundit)--“thus must we say that, not once or twice, or a few times, but with almost infinite repetitions, the same opinions come round in a circle among men.” april <UNK> to-day the magnetic cutter in charge of the middle section of floating telegraph wires. i learn that when this species of telegraph was first put into operation by horse, it was considered quite impossible to convey the wires over sea, but now we are at a loss to comprehend where the difficulty lay! so wags the world. tempora mutantur--excuse me for quoting the etruscan. what would we do without the atalantic telegraph? (pundit says atlantic was the ancient adjective.) we lay to a few minutes to ask the cutter some questions, and learned, among other glorious news, that civil war is raging in africa, while the plague is doing its good work beautifully both in yurope and ayesher. is it not truly remarkable that, before the magnificent light shed upon philosophy by humanity, the world was accustomed to regard war and pestilence as calamities? do you know that prayers were actually offered up in the ancient temples to the end that these evils (!) might not be visited upon mankind? is it not really difficult to comprehend upon what principle of interest our forefathers acted? were they so blind as not to perceive that the destruction of a myriad of individuals is only so much positive advantage to the mass! april <UNK> is really a very fine amusement to ascend the rope-ladder leading to the summit of the balloon-bag, and thence survey the surrounding world. from the car below you know the prospect is not so comprehensive--you can see little vertically. but seated here (where i write this) in the luxuriously-cushioned open piazza of the summit, one can see everything that is going on in all directions. just now there is quite a crowd of balloons in sight, and they present a very animated appearance, while the air is resonant with the hum of so many millions of human voices. i have heard it asserted that when yellow or (pundit will have it) violet, who is supposed to have been the first aeronaut, maintained the practicability of traversing the atmosphere in all directions, by merely ascending or descending until a favorable current was attained, he was scarcely hearkened to at all by his contemporaries, who looked upon him as merely an ingenious sort of madman, because the philosophers (?) of the day declared the thing impossible. really now it does seem to me quite unaccountable how any thing so obviously feasible could have escaped the sagacity of the ancient savans. but in all ages the great obstacles to advancement in art have been opposed by the so-called men of science. to be sure, our men of science are not quite so bigoted as those of old:--oh, i have something so queer to tell you on this topic. do you know that it is not more than a thousand years ago since the metaphysicians consented to relieve the people of the singular fancy that there existed but two possible roads for the attainment of truth! believe it if you can! it appears that long, long ago, in the night of time, there lived a turkish philosopher (or hindoo possibly) called aries tottle. this person introduced, or at all events propagated what was termed the deductive or a priori mode of investigation. he started with what he maintained to be axioms or “self-evident truths,” and thence proceeded “logically” to results. his greatest disciples were one neuclid, and one cant. well, aries tottle flourished supreme until advent of one hog, surnamed the “ettrick shepherd,” who preached an entirely different system, which he called the a posteriori or inductive. his plan referred altogether to sensation. he proceeded by observing, analyzing, and classifying facts-instantiae naturae, as they were affectedly called--into general laws. aries tottle’s mode, in a word, was based on noumena; hog’s on phenomena. well, so great was the admiration excited by this latter system that, at its first introduction, aries tottle fell into disrepute; but finally he recovered ground and was permitted to divide the realm of truth with his more modern rival. the savans now maintained the aristotelian and baconian roads were the sole possible avenues to knowledge. “baconian,” you must know, was an adjective invented as equivalent to hog-ian and more euphonious and dignified. now, my dear friend, i do assure you, most positively, that i represent this matter fairly, on the soundest authority and you can easily understand how a notion so absurd on its very face must have operated to retard the progress of all true knowledge--which makes its advances almost invariably by intuitive bounds. the ancient idea confined investigations to crawling; and for hundreds of years so great was the infatuation about hog especially, that a virtual end was put to all thinking, properly so called. no man dared utter a truth to which he felt himself indebted to his soul alone. it mattered not whether the truth was even demonstrably a truth, for the bullet-headed savans of the time regarded only the road by which he had attained it. they would not even look at the end. “let us see the means,” they cried, “the means!” if, upon investigation of the means, it was found to come under neither the category aries (that is to say ram) nor under the category hog, why then the savans went no farther, but pronounced the “theorist” a fool, and would have nothing to do with him or his truth. now, it cannot be maintained, even, that by the crawling system the greatest amount of truth would be attained in any long series of ages, for the repression of imagination was an evil not to be compensated for by any superior certainty in the ancient modes of investigation. the error of these jurmains, these vrinch, these inglitch, and these amriccans (the latter, by the way, were our own immediate progenitors), was an error quite analogous with that of the wiseacre who fancies that he must necessarily see an object the better the more closely he holds it to his eyes. these people blinded themselves by details. when they proceeded hoggishly, their “facts” were by no means always facts--a matter of little consequence had it not been for assuming that they were facts and must be facts because they appeared to be such. when they proceeded on the path of the ram, their course was scarcely as straight as a ram’s horn, for they never had an axiom which was an axiom at all. they must have been very blind not to see this, even in their own day; for even in their own day many of the long “established” axioms had been rejected. for example--“ex nihilo nihil fit”; “a body cannot act where it is not”; “there cannot exist antipodes”; “darkness cannot come out of light”--all these, and a dozen other similar propositions, formerly admitted without hesitation as axioms, were, even at the period of which i speak, seen to be untenable. how absurd in these people, then, to persist in putting faith in “axioms” as immutable bases of truth! but even out of the mouths of their soundest reasoners it is easy to demonstrate the futility, the impalpability of their axioms in general. who was the soundest of their logicians? let me see! i will go and ask pundit and be back in a minute.... ah, here we have it! here is a book written nearly a thousand years ago and lately translated from the inglitch--which, by the way, appears to have been the rudiment of the amriccan. pundit says it is decidedly the cleverest ancient work on its topic, logic. the author (who was much thought of in his day) was one miller, or mill; and we find it recorded of him, as a point of some importance, that he had a mill-horse called bentham. but let us glance at the treatise! ah!--“ability or inability to conceive,” says mr. mill, very properly, “is in no case to be received as a criterion of axiomatic truth.” what modern in his senses would ever think of disputing this truism? the only wonder with us must be, how it happened that mr. mill conceived it necessary even to hint at any thing so obvious. so far good--but let us turn over another paper. what have we here?--“contradictories cannot both be true--that is, cannot co-exist in nature.” here mr. mill means, for example, that a tree must be either a tree or not a tree--that it cannot be at the same time a tree and not a tree. very well; but i ask him why. his reply is this--and never pretends to be any thing else than this--“because it is impossible to conceive that contradictories can both be true.” but this is no answer at all, by his own showing, for has he not just admitted as a truism that “ability or inability to conceive is in no case to be received as a criterion of axiomatic truth.” now i do not complain of these ancients so much because their logic is, by their own showing, utterly baseless, worthless and fantastic altogether, as because of their pompous and imbecile proscription of all other roads of truth, of all other means for its attainment than the two preposterous paths--the one of creeping and the one of crawling--to which they have dared to confine the soul that loves nothing so well as to soar. by the by, my dear friend, do you not think it would have puzzled these ancient dogmaticians to have determined by which of their two roads it was that the most important and most sublime of all their truths was, in effect, attained? i mean the truth of gravitation. newton owed it to kepler. kepler admitted that his three laws were guessed at--these three laws of all laws which led the great inglitch mathematician to his principle, the basis of all physical principle--to go behind which we must enter the kingdom of metaphysics. kepler guessed--that is to say imagined. he was essentially a “theorist”--that word now of so much sanctity, formerly an epithet of contempt. would it not have puzzled these old moles too, to have explained by which of the two “roads” a cryptographist unriddles a cryptograph of more than usual secrecy, or by which of the two roads champollion directed mankind to those enduring and almost innumerable truths which resulted from his deciphering the hieroglyphics. one word more on this topic and i will be done boring you. is it not passing strange that, with their eternal prattling about roads to truth, these bigoted people missed what we now so clearly perceive to be the great highway--that of consistency? does it not seem singular how they should have failed to deduce from the works of god the vital fact that a perfect consistency must be an absolute truth! how plain has been our progress since the late announcement of this proposition! investigation has been taken out of the hands of the ground-moles and given, as a task, to the true and only true thinkers, the men of ardent imagination. these latter theorize. can you not fancy the shout of scorn with which my words would be received by our progenitors were it possible for them to be now looking over my shoulder? these men, i say, theorize; and their theories are simply corrected, reduced, systematized--cleared, little by little, of their dross of inconsistency--until, finally, a perfect consistency stands apparent which even the most stolid admit, because it is a consistency, to be an absolute and an unquestionable truth. april <UNK> new gas is doing wonders, in conjunction with the new improvement with gutta percha. how very safe, commodious, manageable, and in every respect convenient are our modern balloons! here is an immense one approaching us at the rate of at least a hundred and fifty miles an hour. it seems to be crowded with people--perhaps there are three or four hundred passengers--and yet it soars to an elevation of nearly a mile, looking down upon poor us with sovereign contempt. still a hundred or even two hundred miles an hour is slow travelling after all. do you remember our flight on the railroad across the kanadaw continent?--fully three hundred miles the hour--that was travelling. nothing to be seen though--nothing to be done but flirt, feast and dance in the magnificent saloons. do you remember what an odd sensation was experienced when, by chance, we caught a glimpse of external objects while the cars were in full flight? every thing seemed unique--in one mass. for my part, i cannot say but that i preferred the travelling by the slow train of a hundred miles the hour. here we were permitted to have glass windows--even to have them open--and something like a distinct view of the country was attainable.... pundit says that the route for the great kanadaw railroad must have been in some measure marked out about nine hundred years ago! in fact, he goes so far as to assert that actual traces of a road are still discernible--traces referable to a period quite as remote as that mentioned. the track, it appears was double only; ours, you know, has twelve paths; and three or four new ones are in preparation. the ancient rails were very slight, and placed so close together as to be, according to modern notions, quite frivolous, if not dangerous in the extreme. the present width of track--fifty feet--is considered, indeed, scarcely secure enough. for my part, i make no doubt that a track of some sort must have existed in very remote times, as pundit asserts; for nothing can be clearer, to my mind, than that, at some period--not less than seven centuries ago, certainly--the northern and southern kanadaw continents were united; the kanawdians, then, would have been driven, by necessity, to a great railroad across the continent. april <UNK> am almost devoured by ennui. pundit is the only conversible person on board; and he, poor soul! can speak of nothing but antiquities. he has been occupied all the day in the attempt to convince me that the ancient amriccans governed themselves!--did ever anybody hear of such an absurdity?--that they existed in a sort of every-man-for-himself confederacy, after the fashion of the “prairie dogs” that we read of in fable. he says that they started with the queerest idea conceivable, viz: that all men are born free and equal--this in the very teeth of the laws of gradation so visibly impressed upon all things both in the moral and physical universe. every man “voted,” as they called it--that is to say meddled with public affairs--until at length, it was discovered that what is everybody’s business is nobody’s, and that the “republic” (so the absurd thing was called) was without a government at all. it is related, however, that the first circumstance which disturbed, very particularly, the self-complacency of the philosophers who constructed this “republic,” was the startling discovery that universal suffrage gave opportunity for fraudulent schemes, by means of which any desired number of votes might at any time be polled, without the possibility of prevention or even detection, by any party which should be merely villainous enough not to be ashamed of the fraud. a little reflection upon this discovery sufficed to render evident the consequences, which were that rascality must predominate--in a word, that a republican government could never be any thing but a rascally one. while the philosophers, however, were busied in blushing at their stupidity in not having foreseen these inevitable evils, and intent upon the invention of new theories, the matter was put to an abrupt issue by a fellow of the name of mob, who took every thing into his own hands and set up a despotism, in comparison with which those of the fabulous zeros and hellofagabaluses were respectable and delectable. this mob (a foreigner, by-the-by), is said to have been the most odious of all men that ever encumbered the earth. he was a giant in stature--insolent, rapacious, filthy, had the gall of a bullock with the heart of a hyena and the brains of a peacock. he died, at length, by dint of his own energies, which exhausted him. nevertheless, he had his uses, as every thing has, however vile, and taught mankind a lesson which to this day it is in no danger of forgetting--never to run directly contrary to the natural analogies. as for republicanism, no analogy could be found for it upon the face of the earth--unless we except the case of the “prairie dogs,” an exception which seems to demonstrate, if anything, that democracy is a very admirable form of government--for dogs. april <UNK> night had a fine view of alpha lyrae, whose disk, through our captain’s spy-glass, subtends an angle of half a degree, looking very much as our sun does to the naked eye on a misty day. alpha lyrae, although so very much larger than our sun, by the by, resembles him closely as regards its spots, its atmosphere, and in many other particulars. it is only within the last century, pundit tells me, that the binary relation existing between these two orbs began even to be suspected. the evident motion of our system in the heavens was (strange to say!) referred to an orbit about a prodigious star in the centre of the galaxy. about this star, or at all events about a centre of gravity common to all the globes of the milky way and supposed to be near alcyone in the pleiades, every one of these globes was declared to be revolving, our own performing the circuit in a period of <UNK> of years! we, with our present lights, our vast telescopic improvements, and so forth, of course find it difficult to comprehend the ground of an idea such as this. its first propagator was one mudler. he was led, we must presume, to this wild hypothesis by mere analogy in the first instance; but, this being the case, he should have at least adhered to analogy in its development. a great central orb was, in fact, suggested; so far mudler was consistent. this central orb, however, dynamically, should have been greater than all its surrounding orbs taken together. the question might then have been asked--“why do we not see it?”--we, especially, who occupy the mid region of the cluster--the very locality near which, at least, must be situated this inconceivable central sun. the astronomer, perhaps, at this point, took refuge in the suggestion of non-luminosity; and here analogy was suddenly let fall. but even admitting the central orb non-luminous, how did he manage to explain its failure to be rendered visible by the incalculable host of glorious suns glaring in all directions about it? no doubt what he finally maintained was merely a centre of gravity common to all the revolving orbs--but here again analogy must have been let fall. our system revolves, it is true, about a common centre of gravity, but it does this in connection with and in consequence of a material sun whose mass more than counterbalances the rest of the system. the mathematical circle is a curve composed of an infinity of straight lines; but this idea of the circle--this idea of it which, in regard to all earthly geometry, we consider as merely the mathematical, in contradistinction from the practical, idea--is, in sober fact, the practical conception which alone we have any right to entertain in respect to those titanic circles with which we have to deal, at least in fancy, when we suppose our system, with its fellows, revolving about a point in the centre of the galaxy. let the most vigorous of human imaginations but attempt to take a single step toward the comprehension of a circuit so unutterable! i would scarcely be paradoxical to say that a flash of lightning itself, travelling forever upon the circumference of this inconceivable circle, would still forever be travelling in a straight line. that the path of our sun along such a circumference--that the direction of our system in such an orbit--would, to any human perception, deviate in the slightest degree from a straight line even in a million of years, is a proposition not to be entertained; and yet these ancient astronomers were absolutely cajoled, it appears, into believing that a decisive curvature had become apparent during the brief period of their astronomical history--during the mere point--during the utter nothingness of two or three thousand years! how incomprehensible, that considerations such as this did not at once indicate to them the true state of affairs--that of the binary revolution of our sun and alpha lyrae around a common centre of gravity! april <UNK> last night our astronomical amusements. had a fine view of the five neptunian asteroids, and watched with much interest the putting up of a huge impost on a couple of lintels in the new temple at daphnis in the moon. it was amusing to think that creatures so diminutive as the lunarians, and bearing so little resemblance to humanity, yet evinced a mechanical ingenuity so much superior to our own. one finds it difficult, too, to conceive the vast masses which these people handle so easily, to be as light as our own reason tells us they actually are. april <UNK> pundit is in his glory. a balloon from kanadaw spoke us to-day and threw on board several late papers; they contain some exceedingly curious information relative to kanawdian or rather amriccan antiquities. you know, i presume, that laborers have for some months been employed in preparing the ground for a new fountain at paradise, the emperor’s principal pleasure garden. paradise, it appears, has been, literally speaking, an island time out of mind--that is to say, its northern boundary was always (as far back as any record extends) a rivulet, or rather a very narrow arm of the sea. this arm was gradually widened until it attained its present breadth--a mile. the whole length of the island is nine miles; the breadth varies materially. the entire area (so pundit says) was, about eight hundred years ago, densely packed with houses, some of them twenty stories high; land (for some most unaccountable reason) being considered as especially precious just in this vicinity. the disastrous earthquake, however, of the year <UNK> so totally uprooted and overwhelmed the town (for it was almost too large to be called a village) that the most indefatigable of our antiquarians have never yet been able to obtain from the site any sufficient data (in the shape of coins, medals or inscriptions) wherewith to build up even the ghost of a theory concerning the manners, customs, &c., &c., &c., of the aboriginal inhabitants. nearly all that we have hitherto known of them is, that they were a portion of the knickerbocker tribe of savages infesting the continent at its first discovery by recorder riker, a knight of the golden fleece. they were by no means uncivilized, however, but cultivated various arts and even sciences after a fashion of their own. it is related of them that they were acute in many respects, but were oddly afflicted with monomania for building what, in the ancient amriccan, was denominated “churches”--a kind of pagoda instituted for the worship of two idols that went by the names of wealth and fashion. in the end, it is said, the island became, nine tenths of it, church. the women, too, it appears, were oddly deformed by a natural protuberance of the region just below the small of the back--although, most unaccountably, this deformity was looked upon altogether in the light of a beauty. one or two pictures of these singular women have in fact, been miraculously preserved. they look very odd, very--like something between a turkey-cock and a dromedary. well, these few details are nearly all that have descended to us respecting the ancient knickerbockers. it seems, however, that while digging in the centre of the emperors garden, (which, you know, covers the whole island), some of the workmen unearthed a cubical and evidently chiseled block of granite, weighing several hundred pounds. it was in good preservation, having received, apparently, little injury from the convulsion which entombed it. on one of its surfaces was a marble slab with (only think of it!) an inscription--a legible inscription. pundit is in ecstacies. upon detaching the slab, a cavity appeared, containing a leaden box filled with various coins, a long scroll of names, several documents which appear to resemble newspapers, with other matters of intense interest to the antiquarian! there can be no doubt that all these are genuine amriccan relics belonging to the tribe called knickerbocker. the papers thrown on board our balloon are filled with fac-similes of the coins, mss., typography, &c., &c. i copy for your amusement the knickerbocker inscription on the marble slab:-- this corner stone of a monument to the memory of george washington was laid with appropriate ceremonies on the <UNK> day of october, <UNK> the anniversary of the surrender of lord cornwallis to general washington at yorktown a. d. <UNK> under the auspices of the washington monument association of the city of new york this, as i give it, is a verbatim translation done by pundit himself, so there can be no mistake about it. from the few words thus preserved, we glean several important items of knowledge, not the least interesting of which is the fact that a thousand years ago actual monuments had fallen into disuse--as was all very proper--the people contenting themselves, as we do now, with a mere indication of the design to erect a monument at some future time; a corner-stone being cautiously laid by itself “solitary and alone” (excuse me for quoting the great american poet benton!), as a guarantee of the magnanimous intention. we ascertain, too, very distinctly, from this admirable inscription, the how as well as the where and the what, of the great surrender in question. as to the where, it was yorktown (wherever that was), and as to the what, it was general cornwallis (no doubt some wealthy dealer in corn). he was surrendered. the inscription commemorates the surrender of--what? why, “of lord cornwallis.” the only question is what could the savages wish him surrendered for. but when we remember that these savages were undoubtedly cannibals, we are led to the conclusion that they intended him for sausage. as to the how of the surrender, no language can be more explicit. lord cornwallis was surrendered (for sausage) “under the auspices of the washington monument association”--no doubt a charitable institution for the depositing of corner-stones.--but, heaven bless me! what is the matter? ah, i see--the balloon has collapsed, and we shall have a tumble into the sea. i have, therefore, only time enough to add that, from a hasty inspection of the fac-similes of newspapers, &c., &c., i find that the great men in those days among the amriccans, were one john, a smith, and one zacchary, a tailor. good-bye, until i see you again. whether you ever get this letter or not is point of little importance, as i write altogether for my own amusement. i shall cork the ms. up in a bottle, however, and throw it into the sea. yours everlastingly, pundita. the duc de l’omelette. and stepped at once into a cooler clime.--cowper keats fell by a criticism. who was it died of “the andromache”? <UNK> ignoble souls!--de l’omelette perished of an ortolan. l’histoire en est brève. assist me, spirit of apicius! a golden cage bore the little winged wanderer, enamored, melting, indolent, to the chaussée d’antin, from its home in far peru. from its queenly possessor la bellissima, to the duc de l’omelette, six peers of the empire conveyed the happy bird. that night the duc was to sup alone. in the privacy of his bureau he reclined languidly on that ottoman for which he sacrificed his loyalty in outbidding his king--the notorious ottoman of cadet. he buries his face in the pillow. the clock strikes! unable to restrain his feelings, his grace swallows an olive. at this moment the door gently opens to the sound of soft music, and lo! the most delicate of birds is before the most enamored of men! but what inexpressible dismay now overshadows the countenance of the duc?--“horreur!--chien! baptiste!--l’oiseau! ah, bon dieu! cet oiseau modeste que tu as déshabillé de ses plumes, et que tu as servi sans papier!” it is superfluous to say more:--the duc expired in a paroxysm of disgust. “ha! ha! ha!” said his grace on the third day after his decease. “he! he! he!” replied the devil faintly, drawing himself up with an air of hauteur. “why, surely you are not serious,” retorted de l’omelette. “i have sinned--c’est vrai--but, my good sir, consider!--you have no actual intention of putting such--such barbarous threats into execution.” “no what?” said his majesty--“come, sir, strip!” “strip, indeed! very pretty i’ faith! no, sir, i shall not strip. who are you, pray, that i, duc de l’omelette, prince de foie-gras, just come of age, author of the ‘mazurkiad,’ and member of the academy, should divest myself at your bidding of the sweetest pantaloons ever made by bourdon, the daintiest robe-de-chambre ever put together by rombert--to say nothing of the taking my hair out of paper--not to mention the trouble i should have in drawing off my gloves?” “who am i?--ah, true! i am baal-zebub, prince of the fly. i took thee, just now, from a rose-wood coffin inlaid with ivory. thou wast curiously scented, and labelled as per invoice. belial sent thee,--my inspector of cemeteries. the pantaloons, which thou sayest were made by bourdon, are an excellent pair of linen drawers, and thy robe-de-chambre is a shroud of no scanty dimensions.” “sir!” replied the duc, “i am not to be insulted with impunity!--sir! i shall take the earliest opportunity of avenging this insult!--sir! you shall hear from me! in the meantime au revoir!”--and the duc was bowing himself out of the satanic presence, when he was interrupted and brought back by a gentleman in waiting. hereupon his grace rubbed his eyes, yawned, shrugged his shoulders, reflected. having become satisfied of his identity, he took a bird’s eye view of his whereabouts. the apartment was superb. even de l’omelette pronounced it bien comme il faut. it was not its length nor its breadth,--but its height--ah, that was appalling!--there was no ceiling--certainly none--but a dense whirling mass of fiery-colored clouds. his grace’s brain reeled as he glanced upward. from above, hung a chain of an unknown blood-red metal--its upper end lost, like the city of boston, parmi les nues. from its nether extremity swung a large cresset. the duc knew it to be a ruby; but from it there poured a light so intense, so still, so terrible, persia never worshipped such--gheber never imagined such--mussulman never dreamed of such when, drugged with opium, he has tottered to a bed of poppies, his back to the flowers, and his face to the god apollo. the duc muttered a slight oath, decidedly approbatory. the corners of the room were rounded into niches. three of these were filled with statues of gigantic proportions. their beauty was grecian, their deformity egyptian, their tout ensemble french. in the fourth niche the statue was veiled; it was not colossal. but then there was a taper ankle, a sandalled foot. de l’omelette pressed his hand upon his heart, closed his eyes, raised them, and caught his satanic majesty--in a blush. but the paintings!--kupris! astarte! astoreth!--a thousand and the same! and rafaelle has beheld them! yes, rafaelle has been here, for did he not paint the--? and was he not consequently damned? the paintings--the paintings! o luxury! o love!--who, gazing on those forbidden beauties, shall have eyes for the dainty devices of the golden frames that besprinkled, like stars, the hyacinth and the porphyry walls? but the duc’s heart is fainting within him. he is not, however, as you suppose, dizzy with magnificence, nor drunk with the ecstatic breath of those innumerable censers. c’est vrai que de toutes ces choses il a pensé beaucoup--mais! the duc de l’omelette is terror-stricken; for, through the lurid vista which a single uncurtained window is affording, lo! gleams the most ghastly of all fires! le pauvre duc! he could not help imagining that the glorious, the voluptuous, the never-dying melodies which pervaded that hall, as they passed filtered and transmuted through the alchemy of the enchanted window-panes, were the wailings and the howlings of the hopeless and the damned! and there, too!--there!--upon the ottoman!--who could he be?--he, the petitmaître--no, the deity--who sat as if carved in marble, et qui sourit, with his pale countenance, si amèrement? mais il faut agir--that is to say, a frenchman never faints outright. besides, his grace hated a scene--de l’omelette is himself again. there were some foils upon a table--some points also. the duc s’échapper. he measures two points, and, with a grace inimitable, offers his majesty the choice. horreur! his majesty does not fence! mais il joue!--how happy a thought!--but his grace had always an excellent memory. he had dipped in the “diable” of abbé gualtier. therein it is said “que le diable n’ose pas refuser un jeu d’ecarte.” but the chances--the chances! true--desperate: but scarcely more desperate than the duc. besides, was he not in the secret?--had he not skimmed over père le brun?--was he not a member of the club vingt-un? “si je perds,” said he, “je serai deux fois perdu--i shall be doubly dammed--voilà tout! (here his grace shrugged his shoulders.) si je gagne, je reviendrai a mes ortolans--que les cartes soient préparées!” his grace was all care, all attention--his majesty all confidence. a spectator would have thought of francis and charles. his grace thought of his game. his majesty did not think; he shuffled. the duc cut. the cards were dealt. the trump is turned--it is--it is--the king! no--it was the queen. his majesty cursed her masculine habiliments. de l’omelette placed his hand upon his heart. they play. the duc counts. the hand is out. his majesty counts heavily, smiles, and is taking wine. the duc slips a card. “c’est à vous à faire,” said his majesty, cutting. his grace bowed, dealt, and arose from the table en presentant le roi. his majesty looked chagrined. had alexander not been alexander, he would have been diogenes; and the duc assured his antagonist in taking leave, “que s’il n’eût été de l’omelette il n’aurait point d’objection d’être le diable.” the oblong box. some years ago, i engaged passage from charleston, s. c, to the city of new york, in the fine packet-ship “independence,” captain hardy. we were to sail on the fifteenth of the month (june), weather permitting; and on the fourteenth, i went on board to arrange some matters in my state-room. i found that we were to have a great many passengers, including a more than usual number of ladies. on the list were several of my acquaintances, and among other names, i was rejoiced to see that of mr. cornelius wyatt, a young artist, for whom i entertained feelings of warm friendship. he had been with me a fellow-student at c-- university, where we were very much together. he had the ordinary temperament of genius, and was a compound of misanthropy, sensibility, and enthusiasm. to these qualities he united the warmest and truest heart which ever beat in a human bosom. i observed that his name was carded upon three state-rooms; and, upon again referring to the list of passengers, i found that he had engaged passage for himself, wife, and two sisters--his own. the state-rooms were sufficiently roomy, and each had two berths, one above the other. these berths, to be sure, were so exceedingly narrow as to be insufficient for more than one person; still, i could not comprehend why there were three state-rooms for these four persons. i was, just at that epoch, in one of those moody frames of mind which make a man abnormally inquisitive about trifles: and i confess, with shame, that i busied myself in a variety of ill-bred and preposterous conjectures about this matter of the supernumerary state-room. it was no business of mine, to be sure, but with none the less pertinacity did i occupy myself in attempts to resolve the enigma. at last i reached a conclusion which wrought in me great wonder why i had not arrived at it before. “it is a servant of course,” i said; “what a fool i am, not sooner to have thought of so obvious a solution!” and then i again repaired to the list--but here i saw distinctly that no servant was to come with the party, although, in fact, it had been the original design to bring one--for the words “and servant” had been first written and then overscored. “oh, extra baggage, to be sure,” i now said to myself--“something he wishes not to be put in the hold--something to be kept under his own eye--ah, i have it--a painting or so--and this is what he has been bargaining about with nicolino, the italian jew.” this idea satisfied me, and i dismissed my curiosity for the nonce. wyatt’s two sisters i knew very well, and most amiable and clever girls they were. his wife he had newly married, and i had never yet seen her. he had often talked about her in my presence, however, and in his usual style of enthusiasm. he described her as of surpassing beauty, wit, and accomplishment. i was, therefore, quite anxious to make her acquaintance. on the day in which i visited the ship (the fourteenth), wyatt and party were also to visit it--so the captain informed me--and i waited on board an hour longer than i had designed, in hope of being presented to the bride, but then an apology came. “mrs. w. was a little indisposed, and would decline coming on board until to-morrow, at the hour of sailing.” the morrow having arrived, i was going from my hotel to the wharf, when captain hardy met me and said that, “owing to circumstances” (a stupid but convenient phrase), “he rather thought the ‘independence’ would not sail for a day or two, and that when all was ready, he would send up and let me know.” this i thought strange, for there was a stiff southerly breeze; but as “the circumstances” were not forthcoming, although i pumped for them with much perseverance, i had nothing to do but to return home and digest my impatience at leisure. i did not receive the expected message from the captain for nearly a week. it came at length, however, and i immediately went on board. the ship was crowded with passengers, and every thing was in the bustle attendant upon making sail. wyatt’s party arrived in about ten minutes after myself. there were the two sisters, the bride, and the artist--the latter in one of his customary fits of moody misanthropy. i was too well used to these, however, to pay them any special attention. he did not even introduce me to his wife--this courtesy devolving, per force, upon his sister marian--a very sweet and intelligent girl, who, in a few hurried words, made us acquainted. mrs. wyatt had been closely veiled; and when she raised her veil, in acknowledging my bow, i confess that i was very profoundly astonished. i should have been much more so, however, had not long experience advised me not to trust, with too implicit a reliance, the enthusiastic descriptions of my friend, the artist, when indulging in comments upon the loveliness of woman. when beauty was the theme, i well knew with what facility he soared into the regions of the purely ideal. the truth is, i could not help regarding mrs. wyatt as a decidedly plain-looking woman. if not positively ugly, she was not, i think, very far from it. she was dressed, however, in exquisite taste--and then i had no doubt that she had captivated my friend’s heart by the more enduring graces of the intellect and soul. she said very few words, and passed at once into her state-room with mr. w. my old inquisitiveness now returned. there was no servant--that was a settled point. i looked, therefore, for the extra baggage. after some delay, a cart arrived at the wharf, with an oblong pine box, which was every thing that seemed to be expected. immediately upon its arrival we made sail, and in a short time were safely over the bar and standing out to sea. the box in question was, as i say, oblong. it was about six feet in length by two and a half in breadth; i observed it attentively, and like to be precise. now this shape was peculiar; and no sooner had i seen it, than i took credit to myself for the accuracy of my guessing. i had reached the conclusion, it will be remembered, that the extra baggage of my friend, the artist, would prove to be pictures, or at least a picture; for i knew he had been for several weeks in conference with nicolino:--and now here was a box, which, from its shape, could possibly contain nothing in the world but a copy of leonardo’s “last supper;” and a copy of this very “last supper,” done by rubini the younger, at florence, i had known, for some time, to be in the possession of nicolino. this point, therefore, i considered as sufficiently settled. i chuckled excessively when i thought of my acumen. it was the first time i had ever known wyatt to keep from me any of his artistical secrets; but here he evidently intended to steal a march upon me, and smuggle a fine picture to new york, under my very nose; expecting me to know nothing of the matter. i resolved to quiz him well, now and hereafter. one thing, however, annoyed me not a little. the box did not go into the extra state-room. it was deposited in wyatt’s own; and there, too, it remained, occupying very nearly the whole of the floor--no doubt to the exceeding discomfort of the artist and his wife;--this the more especially as the tar or paint with which it was lettered in sprawling capitals, emitted a strong, disagreeable, and, to my fancy, a peculiarly disgusting odor. on the lid were painted the words--“mrs. adelaide curtis, albany, new york. charge of cornelius wyatt, esq. this side up. to be handled with care.” now, i was aware that mrs. adelaide curtis, of albany, was the artist’s wife’s mother,--but then i looked upon the whole address as a mystification, intended especially for myself. i made up my mind, of course, that the box and contents would never get farther north than the studio of my misanthropic friend, in chambers street, new york. for the first three or four days we had fine weather, although the wind was dead ahead; having chopped round to the northward, immediately upon our losing sight of the coast. the passengers were, consequently, in high spirits and disposed to be social. i must except, however, wyatt and his sisters, who behaved stiffly, and, i could not help thinking, uncourteously to the rest of the party. wyatt’s conduct i did not so much regard. he was gloomy, even beyond his usual habit--in fact he was morose--but in him i was prepared for eccentricity. for the sisters, however, i could make no excuse. they secluded themselves in their staterooms during the greater part of the passage, and absolutely refused, although i repeatedly urged them, to hold communication with any person on board. mrs. wyatt herself was far more agreeable. that is to say, she was chatty; and to be chatty is no slight recommendation at sea. she became excessively intimate with most of the ladies; and, to my profound astonishment, evinced no equivocal disposition to coquet with the men. she amused us all very much. i say “amused”--and scarcely know how to explain myself. the truth is, i soon found that mrs. w. was far oftener laughed at than with. the gentlemen said little about her; but the ladies, in a little while, pronounced her “a good-hearted thing, rather indifferent looking, totally uneducated, and decidedly vulgar.” the great wonder was, how wyatt had been entrapped into such a match. wealth was the general solution--but this i knew to be no solution at all; for wyatt had told me that she neither brought him a dollar nor had any expectations from any source whatever. “he had married,” he said, “for love, and for love only; and his bride was far more than worthy of his love.” when i thought of these expressions, on the part of my friend, i confess that i felt indescribably puzzled. could it be possible that he was taking leave of his senses? what else could i think? he, so refined, so intellectual, so fastidious, with so exquisite a perception of the faulty, and so keen an appreciation of the beautiful! to be sure, the lady seemed especially fond of him--particularly so in his absence--when she made herself ridiculous by frequent quotations of what had been said by her “beloved husband, mr. wyatt.” the word “husband” seemed forever--to use one of her own delicate expressions--forever “on the tip of her tongue.” in the meantime, it was observed by all on board, that he avoided her in the most pointed manner, and, for the most part, shut himself up alone in his state-room, where, in fact, he might have been said to live altogether, leaving his wife at full liberty to amuse herself as she thought best, in the public society of the main cabin. my conclusion, from what i saw and heard, was, that, the artist, by some unaccountable freak of fate, or perhaps in some fit of enthusiastic and fanciful passion, had been induced to unite himself with a person altogether beneath him, and that the natural result, entire and speedy disgust, had ensued. i pitied him from the bottom of my heart--but could not, for that reason, quite forgive his incommunicativeness in the matter of the “last supper.” for this i resolved to have my revenge. one day he came upon deck, and, taking his arm as had been my wont, i sauntered with him backward and forward. his gloom, however (which i considered quite natural under the circumstances), seemed entirely unabated. he said little, and that moodily, and with evident effort. i ventured a jest or two, and he made a sickening attempt at a smile. poor fellow!--as i thought of his wife, i wondered that he could have heart to put on even the semblance of mirth. i determined to commence a series of covert insinuations, or innuendoes, about the oblong box--just to let him perceive, gradually, that i was not altogether the butt, or victim, of his little bit of pleasant mystification. my first observation was by way of opening a masked battery. i said something about the “peculiar shape of that box-,” and, as i spoke the words, i smiled knowingly, winked, and touched him gently with my forefinger in the ribs. the manner in which wyatt received this harmless pleasantry convinced me, at once, that he was mad. at first he stared at me as if he found it impossible to comprehend the witticism of my remark; but as its point seemed slowly to make its way into his brain, his eyes, in the same proportion, seemed protruding from their sockets. then he grew very red--then hideously pale--then, as if highly amused with what i had insinuated, he began a loud and boisterous laugh, which, to my astonishment, he kept up, with gradually increasing vigor, for ten minutes or more. in conclusion, he fell flat and heavily upon the deck. when i ran to uplift him, to all appearance he was dead. i called assistance, and, with much difficulty, we brought him to himself. upon reviving he spoke incoherently for some time. at length we bled him and put him to bed. the next morning he was quite recovered, so far as regarded his mere bodily health. of his mind i say nothing, of course. i avoided him during the rest of the passage, by advice of the captain, who seemed to coincide with me altogether in my views of his insanity, but cautioned me to say nothing on this head to any person on board. several circumstances occurred immediately after this fit of wyatt which contributed to heighten the curiosity with which i was already possessed. among other things, this: i had been nervous--drank too much strong green tea, and slept ill at night--in fact, for two nights i could not be properly said to sleep at all. now, my state-room opened into the main cabin, or dining-room, as did those of all the single men on board. wyatt’s three rooms were in the after-cabin, which was separated from the main one by a slight sliding door, never locked even at night. as we were almost constantly on a wind, and the breeze was not a little stiff, the ship heeled to leeward very considerably; and whenever her starboard side was to leeward, the sliding door between the cabins slid open, and so remained, nobody taking the trouble to get up and shut it. but my berth was in such a position, that when my own state-room door was open, as well as the sliding door in question (and my own door was always open on account of the heat,) i could see into the after-cabin quite distinctly, and just at that portion of it, too, where were situated the state-rooms of mr. wyatt. well, during two nights (not consecutive) while i lay awake, i clearly saw mrs. w., about eleven o’clock upon each night, steal cautiously from the state-room of mr. w., and enter the extra room, where she remained until daybreak, when she was called by her husband and went back. that they were virtually separated was clear. they had separate apartments--no doubt in contemplation of a more permanent divorce; and here, after all i thought was the mystery of the extra state-room. there was another circumstance, too, which interested me much. during the two wakeful nights in question, and immediately after the disappearance of mrs. wyatt into the extra state-room, i was attracted by certain singular cautious, subdued noises in that of her husband. after listening to them for some time, with thoughtful attention, i at length succeeded perfectly in translating their import. they were sounds occasioned by the artist in prying open the oblong box, by means of a chisel and mallet--the latter being apparently muffled, or deadened, by some soft woollen or cotton substance in which its head was enveloped. in this manner i fancied i could distinguish the precise moment when he fairly disengaged the lid--also, that i could determine when he removed it altogether, and when he deposited it upon the lower berth in his room; this latter point i knew, for example, by certain slight taps which the lid made in striking against the wooden edges of the berth, as he endeavored to lay it down very gently--there being no room for it on the floor. after this there was a dead stillness, and i heard nothing more, upon either occasion, until nearly daybreak; unless, perhaps, i may mention a low sobbing, or murmuring sound, so very much suppressed as to be nearly inaudible--if, indeed, the whole of this latter noise were not rather produced by my own imagination. i say it seemed to resemble sobbing or sighing--but, of course, it could not have been either. i rather think it was a ringing in my own ears. mr. wyatt, no doubt, according to custom, was merely giving the rein to one of his hobbies--indulging in one of his fits of artistic enthusiasm. he had opened his oblong box, in order to feast his eyes on the pictorial treasure within. there was nothing in this, however, to make him sob. i repeat, therefore, that it must have been simply a freak of my own fancy, distempered by good captain hardy’s green tea. just before dawn, on each of the two nights of which i speak, i distinctly heard mr. wyatt replace the lid upon the oblong box, and force the nails into their old places by means of the muffled mallet. having done this, he issued from his state-room, fully dressed, and proceeded to call mrs. w. from hers. we had been at sea seven days, and were now off cape hatteras, when there came a tremendously heavy blow from the southwest. we were, in a measure, prepared for it, however, as the weather had been holding out threats for some time. every thing was made snug, alow and aloft; and as the wind steadily freshened, we lay to, at length, under spanker and foretopsail, both double-reefed. in this trim we rode safely enough for forty-eight hours--the ship proving herself an excellent sea-boat in many respects, and shipping no water of any consequence. at the end of this period, however, the gale had freshened into a hurricane, and our after--sail split into ribbons, bringing us so much in the trough of the water that we shipped several prodigious seas, one immediately after the other. by this accident we lost three men overboard with the caboose, and nearly the whole of the larboard bulwarks. scarcely had we recovered our senses, before the foretopsail went into shreds, when we got up a storm stay--sail and with this did pretty well for some hours, the ship heading the sea much more steadily than before. the gale still held on, however, and we saw no signs of its abating. the rigging was found to be ill-fitted, and greatly strained; and on the third day of the blow, about five in the afternoon, our mizzen-mast, in a heavy lurch to windward, went by the board. for an hour or more, we tried in vain to get rid of it, on account of the prodigious rolling of the ship; and, before we had succeeded, the carpenter came aft and announced four feet of water in the hold. to add to our dilemma, we found the pumps choked and nearly useless. all was now confusion and despair--but an effort was made to lighten the ship by throwing overboard as much of her cargo as could be reached, and by cutting away the two masts that remained. this we at last accomplished--but we were still unable to do any thing at the pumps; and, in the meantime, the leak gained on us very fast. at sundown, the gale had sensibly diminished in violence, and as the sea went down with it, we still entertained faint hopes of saving ourselves in the boats. at eight p. m., the clouds broke away to windward, and we had the advantage of a full moon--a piece of good fortune which served wonderfully to cheer our drooping spirits. after incredible labor we succeeded, at length, in getting the longboat over the side without material accident, and into this we crowded the whole of the crew and most of the passengers. this party made off immediately, and, after undergoing much suffering, finally arrived, in safety, at ocracoke inlet, on the third day after the wreck. fourteen passengers, with the captain, remained on board, resolving to trust their fortunes to the jolly-boat at the stern. we lowered it without difficulty, although it was only by a miracle that we prevented it from swamping as it touched the water. it contained, when afloat, the captain and his wife, mr. wyatt and party, a mexican officer, wife, four children, and myself, with a negro valet. we had no room, of course, for any thing except a few positively necessary instruments, some provisions, and the clothes upon our backs. no one had thought of even attempting to save any thing more. what must have been the astonishment of all, then, when having proceeded a few fathoms from the ship, mr. wyatt stood up in the stern-sheets, and coolly demanded of captain hardy that the boat should be put back for the purpose of taking in his oblong box! “sit down, mr. wyatt,” replied the captain, somewhat sternly, “you will capsize us if you do not sit quite still. our gunwhale is almost in the water now.” “the box!” vociferated mr. wyatt, still standing--“the box, i say! captain hardy, you cannot, you will not refuse me. its weight will be but a trifle--it is nothing--mere nothing. by the mother who bore you--for the love of heaven--by your hope of salvation, i implore you to put back for the box!” the captain, for a moment, seemed touched by the earnest appeal of the artist, but he regained his stern composure, and merely said: “mr. wyatt, you are mad. i cannot listen to you. sit down, i say, or you will swamp the boat. stay--hold him--seize him!--he is about to spring overboard! there--i knew it--he is over!” as the captain said this, mr. wyatt, in fact, sprang from the boat, and, as we were yet in the lee of the wreck, succeeded, by almost superhuman exertion, in getting hold of a rope which hung from the fore-chains. in another moment he was on board, and rushing frantically down into the cabin. in the meantime, we had been swept astern of the ship, and being quite out of her lee, were at the mercy of the tremendous sea which was still running. we made a determined effort to put back, but our little boat was like a feather in the breath of the tempest. we saw at a glance that the doom of the unfortunate artist was sealed. as our distance from the wreck rapidly increased, the madman (for as such only could we regard him) was seen to emerge from the companion--way, up which by dint of strength that appeared gigantic, he dragged, bodily, the oblong box. while we gazed in the extremity of astonishment, he passed, rapidly, several turns of a three-inch rope, first around the box and then around his body. in another instant both body and box were in the sea--disappearing suddenly, at once and forever. we lingered awhile sadly upon our oars, with our eyes riveted upon the spot. at length we pulled away. the silence remained unbroken for an hour. finally, i hazarded a remark. “did you observe, captain, how suddenly they sank? was not that an exceedingly singular thing? i confess that i entertained some feeble hope of his final deliverance, when i saw him lash himself to the box, and commit himself to the sea.” “they sank as a matter of course,” replied the captain, “and that like a shot. they will soon rise again, however--but not till the salt melts.” “the salt!” i ejaculated. “hush!” said the captain, pointing to the wife and sisters of the deceased. “we must talk of these things at some more appropriate time.” we suffered much, and made a narrow escape, but fortune befriended us, as well as our mates in the long-boat. we landed, in fine, more dead than alive, after four days of intense distress, upon the beach opposite roanoke island. we remained here a week, were not ill-treated by the wreckers, and at length obtained a passage to new york. about a month after the loss of the “independence,” i happened to meet captain hardy in broadway. our conversation turned, naturally, upon the disaster, and especially upon the sad fate of poor wyatt. i thus learned the following particulars. the artist had engaged passage for himself, wife, two sisters and a servant. his wife was, indeed, as she had been represented, a most lovely, and most accomplished woman. on the morning of the fourteenth of june (the day in which i first visited the ship), the lady suddenly sickened and died. the young husband was frantic with grief--but circumstances imperatively forbade the deferring his voyage to new york. it was necessary to take to her mother the corpse of his adored wife, and, on the other hand, the universal prejudice which would prevent his doing so openly was well known. nine-tenths of the passengers would have abandoned the ship rather than take passage with a dead body. in this dilemma, captain hardy arranged that the corpse, being first partially embalmed, and packed, with a large quantity of salt, in a box of suitable dimensions, should be conveyed on board as merchandise. nothing was to be said of the lady’s decease; and, as it was well understood that mr. wyatt had engaged passage for his wife, it became necessary that some person should personate her during the voyage. this the deceased lady’s-maid was easily prevailed on to do. the extra state-room, originally engaged for this girl during her mistress’ life, was now merely retained. in this state-room the pseudo-wife, slept, of course, every night. in the daytime she performed, to the best of her ability, the part of her mistress--whose person, it had been carefully ascertained, was unknown to any of the passengers on board. my own mistake arose, naturally enough, through too careless, too inquisitive, and too impulsive a temperament. but of late, it is a rare thing that i sleep soundly at night. there is a countenance which haunts me, turn as i will. there is an hysterical laugh which will forever ring within my ears. loss of breath o breathe not, etc. --moore’s melodies the most notorious ill-fortune must in the end yield to the untiring courage of philosophy--as the most stubborn city to the ceaseless vigilance of an enemy. shalmanezer, as we have it in holy writings, lay three years before samaria; yet it fell. sardanapalus--see diodorus--maintained himself seven in nineveh; but to no purpose. troy expired at the close of the second lustrum; and azoth, as aristaeus declares upon his honour as a gentleman, opened at last her gates to psammetichus, after having barred them for the fifth part of a century.... “thou wretch!--thou vixen!--thou shrew!” said i to my wife on the morning after our wedding; “thou witch!--thou hag!--thou whippersnapper--thou sink of iniquity!--thou fiery-faced quintessence of all that is abominable!--thou--thou-” here standing upon tiptoe, seizing her by the throat, and placing my mouth close to her ear, i was preparing to launch forth a new and more decided epithet of opprobrium, which should not fail, if ejaculated, to convince her of her insignificance, when to my extreme horror and astonishment i discovered that i had lost my breath. the phrases “i am out of breath,” “i have lost my breath,” etc., are often enough repeated in common conversation; but it had never occurred to me that the terrible accident of which i speak could bona fide and actually happen! imagine--that is if you have a fanciful turn--imagine, i say, my wonder--my consternation--my despair! there is a good genius, however, which has never entirely deserted me. in my most ungovernable moods i still retain a sense of propriety, et le chemin des passions me conduit--as lord edouard in the “julie” says it did him--a la philosophie veritable. although i could not at first precisely ascertain to what degree the occurrence had affected me, i determined at all events to conceal the matter from my wife, until further experience should discover to me the extent of this my unheard of calamity. altering my countenance, therefore, in a moment, from its bepuffed and distorted appearance, to an expression of arch and coquettish benignity, i gave my lady a pat on the one cheek, and a kiss on the other, and without saying one syllable (furies! i could not), left her astonished at my drollery, as i pirouetted out of the room in a pas de zephyr. behold me then safely ensconced in my private boudoir, a fearful instance of the ill consequences attending upon irascibility--alive, with the qualifications of the dead--dead, with the propensities of the living--an anomaly on the face of the earth--being very calm, yet breathless. yes! breathless. i am serious in asserting that my breath was entirely gone. i could not have stirred with it a feather if my life had been at issue, or sullied even the delicacy of a mirror. hard fate!--yet there was some alleviation to the first overwhelming paroxysm of my sorrow. i found, upon trial, that the powers of utterance which, upon my inability to proceed in the conversation with my wife, i then concluded to be totally destroyed, were in fact only partially impeded, and i discovered that had i, at that interesting crisis, dropped my voice to a singularly deep guttural, i might still have continued to her the communication of my sentiments; this pitch of voice (the guttural) depending, i find, not upon the current of the breath, but upon a certain spasmodic action of the muscles of the throat. throwing myself upon a chair, i remained for some time absorbed in meditation. my reflections, be sure, were of no consolatory kind. a thousand vague and lachrymatory fancies took possession of my soul--and even the idea of suicide flitted across my brain; but it is a trait in the perversity of human nature to reject the obvious and the ready, for the far-distant and equivocal. thus i shuddered at self-murder as the most decided of atrocities while the tabby cat purred strenuously upon the rug, and the very water dog wheezed assiduously under the table, each taking to itself much merit for the strength of its lungs, and all obviously done in derision of my own pulmonary incapacity. oppressed with a tumult of vague hopes and fears, i at length heard the footsteps of my wife descending the staircase. being now assured of her absence, i returned with a palpitating heart to the scene of my disaster. carefully locking the door on the inside, i commenced a vigorous search. it was possible, i thought, that, concealed in some obscure corner, or lurking in some closet or drawer, might be found the lost object of my inquiry. it might have a vapory--it might even have a tangible form. most philosophers, upon many points of philosophy, are still very unphilosophical. william godwin, however, says in his “mandeville,” that “invisible things are the only realities,” and this, all will allow, is a case in point. i would have the judicious reader pause before accusing such asseverations of an undue quantum of absurdity. anaxagoras, it will be remembered, maintained that snow is black, and this i have since found to be the case. long and earnestly did i continue the investigation: but the contemptible reward of my industry and perseverance proved to be only a set of false teeth, two pair of hips, an eye, and a bundle of billets-doux from mr. windenough to my wife. i might as well here observe that this confirmation of my lady’s partiality for mr. w. occasioned me little uneasiness. that mrs. lackobreath should admire anything so dissimilar to myself was a natural and necessary evil. i am, it is well known, of a robust and corpulent appearance, and at the same time somewhat diminutive in stature. what wonder, then, that the lath-like tenuity of my acquaintance, and his altitude, which has grown into a proverb, should have met with all due estimation in the eyes of mrs. lackobreath. but to return. my exertions, as i have before said, proved fruitless. closet after closet--drawer after drawer--corner after corner--were scrutinized to no purpose. at one time, however, i thought myself sure of my prize, having, in rummaging a dressing-case, accidentally demolished a bottle of grandjean’s oil of archangels--which, as an agreeable perfume, i here take the liberty of recommending. with a heavy heart i returned to my boudoir--there to ponder upon some method of eluding my wife’s penetration, until i could make arrangements prior to my leaving the country, for to this i had already made up my mind. in a foreign climate, being unknown, i might, with some probability of success, endeavor to conceal my unhappy calamity--a calamity calculated, even more than beggary, to estrange the affections of the multitude, and to draw down upon the wretch the well-merited indignation of the virtuous and the happy. i was not long in hesitation. being naturally quick, i committed to memory the entire tragedy of “metamora.” i had the good fortune to recollect that in the accentuation of this drama, or at least of such portion of it as is allotted to the hero, the tones of voice in which i found myself deficient were altogether unnecessary, and the deep guttural was expected to reign monotonously throughout. i practised for some time by the borders of a well frequented marsh;--herein, however, having no reference to a similar proceeding of demosthenes, but from a design peculiarly and conscientiously my own. thus armed at all points, i determined to make my wife believe that i was suddenly smitten with a passion for the stage. in this, i succeeded to a miracle; and to every question or suggestion found myself at liberty to reply in my most frog-like and sepulchral tones with some passage from the tragedy--any portion of which, as i soon took great pleasure in observing, would apply equally well to any particular subject. it is not to be supposed, however, that in the delivery of such passages i was found at all deficient in the looking asquint--the showing my teeth--the working my knees--the shuffling my feet--or in any of those unmentionable graces which are now justly considered the characteristics of a popular performer. to be sure they spoke of confining me in a strait-jacket--but, good god! they never suspected me of having lost my breath. having at length put my affairs in order, i took my seat very early one morning in the mail stage for--, giving it to be understood, among my acquaintances, that business of the last importance required my immediate personal attendance in that city. the coach was crammed to repletion; but in the uncertain twilight the features of my companions could not be distinguished. without making any effectual resistance, i suffered myself to be placed between two gentlemen of colossal dimensions; while a third, of a size larger, requesting pardon for the liberty he was about to take, threw himself upon my body at full length, and falling asleep in an instant, drowned all my guttural ejaculations for relief, in a snore which would have put to blush the roarings of the bull of phalaris. happily the state of my respiratory faculties rendered suffocation an accident entirely out of the question. as, however, the day broke more distinctly in our approach to the outskirts of the city, my tormentor, arising and adjusting his shirt-collar, thanked me in a very friendly manner for my civility. seeing that i remained motionless (all my limbs were dislocated and my head twisted on one side), his apprehensions began to be excited; and arousing the rest of the passengers, he communicated, in a very decided manner, his opinion that a dead man had been palmed upon them during the night for a living and responsible fellow-traveller; here giving me a thump on the right eye, by way of demonstrating the truth of his suggestion. hereupon all, one after another (there were nine in company), believed it their duty to pull me by the ear. a young practising physician, too, having applied a pocket-mirror to my mouth, and found me without breath, the assertion of my persecutor was pronounced a true bill; and the whole party expressed a determination to endure tamely no such impositions for the future, and to proceed no farther with any such carcasses for the present. i was here, accordingly, thrown out at the sign of the “crow” (by which tavern the coach happened to be passing), without meeting with any farther accident than the breaking of both my arms, under the left hind wheel of the vehicle. i must besides do the driver the justice to state that he did not forget to throw after me the largest of my trunks, which, unfortunately falling on my head, fractured my skull in a manner at once interesting and extraordinary. the landlord of the “crow,” who is a hospitable man, finding that my trunk contained sufficient to indemnify him for any little trouble he might take in my behalf, sent forthwith for a surgeon of his acquaintance, and delivered me to his care with a bill and receipt for ten dollars. the purchaser took me to his apartments and commenced operations immediately. having cut off my ears, however, he discovered signs of animation. he now rang the bell, and sent for a neighboring apothecary with whom to consult in the emergency. in case of his suspicions with regard to my existence proving ultimately correct, he, in the meantime, made an incision in my stomach, and removed several of my viscera for private dissection. the apothecary had an idea that i was actually dead. this idea i endeavored to confute, kicking and plunging with all my might, and making the most furious contortions--for the operations of the surgeon had, in a measure, restored me to the possession of my faculties. all, however, was attributed to the effects of a new galvanic battery, wherewith the apothecary, who is really a man of information, performed several curious experiments, in which, from my personal share in their fulfillment, i could not help feeling deeply interested. it was a course of mortification to me, nevertheless, that although i made several attempts at conversation, my powers of speech were so entirely in abeyance, that i could not even open my mouth; much less, then, make reply to some ingenious but fanciful theories of which, under other circumstances, my minute acquaintance with the hippocratian pathology would have afforded me a ready confutation. not being able to arrive at a conclusion, the practitioners remanded me for farther examination. i was taken up into a garret; and the surgeon’s lady having accommodated me with drawers and stockings, the surgeon himself fastened my hands, and tied up my jaws with a pocket-handkerchief--then bolted the door on the outside as he hurried to his dinner, leaving me alone to silence and to meditation. i now discovered to my extreme delight that i could have spoken had not my mouth been tied up with the pocket-handkerchief. consoling myself with this reflection, i was mentally repeating some passages of the “omnipresence of the deity,” as is my custom before resigning myself to sleep, when two cats, of a greedy and vituperative turn, entering at a hole in the wall, leaped up with a flourish a la catalani, and alighting opposite one another on my visage, betook themselves to indecorous contention for the paltry consideration of my nose. but, as the loss of his ears proved the means of elevating to the throne of cyrus, the magian or mige-gush of persia, and as the cutting off his nose gave zopyrus possession of babylon, so the loss of a few ounces of my countenance proved the salvation of my body. aroused by the pain, and burning with indignation, i burst, at a single effort, the fastenings and the bandage. stalking across the room i cast a glance of contempt at the belligerents, and throwing open the sash to their extreme horror and disappointment, precipitated myself, very dexterously, from the window. the mail-robber w---, to whom i bore a singular resemblance, was at this moment passing from the city jail to the scaffold erected for his execution in the suburbs. his extreme infirmity and long continued ill health had obtained him the privilege of remaining unmanacled; and habited in his gallows costume--one very similar to my own,--he lay at full length in the bottom of the hangman’s cart (which happened to be under the windows of the surgeon at the moment of my precipitation) without any other guard than the driver, who was asleep, and two recruits of the sixth infantry, who were drunk. as ill-luck would have it, i alit upon my feet within the vehicle. immediately, he bolted out behind, and turning down an alley, was out of sight in the twinkling of an eye. the recruits, aroused by the bustle, could not exactly comprehend the merits of the transaction. seeing, however, a man, the precise counterpart of the felon, standing upright in the cart before their eyes, they were of (so they expressed themselves,) and, having communicated this opinion to one another, they took each a dram, and then knocked me down with the butt-ends of their muskets. it was not long ere we arrived at the place of destination. of course nothing could be said in my defence. hanging was my inevitable fate. i resigned myself thereto with a feeling half stupid, half acrimonious. being little of a cynic, i had all the sentiments of a dog. the hangman, however, adjusted the noose about my neck. the drop fell. i forbear to depict my sensations upon the gallows; although here, undoubtedly, i could speak to the point, and it is a topic upon which nothing has been well said. in fact, to write upon such a theme it is necessary to have been hanged. every author should confine himself to matters of experience. thus mark antony composed a treatise upon getting drunk. i may just mention, however, that die i did not. my body was, but i had no breath to be, suspended; and but for the knot under my left ear (which had the feel of a military stock) i dare say that i should have experienced very little inconvenience. as for the jerk given to my neck upon the falling of the drop, it merely proved a corrective to the twist afforded me by the fat gentleman in the coach. for good reasons, however, i did my best to give the crowd the worth of their trouble. my convulsions were said to be extraordinary. my spasms it would have been difficult to beat. the populace encored. several gentlemen swooned; and a multitude of ladies were carried home in hysterics. pinxit availed himself of the opportunity to retouch, from a sketch taken upon the spot, his admirable painting of the “marsyas flayed alive.” when i had afforded sufficient amusement, it was thought proper to remove my body from the gallows;--this the more especially as the real culprit had in the meantime been retaken and recognized, a fact which i was so unlucky as not to know. much sympathy was, of course, exercised in my behalf, and as no one made claim to my corpse, it was ordered that i should be interred in a public vault. here, after due interval, i was deposited. the sexton departed, and i was left alone. a line of marston’s “malcontent”-- death’s a good fellow and keeps open house--struck me at that moment as a palpable lie. i knocked off, however, the lid of my coffin, and stepped out. the place was dreadfully dreary and damp, and i became troubled with ennui. by way of amusement, i felt my way among the numerous coffins ranged in order around. i lifted them down, one by one, and breaking open their lids, busied myself in speculations about the mortality within. “this,” i soliloquized, tumbling over a carcass, puffy, bloated, and rotund--“this has been, no doubt, in every sense of the word, an unhappy--an unfortunate man. it has been his terrible lot not to walk but to waddle--to pass through life not like a human being, but like an elephant--not like a man, but like a rhinoceros. “his attempts at getting on have been mere abortions, and his circumgyratory proceedings a palpable failure. taking a step forward, it has been his misfortune to take two toward the right, and three toward the left. his studies have been confined to the poetry of crabbe. he can have no idea of the wonder of a pirouette. to him a pas de papillon has been an abstract conception. he has never ascended the summit of a hill. he has never viewed from any steeple the glories of a metropolis. heat has been his mortal enemy. in the dog-days his days have been the days of a dog. therein, he has dreamed of flames and suffocation--of mountains upon mountains--of pelion upon ossa. he was short of breath--to say all in a word, he was short of breath. he thought it extravagant to play upon wind instruments. he was the inventor of self-moving fans, wind-sails, and ventilators. he patronized du pont the bellows-maker, and he died miserably in attempting to smoke a cigar. his was a case in which i feel a deep interest--a lot in which i sincerely sympathize. “but here,”--said i--“here”--and i dragged spitefully from its receptacle a gaunt, tall and peculiar-looking form, whose remarkable appearance struck me with a sense of unwelcome familiarity--“here is a wretch entitled to no earthly commiseration.” thus saying, in order to obtain a more distinct view of my subject, i applied my thumb and forefinger to its nose, and causing it to assume a sitting position upon the ground, held it thus, at the length of my arm, while i continued my soliloquy. “entitled,” i repeated, “to no earthly commiseration. who indeed would think of compassioning a shadow? besides, has he not had his full share of the blessings of mortality? he was the originator of tall monuments--shot-towers--lightning-rods--lombardy poplars. his treatise upon “shades and shadows” has immortalized him. he edited with distinguished ability the last edition of “south on the bones.” he went early to college and studied pneumatics. he then came home, talked eternally, and played upon the french-horn. he patronized the bagpipes. captain barclay, who walked against time, would not walk against him. windham and allbreath were his favorite writers,--his favorite artist, phiz. he died gloriously while inhaling gas--levique flatu corrupitur, like the fama pudicitae in hieronymus. <UNK> he was indubitably a”-- “how can you?--how--can--you?”--interrupted the object of my animadversions, gasping for breath, and tearing off, with a desperate exertion, the bandage around its jaws--“how can you, mr. lackobreath, be so infernally cruel as to pinch me in that manner by the nose? did you not see how they had fastened up my mouth--and you must know--if you know any thing--how vast a superfluity of breath i have to dispose of! if you do not know, however, sit down and you shall see. in my situation it is really a great relief to be able to open ones mouth--to be able to expatiate--to be able to communicate with a person like yourself, who do not think yourself called upon at every period to interrupt the thread of a gentleman’s discourse. interruptions are annoying and should undoubtedly be abolished--don’t you think so?--no reply, i beg you,--one person is enough to be speaking at a time.--i shall be done by and by, and then you may begin.--how the devil sir, did you get into this place?--not a word i beseech you--been here some time myself--terrible accident!--heard of it, i suppose?--awful calamity!--walking under your windows--some short while ago--about the time you were stage-struck--horrible occurrence!--heard of “catching one’s breath,” eh?--hold your tongue i tell you!--i caught somebody elses!--had always too much of my own--met blab at the corner of the street--wouldn’t give me a chance for a word--couldn’t get in a syllable edgeways--attacked, consequently, with epilepsis--blab made his escape--damn all fools!--they took me up for dead, and put me in this place--pretty doings all of them!--heard all you said about me--every word a lie--horrible!--wonderful--outrageous!--hideous!--incomprehensible!--et cetera--et cetera--et cetera--et cetera-” it is impossible to conceive my astonishment at so unexpected a discourse, or the joy with which i became gradually convinced that the breath so fortunately caught by the gentleman (whom i soon recognized as my neighbor windenough) was, in fact, the identical expiration mislaid by myself in the conversation with my wife. time, place, and circumstances rendered it a matter beyond question. i did not at least during the long period in which the inventor of lombardy poplars continued to favor me with his explanations. in this respect i was actuated by that habitual prudence which has ever been my predominating trait. i reflected that many difficulties might still lie in the path of my preservation which only extreme exertion on my part would be able to surmount. many persons, i considered, are prone to estimate commodities in their possession--however valueless to the then proprietor--however troublesome, or distressing--in direct ratio with the advantages to be derived by others from their attainment, or by themselves from their abandonment. might not this be the case with mr. windenough? in displaying anxiety for the breath of which he was at present so willing to get rid, might i not lay myself open to the exactions of his avarice? there are scoundrels in this world, i remembered with a sigh, who will not scruple to take unfair opportunities with even a next door neighbor, and (this remark is from epictetus) it is precisely at that time when men are most anxious to throw off the burden of their own calamities that they feel the least desirous of relieving them in others. upon considerations similar to these, and still retaining my grasp upon the nose of mr. w., i accordingly thought proper to model my reply. “monster!” i began in a tone of the deepest indignation--“monster and double-winded idiot!--dost thou, whom for thine iniquities it has pleased heaven to accurse with a two-fold respimtion--dost thou, i say, presume to address me in the familiar language of an old acquaintance?--‘i lie,’ forsooth! and ‘hold my tongue,’ to be sure!--pretty conversation indeed, to a gentleman with a single breath!--all this, too, when i have it in my power to relieve the calamity under which thou dost so justly suffer--to curtail the superfluities of thine unhappy respiration.” like brutus, i paused for a reply--with which, like a tornado, mr. windenough immediately overwhelmed me. protestation followed upon protestation, and apology upon apology. there were no terms with which he was unwilling to comply, and there were none of which i failed to take the fullest advantage. preliminaries being at length arranged, my acquaintance delivered me the respiration; for which (having carefully examined it) i gave him afterward a receipt. i am aware that by many i shall be held to blame for speaking in a manner so cursory, of a transaction so impalpable. it will be thought that i should have entered more minutely, into the details of an occurrence by which--and this is very true--much new light might be thrown upon a highly interesting branch of physical philosophy. to all this i am sorry that i cannot reply. a hint is the only answer which i am permitted to make. there were circumstances--but i think it much safer upon consideration to say as little as possible about an affair so delicate--so delicate, i repeat, and at the time involving the interests of a third party whose sulphurous resentment i have not the least desire, at this moment, of incurring. we were not long after this necessary arrangement in effecting an escape from the dungeons of the sepulchre. the united strength of our resuscitated voices was soon sufficiently apparent. scissors, the whig editor, republished a treatise upon “the nature and origin of subterranean noises.” a reply--rejoinder--confutation--and justification--followed in the columns of a democratic gazette. it was not until the opening of the vault to decide the controversy, that the appearance of mr. windenough and myself proved both parties to have been decidedly in the wrong. i cannot conclude these details of some very singular passages in a life at all times sufficiently eventful, without again recalling to the attention of the reader the merits of that indiscriminate philosophy which is a sure and ready shield against those shafts of calamity which can neither be seen, felt nor fully understood. it was in the spirit of this wisdom that, among the ancient hebrews, it was believed the gates of heaven would be inevitably opened to that sinner, or saint, who, with good lungs and implicit confidence, should vociferate the word “amen!” it was in the spirit of this wisdom that, when a great plague raged at athens, and every means had been in vain attempted for its removal, epimenides, as laertius relates, in his second book, of that philosopher, advised the erection of a shrine and temple “to the proper god.” lyttleton barry. the man that was used up. a tale of the late bugaboo and kickapoo campaign. _pleurez, pleurez, mes yeux, et fondez vous en eau!_ _la moitié; de ma vie a mis l’ autre au tombeau._ corneille. i cannot just now remember when or where i first made the acquaintance of that truly fine-looking fellow, brevet brigadier general john a. b. c. smith. some one _did_ introduce me to the gentleman, i am sure--at some public meeting, i know very well--held about something of great importance, no doubt--at some place or other, i feel convinced,--whose name i have unaccountably forgotten. the truth is--that the introduction was attended, upon my part, with a degree of anxious embarrassment which operated to prevent any definite impressions of either time or place. i am constitutionally nervous--this, with me, is a family failing, and i can’t help it. in especial, the slightest appearance of mystery--of any point i cannot exactly comprehend--puts me at once into a pitiable state of agitation. there was something, as it were, remarkable--yes, _remarkable_, although this is but a feeble term to express my full meaning--about the entire individuality of the personage in question. he was, perhaps, six feet in height, and of a presence singularly commanding. there was an _air distingué_ pervading the whole man, which spoke of high breeding, and hinted at high birth. upon this topic--the topic of smith’s personal appearance--i have a kind of melancholy satisfaction in being minute. his head of hair would have done honor to a brutus;--nothing could be more richly flowing, or possess a brighter gloss. it was of a jetty black;--which was also the color, or more properly the no color of his unimaginable whiskers. you perceive i cannot speak of these latter without enthusiasm; it is not too much to say that they were the handsomest pair of whiskers under the sun. at all events, they encircled, and at times partially overshadowed, a mouth utterly unequalled. here were the most entirely even, and the most brilliantly white of all conceivable teeth. from between them, upon every proper occasion, issued a voice of surpassing clearness, melody, and strength. in the matter of eyes, also, my acquaintance was pre-eminently endowed. either one of such a pair was worth a couple of the ordinary ocular organs. they were of a deep hazel, exceedingly large and lustrous; and there was perceptible about them, ever and anon, just that amount of interesting obliquity which gives pregnancy to expression. the bust of the general was unquestionably the finest bust i ever saw. for your life you could not have found a fault with its wonderful proportion. this rare peculiarity set off to great advantage a pair of shoulders which would have called up a blush of conscious inferiority into the countenance of the marble apollo. i have a passion for fine shoulders, and may say that i never beheld them in perfection before. the arms altogether were admirably modelled. nor were the lower limbs less superb. these were, indeed, the _ne plus ultra_ of good legs. every connoisseur in such matters admitted the legs to be good. there was neither too much flesh, nor too little,--neither rudeness nor fragility. i could not imagine a more graceful curve than that of the _os femoris_, and there was just that due gentle prominence in the rear of the _fibula_ which goes to the conformation of a properly proportioned calf. i wish to god my young and talented friend chiponchipino, the sculptor, had but seen the legs of brevet brigadier general john a. b. c. smith. but although men so absolutely fine-looking are neither as plenty as reasons or blackberries, still i could not bring myself to believe that _the remarkable_ something to which i alluded just now,--that the odd air of _je ne sais quoi_ which hung about my new acquaintance,--lay altogether, or indeed at all, in the supreme excellence of his bodily endowments. perhaps it might be traced to the _manner_;--yet here again i could not pretend to be positive. there _was_ a primness, not to say stiffness, in his carriage--a degree of measured, and, if i may so express it, of rectangular precision, attending his every movement, which, observed in a more diminutive figure, would have had the least little savor in the world, of affectation, pomposity or constraint, but which noticed in a gentleman of his undoubted dimensions, was readily placed to the account of reserve, _hauteur_--of a commendable sense, in short, of what is due to the dignity of colossal proportion. the kind friend who presented me to general smith whispered in my ear some few words of comment upon the man. he was a _remarkable_ man--a _very_ remarkable man--indeed one of the _most_ remarkable men of the age. he was an especial favorite, too, with the ladies--chiefly on account of his high reputation for courage. “in _that_ point he is unrivalled--indeed he is a perfect desperado--a down-right fire-eater, and no mistake,” said my friend, here dropping his voice excessively low, and thrilling me with the mystery of his tone. “a downright fire-eater, and _no_ mistake. showed _that_, i should say, to some purpose, in the late tremendous swamp-fight away down south, with the bugaboo and kickapoo indians.” [here my friend opened his eyes to some extent.] “bless my soul!--blood and thunder, and all that!--_prodigies_ of valor!--heard of him of course?--you know he’s the man”-- “man alive, how _do_ you do? why, how _are_ ye? _very_ glad to see ye, indeed!” here interrupted the general himself, seizing my companion by the hand as he drew near, and bowing stiffly, but profoundly, as i was presented. i then thought, (and i think so still,) that i never heard a clearer nor a stronger voice, nor beheld a finer set of teeth: but i _must_ say that i was sorry for the interruption just at that moment, as, owing to the whispers and insinuations aforesaid, my interest had been greatly excited in the hero of the bugaboo and kickapoo campaign. however, the delightfully luminous conversation of brevet brigadier general john a. b. c. smith soon completely dissipated this chagrin. my friend leaving us immediately, we had quite a long _tête-à-tête_, and i was not only pleased but _really_--instructed. i never heard a more fluent talker, or a man of greater general information. with becoming modesty, he forebore, nevertheless, to touch upon the theme i had just then most at heart--i mean the mysterious circumstances attending the bugaboo war--and, on my own part, what i conceive to be a proper sense of delicacy forbade me to broach the subject; although, in truth, i was exceedingly tempted to do so. i perceived, too, that the gallant soldier preferred topics of philosophical interest, and that he delighted, especially, in commenting upon the rapid march of mechanical invention. indeed, lead him where i would, this was a point to which he invariably came back. “there is nothing at all like it,” he would say; “we are a wonderful people, and live in a wonderful age. parachutes and rail-roads--man-traps and spring-guns! our steam-boats are upon every sea, and the nassau balloon packet is about to run regular trips (fare either way only twenty pounds sterling) between london and timbuctoo. and who shall calculate the immense influence upon social life--upon arts--upon commerce--upon literature--which will be the immediate result of the great principles of electro magnetics! nor, is this all, let me assure you! there is really no end to the march of invention. the most wonderful--the most ingenious--and let me add, mr.--mr.--thompson, i believe, is your name--let me add, i say, the most _useful_--the most truly _useful_ mechanical contrivances, are daily springing up like mushrooms, if i may so express myself, or, more figuratively, like--ah--grasshoppers--like grasshoppers, mr. thompson--about us and ah--ah--ah--around us!” thompson, to be sure, is not my name; but it is needless to say that i left general smith with a heightened interest in the man, with an exalted opinion of his conversational powers, and a deep sense of the valuable privileges we enjoy in living in this age of mechanical invention. my curiosity, however, had not been altogether satisfied, and i resolved to prosecute immediate inquiry among my acquaintances touching the brevet brigadier general himself, and particularly respecting the tremendous events _quorum pars magna fuit_, during the bugaboo and kickapoo campaign. the first opportunity which presented itself, and which (_horresco referens_) i did not in the least scruple to seize, occurred at the church of the reverend doctor drummummupp, where i found myself established, one sunday, just at sermon time, not only in the pew, but by the side, of that worthy and communicative little friend of mine, miss tabitha t. thus seated, i congratulated myself, and with much reason, upon the very flattering state of affairs. if any person knew anything about brevet brigadier general john a. b. c. smith, that person, it was clear to me, was miss tabitha t. we telegraphed a few signals, and then commenced, _soto voce_, a brisk _tête-à-tête_. “smith!” said she, in reply to my very earnest inquiry; “smith!--why, not general john a. b. c.? bless me, i thought you _knew_ all about _him!_ this is a wonderfully inventive age! horrid affair that!--a bloody set of wretches, those kickapoos!--fought like a hero--prodigies of valor--immortal renown. smith!--brevet brigadier general john a. b. c.! why, you know he’s the man”-- “man,” here broke in doctor drummummupp, at the top of his voice, and with a thump that came near knocking the pulpit about our ears; “man that is born of a woman hath but a short time to live; he cometh up and is cut down like a flower!” i started to the extremity of the pew, and perceived by the animated looks of the divine, that the wrath which had nearly proved fatal to the pulpit had been excited by the whispers of the lady and myself. there was no help for it; so i submitted with a good grace, and listened, in all the martyrdom of dignified silence, to the balance of that very capital discourse. next evening found me a somewhat late visitor at the rantipole theatre, where i felt sure of satisfying my curiosity at once, by merely stepping into the box of those exquisite specimens of affability and omniscience, the misses arabella and miranda cognoscenti. that fine tragedian, climax, was doing iago to a very crowded house, and i experienced some little difficulty in making my wishes understood; especially, as our box was next the slips, and completely overlooked the stage. “smith?” said miss arabella, as she at length comprehended the purport of my query; “smith?--why, not general john a. b. c.?” “smith?” inquired miranda, musingly. “god bless me, did you ever behold a finer figure?” “never, madam, but _do_ tell me”-- “or so inimitable grace?” “never, upon my word!--but pray inform me”-- “or so just an appreciation of stage effect?” “madam!” “or a more delicate sense of the true beauties of shakespeare? be so good as to look at that leg!” “the devil!” and i turned again to her sister. “smith?” said she, “why, not general john a. b. c.? horrid affair that, wasn’t it?--great wretches, those bugaboos--savage and so on--but we live in a wonderfully inventive age!--smith!--o yes! great man!--perfect desperado--immortal renown--prodigies of valor! _never heard!_” [this was given in a scream.] “bless my soul! why, he’s the man”-- “-----mandragora nor all the drowsy syrups of the world shall ever medicine thee to that sweet sleep which thou owd’st yesterday!” here roared our climax just in my ear, and shaking his fist in my face all the time, in a way that i _couldn’t_ stand, and i _wouldn’t_. i left the misses cognoscenti immediately, went behind the scenes forthwith, and gave the beggarly scoundrel such a thrashing as i trust he will remember to the day of his death. at the _soirée_ of the lovely widow, mrs. kathleen o’trump, i was confident that i should meet with no similar disappointment. accordingly, i was no sooner seated at the card-table, with my pretty hostess for a _vis-à-vis_, than i propounded those questions the solution of which had become a matter so essential to my peace. “smith?” said my partner, “why, not general john a. b. c.? horrid affair that, wasn’t it?--diamonds, did you say?--terrible wretches those kickapoos!--we are playing _whist_, if you please, mr. tattle--however, this is the age of invention, most certainly _the_ age, one may say--_the_ age _par excellence_--speak french?--oh, quite a hero--perfect desperado!--_no hearts_, mr. tattle? i don’t believe it!--immortal renown and all that!--prodigies of valor! _never heard!!_--why, bless me, he’s the man”-- “mann?--_captain_ mann?” here screamed some little feminine interloper from the farthest corner of the room. “are you talking about captain mann and the duel?--oh, i _must_ hear--do tell--go on, mrs. o’trump!--do now go on!” and go on mrs. o’trump did--all about a certain captain mann, who was either shot or hung, or should have been both shot and hung. yes! mrs. o’trump, she went on, and i--i went off. there was no chance of hearing anything farther that evening in regard to brevet brigadier general john a. b. c. smith. still i consoled myself with the reflection that the tide of ill luck would not run against me forever, and so determined to make a bold push for information at the rout of that bewitching little angel, the graceful mrs. pirouette. “smith?” said mrs. p., as we twirled about together in a _pas de zephyr_, “smith?--why, not general john a. b. c.? dreadful business that of the bugaboos, wasn’t it?--dreadful creatures, those indians!--_do_ turn out your toes! i really am ashamed of you--man of great courage, poor fellow!--but this is a wonderful age for invention--o dear me, i’m out of breath--quite a desperado--prodigies of valor--_never heard!!_--can’t believe it--i shall have to sit down and enlighten you--smith! why, he’s the man”-- “man-_fred_, i tell you!” here bawled out miss bas-bleu, as i led mrs. pirouette to a seat. “did ever anybody hear the like? it’s man-_fred_, i say, and not at all by any means man-_friday_.” here miss bas-bleu beckoned to me in a very peremptory manner; and i was obliged, will i nill i, to leave mrs. p. for the purpose of deciding a dispute touching the title of a certain poetical drama of lord byron’s. although i pronounced, with great promptness, that the true title was man-_friday_, and not by any means man-_fred_, yet when i returned to seek mrs. pirouette she was not to be discovered, and i made my retreat from the house in a very bitter spirit of animosity against the whole race of the bas-bleus. matters had now assumed a really serious aspect, and i resolved to call at once upon my particular friend, mr. theodore sinivate; for i knew that here at least i should get something like definite information. “smith?” said he, in his well-known peculiar way of drawling out his syllables; “smith?--why, not general john a. b. c.? savage affair that with the kickapo-o-o-os, wasn’t it? say! don’t you think so?--perfect despera-a-ado--great pity, ‘pon my honor!--wonderfully inventive age!--pro-o-odigies of valor! by the by, did you ever hear about captain ma-a-a-a-n?” “captain mann be d--d!” said i; “please to go on with your story.” “hem!--oh well!--quite _la même cho-o-ose_, as we say in france. smith, eh? brigadier-general john a. b. c.? i say”--[here mr. s. thought proper to put his finger to the side of his nose]--“i say, you don’t mean to insinuate now, really and truly, and conscientiously, that you don’t know all about that affair of smith’s, as well as i do, eh? smith? john a-b-c.? why, bless me, he’s the ma-a-an”-- “_mr_. sinivate,” said i, imploringly, “_is_ he the man in the mask?” “no-o-o!” said he, looking wise, “nor the man in the mo-o-on.” this reply i considered a pointed and positive insult, and so left the house at once in high dudgeon, with a firm resolve to call my friend, mr. sinivate, to a speedy account for his ungentlemanly conduct and ill-breeding. in the meantime, however, i had no notion of being thwarted touching the information i desired. there was one resource left me yet. i would go to the fountain-head. i would call forthwith upon the general himself, and demand, in explicit terms, a solution of this abominable piece of mystery. here, at least, there should be no chance for equivocation. i would be plain, positive, peremptory--as short as pie-crust--as concise as tacitus or montesquieu. it was early when i called, and the general was dressing; but i pleaded urgent business, and was shown at once into his bed-room by an old negro valet, who remained in attendance during my visit. as i entered the chamber, i looked about, of course, for the occupant, but did not immediately perceive him. there was a large and exceedingly odd-looking bundle of something which lay close by my feet on the floor, and, as i was not in the best humor in the world, i gave it a kick out of the way. “hem! ahem! rather civil that, i should say!” said the bundle, in one of the smallest, and altogether the funniest little voices, between a squeak and a whistle, that i ever heard in all the days of my existence. “ahem! rather civil that, i should observe.” i fairly shouted with terror, and made off, at a tangent, into the farthest extremity of the room. “god bless me! my dear fellow,” here again whistled the bundle, “what--what--what--why, what _is_ the matter? i really believe you don’t know me at all.” what _could_ i say to all this--what _could_ i? i staggered into an arm-chair, and, with staring eyes and open mouth, awaited the solution of the wonder. “strange you shouldn’t know me though, isn’t it?” presently re-squeaked the nondescript, which i now perceived was performing, upon the floor, some inexplicable evolution, very analogous to the drawing on of a stocking. there was only a single leg, however, apparent. “strange you shouldn’t know me, though, isn’t it? pompey, bring me that leg!” here pompey handed the bundle, a very capital cork leg, already dressed, which it screwed on in a trice; and then it stood up before my eyes. “and a bloody action it _was_,” continued the thing, as if in a soliloquy; “but then one mustn’t fight with the bugaboos and kickapoos, and think of coming off with a mere scratch. pompey, i’ll thank you now for that arm. thomas” [turning to me] “is decidedly the best hand at a cork leg; but if you should ever want an arm, my dear fellow, you must really let me recommend you to bishop.” here pompey screwed on an arm. “we had rather hot work of it, that you may say. now, you dog, slip on my shoulders and bosom! pettitt makes the best shoulders, but for a bosom you will have to go to ducrow.” “bosom!” said i. “pompey, will you _never_ be ready with that wig? scalping is a rough process after all; but then you can procure such a capital scratch at de l’orme’s.” “scratch!” “now, you nigger, my teeth! for a _good_ set of these you had better go to parmly’s at once; high prices, but excellent work. i swallowed some very capital articles, though, when the big bugaboo rammed me down with the butt end of his rifle.” “butt end! ram down!! my eye!!” “o yes, by-the-by, my eye--here, pompey, you scamp, screw it in ! those kickapoos are not so very slow at a gouge; but he’s a belied man, that dr. williams, after all; you can’t imagine how well i see with the eyes of his make.” i now began very clearly to perceive that the object before me was nothing more nor less than my new acquaintance, brevet brigadier general john a. b. c. smith. the manipulations of pompey had made, i must confess, a very striking difference in the appearance of the personal man. the voice, however, still puzzled me no little; but even this apparent mystery was speedily cleared up. “pompey, you black rascal,” squeaked the general, “i really do believe you would let me go out without my palate.” hereupon, the negro, grumbling out an apology, went up to his master, opened his mouth with the knowing air of a horse-jockey, and adjusted therein a somewhat singular-looking machine, in a very dexterous manner, that i could not altogether comprehend. the alteration, however, in the entire expression of the general’s countenance was instantaneous and surprising. when he again spoke, his voice had resumed all that rich melody and strength which i had noticed upon our original introduction. “d--n the vagabonds!” said he, in so clear a tone that i positively started at the change, “d--n the vagabonds! they not only knocked in the roof of my mouth, but took the trouble to cut off at least seven-eighths of my tongue. there isn’t bonfanti’s equal, however, in america, for really good articles of this description. i can recommend you to him with confidence,” [here the general bowed,] “and assure you that i have the greatest pleasure in so doing.” i acknowledged his kindness in my best manner, and took leave of him at once, with a perfect understanding of the true state of affairs--with a full comprehension of the mystery which had troubled me so long. it was evident. it was a clear case. brevet brigadier general john a. b. c. smith was the man--was _the man that was used up_. the business man method is the soul of business.--old saying. i am a business man. i am a methodical man. method is the thing, after all. but there are no people i more heartily despise than your eccentric fools who prate about method without understanding it; attending strictly to its letter, and violating its spirit. these fellows are always doing the most out-of-the-way things in what they call an orderly manner. now here, i conceive, is a positive paradox. true method appertains to the ordinary and the obvious alone, and cannot be applied to the outre. what definite idea can a body attach to such expressions as “methodical jack o’ dandy,” or “a systematical will o’ the wisp”? my notions upon this head might not have been so clear as they are, but for a fortunate accident which happened to me when i was a very little boy. a good-hearted old irish nurse (whom i shall not forget in my will) took me up one day by the heels, when i was making more noise than was necessary, and swinging me round two or knocked my head into a cocked hat against the bedpost. this, i say, decided my fate, and made my fortune. a bump arose at once on my sinciput, and turned out to be as pretty an organ of order as one shall see on a summer’s day. hence that positive appetite for system and regularity which has made me the distinguished man of business that i am. if there is any thing on earth i hate, it is a genius. your geniuses are all arrant asses--the greater the genius the greater the ass--and to this rule there is no exception whatever. especially, you cannot make a man of business out of a genius, any more than money out of a jew, or the best nutmegs out of pine-knots. the creatures are always going off at a tangent into some fantastic employment, or ridiculous speculation, entirely at variance with the “fitness of things,” and having no business whatever to be considered as a business at all. thus you may tell these characters immediately by the nature of their occupations. if you ever perceive a man setting up as a merchant or a manufacturer, or going into the cotton or tobacco trade, or any of those eccentric pursuits; or getting to be a drygoods dealer, or soap-boiler, or something of that kind; or pretending to be a lawyer, or a blacksmith, or a physician--any thing out of the usual way--you may set him down at once as a genius, and then, according to the rule-of-three, he’s an ass. now i am not in any respect a genius, but a regular business man. my day-book and ledger will evince this in a minute. they are well kept, though i say it myself; and, in my general habits of accuracy and punctuality, i am not to be beat by a clock. moreover, my occupations have been always made to chime in with the ordinary habitudes of my fellowmen. not that i feel the least indebted, upon this score, to my exceedingly weak-minded parents, who, beyond doubt, would have made an arrant genius of me at last, if my guardian angel had not come, in good time, to the rescue. in biography the truth is every thing, and in autobiography it is especially so--yet i scarcely hope to be believed when i state, however solemnly, that my poor father put me, when i was about fifteen years of age, into the counting-house of what be termed “a respectable hardware and commission merchant doing a capital bit of business!” a capital bit of fiddlestick! however, the consequence of this folly was, that in two or three days, i had to be sent home to my button-headed family in a high state of fever, and with a most violent and dangerous pain in the sinciput, all around about my organ of order. it was nearly a gone case with me then--just touch-and-go for six weeks--the physicians giving me up and all that sort of thing. but, although i suffered much, i was a thankful boy in the main. i was saved from being a “respectable hardware and commission merchant, doing a capital bit of business,” and i felt grateful to the protuberance which had been the means of my salvation, as well as to the kindhearted female who had originally put these means within my reach. the most of boys run away from home at ten or twelve years of age, but i waited till i was sixteen. i don’t know that i should have gone even then, if i had not happened to hear my old mother talk about setting me up on my own hook in the grocery way. the grocery way!--only think of that! i resolved to be off forthwith, and try and establish myself in some decent occupation, without dancing attendance any longer upon the caprices of these eccentric old people, and running the risk of being made a genius of in the end. in this project i succeeded perfectly well at the first effort, and by the time i was fairly eighteen, found myself doing an extensive and profitable business in the tailor’s walking-advertisement line. i was enabled to discharge the onerous duties of this profession, only by that rigid adherence to system which formed the leading feature of my mind. a scrupulous method characterized my actions as well as my accounts. in my case it was method--not money--which made the man: at least all of him that was not made by the tailor whom i served. at nine, every morning, i called upon that individual for the clothes of the day. ten o’clock found me in some fashionable promenade or other place of public amusement. the precise regularity with which i turned my handsome person about, so as to bring successively into view every portion of the suit upon my back, was the admiration of all the knowing men in the trade. noon never passed without my bringing home a customer to the house of my employers, messrs. cut & comeagain. i say this proudly, but with tears in my eyes--for the firm proved themselves the basest of ingrates. the little account, about which we quarreled and finally parted, cannot, in any item, be thought overcharged, by gentlemen really conversant with the nature of the business. upon this point, however, i feel a degree of proud satisfaction in permitting the reader to judge for himself. my bill ran thus: messrs. cut & comeagain, merchant tailors. to peter proffit, walking advertiser, drs. july <UNK> promenade, as usual and customer brought home... <UNK> <UNK> july <UNK> do do do <UNK> july <UNK> one lie,

size)................. <UNK> aug. <UNK> do do (small man and bad pay)....... <UNK> total [sic] <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the item chiefly disputed in this bill was the very moderate charge of two pennies for the dickey. upon my word of honor, this was not an unreasonable price for that dickey. it was one of the cleanest and prettiest little dickeys i ever saw; and i have good reason to believe that it effected the sale of three petershams. the elder partner of the firm, however, would allow me only one penny of the charge, and took it upon himself to show in what manner four of the same sized conveniences could be got out of a sheet of foolscap. but it is needless to say that i stood upon the principle of the thing. business is business, and should be done in a business way. there was no system whatever in swindling me out of a penny--a clear fraud of fifty per cent--no method in any respect. i left at once the employment of messrs. cut & comeagain, and set up in the eye-sore line by myself--one of the most lucrative, respectable, and independent of the ordinary occupations. my strict integrity, economy, and rigorous business habits, here again came into play. i found myself driving a flourishing trade, and soon became a marked man upon ‘change. the truth is, i never dabbled in flashy matters, but jogged on in the good old sober routine of the calling--a calling in which i should, no doubt, have remained to the present hour, but for a little accident which happened to me in the prosecution of one of the usual business operations of the profession. whenever a rich old hunks or prodigal heir or bankrupt corporation gets into the notion of putting up a palace, there is no such thing in the world as stopping either of them, and this every intelligent person knows. the fact in question is indeed the basis of the eye-sore trade. as soon, therefore, as a building-project is fairly afoot by one of these parties, we merchants secure a nice corner of the lot in contemplation, or a prime little situation just adjoining, or tight in front. this done, we wait until the palace is half-way up, and then we pay some tasty architect to run us up an ornamental mud hovel, right against it; or a down-east or dutch pagoda, or a pig-sty, or an ingenious little bit of fancy work, either esquimau, kickapoo, or hottentot. of course we can’t afford to take these structures down under a bonus of five hundred per cent upon the prime cost of our lot and plaster. can we? i ask the question. i ask it of business men. it would be irrational to suppose that we can. and yet there was a rascally corporation which asked me to do this very thing--this very thing! i did not reply to their absurd proposition, of course; but i felt it a duty to go that same night, and lamp-black the whole of their palace. for this the unreasonable villains clapped me into jail; and the gentlemen of the eye-sore trade could not well avoid cutting my connection when i came out. the assault-and-battery business, into which i was now forced to adventure for a livelihood, was somewhat ill-adapted to the delicate nature of my constitution; but i went to work in it with a good heart, and found my account here, as heretofore, in those stern habits of methodical accuracy which had been thumped into me by that delightful old nurse--i would indeed be the basest of men not to remember her well in my will. by observing, as i say, the strictest system in all my dealings, and keeping a well-regulated set of books, i was enabled to get over many serious difficulties, and, in the end, to establish myself very decently in the profession. the truth is, that few individuals, in any line, did a snugger little business than i. i will just copy a page or so out of my day-book; and this will save me the necessity of blowing my own trumpet--a contemptible practice of which no high-minded man will be guilty. now, the day-book is a thing that don’t lie. “jan. <UNK> year’s day. met snap in the street, groggy. mem--he’ll do. met gruff shortly afterward, blind drunk. mem--he’ll answer, too. entered both gentlemen in my ledger, and opened a running account with each. “jan. <UNK> snap at the exchange, and went up and trod on his toe. doubled his fist and knocked me down. good!--got up again. some trifling difficulty with bag, my attorney. i want the damages at a thousand, but he says that for so simple a knock down we can’t lay them at more than five hundred. mem--must get rid of bag--no system at all. “jan. <UNK> to the theatre, to look for gruff. saw him sitting in a side box, in the second tier, between a fat lady and a lean one. quizzed the whole party through an opera-glass, till i saw the fat lady blush and whisper to g. went round, then, into the box, and put my nose within reach of his hand. wouldn’t pull it--no go. blew it, and tried again--no go. sat down then, and winked at the lean lady, when i had the high satisfaction of finding him lift me up by the nape of the neck, and fling me over into the pit. neck dislocated, and right leg capitally splintered. went home in high glee, drank a bottle of champagne, and booked the young man for five thousand. bag says it’ll do. “feb. <UNK> the case of mr. snap. amount entered in journal--fifty cents--which see. “feb. <UNK> by that ruffian, gruff, who made me a present of five dollars. costs of suit, four dollars and twenty-five cents. nett profit,--see journal,--seventy-five cents.” now, here is a clear gain, in a very brief period, of no less than one dollar and twenty-five cents--this is in the mere cases of snap and gruff; and i solemnly assure the reader that these extracts are taken at random from my day-book. it’s an old saying, and a true one, however, that money is nothing in comparison with health. i found the exactions of the profession somewhat too much for my delicate state of body; and, discovering, at last, that i was knocked all out of shape, so that i didn’t know very well what to make of the matter, and so that my friends, when they met me in the street, couldn’t tell that i was peter proffit at all, it occurred to me that the best expedient i could adopt was to alter my line of business. i turned my attention, therefore, to mud-dabbling, and continued it for some years. the worst of this occupation is, that too many people take a fancy to it, and the competition is in consequence excessive. every ignoramus of a fellow who finds that he hasn’t brains in sufficient quantity to make his way as a walking advertiser, or an eye-sore prig, or a salt-and-batter man, thinks, of course, that he’ll answer very well as a dabbler of mud. but there never was entertained a more erroneous idea than that it requires no brains to mud-dabble. especially, there is nothing to be made in this way without method. i did only a retail business myself, but my old habits of system carried me swimmingly along. i selected my street-crossing, in the first place, with great deliberation, and i never put down a broom in any part of the town but that. i took care, too, to have a nice little puddle at hand, which i could get at in a minute. by these means i got to be well known as a man to be trusted; and this is one-half the battle, let me tell you, in trade. nobody ever failed to pitch me a copper, and got over my crossing with a clean pair of pantaloons. and, as my business habits, in this respect, were sufficiently understood, i never met with any attempt at imposition. i wouldn’t have put up with it, if i had. never imposing upon any one myself, i suffered no one to play the possum with me. the frauds of the banks of course i couldn’t help. their suspension put me to ruinous inconvenience. these, however, are not individuals, but corporations; and corporations, it is very well known, have neither bodies to be kicked nor souls to be damned. i was making money at this business when, in an evil moment, i was induced to merge it in the cur-spattering--a somewhat analogous, but, by no means, so respectable a profession. my location, to be sure, was an excellent one, being central, and i had capital blacking and brushes. my little dog, too, was quite fat and up to all varieties of snuff. he had been in the trade a long time, and, i may say, understood it. our general routine was this:--pompey, having rolled himself well in the mud, sat upon end at the shop door, until he observed a dandy approaching in bright boots. he then proceeded to meet him, and gave the wellingtons a rub or two with his wool. then the dandy swore very much, and looked about for a boot-black. there i was, full in his view, with blacking and brushes. it was only a minute’s work, and then came a sixpence. this did moderately well for a time;--in fact, i was not avaricious, but my dog was. i allowed him a third of the profit, but he was advised to insist upon half. this i couldn’t stand--so we quarrelled and parted. i next tried my hand at the organ-grinding for a while, and may say that i made out pretty well. it is a plain, straightforward business, and requires no particular abilities. you can get a music-mill for a mere song, and to put it in order, you have but to open the works, and give them three or four smart raps with a hammer. in improves the tone of the thing, for business purposes, more than you can imagine. this done, you have only to stroll along, with the mill on your back, until you see tanbark in the street, and a knocker wrapped up in buckskin. then you stop and grind; looking as if you meant to stop and grind till doomsday. presently a window opens, and somebody pitches you a sixpence, with a request to “hush up and go on,” etc. i am aware that some grinders have actually afforded to “go on” for this sum; but for my part, i found the necessary outlay of capital too great to permit of my “going on” under a shilling. at this occupation i did a good deal; but, somehow, i was not quite satisfied, and so finally abandoned it. the truth is, i labored under the disadvantage of having no monkey--and american streets are so muddy, and a democratic rabble is so obstrusive, and so full of demnition mischievous little boys. i was now out of employment for some months, but at length succeeded, by dint of great interest, in procuring a situation in the sham-post. the duties, here, are simple, and not altogether unprofitable. for example:--very early in the morning i had to make up my packet of sham letters. upon the inside of each of these i had to scrawl a few lines on any subject which occurred to me as sufficiently mysterious--signing all the epistles tom dobson, or bobby tompkins, or anything in that way. having folded and sealed all, and stamped them with sham postmarks--new orleans, bengal, botany bay, or any other place a great way off--i set out, forthwith, upon my daily route, as if in a very great hurry. i always called at the big houses to deliver the letters, and receive the postage. nobody hesitates at paying for a letter--especially for a double one--people are such fools--and it was no trouble to get round a corner before there was time to open the epistles. the worst of this profession was, that i had to walk so much and so fast; and so frequently to vary my route. besides, i had serious scruples of conscience. i can’t bear to hear innocent individuals abused--and the way the whole town took to cursing tom dobson and bobby tompkins was really awful to hear. i washed my hands of the matter in disgust. my eighth and last speculation has been in the cat-growing way. i have found that a most pleasant and lucrative business, and, really, no trouble at all. the country, it is well known, has become infested with cats--so much so of late, that a petition for relief, most numerously and respectably signed, was brought before the legislature at its late memorable session. the assembly, at this epoch, was unusually well-informed, and, having passed many other wise and wholesome enactments, it crowned all with the cat-act. in its original form, this law offered a premium for cat-heads (fourpence a-piece), but the senate succeeded in amending the main clause, so as to substitute the word “tails” for “heads.” this amendment was so obviously proper, that the house concurred in it nem. con. as soon as the governor had signed the bill, i invested my whole estate in the purchase of toms and tabbies. at first i could only afford to feed them upon mice (which are cheap), but they fulfilled the scriptural injunction at so marvellous a rate, that i at length considered it my best policy to be liberal, and so indulged them in oysters and turtle. their tails, at a legislative price, now bring me in a good income; for i have discovered a way, in which, by means of macassar oil, i can force three crops in a year. it delights me to find, too, that the animals soon get accustomed to the thing, and would rather have the appendages cut off than otherwise. i consider myself, therefore, a made man, and am bargaining for a country seat on the hudson. the landscape garden the garden like a lady fair was cut that lay as if she slumbered in delight, and to the open skies her eyes did shut; the azure fields of heaven were ‘sembled right in a large round set with flow’rs of light: the flowers de luce and the round sparks of dew that hung upon their azure leaves, did show like twinkling stars that sparkle in the ev’ning blue. --giles fletcher no more remarkable man ever lived than my friend, the young ellison. he was remarkable in the entire and continuous profusion of good gifts ever lavished upon him by fortune. from his cradle to his grave, a gale of the blandest prosperity bore him along. nor do i use the word prosperity in its mere wordly or external sense. i mean it as synonymous with happiness. the person of whom i speak, seemed born for the purpose of foreshadowing the wild doctrines of turgot, price, priestley, and condorcet--of exemplifying, by individual instance, what has been deemed the mere chimera of the perfectionists. in the brief existence of ellison, i fancy, that i have seen refuted the dogma--that in man’s physical and spiritual nature, lies some hidden principle, the antagonist of bliss. an intimate and anxious examination of his career, has taught me to understand that, in general, from the violation of a few simple laws of humanity, arises the wretchedness of mankind; that, as a species, we have in our possession the as yet unwrought elements of content,--and that even now, in the present blindness and darkness of all idea on the great question of the social condition, it is not impossible that man, the individual, under certain unusual and highly fortuitous conditions, may be happy. with opinions such as these was my young friend fully imbued; and thus is it especially worthy of observation that the uninterrupted enjoyment which distinguished his life was in great part the result of preconcert. it is, indeed evident, that with less of the instinctive philosophy which, now and then, stands so well in the stead of experience, mr. ellison would have found himself precipitated, by the very extraordinary successes of his life, into the common vortex of unhappiness which yawns for those of preeminent endowments. but it is by no means my present object to pen an essay on happiness. the ideas of my friend may be summed up in a few words. he admitted but four unvarying laws, or rather elementary principles, of bliss. that which he considered chief, was (strange to say!) the simple and purely physical one of free exercise in the open air. “the health,” he said, “attainable by other means than this is scarcely worth the name.” he pointed to the tillers of the earth--the only people who, as a class, are proverbially more happy than others--and then he instanced the high ecstasies of the fox-hunter. his second principle was the love of woman. his third was the contempt of ambition. his fourth was an object of unceasing pursuit; and he held that, other things being equal, the extent of happiness was proportioned to the spirituality of this object. i have said that ellison was remarkable in the continuous profusion of good gifts lavished upon him by fortune. in personal grace and beauty he exceeded all men. his intellect was of that order to which the attainment of knowledge is less a labor than a necessity and an intuition. his family was one of the most illustrious of the empire. his bride was the loveliest and most devoted of women. his possessions had been always ample; but, upon the attainment of his one and twentieth year, it was discovered that one of those extraordinary freaks of fate had been played in his behalf which startle the whole social world amid which they occur, and seldom fail radically to alter the entire moral constitution of those who are their objects. it appears that about one hundred years prior to mr. ellison’s attainment of his majority, there had died, in a remote province, one mr. seabright ellison. this gentlemen had amassed a princely fortune, and, having no very immediate connexions, conceived the whim of suffering his wealth to accumulate for a century after his decease. minutely and sagaciously directing the various modes of investment, he bequeathed the aggregate amount to the nearest of blood, bearing the name ellison, who should be alive at the end of the hundred years. many futile attempts had been made to set aside this singular bequest; their ex post facto character rendered them abortive; but the attention of a jealous government was aroused, and a decree finally obtained, forbidding all similar accumulations. this act did not prevent young ellison, upon his twenty-first birth-day, from entering into possession, as the heir of his ancestor, seabright, of a fortune of four hundred and fifty millions of dollars. <UNK> when it had become definitely known that such was the enormous wealth inherited, there were, of course, many speculations as to the mode of its disposal. the gigantic magnitude and the immediately available nature of the sum, dazzled and bewildered all who thought upon the topic. the possessor of any appreciable amount of money might have been imagined to perform any one of a thousand things. with riches merely surpassing those of any citizen, it would have been easy to suppose him engaging to supreme excess in the fashionable extravagances of his time; or busying himself with political intrigues; or aiming at ministerial power, or purchasing increase of nobility, or devising gorgeous architectural piles; or collecting large specimens of virtu; or playing the munificent patron of letters and art; or endowing and bestowing his name upon extensive institutions of charity. but, for the inconceivable wealth in the actual possession of the young heir, these objects and all ordinary objects were felt to be inadequate. recourse was had to figures; and figures but sufficed to confound. it was seen, that even at three per cent, the annual income of the inheritance amounted to no less than thirteen millions and five hundred thousand dollars; which was one million and one hundred and twenty-five thousand per month; or thirty-six thousand, nine hundred and eighty-six per day, or one thousand five hundred and forty-one per hour, or six and twenty dollars for every minute that flew. thus the usual track of supposition was thoroughly broken up. men knew not what to imagine. there were some who even conceived that mr. ellison would divest himself forthwith of at least two-thirds of his fortune as of utterly superfluous opulence; enriching whole troops of his relatives by division of his superabundance. i was not surprised, however, to perceive that he had long made up his mind upon a topic which had occasioned so much of discussion to his friends. nor was i greatly astonished at the nature of his decision. in the widest and noblest sense, he was a poet. he comprehended, moreover, the true character, the august aims, the supreme majesty and dignity of the poetic sentiment. the proper gratification of the sentiment he instinctively felt to lie in the creation of novel forms of beauty. some peculiarities, either in his early education, or in the nature of his intellect, had tinged with what is termed materialism the whole cast of his ethical speculations; and it was this bias, perhaps, which imperceptibly led him to perceive that the most advantageous, if not the sole legitimate field for the exercise of the poetic sentiment, was to be found in the creation of novel moods of purely physical loveliness. thus it happened that he became neither musician nor poet; if we use this latter term in its every--day acceptation. or it might have been that he became neither the one nor the other, in pursuance of an idea of his which i have already mentioned--the idea, that in the contempt of ambition lay one of the essential principles of happiness on earth. is it not, indeed, possible that while a high order of genius is necessarily ambitious, the highest is invariably above that which is termed ambition? and may it not thus happen that many far greater than milton, have contentedly remained “mute and inglorious?” i believe the world has never yet seen, and that, unless through some series of accidents goading the noblest order of mind into distasteful exertion, the world will never behold, that full extent of triumphant execution, in the richer productions of art, of which the human nature is absolutely capable. mr. ellison became neither musician nor poet; although no man lived more profoundly enamored both of music and the muse. under other circumstances than those which invested him, it is not impossible that he would have become a painter. the field of sculpture, although in its nature rigidly poetical, was too limited in its extent and in its consequences, to have occupied, at any time, much of his attention. and i have now mentioned all the provinces in which even the most liberal understanding of the poetic sentiment has declared this sentiment capable of expatiating. i mean the most liberal public or recognized conception of the idea involved in the phrase “poetic sentiment.” but mr. ellison imagined that the richest, and altogether the most natural and most suitable province, had been blindly neglected. no definition had spoken of the landscape-gardener, as of the poet; yet my friend could not fail to perceive that the creation of the landscape-garden offered to the true muse the most magnificent of opportunities. here was, indeed, the fairest field for the display of invention, or imagination, in the endless combining of forms of novel beauty; the elements which should enter into combination being, at all times, and by a vast superiority, the most glorious which the earth could afford. in the multiform of the tree, and in the multicolor of the flower, he recognized the most direct and the most energetic efforts of nature at physical loveliness. and in the direction or concentration of this effort, or, still more properly, in its adaption to the eyes which were to behold it upon earth, he perceived that he should be employing the best means--laboring to the greatest advantage--in the fulfilment of his destiny as poet. “its adaptation to the eyes which were to behold it upon earth.” in his explanation of this phraseology, mr. ellison did much towards solving what has always seemed to me an enigma. i mean the fact (which none but the ignorant dispute,) that no such combinations of scenery exist in nature as the painter of genius has in his power to produce. no such paradises are to be found in reality as have glowed upon the canvass of claude. in the most enchanting of natural landscapes, there will always be found a defect or an excess--many excesses and defects. while the component parts may exceed, individually, the highest skill of the artist, the arrangement of the parts will always be susceptible of improvement. in short, no position can be attained, from which an artistical eye, looking steadily, will not find matter of offence, in what is technically termed the composition of a natural landscape. and yet how unintelligible is this! in all other matters we are justly instructed to regard nature as supreme. with her details we shrink from competition. who shall presume to imitate the colors of the tulip, or to improve the proportions of the lily of the valley? the criticism which says, of sculpture or of portraiture, that “nature is to be exalted rather than imitated,” is in error. no pictorial or sculptural combinations of points of human loveliness, do more than approach the living and breathing human beauty as it gladdens our daily path. byron, who often erred, erred not in saying, i’ve seen more living beauty, ripe and real, than all the nonsense of their stone ideal. in landscape alone is the principle of the critic true; and, having felt its truth here, it is but the headlong spirit of generalization which has induced him to pronounce it true throughout all the domains of art. having, i say, felt its truth here. for the feeling is no affectation or chimera. the mathematics afford no more absolute demonstrations, than the sentiment of his art yields to the artist. he not only believes, but positively knows, that such and such apparently arbitrary arrangements of matter, or form, constitute, and alone constitute, the true beauty. yet his reasons have not yet been matured into expression. it remains for a more profound analysis than the world has yet seen, fully to investigate and express them. nevertheless is he confirmed in his instinctive opinions, by the concurrence of all his compeers. let a composition be defective, let an emendation be wrought in its mere arrangement of form; let this emendation be submitted to every artist in the world; by each will its necessity be admitted. and even far more than this, in remedy of the defective composition, each insulated member of the fraternity will suggest the identical emendation. i repeat that in landscape arrangements, or collocations alone, is the physical nature susceptible of “exaltation” and that, therefore, her susceptibility of improvement at this one point, was a mystery which, hitherto i had been unable to solve. it was mr. ellison who first suggested the idea that what we regarded as improvement or exaltation of the natural beauty, was really such, as respected only the mortal or human point of view; that each alteration or disturbance of the primitive scenery might possibly effect a blemish in the picture, if we could suppose this picture viewed at large from some remote point in the heavens. “it is easily understood,” says mr. ellison, “that what might improve a closely scrutinized detail, might, at the same time, injure a general and more distantly--observed effect.” he spoke upon this topic with warmth: regarding not so much its immediate or obvious importance, (which is little,) as the character of the conclusions to which it might lead, or of the collateral propositions which it might serve to corroborate or sustain. there might be a class of beings, human once, but now to humanity invisible, for whose scrutiny and for whose refined appreciation of the beautiful, more especially than for our own, had been set in order by god the great landscape-garden of the whole earth. in the course of our discussion, my young friend took occasion to quote some passages from a writer who has been supposed to have well treated this theme. “there are, properly,” he writes, “but two styles of landscape-gardening, the natural and the artificial. one seeks to recall the original beauty of the country, by adapting its means to the surrounding scenery; cultivating trees in harmony with the hills or plain of the neighboring land; detecting and bringing into practice those nice relations of size, proportion and color which, hid from the common observer, are revealed everywhere to the experienced student of nature. the result of the natural style of gardening, is seen rather in the absence of all defects and incongruities--in the prevalence of a beautiful harmony and order, than in the creation of any special wonders or miracles. the artificial style has as many varieties as there are different tastes to gratify. it has a certain general relation to the various styles of building. there are the stately avenues and retirements of versailles; italian terraces; and a various mixed old english style, which bears some relation to the domestic gothic or english elizabethan architecture. whatever may be said against the abuses of the artificial landscape-gardening, a mixture of pure art in a garden scene, adds to it a great beauty. this is partly pleasing to the eye, by the show of order and design, and partly moral. a terrace, with an old moss-covered balustrade, calls up at once to the eye, the fair forms that have passed there in other days. the slightest exhibition of art is an evidence of care and human interest.” “from what i have already observed,” said mr. ellison, “you will understand that i reject the idea, here expressed, of ‘recalling the original beauty of the country.’ the original beauty is never so great as that which may be introduced. of course, much depends upon the selection of a spot with capabilities. what is said in respect to the ‘detecting and bringing into practice those nice relations of size, proportion and color,’ is a mere vagueness of speech, which may mean much, or little, or nothing, and which guides in no degree. that the true ‘result of the natural style of gardening is seen rather in the absence of all defects and incongruities, than in the creation of any special wonders or miracles,’ is a proposition better suited to the grovelling apprehension of the herd, than to the fervid dreams of the man of genius. the merit suggested is, at best, negative, and appertains to that hobbling criticism which, in letters, would elevate addison into apotheosis. in truth, while that merit which consists in the mere avoiding demerit, appeals directly to the understanding, and can thus be foreshadowed in rule, the loftier merit, which breathes and flames in invention or creation, can be apprehended solely in its results. rule applies but to the excellences of avoidance--to the virtues which deny or refrain. beyond these the critical art can but suggest. we may be instructed to build an odyssey, but it is in vain that we are told how to conceive a ‘tempest,’ an ‘inferno,’ a ‘prometheus bound,’ a ‘nightingale,’ such as that of keats, or the ‘sensitive plant’ of shelley. but, the thing done, the wonder accomplished, and the capacity for apprehension becomes universal. the sophists of the negative school, who, through inability to create, have scoffed at creation, are now found the loudest in applause. what, in its chrysalis condition of principle, affronted their demure reason, never fails, in its maturity of accomplishment, to extort admiration from their instinct of the beautiful or of the sublime. “our author’s observations on the artificial style of gardening,” continued mr. ellison, “are less objectionable. ‘a mixture of pure art in a garden scene, adds to it a great beauty.’ this is just; and the reference to the sense of human interest is equally so. i repeat that the principle here expressed, is incontrovertible; but there may be something even beyond it. there may be an object in full keeping with the principle suggested--an object unattainable by the means ordinarily in possession of mankind, yet which, if attained, would lend a charm to the landscape-garden immeasurably surpassing that which a merely human interest could bestow. the true poet possessed of very unusual pecuniary resources, might possibly, while retaining the necessary idea of art or interest or culture, so imbue his designs at once with extent and novelty of beauty, as to convey the sentiment of spiritual interference. it will be seen that, in bringing about such result, he secures all the advantages of interest or design, while relieving his work of all the harshness and technicality of art. in the most rugged of wildernesses--in the most savage of the scenes of pure nature--there is apparent the art of a creator; yet is this art apparent only to reflection; in no respect has it the obvious force of a feeling. now, if we imagine this sense of the almighty design to be harmonized in a measurable degree, if we suppose a landscape whose combined strangeness, vastness, definitiveness, and magnificence, shall inspire the idea of culture, or care, or superintendence, on the part of intelligences superior yet akin to humanity--then the sentiment of interest is preserved, while the art is made to assume the air of an intermediate or secondary nature--a nature which is not god, nor an emanation of god, but which still is nature, in the sense that it is the handiwork of the angels that hover between man and god.” it was in devoting his gigantic wealth to the practical embodiment of a vision such as this--in the free exercise in the open air, which resulted from personal direction of his plans--in the continuous and unceasing object which these plans afford--in the contempt of ambition which it enabled him more to feel than to affect--and, lastly, it was in the companionship and sympathy of a devoted wife, that ellison thought to find, and found, an exemption from the ordinary cares of humanity, with a far greater amount of positive happiness than ever glowed in the rapt day-dreams of de stael. maelzel’s chess-player perhaps no exhibition of the kind has ever elicited so general attention as the chess-player of maelzel. wherever seen it has been an object of intense curiosity, to all persons who think. yet the question of its _modus operandi is _still undetermined. nothing has been written on this topic which can be considered as decisive--and accordingly we find every where men of mechanical genius, of great general acuteness, and discriminative understanding, who make no scruple in pronouncing the automaton a _pure machine, _unconnected with human agency in its movements, and consequently, beyond all comparison, the most astonishing of the inventions of mankind. and such it would undoubtedly be, were they right in their supposition. assuming this hypothesis, it would be grossly absurd to compare with the chess-player, any similar thing of either modern or ancient days. yet there have been many and wonderful automata. in brewster’s letters on natural magic, we have an account of the most remarkable. among these may be mentioned, as having beyond doubt existed, firstly, the coach invented by m. camus for the amusement of louis xiv when a child. a table, about four feet square, was introduced, into the room appropriated for the exhibition. upon this table was placed a carriage, six inches in length, made of wood, and drawn by two horses of the same material. one window being down, a lady was seen on the back seat. a coachman held the reins on the box, and a footman and page were in their places behind. m. camus now touched a spring; whereupon the coachman smacked his whip, and the horses proceeded in a natural manner, along the edge of the table, drawing after them the carriage. having gone as far as possible in this direction, a sudden turn was made to the left, and the vehicle was driven at right angles to its former course, and still closely along the edge of the table. in this way the coach proceeded until it arrived opposite the chair of the young prince. it then stopped, the page descended and opened the door, the lady alighted, and presented a petition to her sovereign. she then re-entered. the page put up the steps, closed the door, and resumed his station. the coachman whipped his horses, and the carriage was driven back to its original position. the magician of m. maillardet is also worthy of notice. we copy the following account of it from the _letters _before mentioned of dr. b., who derived his information principally from the edinburgh encyclopaedia. “one of the most popular pieces of mechanism which we have seen, is the magician constructed by m. maillardet, for the purpose of answering certain given questions. a figure, dressed like a magician, appears seated at the bottom of a wall, holding a wand in one hand, and a book in the other a number of questions, ready prepared, are inscribed on oval medallions, and the spectator takes any of these he chooses and to which he wishes an answer, and having placed it in a drawer ready to receive it, the drawer shuts with a spring till the answer is returned. the magician then arises from his seat, bows his head, describes circles with his wand, and consulting the book as if in deep thought, he lifts it towards his face. having thus appeared to ponder over the proposed question he raises his wand, and striking with it the wall above his head, two folding doors fly open, and display an appropriate answer to the question. the doors again close, the magician resumes his original position, and the drawer opens to return the medallion. there are twenty of these medallions, all containing different questions, to which the magician returns the most suitable and striking answers. the medallions are thin plates of brass, of an elliptical form, exactly resembling each other. some of the medallions have a question inscribed on each side, both of which the magician answered in succession. if the drawer is shut without a medallion being put into it, the magician rises, consults his book, shakes his head, and resumes his seat. the folding doors remain shut, and the drawer is returned empty. if two medallions are put into the drawer together, an answer is returned only to the lower one. when the machinery is wound up, the movements continue about an hour, during which time about fifty questions may be answered. the inventor stated that the means by which the different medallions acted upon the machinery, so as to produce the proper answers to the questions which they contained, were extremely simple.” the duck of vaucanson was still more remarkable. it was _of _the size of life, and so perfect an imitation of the living animal that all the spectators were deceived. it executed, says brewster, all the natural movements and gestures, it ate and drank with avidity, performed all the quick motions of the head and throat which are peculiar to the duck, and like it muddled the water which it drank with its bill. it produced also the sound of quacking in the most natural manner. in the anatomical structure the artist exhibited the highest skill. every bone in the real duck had its representative in the automaton, and its wings were anatomically exact. every cavity, apophysis, and curvature was imitated, and each bone executed its proper movements. when corn was thrown down before it, the duck stretched out its neck to pick it up, swallowed, and digested it. <UNK> but if these machines were ingenious, what shall we think of the calculating machine of mr. babbage? what shall we think of an engine of wood and metal which can not only compute astronomical and navigation tables to any given extent, but render the exactitude of its operations mathematically certain through its power of correcting its possible errors? what shall we think of a machine which can not only accomplish all this, but actually print off its elaborate results, when obtained, without the slightest intervention of the intellect of man? it will, perhaps, be said, in reply, that a machine such as we have described is altogether above comparison with the chess-player of maelzel. by no means--it is altogether beneath it--that is to say provided we assume (what should never for a moment be assumed) that the chess-player is a _pure machine, _and performs its operations without any immediate human agency. arithmetical or algebraical calculations are, from their very nature, fixed and determinate. certain _data _being given, certain results necessarily and inevitably follow. these results have dependence upon nothing, and are influenced by nothing but the _data _originally given. and the question to be solved proceeds, or should proceed, to its final determination, by a succession of unerring steps liable to no change, and subject to no modification. this being the case, we can without difficulty conceive the _possibility _of so arranging a piece of mechanism, that upon starting in accordance with the _data _of the question to be solved, it should continue its movements regularly, progressively, and undeviatingly towards the required solution, since these movements, however complex, are never imagined to be otherwise than finite and determinate. but the case is widely different with the chess-player. with him there is no determinate progression. no one move in chess necessarily follows upon any one other. from no particular disposition of the men at one period of a game can we predicate their disposition at a different period. let us place the _first move _in a game of chess, in juxta-position with the _data _of an algebraical question, and their great difference will be immediately perceived. from the latter--from the _data--_the second step of the question, dependent thereupon, inevitably follows. it is modelled by the _data. _it must be _thus _and not otherwise. but from the first move in the game of chess no especial second move follows of necessity. in the algebraical question, as it proceeds towards solution, the _certainty _of its operations remains altogether unimpaired. the second step having been a consequence of the _data, _the third step is equally a consequence of the second, the fourth of the third, the fifth of the fourth, and so on, _and not possibly otherwise, _to the end. but in proportion to the progress made in a game of chess, is the _uncertainty _of each ensuing move. a few moves having been made, _no _step is certain. different spectators of the game would advise different moves. all is then dependent upon the variable judgment of the players. now even granting (what should not be granted) that the movements of the automaton chess-player were in themselves determinate, they would be necessarily interrupted and disarranged by the indeterminate will of his antagonist. there is then no analogy whatever between the operations of the chess-player, and those of the calculating machine of mr. babbage, and if we choose to call the former a _pure machine _we must be prepared to admit that it is, beyond all comparison, the most wonderful of the inventions of mankind. its original projector, however, baron kempelen, had no scruple in declaring it to be a “very ordinary piece of mechanism--a _bagatelle _whose effects appeared so marvellous only from the boldness of the conception, and the fortunate choice of the methods adopted for promoting the illusion.” but it is needless to dwell upon this point. it is quite certain that the operations of the automaton are regulated by _mind, _and by nothing else. indeed this matter is susceptible of a mathematical demonstration, _a priori. _the only question then is of the _manner _in which human agency is brought to bear. before entering upon this subject it would be as well to give a brief history and description of the chess-player for the benefit of such of our readers as may never have had an opportunity of witnessing mr. maelzel’s exhibition. the automaton chess-player was invented in <UNK> by baron kempelen, a nobleman of presburg, in hungary, who afterwards disposed of it, together with the secret of its operations, to its present possessor. <UNK> soon after its completion it was exhibited in presburg, paris, vienna, and other continental cities. in <UNK> and <UNK> it was taken to london by mr. maelzel. of late years it has visited the principal towns in the united states. wherever seen, the most intense curiosity was excited by its appearance, and numerous have been the attempts, by men of all classes, to fathom the mystery of its evolutions. the cut on this page gives a tolerable representation of the figure as seen by the citizens of richmond a few weeks ago. the right arm, however, should lie more at length upon the box, a chess-board should appear upon it, and the cushion should not be seen while the pipe is held. some immaterial alterations have been made in the costume of the player since it came into the possession of maelzel--the plume, for example, was not originally worn. {image of automaton} at the hour appointed for exhibition, a curtain is withdrawn, or folding doors are thrown open, and the machine rolled to within about twelve feet of the nearest of the spectators, between whom and it (the machine) a rope is stretched. a figure is seen habited as a turk, and seated, with its legs crossed, at a large box apparently of maple wood, which serves it as a table. the exhibiter will, if requested, roll the machine to any portion of the room, suffer it to remain altogether on any designated spot, or even shift its location repeatedly during the progress of a game. the bottom of the box is elevated considerably above the floor by means of the castors or brazen rollers on which it moves, a clear view of the surface immediately beneath the automaton being thus afforded to the spectators. the chair on which the figure sits is affixed permanently to the box. on the top of this latter is a chess-board, also permanently affixed. the right arm of the chess-player is extended at full length before him, at right angles with his body, and lying, in an apparently careless position, by the side of the board. the back of the hand is upwards. the board itself is eighteen inches square. the left arm of the figure is bent at the elbow, and in the left hand is a pipe. a green drapery conceals the back of the turk, and falls partially over the front of both shoulders. to judge from the external appearance of the box, it is divided into five compartments--three cupboards of equal dimensions, and two drawers occupying that portion of the chest lying beneath the cupboards. the foregoing observations apply to the appearance of the automaton upon its first introduction into the presence of the spectators. maelzel now informs the company that he will disclose to their view the mechanism of the machine. taking from his pocket a bunch of keys he unlocks with one of them, door marked ~ in the cut above, and throws the cupboard fully open to the inspection of all present. its whole interior is apparently filled with wheels, pinions, levers, and other machinery, crowded very closely together, so that the eye can penetrate but a little distance into the mass. leaving this door open to its full extent, he goes now round to the back of the box, and raising the drapery of the figure, opens another door situated precisely in the rear of the one first opened. holding a lighted candle at this door, and shifting the position of the whole machine repeatedly at the same time, a bright light is thrown entirely through the cupboard, which is now clearly seen to be full, completely full, of machinery. the spectators being satisfied of this fact, maelzel closes the back door, locks it, takes the key from the lock, lets fall the drapery of the figure, and comes round to the front. the door marked i, it will be remembered, is still open. the exhibiter now proceeds to open the drawer which lies beneath the cupboards at the bottom of the box--for although there are apparently two drawers, there is really only one--the two handles and two key holes being intended merely for ornament. having opened this drawer to its full extent, a small cushion, and a set of chessmen, fixed in a frame work made to support them perpendicularly, are discovered. leaving this drawer, as well as cupboard no. <UNK> open, maelzel now unlocks door no. <UNK> and door no. <UNK> which are discovered to be folding doors, opening into one and the same compartment. to the right of this compartment, however, (that is to say the spectators’ right) a small division, six inches wide, and filled with machinery, is partitioned off. the main compartment itself (in speaking of that portion of the box visible upon opening doors <UNK> and <UNK> we shall always call it the main compartment) is lined with dark cloth and contains no machinery whatever beyond two pieces of steel, quadrant-shaped, and situated one in each of the rear top corners of the compartment. a small protuberance about eight inches square, and also covered with dark cloth, lies on the floor of the compartment near the rear corner on the spectators’ left hand. leaving doors no. <UNK> and no. <UNK> open as well as the drawer, and door no. i, the exhibiter now goes round to the back of the main compartment, and, unlocking another door there, displays clearly all the interior of the main compartment, by introducing a candle behind it and within it. the whole box being thus apparently disclosed to the scrutiny of the company, maelzel, still leaving the doors and drawer open, rolls the automaton entirely round, and exposes the back of the turk by lifting up the drapery. a door about ten inches square is thrown open in the loins of the figure, and a smaller one also in the left thigh. the interior of the figure, as seen through these apertures, appears to be crowded with machinery. in general, every spectator is now thoroughly satisfied of having beheld and completely scrutinized, at one and the same time, every individual portion of the automaton, and the idea of any person being concealed in the interior, during so complete an exhibition of that interior, if ever entertained, is immediately dismissed as preposterous in the extreme. m. maelzel, having rolled the machine back into its original position, now informs the company that the automaton will play a game of chess with any one disposed to encounter him. this challenge being accepted, a small table is prepared for the antagonist, and placed close by the rope, but on the spectators’ side of it, and so situated as not to prevent the company from obtaining a full view of the automaton. from a drawer in this table is taken a set of chess-men, and maelzel arranges them generally, but not always, with his own hands, on the chess board, which consists merely of the usual number of squares painted upon the table. the antagonist having taken his seat, the exhibiter approaches the drawer of the box, and takes therefrom the cushion, which, after removing the pipe from the hand of the automaton, he places under its left arm as a support. then taking also from the drawer the automaton’s set of chess-men, he arranges them upon the chessboard before the figure. he now proceeds to close the doors and to lock them--leaving the bunch of keys in door no. <UNK> he also closes the drawer, and, finally, winds up the machine, by applying a key to an aperture in the left end (the spectators’ left) of the box. the game now commences--the automaton taking the first move. the duration of the contest is usually limited to half an hour, but if it be not finished at the expiration of this period, and the antagonist still contend that he can beat the automaton, m. maelzel has seldom any objection to continue it. not to weary the company, is the ostensible, and no doubt the real object of the limitation. it wits of course be understood that when a move is made at his own table, by the antagonist, the corresponding move is made at the box of the automaton, by maelzel himself, who then acts as the representative of the antagonist. on the other hand, when the turk moves, the corresponding move is made at the table of the antagonist, also by m. maelzel, who then acts as the representative of the automaton. in this manner it is necessary that the exhibiter should often pass from one table to the other. he also frequently goes in rear of the figure to remove the chess-men which it has taken, and which it deposits, when taken, on the box to the left (to its own left) of the board. when the automaton hesitates in relation to its move, the exhibiter is occasionally seen to place himself very near its right side, and to lay his hand, now and then, in a careless manner upon the box. he has also a peculiar shuffle with his feet, calculated to induce suspicion of collusion with the machine in minds which are more cunning than sagacious. these peculiarities are, no doubt, mere mannerisms of m. maelzel, or, if he is aware of them at all, he puts them in practice with a view of exciting in the spectators a false idea of the pure mechanism in the automaton. the turk plays with his left hand. all the movements of the arm are at right angles. in this manner, the hand (which is gloved and bent in a natural way,) being brought directly above the piece to be moved, descends finally upon it, the fingers receiving it, in most cases, without difficulty. occasionally, however, when the piece is not precisely in its proper situation, the automaton fails in his attempt at seizing it. when this occurs, no second effort is made, but the arm continues its movement in the direction originally intended, precisely as if the piece were in the fingers. having thus designated the spot whither the move should have been made, the arm returns to its cushion, and maelzel performs the evolution which the automaton pointed out. at every movement of the figure machinery is heard in motion. during the progress of the game, the figure now and then rolls its eyes, as if surveying the board, moves its head, and pronounces the word _echec _(check) when necessary. <UNK> if a false move be made by his antagonist, he raps briskly on the box with the fingers of his right hand, shakes his head roughly, and replacing the piece falsely moved, in its former situation, assumes the next move himself. upon beating the game, he waves his head with an air of triumph, looks round complacently upon the spectators, and drawing his left arm farther back than usual, suffers his fingers alone to rest upon the cushion. in general, the turk is victorious--once or twice he has been beaten. the game being ended, maelzel will again if desired, exhibit the mechanism of the box, in the same manner as before. the machine is then rolled back, and a curtain hides it from the view of the company. there have been many attempts at solving the mystery of the automaton. the most general opinion in relation to it, an opinion too not unfrequently adopted by men who should have known better, was, as we have before said, that no immediate human agency was employed--in other words, that the machine was purely a machine and nothing else. many, however maintained that the exhibiter himself regulated the movements of the figure by mechanical means operating through the feet of the box. others again, spoke confidently of a magnet. of the first of these opinions we shall say nothing at present more than we have already said. in relation to the second it is only necessary to repeat what we have before stated, that the machine is rolled about on castors, and will, at the request of a spectator, be moved to and fro to any portion of the room, even during the progress of a game. the supposition of the magnet is also untenable--for if a magnet were the agent, any other magnet in the pocket of a spectator would disarrange the entire mechanism. the exhibiter, however, will suffer the most powerful loadstone to remain even upon the box during the whole of the exhibition. the first attempt at a written explanation of the secret, at least the first attempt of which we ourselves have any knowledge, was made in a large pamphlet printed at paris in <UNK> the author’s hypothesis amounted to this--that a dwarf actuated the machine. this dwarf he supposed to conceal himself during the opening of the box by thrusting his legs into two hollow cylinders, which were represented to be (but which are not) among the machinery in the cupboard no. i, while his body was out of the box entirely, and covered by the drapery of the turk. when the doors were shut, the dwarf was enabled to bring his body within the box--the noise produced by some portion of the machinery allowing him to do so unheard, and also to close the door by which he entered. the interior of the automaton being then exhibited, and no person discovered, the spectators, says the author of this pamphlet, are satisfied that no one is within any portion of the machine. this whole hypothesis was too obviously absurd to require comment, or refutation, and accordingly we find that it attracted very little attention. in <UNK> a book was published at dresden by m. i. f. freyhere in which another endeavor was made to unravel the mystery. mr. freyhere’s book was a pretty large one, and copiously illustrated by colored engravings. his supposition was that “a well-taught boy very thin and tall of his age (sufficiently so that he could be concealed in a drawer almost immediately under the chess-board”) played the game of chess and effected all the evolutions of the automaton. this idea, although even more silly than that of the parisian author, met with a better reception, and was in some measure believed to be the true solution of the wonder, until the inventor put an end to the discussion by suffering a close examination of the top of the box. these bizarre attempts at explanation were followed by others equally bizarre. of late years however, an anonymous writer, by a course of reasoning exceedingly unphilosophical, has contrived to blunder upon a plausible solution--although we cannot consider it altogether the true one. his essay was first published in a baltimore weekly paper, was illustrated by cuts, and was entitled “an attempt to analyze the automaton chess-player of m. maelzel.” this essay we suppose to have been the original of the _pamphlet to _which sir david brewster alludes in his letters on natural magic, and which he has no hesitation in declaring a thorough and satisfactory explanation. the _results _of the analysis are undoubtedly, in the main, just; but we can only account for brewster’s pronouncing the essay a thorough and satisfactory explanation, by supposing him to have bestowed upon it a very cursory and inattentive perusal. in the compendium of the essay, made use of in the letters on natural magic, it is quite impossible to arrive at any distinct conclusion in regard to the adequacy or inadequacy of the analysis, on account of the gross misarrangement and deficiency of the letters of reference employed. the same fault is to be found in the “attempt &c.,” as we originally saw it. the solution consists in a series of minute explanations, (accompanied by wood-cuts, the whole occupying many pages) in which the object is to show the _possibility _of _so shifting the partitions _of the box, as to allow a human being, concealed in the interior, to move portions of his body from one part of the box to another, during the exhibition of the mechanism--thus eluding the scrutiny of the spectators. there can be no doubt, as we have before observed, and as we will presently endeavor to show, that the principle, or rather the result, of this solution is the true one. some person is concealed in the box during the whole time of exhibiting the interior. we object, however, to the whole verbose description of the _manner _in which the partitions are shifted, to accommodate the movements of the person concealed. we object to it as a mere theory assumed in the first place, and to which circumstances are afterwards made to adapt themselves. it was not, and could not have been, arrived at by any inductive reasoning. in whatever way the shifting is managed, it is of course concealed at every step from observation. to show that certain movements might possibly be effected in a certain way, is very far from showing that they are actually so effected. there may be an infinity of other methods by which the same results may be obtained. the probability of the one assumed proving the correct one is then as unity to infinity. but, in reality, this particular point, the shifting of the partitions, is of no consequence whatever. it was altogether unnecessary to devote seven or eight pages for the purpose of proving what no one in his senses would deny--viz: that the wonderful mechanical genius of baron kempelen could invent the necessary means for shutting a door or slipping aside a pannel, with a human agent too at his service in actual contact with the pannel or the door, and the whole operations carried on, as the author of the essay himself shows, and as we shall attempt to show more fully hereafter, entirely out of reach of the observation of the spectators. in attempting ourselves an explanation of the automaton, we will, in the first place, endeavor to show how its operations are effected, and afterwards describe, as briefly as possible, the nature of the _observations _from which we have deduced our result. it will be necessary for a proper understanding of the subject, that we repeat here in a few words, the routine adopted by the exhibiter in disclosing the interior of the box--a routine from which he _never _deviates in any material particular. in the first place he opens the door no. i. leaving this open, he goes round to the rear of the box, and opens a door precisely at the back of door no. i. to this back door he holds a lighted candle. he then _closes the back door, _locks it, and, coming round to the front, opens the drawer to its full extent. this done, he opens the doors no. <UNK> and no. <UNK> (the folding doors) and displays the interior of the main compartment. leaving open the main compartment, the drawer, and the front door of cupboard no. i, he now goes to the rear again, and throws open the back door of the main compartment. in shutting up the box no particular order is observed, except that the folding doors are always closed before the drawer. now, let us suppose that when the machine is first rolled into the presence of the spectators, a man is already within it. his body is situated behind the dense machinery in cupboard no. t. (the rear portion of which machinery is so contrived as to slip _en masse, _from the main compartment to the cupboard no. i, as occasion may require,) and his legs lie at full length in the main compartment. when maelzel opens the door no. i, the man within is not in any danger of discovery, for the keenest eye cannot penetrate more than about two inches into the darkness within. but the case is otherwise when the back door of the cupboard no. i, is opened. a bright light then pervades the cupboard, and the body of the man would be discovered if it were there. but it is not. the putting the key in the lock of the back door was a signal on hearing which the person concealed brought his body forward to an angle as acute as possible--throwing it altogether, or nearly so, into the main compartment. this, however, is a painful position, and cannot be long maintained. accordingly we find that maelzel _closes the back door. _this being done, there is no reason why the body of the man may not resume its former situation--for the cupboard is again so dark as to defy scrutiny. the drawer is now opened, and the legs of the person within drop down behind it in the space it formerly occupied. <UNK> there is, consequently, now no longer any part of the man in the main compartment--his body being behind the machinery in cupboard no. <UNK> and his legs in the space occupied by the drawer. the exhibiter, therefore, finds himself at liberty to display the main compartment. this he does--opening both its back and front doors--and no person is discovered. the spectators are now satisfied that the whole of the box is exposed to view--and exposed too, all portions of it at one and the same time. but of course this is not the case. they neither see the space behind the drawer, nor the interior of cupboard no. <UNK> front door of which latter the exhibiter virtually shuts in shutting its back door. maelzel, having now rolled the machine around, lifted up the drapery of the turk, opened the doors in his back and thigh, and shown his trunk to be full of machinery, brings the whole back into its original position, and closes the doors. the man within is now at liberty to move about. he gets up into the body of the turk just so high as to bring his eyes above the level of the chess-board. it is very probable that he seats himself upon the little square block or protuberance which is seen in a corner of the main compartment when the doors are open. in this position he sees the chess-board through the bosom of the turk which is of gauze. bringing his right arm across his breast he actuates the little machinery necessary to guide the left arm and the fingers of the figure. this machinery is situated just beneath the left shoulder of the turk, and is consequently easily reached by the right hand of the man concealed, if we suppose his right arm brought across the breast. the motions of the head and eyes, and of the right arm of the figure, as well as the sound _echec _are produced by other mechanism in the interior, and actuated at will by the man within. the whole of this mechanism--that is to say all the mechanism essential to the machine--is most probably contained within the little cupboard (of about six inches in breadth) partitioned off at the right (the spectators’ right) of the main compartment. in this analysis of the operations of the automaton, we have purposely avoided any allusion to the manner in which the partitions are shifted, and it will now be readily comprehended that this point is a matter of no importance, since, by mechanism within the ability of any common carpenter, it might be effected in an infinity of different ways, and since we have shown that, however performed, it is performed out of the view of the spectators. our result is founded upon the following _observations _taken during frequent visits to the exhibition of maelzel. <UNK> i. the moves of the turk are not made at regular intervals of time, but accommodate themselves to the moves of the antagonist--although this point (of regularity) so important in all kinds of mechanical contrivance, might have been readily brought about by limiting the time allowed for the moves of the antagonist. for example, if this limit were three minutes, the moves of the automaton might be made at any given intervals longer than three minutes. the fact then of irregularity, when regularity might have been so easily attained, goes to prove that regularity is unimportant to the action of the automaton--in other words, that the automaton is not a _pure machine._ <UNK> when the automaton is about to move a piece, a distinct motion is observable just beneath the left shoulder, and which motion agitates in a slight degree, the drapery covering the front of the left shoulder. this motion invariably precedes, by about two seconds, the movement of the arm itself--and the arm never, in any instance, moves without this preparatory motion in the shoulder. now let the antagonist move a piece, and let the corresponding move be made by maelzel, as usual, upon the board of the automaton. then let the antagonist narrowly watch the automaton, until he detect the preparatory motion in the shoulder. immediately upon detecting this motion, and before the arm itself begins to move, let him withdraw his piece, as if perceiving an error in his manoeuvre. it will then be seen that the movement of the arm, which, in all other cases, immediately succeeds the motion in the shoulder, is withheld--is not made--although maelzel has not yet performed, on the board of the automaton, any move corresponding to the withdrawal of the antagonist. in this case, that the automaton was about to move is evident--and that he did not move, was an effect plainly produced by the withdrawal of the antagonist, and without any intervention of maelzel. this fact fully proves, <UNK> the intervention of maelzel, in performing the moves of the antagonist on the board of the automaton, is not essential to the movements of the automaton, <UNK> its movements are regulated by _mind--_by some person who sees the board of the antagonist, <UNK> its movements are not regulated by the mind of maelzel, whose back was turned towards the antagonist at the withdrawal of his move. <UNK> the automaton does not invariably win the game. were the machine a pure machine this would not be the case--it would always win. the _principle _being discovered by which a machine can be made to _play _a game of chess, an extension of the same principle would enable it to win a game--a farther extension would enable it to win _all _games--that is, to beat any possible game of an antagonist. a little consideration will convince any one that the difficulty of making a machine beat all games, is not in the least degree greater, as regards the principle of the operations necessary, than that of making it beat a single game. if then we regard the chess-player as a machine, we must suppose, (what is highly improbable,) that its inventor preferred leaving it incomplete to perfecting it--a supposition rendered still more absurd, when we reflect that the leaving it incomplete would afford an argument against the possibility of its being a pure machine--the very argument we now adduce. <UNK> when the situation of the game is difficult or complex, we never perceive the turk either shake his head or roll his eyes. it is only when his next move is obvious, or when the game is so circumstanced that to a man in the automaton’s place there would be no necessity for reflection. now these peculiar movements of the head and eyes are movements customary with persons engaged in meditation, and the ingenious baron kempelen would have adapted these movements (were the machine a pure machine) to occasions proper for their display--that is, to occasions of complexity. but the reverse is seen to be the case, and this reverse applies precisely to our supposition of a man in the interior. when engaged in meditation about the game he has no time to think of setting in motion the mechanism of the automaton by which are moved the head and the eyes. when the game, however, is obvious, he has time to look about him, and, accordingly, we see the head shake and the eyes roll. <UNK> when the machine is rolled round to allow the spectators an examination of the back of the turk, and when his drapery is lifted up and the doors in the trunk and thigh thrown open, the interior of the trunk is seen to be crowded with machinery. in scrutinizing this machinery while the automaton was in motion, that is to say while the whole machine was moving on the castors, it appeared to us that certain portions of the mechanism changed their shape and position in a degree too great to be accounted for by the simple laws of perspective; and subsequent examinations convinced us that these undue alterations were attributable to mirrors in the interior of the trunk. the introduction of mirrors among the machinery could not have been intended to influence, in any degree, the machinery itself. their operation, whatever that operation should prove to be, must necessarily have reference to the eye of the spectator. we at once concluded that these mirrors were so placed to multiply to the vision some few pieces of machinery within the trunk so as to give it the appearance of being crowded with mechanism. now the direct inference from this is that the machine is not a pure machine. for if it were, the inventor, so far from wishing its mechanism to appear complex, and using deception for the purpose of giving it this appearance, would have been especially desirous of convincing those who witnessed his exhibition, of the _simplicity _of the means by which results so wonderful were brought about. <UNK> the external appearance, and, especially, the deportment of the turk, are, when we consider them as imitations of _life, _but very indifferent imitations. the countenance evinces no ingenuity, and is surpassed, in its resemblance to the human face, by the very commonest of wax-works. the eyes roll unnaturally in the head, without any corresponding motions of the lids or brows. the arm, particularly, performs its operations in an exceedingly stiff, awkward, jerking, and rectangular manner. now, all this is the result either of inability in maelzel to do better, or of intentional neglect--accidental neglect being out of the question, when we consider that the whole time of the ingenious proprietor is occupied in the improvement of his machines. most assuredly we must not refer the unlife-like appearances to inability--for all the rest of maelzel’s automata are evidence of his full ability to copy the motions and peculiarities of life with the most wonderful exactitude. the rope-dancers, for example, are inimitable. when the clown laughs, his lips, his eyes, his eye-brows, and eyelids--indeed, all the features of his countenance--are imbued with their appropriate expressions. in both him and his companion, every gesture is so entirely easy, and free from the semblance of artificiality, that, were it not for the diminutiveness of their size, and the fact of their being passed from one spectator to another previous to their exhibition on the rope, it would be difficult to convince any assemblage of persons that these wooden automata were not living creatures. we cannot, therefore, doubt mr. maelzel’s ability, and we must necessarily suppose that he intentionally suffered his chess player to remain the same artificial and unnatural figure which baron kempelen (no doubt also through design) originally made it. what this design was it is not difficult to conceive. were the automaton life-like in its motions, the spectator would be more apt to attribute its operations to their true cause, (that is, to human agency within) than he is now, when the awkward and rectangular manoeuvres convey the idea of pure and unaided mechanism. <UNK> when, a short time previous to the commencement of the game, the automaton is wound up by the exhibiter as usual, an ear in any degree accustomed to the sounds produced in winding up a system of machinery, will not fail to discover, instantaneously, that the axis turned by the key in the box of the chess-player, cannot possibly be connected with either a weight, a spring, or any system of machinery whatever. the inference here is the same as in our last observation. the winding up is inessential to the operations of the automaton, and is performed with the design of exciting in the spectators the false idea of mechanism. <UNK> when the question is demanded explicitly of maelzel--“is the automaton a pure machine or not?” his reply is invariably the same--“i will say nothing about it.” now the notoriety of the automaton, and the great curiosity it has every where excited, are owing more especially to the prevalent opinion that it is a pure machine, than to any other circumstance. of course, then, it is the interest of the proprietor to represent it as a pure machine. and what more obvious, and more effectual method could there be of impressing the spectators with this desired idea, than a positive and explicit declaration to that effect? on the other hand, what more obvious and effectual method could there be of exciting a disbelief in the automaton’s being a pure machine, than by withholding such explicit declaration? for, people will naturally reason thus,--it is maelzel’s interest to represent this thing a pure machine--he refuses to do so, directly, in words, although he does not scruple, and is evidently anxious to do so, indirectly by actions--were it actually what he wishes to represent it by actions, he would gladly avail himself of the more direct testimony of words--the inference is, that a consciousness of its not being a pure machine, is the reason of his silence--his actions cannot implicate him in a falsehood--his words may. <UNK> when, in exhibiting the interior of the box, maelzel has thrown open the door no. i, and also the door immediately behind it, he holds a lighted candle at the back door (as mentioned above) and moves the entire machine to and fro with a view of convincing the company that the cupboard no. <UNK> is entirely filled with machinery. when the machine is thus moved about, it will be apparent to any careful observer, that whereas that portion of the machinery near the front door no. <UNK> is perfectly steady and unwavering, the portion farther within fluctuates, in a very slight degree, with the movements of the machine. this circumstance first aroused in us the suspicion that the more remote portion of the machinery was so arranged as to be easily slipped, _en masse, _from its position when occasion should require it. this occasion we have already stated to occur when the man concealed within brings his body into an erect position upon the closing of the back door. <UNK> sir david brewster states the figure of the turk to be of the size of life--but in fact it is far above the ordinary size. nothing is more easy than to err in our notions of magnitude. the body of the automaton is generally insulated, and, having no means of immediately comparing it with any human form, we suffer ourselves to consider it as of ordinary dimensions. this mistake may, however, be corrected by observing the chess-player when, as is sometimes the case, the exhibiter approaches it. mr. maelzel, to be sure, is not very tall, but upon drawing near the machine, his head will be found at least eighteen inches below the head of the turk, although the latter, it will be remembered, is in a sitting position. <UNK> the box behind which the automaton is placed, is precisely three feet six inches long, two feet four inches deep, and two feet six inches high. these dimensions are fully sufficient for the accommodation of a man very much above the common size--and the main compartment alone is capable of holding any ordinary man in the position we have mentioned as assumed by the person concealed. as these are facts, which any one who doubts them may prove by actual calculation, we deem it unnecessary to dwell upon them. we will only suggest that, although the top of the box is apparently a board of about three inches in thickness, the spectator may satisfy himself by stooping and looking up at it when the main compartment is open, that it is in reality very thin. the height of the drawer also will be misconceived by those who examine it in a cursory manner. there is a space of about three inches between the top of the drawer as seen from the exterior, and the bottom of the cupboard--a space which must be included in the height of the drawer. these contrivances to make the room within the box appear less than it actually is, are referrible to a design on the part of the inventor, to impress the company again with a false idea, viz. that no human being can be accommodated within the box. <UNK> the interior of the main compartment is lined throughout with _cloth. _this cloth we suppose to have a twofold object. a portion of _it _may form, when tightly stretched, the only partitions which there is any necessity for removing during the changes of the man’s position, viz: the partition between the rear of the main compartment and the rear of the cupboard no. <UNK> and the partition between the main compartment, and the space behind the drawer when open. if we imagine this to be the case, the difficulty of shifting the partitions vanishes at once, if indeed any such difficulty could be supposed under any circumstances to exist. the second object of the cloth is to deaden and render indistinct all sounds occasioned by the movements of the person within. <UNK> the antagonist (as we have before observed) is not suffered to play at the board of the automaton, but is seated at some distance from the machine. the reason which, most probably, would be assigned for this circumstance, if the question were demanded, is, that were the antagonist otherwise situated, his person would intervene between the machine and the spectators, and preclude the latter from a distinct view. but this difficulty might be easily obviated, either by elevating the seats of the company, or by turning the end of the box towards them during the game. the true cause of the restriction is, perhaps, very different. were the antagonist seated in contact with the box, the secret would be liable to discovery, by his detecting, with the aid of a quick car, the breathings of the man concealed. <UNK> although m. maelzel, in disclosing the interior of the machine, sometimes slightly deviates from the _routine _which we have pointed out, yet _reeler in _any instance does he _so _deviate from it as to interfere with our solution. for example, he has been known to open, first of all, the drawer--but he never opens the main compartment without first closing the back door of cupboard no. <UNK> never opens the main compartment without first pulling out the drawer--he never shuts the drawer without first shutting the main compartment--he never opens the back door of cupboard no. <UNK> while the main compartment is open--and the game of chess is never commenced until the whole machine is closed. now if it were observed that _never, in any single instance, _did m. maelzel differ from the routine we have pointed out as necessary to our solution, it would be one of the strongest possible arguments in corroboration of it--but the argument becomes infinitely strengthened if we duly consider the circumstance that he _does occasionally _deviate from the routine but never does _so _deviate as to falsify the solution. <UNK> there are six candles on the board of the automaton during exhibition. the question naturally arises--“why are so many employed, when a single candle, or, at farthest, two, would have been amply sufficient to afford the spectators a clear view of the board, in a room otherwise so well lit up as the exhibition room always is--when, moreover, if we suppose the machine a _pure machine, _there can be no necessity for so much light, or indeed any light at all, to enable _it _to perform its operations--and when, especially, only a single candle is placed upon the table of the antagonist?” the first and most obvious inference is, that so strong a light is requisite to enable the man within to see through the transparent material (probably fine gauze) of which the breast of the turk is composed. but when we consider the arrangement of the candles, another reason immediately presents itself. there are six lights (as we have said before) in all. three of these are on each side of the figure. those most remote from the spectators are the longest--those in the middle are about two inches shorter--and those nearest the company about two inches shorter still--and the candles on one side differ in height from the candles respectively opposite on the other, by a ratio different from two inches--that is to say, the longest candle on one side is about three inches shorter than the longest candle on the other, and so on. thus it will be seen that no two of the candles are of the same height, and thus also the difficulty of ascertaining the _material _of the breast of the figure (against which the light is especially directed) is greatly augmented by the dazzling effect of the complicated crossings of the rays--crossings which are brought about by placing the centres of radiation all upon different levels. <UNK> while the chess-player was in possession of baron kempelen, it was more than once observed, first, that an italian in the suite of the baron was never visible during the playing of a game at chess by the turk, and, secondly, that the italian being taken seriously ill, the exhibition was suspended until his recovery. this italian professed a _total _ignorance of the game of chess, although all others of the suite played well. similar observations have been made since the automaton has been purchased by maelzel. there is a man, _schlumberoer, _who attends him wherever he goes, but who has no ostensible occupation other than that of assisting in the packing and unpacking of the automata. this man is about the medium size, and has a remarkable stoop in the shoulders. whether he professes to play chess or not, we are not informed. it is quite certain, however, that he is never to be seen during the exhibition of the chess-player, although frequently visible just before and just after the exhibition. moreover, some years ago maelzel visited richmond with his automata, and exhibited them, we believe, in the house now occupied by m. bossieux as a dancing academy. _schlumberg_er was suddenly taken ill, and during his illness there was no exhibition of the chess-player. these facts are well known to many of our citizens. the reason assigned for the suspension of the chess-player’s performances, was _not _the illness of _schlumberger. _the inferences from all this we leave, without farther comment, to the reader. <UNK> the turk plays with his _left_ arm. a circumstance so remarkable cannot be accidental. brewster takes no notice of it whatever beyond a mere statement, we believe, that such is the fact. the early writers of treatises on the automaton, seem not to have observed the matter at all, and have no reference to it. the author of the pamphlet alluded to by brewster, mentions it, but acknowledges his inability to account for it. yet it is obviously from such prominent discrepancies or incongruities as this that deductions are to be made (if made at all) which shall lead us to the truth. the circumstance of the automaton’s playing with his left hand cannot have connexion with the operations of the machine, considered merely as such. any mechanical arrangement which would cause the figure to move, in any given manner, the left arm--could, if reversed, cause it to move, in the same manner, the right. but these principles cannot be extended to the human organization, wherein there is a marked and radical difference in the construction, and, at all events, in the powers, of the right and left arms. reflecting upon this latter fact, we naturally refer the incongruity noticeable in the chess-player to this peculiarity in the human organization. if so, we must imagine some _reversion--_for the chess-player plays precisely as a man _would not. _these ideas, once entertained, are sufficient of themselves, to suggest the notion of a man in the interior. a few more imperceptible steps lead us, finally, to the result. the automaton plays with his left arm, because under no other circumstances could the man within play with his right--a _desideratum _of course. let us, for example, imagine the automaton to play with his right arm. to reach the machinery which moves the arm, and which we have before explained to lie just beneath the shoulder, it would be necessary for the man within either to use his right arm in an exceedingly painful and awkward position, (viz. brought up close to his body and tightly compressed between his body and the side of the automaton,) or else to use his left arm brought across his breast. in neither case could he act with the requisite ease or precision. on the contrary, the automaton playing, as it actually does, with the left arm, all difficulties vanish. the right arm of the man within is brought across his breast, and his right fingers act, without any constraint, upon the machinery in the shoulder of the figure. we do not believe that any reasonable objections can be urged against this solution of the automaton chess-player. the power of words oinos. pardon, agathos, the weakness of a spirit new-fledged with immortality! agathos. you have spoken nothing, my oinos, for which pardon is to be demanded. not even here is knowledge thing of intuition. for wisdom, ask of the angels freely, that it may be given! oinos. but in this existence, i dreamed that i should be at once cognizant of all things, and thus at once be happy in being cognizant of all. agathos. ah, not in knowledge is happiness, but in the acquisition of knowledge! in for ever knowing, we are for ever blessed; but to know all were the curse of a fiend. oinos. but does not the most high know all? agathos. that (since he is the most happy) must be still the one thing unknown even to him. oinos. but, since we grow hourly in knowledge, must not at last all things be known? agathos. look down into the abysmal distances!--attempt to force the gaze down the multitudinous vistas of the stars, as we sweep slowly through them thus--and thus--and thus! even the spiritual vision, is it not at all points arrested by the continuous golden walls of the universe?--the walls of the myriads of the shining bodies that mere number has appeared to blend into unity? oinos. i clearly perceive that the infinity of matter is no dream. agathos. there are no dreams in aidenn--but it is here whispered that, of this infinity of matter, the sole purpose is to afford infinite springs, at which the soul may allay the thirst to know, which is for ever unquenchable within it--since to quench it, would be to extinguish the soul’s self. question me then, my oinos, freely and without fear. come! we will leave to the left the loud harmony of the pleiades, and swoop outward from the throne into the starry meadows beyond orion, where, for pansies and violets, and heart’s--ease, are the beds of the triplicate and triple--tinted suns. oinos. and now, agathos, as we proceed, instruct me!--speak to me in the earth’s familiar tones. i understand not what you hinted to me, just now, of the modes or of the method of what, during mortality, we were accustomed to call creation. do you mean to say that the creator is not god? agathos. i mean to say that the deity does not create. oinos. explain. agathos. in the beginning only, he created. the seeming creatures which are now, throughout the universe, so perpetually springing into being, can only be considered as the mediate or indirect, not as the direct or immediate results of the divine creative power. oinos. among men, my agathos, this idea would be considered heretical in the extreme. agathos. among angels, my oinos, it is seen to be simply true. oinos. i can comprehend you thus far--that certain operations of what we term nature, or the natural laws, will, under certain conditions, give rise to that which has all the appearance of creation. shortly before the final overthrow of the earth, there were, i well remember, many very successful experiments in what some philosophers were weak enough to denominate the creation of animalculae. agathos. the cases of which you speak were, in fact, instances of the secondary creation--and of the only species of creation which has ever been, since the first word spoke into existence the first law. oinos. are not the starry worlds that, from the abyss of nonentity, burst hourly forth into the heavens--are not these stars, agathos, the immediate handiwork of the king? agathos. let me endeavor, my oinos, to lead you, step by step, to the conception i intend. you are well aware that, as no thought can perish, so no act is without infinite result. we moved our hands, for example, when we were dwellers on the earth, and, in so doing, gave vibration to the atmosphere which engirdled it. this vibration was indefinitely extended, till it gave impulse to every particle of the earth’s air, which thenceforward, and for ever, was actuated by the one movement of the hand. this fact the mathematicians of our globe well knew. they made the special effects, indeed, wrought in the fluid by special impulses, the subject of exact calculation--so that it became easy to determine in what precise period an impulse of given extent would engirdle the orb, and impress (for ever) every atom of the atmosphere circumambient. retrograding, they found no difficulty, from a given effect, under given conditions, in determining the value of the original impulse. now the mathematicians who saw that the results of any given impulse were absolutely endless--and who saw that a portion of these results were accurately traceable through the agency of algebraic analysis--who saw, too, the facility of the retrogradation--these men saw, at the same time, that this species of analysis itself, had within itself a capacity for indefinite progress--that there were no bounds conceivable to its advancement and applicability, except within the intellect of him who advanced or applied it. but at this point our mathematicians paused. oinos. and why, agathos, should they have proceeded? agathos. because there were some considerations of deep interest beyond. it was deducible from what they knew, that to a being of infinite understanding--one to whom the perfection of the algebraic analysis lay unfolded--there could be no difficulty in tracing every impulse given the air--and the ether through the air--to the remotest consequences at any even infinitely remote epoch of time. it is indeed demonstrable that every such impulse given the air, must, in the end, impress every individual thing that exists within the universe;--and the being of infinite understanding--the being whom we have imagined--might trace the remote undulations of the impulse--trace them upward and onward in their influences upon all particles of an matter--upward and onward for ever in their modifications of old forms--or, in other words, in their creation of new--until he found them reflected--unimpressive at last--back from the throne of the godhead. and not only could such a thing do this, but at any epoch, should a given result be afforded him--should one of these numberless comets, for example, be presented to his inspection--he could have no difficulty in determining, by the analytic retrogradation, to what original impulse it was due. this power of retrogradation in its absolute fulness and perfection--this faculty of referring at all epochs, all effects to all causes--is of course the prerogative of the deity alone--but in every variety of degree, short of the absolute perfection, is the power itself exercised by the whole host of the angelic intelligences. oinos. but you speak merely of impulses upon the air. agathos. in speaking of the air, i referred only to the earth; but the general proposition has reference to impulses upon the ether--which, since it pervades, and alone pervades all space, is thus the great medium of creation. oinos. then all motion, of whatever nature, creates? agathos. it must: but a true philosophy has long taught that the source of all motion is thought--and the source of all thought is-- oinos. god. agathos. i have spoken to you, oinos, as to a child of the fair earth which lately perished--of impulses upon the atmosphere of the earth. oinos. you did. agathos. and while i thus spoke, did there not cross your mind some thought of the physical power of words? is not every word an impulse on the air? oinos. but why, agathos, do you weep--and why, oh why do your wings droop as we hover above this fair star--which is the greenest and yet most terrible of all we have encountered in our flight? its brilliant flowers look like a fairy dream--but its fierce volcanoes like the passions of a turbulent heart. agathos. they are!--they are! this wild star--it is now three centuries since, with clasped hands, and with streaming eyes, at the feet of my beloved--i spoke it--with a few passionate sentences--into birth. its brilliant flowers are the dearest of all unfulfilled dreams, and its raging volcanoes are the passions of the most turbulent and unhallowed of hearts. the colloquy of monos and una “these; things are in the future.” sophocles--antig: _ una._ “born again?” _ monos._ yes, fairest and best beloved una, “born again.” these were the words upon whose mystical meaning i had so long pondered, rejecting the explanations of the priesthood, until death himself resolved for me the secret. _una._ death! _monos._ how strangely, sweet una, you echo my words! i observe, too, a vacillation in your step--a joyous inquietude in your eyes. you are confused and oppressed by the majestic novelty of the life eternal. yes, it was of death i spoke. and here how singularly sounds that word which of old was wont to bring terror to all hearts--throwing a mildew upon all pleasures! _ una._ ah, death, the spectre which sate at all feasts! how often, monos, did we lose ourselves in speculations upon its nature! how mysteriously did it act as a check to human bliss--saying unto it “thus far, and no farther!” that earnest mutual love, my own monos, which burned within our bosoms how vainly did we flatter ourselves, feeling happy in its first up-springing, that our happiness would strengthen with its strength! alas! as it grew, so grew in our hearts the dread of that evil hour which was hurrying to separate us forever! thus, in time, it became painful to love. hate would have been mercy then. _ monos._ speak not here of these griefs, dear una--mine, mine, forever now! _ una._ but the memory of past sorrow--is it not present joy? i have much to say yet of the things which have been. above all, i burn to know the incidents of your own passage through the dark valley and shadow. _ monos._ and when did the radiant una ask anything of her monos in vain? i will be minute in relating all--but at what point shall the weird narrative begin? _una._ at what point? _monos._ you have said. _una._ monos, i comprehend you. in death we have both learned the propensity of man to define the indefinable. i will not say, then, commence with the moment of life’s cessation--but commence with that sad, sad instant when, the fever having abandoned you, you sank into a breathless and motionless torpor, and i pressed down your pallid eyelids with the passionate fingers of love. _ monos._ one word first, my una, in regard to man’s general condition at this epoch. you will remember that one or two of the wise among our forefathers--wise in fact, although not in the world’s esteem--had ventured to doubt the propriety of the term “improvement,” as applied to the progress of our civilization. there were periods in each of the five or six centuries immediately preceding our dissolution, when arose some vigorous intellect, boldly contending for those principles whose truth appears now, to our disenfranchised reason, so utterly obvious--principles which should have taught our race to submit to the guidance of the natural laws, rather than attempt their control. at long intervals some masterminds appeared, looking upon each advance in practical science as a retro-gradation in the true utility. occasionally the poetic intellect--that intellect which we now feel to have been the most exalted of all--since those truths which to us were of the most enduring importance could only be reached by that analogy which speaks in proof tones to the imagination alone and to the unaided reason bears no weight--occasionally did this poetic intellect proceed a step farther in the evolving of the vague idea of the philosophic, and find in the mystic parable that tells of the tree of knowledge, and of its forbidden fruit, death-producing, a distinct intimation that knowledge was not meet for man in the infant condition of his soul. and these men--the poets--living and perishing amid the scorn of the “utilitarians”--of rough pedants, who arrogated to themselves a title which could have been properly applied only to the scorned--these men, the poets, pondered piningly, yet not unwisely, upon the ancient days when our wants were not more simple than our enjoyments were keen--days when mirth was a word unknown, so solemnly deep-toned was happiness--holy, august and blissful days, when blue rivers ran undammed, between hills unhewn, into far forest solitudes, primæval, odorous, and unexplored. yet these noble exceptions from the general misrule served but to strengthen it by opposition. alas! we had fallen upon the most evil of all our evil days. the great “movement”--that was the cant term--went on: a diseased commotion, moral and physical. art--the arts--arose supreme, and, once enthroned, cast chains upon the intellect which had elevated them to power. man, because he could not but acknowledge the majesty of nature, fell into childish exultation at his acquired and still-increasing dominion over her elements. even while he stalked a god in his own fancy, an infantine imbecility came over him. as might be supposed from the origin of his disorder, he grew infected with system, and with abstraction. he enwrapped himself in generalities. among other odd ideas, that of universal equality gained ground; and in the face of analogy and of god--in despite of the loud warning voice of the laws of gradation so visibly pervading all things in earth an heaven--wild attempts at an omni-prevalent democracy were made. yet this evil sprang necessarily from the leading evil, knowledge. man could not both know and succumb. meantime huge smoking cities arose, innumerable. green leaves shrank before the hot breath of furnaces. the fair face of nature was deformed as with the ravages of some loathsome disease. and methinks, sweet una, even our slumbering sense of the forced and of the far-fetched might have arrested us here. but now it appears that we had worked out our own destruction in the perversion of our taste, or rather in the blind neglect of its culture in the schools. for, in truth, it was at this crisis that taste alone--that faculty which, holding a middle position between the pure intellect and the moral sense, could never safely have been disregarded--it was now that taste alone could have led us gently back to beauty, to nature, and to life. but alas for the pure contemplative spirit and majestic intuition of plato! alas for the which he justly regarded as an all-sufficient education for the soul! alas for him and for it!--since both were most desperately needed when both were most entirely forgotten or despised. <UNK> pascal, a philosopher whom we both love, has said, how truly!--“que tout notre raisonnement se rèduit à céder au sentiment;” and it is not impossible that the sentiment of the natural, had time permitted it, would have regained its old ascendancy over the harsh mathematical reason of the schools. but this thing was not to be. prematurely induced by intemperance of knowledge the old age of the world drew on. this the mass of mankind saw not, or, living lustily although unhappily, affected not to see. but, for myself, the earth’s records had taught me to look for widest ruin as the price of highest civilization. i had imbibed a prescience of our fate from comparison of china the simple and enduring, with assyria the architect, with egypt the astrologer, with nubia, more crafty than either, the turbulent mother of all arts. in history <UNK> of these regions i met with a ray from the future. the individual artificialities of the three latter were local diseases of the earth, and in their individual overthrows we had seen local remedies applied; but for the infected world at large i could anticipate no regeneration save in death. that man, as a race, should not become extinct, i saw that he must be “born again.” and now it was, fairest and dearest, that we wrapped our spirits, daily, in dreams. now it was that, in twilight, we discoursed of the days to come, when the art-scarred surface of the earth, having undergone that purification <UNK> which alone could efface its rectangular obscenities, should clothe itself anew in the verdure and the mountain-slopes and the smiling waters of paradise, and be rendered at length a fit dwelling-place for man:--for man the death purged--for man to whose now exalted intellect there should be poison in knowledge no more--for the redeemed, regenerated, blissful, and now immortal, but still for the material, man. _una._ well do i remember these conversations, dear monos; but the epoch of the fiery overthrow was not so near at hand as we believed, and as the corruption you indicate did surely warrant us in believing. men lived; and died individually. you yourself sickened, and passed into the grave; and thither your constant una speedily followed you. and though the century which has since elapsed, and whose conclusion brings us thus together once more, tortured our slumbering senses with no impatience of duration, yet, my monos, it was a century still. _monos._ say, rather, a point in the vague infinity. unquestionably, it was in the earth’s dotage that i died. wearied at heart with anxieties which had their origin in the general turmoil and decay, i succumbed to the fierce fever. after some few days of pain, and many of dreamy delirium replete with ecstasy, the manifestations of which you mistook for pain, while i longed but was impotent to undeceive you--after some days there came upon me, as you have said, a breathless and motionless torpor; and this was termed death by those who stood around me. words are vague things. my condition did not deprive me of sentience. it appeared to me not greatly dissimilar to the extreme quiescence of him, who, having slumbered long and profoundly, lying motionless and fully prostrate in a midsummer noon, begins to steal slowly back into consciousness, through the mere sufficiency of his sleep, and without being awakened by external disturbances. i breathed no longer. the pulses were still. the heart had ceased to beat. volition had not departed, but was powerless. the senses were unusually active, although eccentrically so--assuming often each other’s functions at random. the taste and the smell were inextricably confounded, and became one sentiment, abnormal and intense. the rose-water with which your tenderness had moistened my lips to the last, affected me with sweet fancies of flowers--fantastic flowers, far more lovely than any of the old earth, but whose prototypes we have here blooming around us. the eyelids, transparent and bloodless, offered no complete impediment to vision. as volition was in abeyance, the balls could not roll in their sockets but all objects within the range of the visual hemisphere were seen with more or less distinctness; the rays which fell upon the external retina, or into the corner of the eye, producing a more vivid effect than those which struck the front or interior surface. yet, in the former instance, this effect was so far anomalous that i appreciated it only as sound--sound sweet or discordant as the matters presenting themselves at my side were light or dark in shade--curved or angular in outline. the hearing, at the same time, although excited in degree, was not irregular in action--estimating real sounds with an extravagance of precision, not less than of sensibility. touch had undergone a modification more peculiar. its impressions were tardily received, but pertinaciously retained, and resulted always in the highest physical pleasure. thus the pressure of your sweet fingers upon my eyelids, at first only recognised through vision, at length, long after their removal, filled my whole being with a sensual delight immeasurable. i say with a sensual delight. all my perceptions were purely sensual. the materials furnished the passive brain by the senses were not in the least degree wrought into shape by the deceased understanding. of pain there was some little; of pleasure there was much; but of moral pain or pleasure none at all. thus your wild sobs floated into my ear with all their mournful cadences, and were appreciated in their every variation of sad tone; but they were soft musical sounds and no more; they conveyed to the extinct reason no intimation of the sorrows which gave them birth; while the large and constant tears which fell upon my face, telling the bystanders of a heart which broke, thrilled every fibre of my frame with ecstasy alone. and this was in truth the death of which these bystanders spoke reverently, in low whispers--you, sweet una, gaspingly, with loud cries. they attired me for the coffin--three or four dark figures which flitted busily to and fro. as these crossed the direct line of my vision they affected me as forms; but upon passing to my side their images impressed me with the idea of shrieks, groans, and other dismal expressions of terror, of horror, or of wo. you alone, habited in a white robe, passed in all directions musically about me. the day waned; and, as its light faded away, i became possessed by a vague uneasiness--an anxiety such as the sleeper feels when sad real sounds fall continuously within his ear--low distant bell-tones, solemn, at long but equal intervals, and mingling with melancholy dreams. night arrived; and with its shadows a heavy discomfort. it oppressed my limbs with the oppression of some dull weight, and was palpable. there was also a moaning sound, not unlike the distant reverberation of surf, but more continuous, which, beginning with the first twilight, had grown in strength with the darkness. suddenly lights were brought into the room, and this reverberation became forthwith interrupted into frequent unequal bursts of the same sound, but less dreary and less distinct. the ponderous oppression was in a great measure relieved; and, issuing from the flame of each lamp, (for there were many,) there flowed unbrokenly into my ears a strain of melodious monotone. and when now, dear una, approaching the bed upon which i lay outstretched, you sat gently by my side, breathing odor from your sweet lips, and pressing them upon my brow, there arose tremulously within my bosom, and mingling with the merely physical sensations which circumstances had called forth, a something akin to sentiment itself--a feeling that, half appreciating, half responded to your earnest love and sorrow; but this feeling took no root in the pulseless heart, and seemed indeed rather a shadow than a reality, and faded quickly away, first into extreme quiescence, and then into a purely sensual pleasure as before. and now, from the wreck and the chaos of the usual senses, there appeared to have arisen within me a sixth, all perfect. in its exercise i found a wild delight--yet a delight still physical, inasmuch as the understanding had in it no part. motion in the animal frame had fully ceased. no muscle quivered; no nerve thrilled; no artery throbbed. but there seemed to have sprung up in the brain, that of which no words could convey to the merely human intelligence even an indistinct conception. let me term it a mental pendulous pulsation. it was the moral embodiment of man’s abstract idea of time. by the absolute equalization of this movement--or of such as this--had the cycles of the firmamental orbs themselves, been adjusted. by its aid i measured the irregularities of the clock upon the mantel, and of the watches of the attendants. their tickings came sonorously to my ears. the slightest deviations from the true proportion--and these deviations were omni-prævalent--affected me just as violations of abstract truth were wont, on earth, to affect the moral sense. although no two of the time-pieces in the chamber struck the individual seconds accurately together, yet i had no difficulty in holding steadily in mind the tones, and the respective momentary errors of each. and this--this keen, perfect, self-existing sentiment of duration--this sentiment existing (as man could not possibly have conceived it to exist) independently of any succession of events--this idea--this sixth sense, upspringing from the ashes of the rest, was the first obvious and certain step of the intemporal soul upon the threshold of the temporal eternity. it was midnight; and you still sat by my side. all others had departed from the chamber of death. they had deposited me in the coffin. the lamps burned flickeringly; for this i knew by the tremulousness of the monotonous strains. but, suddenly these strains diminished in distinctness and in volume. finally they ceased. the perfume in my nostrils died away. forms affected my vision no longer. the oppression of the darkness uplifted itself from my bosom. a dull shock like that of electricity pervaded my frame, and was followed by total loss of the idea of contact. all of what man has termed sense was merged in the sole consciousness of entity, and in the one abiding sentiment of duration. the mortal body had been at length stricken with the hand of the deadly decay. yet had not all of sentience departed; for the consciousness and the sentiment remaining supplied some of its functions by a lethargic intuition. i appreciated the direful change now in operation upon the flesh, and, as the dreamer is sometimes aware of the bodily presence of one who leans over him, so, sweet una, i still dully felt that you sat by my side. so, too, when the noon of the second day came, i was not unconscious of those movements which displaced you from my side, which confined me within the coffin, which deposited me within the hearse, which bore me to the grave, which lowered me within it, which heaped heavily the mould upon me, and which thus left me, in blackness and corruption, to my sad and solemn slumbers with the worm. and here, in the prison-house which has few secrets to disclose, there rolled away days and weeks and months; and the soul watched narrowly each second as it flew, and, without effort, took record of its flight--without effort and without object. a year passed. the consciousness of being had grown hourly more indistinct, and that of mere locality had, in great measure, usurped its position. the idea of entity was becoming merged in that of place. the narrow space immediately surrounding what had been the body, was now growing to be the body itself. at length, as often happens to the sleeper (by sleep and its world alone is death imaged)--at length, as sometimes happened on earth to the deep slumberer, when some flitting light half startled him into awaking, yet left him half enveloped in dreams--so to me, in the strict embrace of the shadow came that light which alone might have had power to startle--the light of enduring love. men toiled at the grave in which i lay darkling. they upthrew the damp earth. upon my mouldering bones there descended the coffin of una. and now again all was void. that nebulous light had been extinguished. that feeble thrill had vibrated itself into quiescence. many lustra had supervened. dust had returned to dust. the worm had food no more. the sense of being had at length utterly departed, and there reigned in its stead--instead of all things--dominant and perpetual--the autocrats place and time. for that which was not--for that which had no form--for that which had no thought--for that which had no sentience--for that which was soulless, yet of which matter formed no portion--for all this nothingness, yet for all this immortality, the grave was still a home, and the corrosive hours, co-mates. the conversation of eiros and charmion i will bring fire to thee. _euripides--androm:_ eiros. why do you call me eiros? charmion so henceforward will you always be called. you must forget too, my earthly name, and speak to me as charmion. eiros. this is indeed no dream! charmion. dreams are with us no more;--but of these mysteries anon. i rejoice to see you looking life-like and rational. the film of the shadow has already passed from off your eyes. be of heart and fear nothing. your allotted days of stupor have expired and, to-morrow, i will myself induct you into the full joys and wonders of your novel existence. eiros. true--i feel no stupor--none at all. the wild sickness and the terrible darkness have left me, and i hear no longer that mad, rushing, horrible sound, like the “voice of many waters.” yet my senses are bewildered, charmion, with the keenness of their perception of the new. charmion. a few days will remove all this;--but i fully understand you, and feel for you. it is now ten earthly years since i underwent what you undergo--yet the remembrance of it hangs by me still. you have now suffered all of pain, however, which you will suffer in aidenn. eiros. in aidenn? charmion. in aidenn. eiros. oh god!--pity me, charmion!--i am overburthened with the majesty of all things--of the unknown now known--of the speculative future merged in the august and certain present. charmion. grapple not now with such thoughts. to-morrow we will speak of this. your mind wavers, and its agitation will find relief in the exercise of simple memories. look not around, nor forward--but back. i am burning with anxiety to hear the details of that stupendous event which threw you among us. tell me of it. let us converse of familiar things, in the old familiar language of the world which has so fearfully perished. eiros. most fearfully, fearfully!--this is indeed no dream. charmion. dreams are no more. was i much mourned, my eiros? eiros. mourned, charmion?--oh deeply. to that last hour of all, there hung a cloud of intense gloom and devout sorrow over your household. charmion. and that last hour--speak of it. remember that, beyond the naked fact of the catastrophe itself, i know nothing. when, coming out from among mankind, i passed into night through the grave--at that period, if i remember aright, the calamity which overwhelmed you was utterly unanticipated. but, indeed, i knew little of the speculative philosophy of the day. eiros. the individual calamity was as you say entirely unanticipated; but analogous misfortunes had been long a subject of discussion with astronomers. i need scarce tell you, my friend, that, even when you left us, men had agreed to understand those passages in the most holy writings which speak of the final destruction of all things by fire, as having reference to the orb of the earth alone. but in regard to the immediate agency of the ruin, speculation had been at fault from that epoch in astronomical knowledge in which the comets were divested of the terrors of flame. the very moderate density of these bodies had been well established. they had been observed to pass among the satellites of jupiter, without bringing about any sensible alteration either in the masses or in the orbits of these secondary planets. we had long regarded the wanderers as vapory creations of inconceivable tenuity, and as altogether incapable of doing injury to our substantial globe, even in the event of contact. but contact was not in any degree dreaded; for the elements of all the comets were accurately known. that among them we should look for the agency of the threatened fiery destruction had been for many years considered an inadmissible idea. but wonders and wild fancies had been, of late days, strangely rife among mankind; and, although it was only with a few of the ignorant that actual apprehension prevailed, upon the announcement by astronomers of a new comet, yet this announcement was generally received with i know not what of agitation and mistrust. the elements of the strange orb were immediately calculated, and it was at once conceded by all observers, that its path, at perihelion, would bring it into very close proximity with the earth. there were two or three astronomers, of secondary note, who resolutely maintained that a contact was inevitable. i cannot very well express to you the effect of this intelligence upon the people. for a few short days they would not believe an assertion which their intellect so long employed among worldly considerations could not in any manner grasp. but the truth of a vitally important fact soon makes its way into the understanding of even the most stolid. finally, all men saw that astronomical knowledge lied not, and they awaited the comet. its approach was not, at first, seemingly rapid; nor was its appearance of very unusual character. it was of a dull red, and had little perceptible train. for seven or eight days we saw no material increase in its apparent diameter, and but a partial alteration in its color. meantime, the ordinary affairs of men were discarded and all interests absorbed in a growing discussion, instituted by the philosophic, in respect to the cometary nature. even the grossly ignorant aroused their sluggish capacities to such considerations. the learned now gave their intellect--their soul--to no such points as the allaying of fear, or to the sustenance of loved theory. they sought--they panted for right views. they groaned for perfected knowledge. truth arose in the purity of her strength and exceeding majesty, and the wise bowed down and adored. that material injury to our globe or to its inhabitants would result from the apprehended contact, was an opinion which hourly lost ground among the wise; and the wise were now freely permitted to rule the reason and the fancy of the crowd. it was demonstrated, that the density of the comet’s nucleus was far less than that of our rarest gas; and the harmless passage of a similar visitor among the satellites of jupiter was a point strongly insisted upon, and which served greatly to allay terror. theologists with an earnestness fear-enkindled, dwelt upon the biblical prophecies, and expounded them to the people with a directness and simplicity of which no previous instance had been known. that the final destruction of the earth must be brought about by the agency of fire, was urged with a spirit that enforced every where conviction; and that the comets were of no fiery nature (as all men now knew) was a truth which relieved all, in a great measure, from the apprehension of the great calamity foretold. it is noticeable that the popular prejudices and vulgar errors in regard to pestilences and wars--errors which were wont to prevail upon every appearance of a comet--were now altogether unknown. as if by some sudden convulsive exertion, reason had at once hurled superstition from her throne. the feeblest intellect had derived vigor from excessive interest. what minor evils might arise from the contact were points of elaborate question. the learned spoke of slight geological disturbances, of probable alterations in climate, and consequently in vegetation, of possible magnetic and electric influences. many held that no visible or perceptible effect would in any manner be produced. while such discussions were going on, their subject gradually approached, growing larger in apparent diameter, and of a more brilliant lustre. mankind grew paler as it came. all human operations were suspended. there was an epoch in the course of the general sentiment when the comet had attained, at length, a size surpassing that of any previously recorded visitation. the people now, dismissing any lingering hope that the astronomers were wrong, experienced all the certainty of evil. the chimerical aspect of their terror was gone. the hearts of the stoutest of our race beat violently within their bosoms. a very few days sufficed, however, to merge even such feelings in sentiments more unendurable we could no longer apply to the strange orb any accustomed thoughts. its historical attributes had disappeared. it oppressed us with a hideous novelty of emotion. we saw it not as an astronomical phenomenon in the heavens, but as an incubus upon our hearts, and a shadow upon our brains. it had taken, with inconceivable rapidity, the character of a gigantic mantle of rare flame, extending from horizon to horizon. yet a day, and men breathed with greater freedom. it was clear that we were already within the influence of the comet; yet we lived. we even felt an unusual elasticity of frame and vivacity of mind. the exceeding tenuity of the object of our dread was apparent; for all heavenly objects were plainly visible through it. meantime, our vegetation had perceptibly altered; and we gained faith, from this predicted circumstance, in the foresight of the wise. a wild luxuriance of foliage, utterly unknown before, burst out upon every vegetable thing. yet another day--and the evil was not altogether upon us. it was now evident that its nucleus would first reach us. a wild change had come over all men; and the first sense of pain was the wild signal for general lamentation and horror. this first sense of pain lay in a rigorous constriction of the breast and lungs, and an insufferable dryness of the skin. it could not be denied that our atmosphere was radically affected; the conformation of this atmosphere and the possible modifications to which it might be subjected, were now the topics of discussion. the result of investigation sent an electric thrill of the intensest terror through the universal heart of man. it had been long known that the air which encircled us was a compound of oxygen and nitrogen gases, in the proportion of twenty-one measures of oxygen, and seventy-nine of nitrogen in every one hundred of the atmosphere. oxygen, which was the principle of combustion, and the vehicle of heat, was absolutely necessary to the support of animal life, and was the most powerful and energetic agent in nature. nitrogen, on the contrary, was incapable of supporting either animal life or flame. an unnatural excess of oxygen would result, it had been ascertained in just such an elevation of the animal spirits as we had latterly experienced. it was the pursuit, the extension of the idea, which had engendered awe. what would be the result of a total extraction of the nitrogen? a combustion irresistible, all-devouring, omni-prevalent, immediate;--the entire fulfilment, in all their minute and terrible details, of the fiery and horror-inspiring denunciations of the prophecies of the holy book. why need i paint, charmion, the now disenchained frenzy of mankind? that tenuity in the comet which had previously inspired us with hope, was now the source of the bitterness of despair. in its impalpable gaseous character we clearly perceived the consummation of fate. meantime a day again passed--bearing away with it the last shadow of hope. we gasped in the rapid modification of the air. the red blood bounded tumultuously through its strict channels. a furious delirium possessed all men; and, with arms rigidly outstretched towards the threatening heavens, they trembled and shrieked aloud. but the nucleus of the destroyer was now upon us;--even here in aidenn, i shudder while i speak. let me be brief--brief as the ruin that overwhelmed. for a moment there was a wild lurid light alone, visiting and penetrating all things. then--let us bow down charmion, before the excessive majesty of the great god!--then, there came a shouting and pervading sound, as if from the mouth itself of him; while the whole incumbent mass of ether in which we existed, burst at once into a species of intense flame, for whose surpassing brilliancy and all-fervid heat even the angels in the high heaven of pure knowledge have no name. thus ended all. shadow--a parable yea, though i walk through the valley of the shadow: --psalm of david. ye who read are still among the living; but i who write shall have long since gone my way into the region of shadows. for indeed strange things shall happen, and secret things be known, and many centuries shall pass away, ere these memorials be seen of men. and, when seen, there will be some to disbelieve, and some to doubt, and yet a few who will find much to ponder upon in the characters here graven with a stylus of iron. the year had been a year of terror, and of feelings more intense than terror for which there is no name upon the earth. for many prodigies and signs had taken place, and far and wide, over sea and land, the black wings of the pestilence were spread abroad. to those, nevertheless, cunning in the stars, it was not unknown that the heavens wore an aspect of ill; and to me, the greek oinos, among others, it was evident that now had arrived the alternation of that seven hundred and ninety-fourth year when, at the entrance of aries, the planet jupiter is conjoined with the red ring of the terrible saturnus. the peculiar spirit of the skies, if i mistake not greatly, made itself manifest, not only in the physical orb of the earth, but in the souls, imaginations, and meditations of mankind. over some flasks of the red chian wine, within the walls of a noble hall, in a dim city called ptolemais, we sat, at night, a company of seven. and to our chamber there was no entrance save by a lofty door of brass: and the door was fashioned by the artisan corinnos, and, being of rare workmanship, was fastened from within. black draperies, likewise, in the gloomy room, shut out from our view the moon, the lurid stars, and the peopleless streets--but the boding and the memory of evil they would not be so excluded. there were things around us and about of which i can render no distinct account--things material and spiritual--heaviness in the atmosphere--a sense of suffocation--anxiety--and, above all, that terrible state of existence which the nervous experience when the senses are keenly living and awake, and meanwhile the powers of thought lie dormant. a dead weight hung upon us. it hung upon our limbs--upon the household furniture--upon the goblets from which we drank; and all things were depressed, and borne down thereby--all things save only the flames of the seven lamps which illumined our revel. uprearing themselves in tall slender lines of light, they thus remained burning all pallid and motionless; and in the mirror which their lustre formed upon the round table of ebony at which we sat, each of us there assembled beheld the pallor of his own countenance, and the unquiet glare in the downcast eyes of his companions. yet we laughed and were merry in our proper way--which was hysterical; and sang the songs of anacreon--which are madness; and drank deeply--although the purple wine reminded us of blood. for there was yet another tenant of our chamber in the person of young zoilus. dead, and at full length he lay, enshrouded; the genius and the demon of the scene. alas! he bore no portion in our mirth, save that his countenance, distorted with the plague, and his eyes, in which death had but half extinguished the fire of the pestilence, seemed to take such interest in our merriment as the dead may haply take in the merriment of those who are to die. but although i, oinos, felt that the eyes of the departed were upon me, still i forced myself not to perceive the bitterness of their expression, and gazing down steadily into the depths of the ebony mirror, sang with a loud and sonorous voice the songs of the son of teios. but gradually my songs they ceased, and their echoes, rolling afar off among the sable draperies of the chamber, became weak, and undistinguishable, and so faded away. and lo! from among those sable draperies where the sounds of the song departed, there came forth a dark and undefined shadow--a shadow such as the moon, when low in heaven, might fashion from the figure of a man: but it was the shadow neither of man nor of god, nor of any familiar thing. and quivering awhile among the draperies of the room, it at length rested in full view upon the surface of the door of brass. but the shadow was vague, and formless, and indefinite, and was the shadow neither of man nor of god--neither god of greece, nor god of chaldaea, nor any egyptian god. and the shadow rested upon the brazen doorway, and under the arch of the entablature of the door, and moved not, nor spoke any word, but there became stationary and remained. and the door whereupon the shadow rested was, if i remember aright, over against the feet of the young zoilus enshrouded. but we, the seven there assembled, having seen the shadow as it came out from among the draperies, dared not steadily behold it, but cast down our eyes, and gazed continually into the depths of the mirror of ebony. and at length i, oinos, speaking some low words, demanded of the shadow its dwelling and its appellation. and the shadow answered, “i am shadow, and my dwelling is near to the catacombs of ptolemais, and hard by those dim plains of helusion which border upon the foul charonian canal.” and then did we, the seven, start from our seats in horror, and stand trembling, and shuddering, and aghast, for the tones in the voice of the shadow were not the tones of any one being, but of a multitude of beings, and, varying in their cadences from syllable to syllable fell duskly upon our ears in the well-remembered and familiar accents of many thousand departed friends.

internal decoration, if not in the external architecture of their residences, the english are supreme. the italians have but little sentiment beyond marbles and colours. in france, _meliora probant, deteriora _sequuntur--the people are too much a race of gadabouts to maintain those household proprieties of which, indeed, they have a delicate appreciation, or at least the elements of a proper sense. the chinese and most of the eastern races have a warm but inappropriate fancy. the scotch are _poor _decorists. the dutch have, perhaps, an indeterminate idea that a curtain is not a cabbage. in spain they are _all _curtains--a nation of hangmen. the russians do not furnish. the hottentots and kickapoos are very well in their way. the yankees alone are preposterous. how this happens, it is not difficult to see. we have no aristocracy of blood, and having therefore as a natural, and indeed as an inevitable thing, fashioned for ourselves an aristocracy of dollars, the _display of wealth _has here to take the place and perform the office of the heraldic display in monarchical countries. by a transition readily understood, and which might have been as readily foreseen, we have been brought to merge in simple _show_ our notions of taste itself. to speak less abstractly. in england, for example, no mere parade of costly appurtenances would be so likely as with us, to create an impression of the beautiful in respect to the appurtenances themselves--or of taste as regards the proprietor:--this for the reason, first, that wealth is not, in england, the loftiest object of ambition as constituting a nobility; and secondly, that there, the true nobility of blood, confining itself within the strict limits of legitimate taste, rather avoids than affects that mere costliness in which a _parvenu _rivalry may at any time be successfully attempted. the people _will _imitate the nobles, and the result is a thorough diffusion of the proper feeling. but in america, the coins current being the sole arms of the aristocracy, their display may be said, in general, to be the sole means of the aristocratic distinction; and the populace, looking always upward for models, are insensibly led to confound the two entirely separate ideas of magnificence and beauty. in short, the cost of an article of furniture has at length come to be, with us, nearly the sole test of its merit in a decorative point of view--and this test, once established, has led the way to many analogous errors, readily traceable to the one primitive folly. there could be nothing more directly offensive to the eye of an artist than the interior of what is termed in the united states--that is to say, in appallachia--a well-furnished apartment. its most usual defect is a want of keeping. we speak of the keeping of a room as we would of the keeping of a picture--for both the picture and the room are amenable to those undeviating principles which regulate all varieties of art; and very nearly the same laws by which we decide on the higher merits of a painting, suffice for decision on the adjustment of a chamber. a want of keeping is observable sometimes in the character of the several pieces of furniture, but generally in their colours or modes of adaptation to use _very _often the eye is offended by their inartistic arrangement. straight lines are too prevalent--too uninterruptedly continued--or clumsily interrupted at right angles. if curved lines occur, they are repeated into unpleasant uniformity. by undue precision, the appearance of many a fine apartment is utterly spoiled. curtains are rarely well disposed, or well chosen in respect to other decorations. with formal furniture, curtains are out of place; and an extensive volume of drapery of any kind is, under any circumstance, irreconcilable with good taste--the proper quantum, as well as the proper adjustment, depending upon the character of the general effect. carpets are better understood of late than of ancient days, but we still very frequently err in their patterns and colours. the soul of the apartment is the carpet. from it are deduced not only the hues but the forms of all objects incumbent. a judge at common law may be an ordinary man; a good judge of a carpet _must be _a genius. yet we have heard discoursing of carpets, with the air “_d’un mouton qui reve,” _fellows who should not and who could not be entrusted with the management of their own _moustaches. _every one knows that a large floor _may _have a covering of large figures, and that a small one must have a covering of small--yet this is not all the knowledge in the world. as regards texture, the saxony is alone admissible. brussels is the preterpluperfect tense of fashion, and turkey is taste in its dying agonies. touching pattern--a carpet should _not _be bedizzened out like a riccaree indian--all red chalk, yellow ochre, and cock’s feathers. in brief--distinct grounds, and vivid circular or cycloid figures, _of no meaning, _are here median laws. the abomination of flowers, or representations of well-known objects of any kind, should not be endured within the limits of christendom. indeed, whether on carpets, or curtains, or tapestry, or ottoman coverings, all upholstery of this nature should be rigidly arabesque. as for those antique floor-cloth & still occasionally seen in the dwellings of the rabble--cloths of huge, sprawling, and radiating devises, stripe-interspersed, and glorious with all hues, among which no ground is intelligible--these are but the wicked invention of a race of time-servers and money-lovers--children of baal and worshippers of mammon--benthams, who, to spare thought and economize fancy, first cruelly invented the kaleidoscope, and then established joint-stock companies to twirl it by steam. _glare_ is a leading error in the philosophy of american household decoration--an error easily recognised as deduced from the perversion of taste just specified., we are violently enamoured of gas and of glass. the former is totally inadmissible within doors. its harsh and unsteady light offends. no one having both brains and eyes will use it. a mild, or what artists term a cool light, with its consequent warm shadows, will do wonders for even an ill-furnished apartment. never was a more lovely thought than that of the astral lamp. we mean, of course, the astral lamp proper--the lamp of argand, with its original plain ground-glass shade, and its tempered and uniform moonlight rays. the cut-glass shade is a weak invention of the enemy. the eagerness with which we have adopted it, partly on account of its _flashiness,_ but principally on account of its _greater rest,_ is a good commentary on the proposition with which we began. it is not too much to say, that the deliberate employer of a cut-glass shade, is either radically deficient in taste, or blindly subservient to the caprices of fashion. the light proceeding from one of these gaudy abominations is unequal broken, and painful. it alone is sufficient to mar a world of good effect in the furniture subjected to its influence. female loveliness, in especial, is more than one-half disenchanted beneath its evil eye. in the matter of glass, generally, we proceed upon false principles. its leading feature is _glitter--_and in that one word how much of all that is detestable do we express! flickering, unquiet lights, are _sometimes _pleasing--to children and idiots always so--but in the embellishment of a room they should be scrupulously avoided. in truth, even strong _steady _lights are inadmissible. the huge and unmeaning glass chandeliers, prism-cut, gas-lighted, and without shade, which dangle in our most fashionable drawing-rooms, may be cited as the quintessence of all that is false in taste or preposterous in folly. the rage for _glitter-_because its idea has become as we before observed, confounded with that of magnificence in the abstract--has led us, also, to the exaggerated employment of mirrors. we line our dwellings with great british plates, and then imagine we have done a fine thing. now the slightest thought will be sufficient to convince any one who has an eye at all, of the ill effect of numerous looking-glasses, and especially of large ones. regarded apart from its reflection, the mirror presents a continuous, flat, colourless, unrelieved surface,--a thing always and obviously unpleasant. considered as a reflector, it is potent in producing a monstrous and odious uniformity: and the evil is here aggravated, not in merely direct proportion with the augmentation of its sources, but in a ratio constantly increasing. in fact, a room with four or five mirrors arranged at random, is, for all purposes of artistic show, a room of no shape at all. if we add to this evil, the attendant glitter upon glitter, we have a perfect farrago of discordant and displeasing effects. the veriest bumpkin, on entering an apartment so bedizzened, would be instantly aware of something wrong, although he might be altogether unable to assign a cause for his dissatisfaction. but let the same person be led into a room tastefully furnished, and he would be startled into an exclamation of pleasure and surprise. it is an evil growing out of our republican institutions, that here a man of large purse has usually a very little soul which he keeps in it. the corruption of taste is a portion or a pendant of the dollar-manufacture. as we grow rich, our ideas grow rusty. it is, therefore, not among _our _aristocracy that we must look (if at all, in appallachia), for the spirituality of a british _boudoir. _but we have seen apartments in the tenure of americans of moderns [possibly “modest” or “moderate”] means, which, in negative merit at least, might vie with any of the _or-molu’d _cabinets of our friends across the water. even _now_, there is present to our mind’s eye a small and not, ostentatious chamber with whose decorations no fault can be found. the proprietor lies asleep on a sofa--the weather is cool--the time is near midnight: we will make a sketch of the room during his slumber. it is oblong--some thirty feet in length and twenty-five in breadth--a shape affording the best(ordinary) opportunities for the adjustment of furniture. it has but one door--by no means a wide one--which is at one end of the parallelogram, and but two windows, which are at the other. these latter are large, reaching down to the floor--have deep recesses--and open on an italian _veranda. _their panes are of a crimson-tinted glass, set in rose-wood framings, more massive than usual. they are curtained within the recess, by a thick silver tissue adapted to the shape of the window, and hanging loosely in small volumes. without the recess are curtains of an exceedingly rich crimson silk, fringed with a deep network of gold, and lined with silver tissue, which is the material of the exterior blind. there are no cornices; but the folds of the whole fabric (which are sharp rather than massive, and have an airy appearance), issue from beneath a broad entablature of rich giltwork, which encircles the room at the junction of the ceiling and walls. the drapery is thrown open also, or closed, by means of a thick rope of gold loosely enveloping it, and resolving itself readily into a knot; no pins or other such devices are apparent. the colours of the curtains and their fringe--the tints of crimson and gold--appear everywhere in profusion, and determine the _character _of the room. the carpet--of saxony material--is quite half an inch thick, and is of the same crimson ground, relieved simply by the appearance of a gold cord (like that festooning the curtains) slightly relieved above the surface of the _ground, _and thrown upon it in such a manner as to form a succession of short irregular curves--one occasionally overlaying the other. the walls are prepared with a glossy paper of a silver gray tint, spotted with small arabesque devices of a fainter hue of the prevalent crimson. many paintings relieve the expanse of paper. these are chiefly landscapes of an imaginative cast--such as the fairy grottoes of stanfield, or the lake of the dismal swamp of chapman. there are, nevertheless, three or four female heads, of an ethereal beauty-portraits in the manner of sully. the tone of each picture is warm, but dark. there are no “brilliant effects.” _repose _speaks in all. not one is of small size. diminutive paintings give that _spotty _look to a room, which is the blemish of so many a fine work of art overtouched. the frames are broad but not deep, and richly carved, without being _dulled _or filagreed. they have the whole lustre of burnished gold. they lie flat on the walls, and do not hang off with cords. the designs themselves are often seen to better advantage in this latter position, but the general appearance of the chamber is injured. but one mirror--and this not a very large one--is visible. in shape it is nearly circular--and it is hung so that a reflection of the person can be obtained from it in none of the ordinary sitting-places of the room. two large low sofas of rosewood and crimson silk, gold-flowered, form the only seats, with the exception of two light conversation chairs, also of rose-wood. there is a pianoforte (rose-wood, also), without cover, and thrown open. an octagonal table, formed altogether of the richest gold-threaded marble, is placed near one of the sofas. this is also without cover--the drapery of the curtains has been thought sufficient.. four large and gorgeous sevres vases, in which bloom a profusion of sweet and vivid flowers, occupy the slightly rounded angles of the room. a tall candelabrum, bearing a small antique lamp with highly perfumed oil, is standing near the head of my sleeping friend. some light and graceful hanging shelves, with golden edges and crimson silk cords with gold tassels, sustain two or three hundred magnificently bound books. beyond these things, there is no furniture, if we except an argand lamp, with a plain crimson-tinted ground glass shade, which depends from he lofty vaulted ceiling by a single slender gold chain, and throws a tranquil but magical radiance over all. a tale of jerusalem intensos rigidarn in frontern ascendere canos passus erat---- --lucan--de catone ----a bristly bore. “let us hurry to the walls,” said abel-phittim to buzi-ben-levi and simeon the pharisee, on the tenth day of the month thammuz, in the year of the world three thousand nine hundred and forty-one--let us hasten to the ramparts adjoining the gate of benjamin, which is in the city of david, and overlooking the camp of the uncircumcised; for it is the last hour of the fourth watch, being sunrise; and the idolaters, in fulfilment of the promise of pompey, should be awaiting us with the lambs for the sacrifices.” simeon, abel-phittim, and duzi-ben-levi were the gizbarim, or sub-collectors of the offering, in the holy city of jerusalem. “verily,” replied the pharisee; “let us hasten: for this generosity in the heathen is unwonted; and fickle-mindedness has ever been an attribute of the worshippers of baal.” “‘that they are fickle-minded and treacherous is as true as the pentateuch,” said buzi-ben-levi, “but that is only toward the people of adonai. when was it ever known that the ammonites proved wanting to their own interests? methinks it is no great stretch of generosity to allow us lambs for the altar of the lord, receiving in lieu thereof thirty silver shekels per head!” “thou forgettest, however, ben-levi,” replied abel-phittim, “that the roman pompey, who is now impiously besieging the city of the most high, has no assurity that we apply not the lambs thus purchased for the altar, to the sustenance of the body, rather than of the spirit.” “now, by the five corners of my beard!” shouted the pharisee, who belonged to the sect called the dashers (that little knot of saints whose manner of _dashing _and lacerating the feet against the pavement was long a thorn and a reproach to less zealous devotees-a stumbling-block to less gifted perambulators)--“by the five corners of that beard which, as a priest, i am forbidden to shave!-have we lived to see the day when a blaspheming and idolatrous upstart of rome shall accuse us of appropriating to the appetites of the flesh the most holy and consecrated elements? have we lived to see the day when--“’ “let us not question the motives of the philistine,” interrupted abel-phittim’ “for to-day we profit for the first time by his avarice or by his generosity; but rather let us hurry to the ramparts, lest offerings should be wanting for that altar whose fire the rains of heaven can not extinguish, and whose pillars of smoke no tempest can turn aside.” that part of the city to which our worthy gizbarim now hastened, and which bore the name of its architect, king david, was esteemed the most strongly fortified district of jerusalem; being situated upon the steep and lofty hill of zion. here, a broad, deep, circumvallatory trench, hewn from the solid rock, was defended by a wall of great strength erected upon its inner edge. this wall was adorned, at regular interspaces, by square towers of white marble; the lowest sixty, and the highest one hundred and twenty cubits in height. but, in the vicinity of the gate of benjamin, the wall arose by no means from the margin of the fosse. on the contrary, between the level of the ditch and the basement of the rampart sprang up a perpendicular cliff of two hundred and fifty cubits, forming part of the precipitous mount moriah. so that when simeon and his associates arrived on the summit of the tower called adoni-bezek-the loftiest of all the turrets around about jerusalem, and the usual place of conference with the besieging army-they looked down upon the camp of the enemy from an eminence excelling by many feet that of the pyramid of cheops, and, by several, that of the temple of belus. “verily,” sighed the pharisee, as he peered dizzily over the precipice, “the uncircumcised are as the sands by the seashore-as the locusts in the wilderness! the valley of the king hath become the valley of adommin.” “and yet,” added ben-levi, “thou canst not point me out a philistine-no, not one-from aleph to tau-from the wilderness to the battlements--who seemeth any bigger than the letter jod!” “lower away the basket with the shekels of silver!” here shouted a roman soldier in a hoarse, rough voice, which appeared to issue from the regions of pluto--“lower away the basket with the accursed coin which it has broken the jaw of a noble roman to pronounce! is it thus you evince your gratitude to our master pompeius, who, in his condescension, has thought fit to listen to your idolatrous importunities? the god phoebus, who is a true god, has been charioted for an hour-and were you not to be on the ramparts by sunrise? aedepol! do you think that we, the conquerors of the world, have nothing better to do than stand waiting by the walls of every kennel, to traffic with the dogs of the earth? lower away! i say--and see that your trumpery be bright in color and just in weight!” “el elohim!” ejaculated the pharisee, as the discordant tones of the centurion rattled up the crags of the precipice, and fainted away against the temple--“el elohim!--who is the god phoebus?--whom doth the blasphemer invoke? thou, buzi-ben-levi! who art read in the laws of the gentiles,

to hang on the projection of yonder crag, there will be a woful outpouring of the holy things of the sanctuary.” by the assistance of some rudely constructed machinery, the heavily laden basket was now carefully lowered down among the multitude; and, from the giddy pinnacle, the romans were seen gathering confusedly round it; but owing to the vast height and the prevalence of a fog, no distinct view of their operations could be obtained. half an hour had already elapsed. “we shall be too late!” sighed the pharisee, as at the expiration of this period he looked over into the abyss-“we shall be too late! we shall be turned out of office by the katholim.” “no more,” responded abel-phittim---“no more shall we feast upon the fat of the land-no longer shall our beards be odorous with frankincense--our loins girded up with fine linen from the temple.” “racal” swore ben-levi, “racal do they mean to defraud us of the purchase money? or, holy moses! are they weighing the shekels of the tabernacle?” “they have given the signal at last!” cried the pharisee-----“they have given the signal at last! pull away, abel-phittim!--and thou, buzi-ben-levi, pull away!--for verily the philistines have either still hold upon the basket, or the lord hath softened their hearts to place therein a beast of good weight!” and the gizbarim pulled away, while their burden swung heavily upward through the still increasing mist. “booshoh he!”--as, at the conclusion of an hour, some object at the extremity of the rope became indistinctly visible--“booshoh he!” was the exclamation which burst from the lips of ben-levi. ***** “booshoh he!--for shame!--it is a ram from the thickets of engedi, and as rugged as the valley of jehosaphat!” “it is a firstling of the flock,” said abel-phittim, “i know him by the bleating of his lips, and the innocent folding of his limbs. his eyes are more beautiful than the jewels of the pectoral, and his flesh is like the honey of hebron.” “it is a fatted calf from the pastures of bashan,” said the pharisee, “the heathen have dealt wonderfully with us----let us raise up our voices in a psalm--let us give thanks on the shawm and on the psaltery-on the harp and on the huggab-on the cythern and on the sackbut!” it was not until the basket had arrived within a few feet of the gizbarim that a low grunt betrayed to their perception a hog of no common size. “now el emanu!” slowly and with upturned eyes ejaculated the trio, as, letting go their hold, the emancipated porker tumbled headlong among the philistines, “el emanu!-god be with us--it is _the unutterable flesh!”_ the sphinx during the dread reign of the cholera in new york, i had accepted the invitation of a relative to spend a fortnight with him in the retirement of his _cottage ornee_ on the banks of the hudson. we had here around us all the ordinary means of summer amusement; and what with rambling in the woods, sketching, boating, fishing, bathing, music, and books, we should have passed the time pleasantly enough, but for the fearful intelligence which reached us every morning from the populous city. not a day elapsed which did not bring us news of the decease of some acquaintance. then as the fatality increased, we learned to expect daily the loss of some friend. at length we trembled at the approach of every messenger. the very air from the south seemed to us redolent with death. that palsying thought, indeed, took entire possession of my soul. i could neither speak, think, nor dream of any thing else. my host was of a less excitable temperament, and, although greatly depressed in spirits, exerted himself to sustain my own. his richly philosophical intellect was not at any time affected by unrealities. to the substances of terror he was sufficiently alive, but of its shadows he had no apprehension. his endeavors to arouse me from the condition of abnormal gloom into which i had fallen, were frustrated, in great measure, by certain volumes which i had found in his library. these were of a character to force into germination whatever seeds of hereditary superstition lay latent in my bosom. i had been reading these books without his knowledge, and thus he was often at a loss to account for the forcible impressions which had been made upon my fancy. a favorite topic with me was the popular belief in omens--a belief which, at this one epoch of my life, i was almost seriously disposed to defend. on this subject we had long and animated discussions--he maintaining the utter groundlessness of faith in such matters,--i contending that a popular sentiment arising with absolute spontaneity- that is to say, without apparent traces of suggestion--had in itself the unmistakable elements of truth, and was entitled to as much respect as that intuition which is the idiosyncrasy of the individual man of genius. the fact is, that soon after my arrival at the cottage there had occurred to myself an incident so entirely inexplicable, and which had in it so much of the portentous character, that i might well have been excused for regarding it as an omen. it appalled, and at the same time so confounded and bewildered me, that many days elapsed before i could make up my mind to communicate the circumstances to my friend. near the close of exceedingly warm day, i was sitting, book in hand, at an open window, commanding, through a long vista of the river banks, a view of a distant hill, the face of which nearest my position had been denuded by what is termed a land-slide, of the principal portion of its trees. my thoughts had been long wandering from the volume before me to the gloom and desolation of the neighboring city. uplifting my eyes from the page, they fell upon the naked face of the bill, and upon an object--upon some living monster of hideous conformation, which very rapidly made its way from the summit to the bottom, disappearing finally in the dense forest below. as this creature first came in sight, i doubted my own sanity--or at least the evidence of my own eyes; and many minutes passed before i succeeded in convincing myself that i was neither mad nor in a dream. yet when i described the monster (which i distinctly saw, and calmly surveyed through the whole period of its progress), my readers, i fear, will feel more difficulty in being convinced of these points than even i did myself. estimating the size of the creature by comparison with the diameter of the large trees near which it passed--the few giants of the forest which had escaped the fury of the land-slide--i concluded it to be far larger than any ship of the line in existence. i say ship of the line, because the shape of the monster suggested the idea--the hull of one of our seventy-four might convey a very tolerable conception of the general outline. the mouth of the animal was situated at the extremity of a proboscis some sixty or seventy feet in length, and about as thick as the body of an ordinary elephant. near the root of this trunk was an immense quantity of black shaggy hair--more than could have been supplied by the coats of a score of buffaloes; and projecting from this hair downwardly and laterally, sprang two gleaming tusks not unlike those of the wild boar, but of infinitely greater dimensions. extending forward, parallel with the proboscis, and on each side of it, was a gigantic staff, thirty or forty feet in length, formed seemingly of pure crystal and in shape a perfect prism,--it reflected in the most gorgeous manner the rays of the declining sun. the trunk was fashioned like a wedge with the apex to the earth. from it there were outspread two pairs of wings--each wing nearly one hundred yards in length--one pair being placed above the other, and all thickly covered with metal scales; each scale apparently some ten or twelve feet in diameter. i observed that the upper and lower tiers of wings were connected by a strong chain. but the chief peculiarity of this horrible thing was the representation of a death’s head, which covered nearly the whole surface of its breast, and which was as accurately traced in glaring white, upon the dark ground of the body, as if it had been there carefully designed by an artist. while i regarded the terrific animal, and more especially the appearance on its breast, with a feeling or horror and awe--with a sentiment of forthcoming evil, which i found it impossible to quell by any effort of the reason, i perceived the huge jaws at the extremity of the proboscis suddenly expand themselves, and from them there proceeded a sound so loud and so expressive of wo, that it struck upon my nerves like a knell and as the monster disappeared at the foot of the hill, i fell at once, fainting, to the floor. upon recovering, my first impulse, of course, was to inform my friend of what i had seen and heard--and i can scarcely explain what feeling of repugnance it was which, in the end, operated to prevent me. at length, one evening, some three or four days after the occurrence, we were sitting together in the room in which i had seen the apparition--i occupying the same seat at the same window, and he lounging on a sofa near at hand. the association of the place and time impelled me to give him an account of the phenomenon. he heard me to the end--at first laughed heartily--and then lapsed into an excessively grave demeanor, as if my insanity was a thing beyond suspicion. at this instant i again had a distinct view of the monster--to which, with a shout of absolute terror, i now directed his attention. he looked eagerly--but maintained that he saw nothing--although i designated minutely the course of the creature, as it made its way down the naked face of the hill. i was now immeasurably alarmed, for i considered the vision either as an omen of my death, or, worse, as the fore-runner of an attack of mania. i threw myself passionately back in my chair, and for some moments buried my face in my hands. when i uncovered my eyes, the apparition was no longer apparent. my host, however, had in some degree resumed the calmness of his demeanor, and questioned me very rigorously in respect to the conformation of the visionary creature. when i had fully satisfied him on this head, he sighed deeply, as if relieved of some intolerable burden, and went on to talk, with what i thought a cruel calmness, of various points of speculative philosophy, which had heretofore formed subject of discussion between us. i remember his insisting very especially (among other things) upon the idea that the principle source of error in all human investigations lay in the liability of the understanding to under-rate or to over-value the importance of an object, through mere mis-admeasurement of its propinquity. “to estimate properly, for example,” he said, “the influence to be exercised on mankind at large by the thorough diffusion of democracy, the distance of the epoch at which such diffusion may possibly be accomplished should not fail to form an item in the estimate. yet can you tell me one writer on the subject of government who has ever thought this particular branch of the subject worthy of discussion at all?” he here paused for a moment, stepped to a book-case, and brought forth one of the ordinary synopses of natural history. requesting me then to exchange seats with him, that he might the better distinguish the fine print of the volume, he took my armchair at the window, and, opening the book, resumed his discourse very much in the same tone as before. “but for your exceeding minuteness,” he said, “in describing the monster, i might never have had it in my power to demonstrate to you what it was. in the first place, let me read to you a schoolboy account of the genus sphinx, of the family crepuscularia of the order lepidoptera, of the class of insecta--or insects. the account runs thus: “‘four membranous wings covered with little colored scales of metallic appearance; mouth forming a rolled proboscis, produced by an elongation of the jaws, upon the sides of which are found the rudiments of mandibles and downy palpi; the inferior wings retained to the superior by a stiff hair; antennae in the form of an elongated club, prismatic; abdomen pointed, the death’s--headed sphinx has occasioned much terror among the vulgar, at times, by the melancholy kind of cry which it utters, and the insignia of death which it wears upon its corslet.’” he here closed the book and leaned forward in the chair, placing himself accurately in the position which i had occupied at the moment of beholding “the monster.” “ah, here it is,” he presently exclaimed--“it is reascending the face of the hill, and a very remarkable looking creature i admit it to be. still, it is by no means so large or so distant as you imagined it,--for the fact is that, as it wriggles its way up this thread, which some spider has wrought along the window-sash, i find it to be about the sixteenth of an inch in its extreme length, and also about the sixteenth of an inch distant from the pupil of my eye.” hop-frog i never knew anyone so keenly alive to a joke as the king was. he seemed to live only for joking. to tell a good story of the joke kind, and to tell it well, was the surest road to his favor. thus it happened that his seven ministers were all noted for their accomplishments as jokers. they all took after the king, too, in being large, corpulent, oily men, as well as inimitable jokers. whether people grow fat by joking, or whether there is something in fat itself which predisposes to a joke, i have never been quite able to determine; but certain it is that a lean joker is a rara avis in terris. about the refinements, or, as he called them, the ‘ghost’ of wit, the king troubled himself very little. he had an especial admiration for breadth in a jest, and would often put up with length, for the sake of it. over-niceties wearied him. he would have preferred rabelais’ ‘gargantua’ to the ‘zadig’ of voltaire: and, upon the whole, practical jokes suited his taste far better than verbal ones. at the date of my narrative, professing jesters had not altogether gone out of fashion at court. several of the great continental ‘powers’ still retain their ‘fools,’ who wore motley, with caps and bells, and who were expected to be always ready with sharp witticisms, at a moment’s notice, in consideration of the crumbs that fell from the royal table. our king, as a matter of course, retained his ‘fool.’ the fact is, he required something in the way of folly--if only to counterbalance the heavy wisdom of the seven wise men who were his ministers--not to mention himself. his fool, or professional jester, was not only a fool, however. his value was trebled in the eyes of the king, by the fact of his being also a dwarf and a cripple. dwarfs were as common at court, in those days, as fools; and many monarchs would have found it difficult to get through their days (days are rather longer at court than elsewhere) without both a jester to laugh with, and a dwarf to laugh at. but, as i have already observed, your jesters, in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred, are fat, round, and unwieldy--so that it was no small source of self-gratulation with our king that, in hop-frog (this was the fool’s name), he possessed a triplicate treasure in one person. i believe the name ‘hop-frog’ was not that given to the dwarf by his sponsors at baptism, but it was conferred upon him, by general consent of the several ministers, on account of his inability to walk as other men do. in fact, hop-frog could only get along by a sort of interjectional gait--something between a leap and a wriggle--a movement that afforded illimitable amusement, and of course consolation, to the king, for (notwithstanding the protuberance of his stomach and a constitutional swelling of the head) the king, by his whole court, was accounted a capital figure. but although hop-frog, through the distortion of his legs, could move only with great pain and difficulty along a road or floor, the prodigious muscular power which nature seemed to have bestowed upon his arms, by way of compensation for deficiency in the lower limbs, enabled him to perform many feats of wonderful dexterity, where trees or ropes were in question, or any thing else to climb. at such exercises he certainly much more resembled a squirrel, or a small monkey, than a frog. i am not able to say, with precision, from what country hop-frog originally came. it was from some barbarous region, however, that no person ever heard of--a vast distance from the court of our king. hop-frog, and a young girl very little less dwarfish than himself (although of exquisite proportions, and a marvellous dancer), had been forcibly carried off from their respective homes in adjoining provinces, and sent as presents to the king, by one of his ever-victorious generals. under these circumstances, it is not to be wondered at that a close intimacy arose between the two little captives. indeed, they soon became sworn friends. hop-frog, who, although he made a great deal of sport, was by no means popular, had it not in his power to render trippetta many services; but she, on account of her grace and exquisite beauty (although a dwarf), was universally admired and petted; so she possessed much influence; and never failed to use it, whenever she could, for the benefit of hop-frog. on some grand state occasion--i forgot what--the king determined to have a masquerade, and whenever a masquerade or any thing of that kind, occurred at our court, then the talents, both of hop-frog and trippetta were sure to be called into play. hop-frog, in especial, was so inventive in the way of getting up pageants, suggesting novel characters, and arranging costumes, for masked balls, that nothing could be done, it seems, without his assistance. the night appointed for the fete had arrived. a gorgeous hall had been fitted up, under trippetta’s eye, with every kind of device which could possibly give eclat to a masquerade. the whole court was in a fever of expectation. as for costumes and characters, it might well be supposed that everybody had come to a decision on such points. many had made up their minds (as to what roles they should assume) a week, or even a month, in advance; and, in fact, there was not a particle of indecision anywhere--except in the case of the king and his seven minsters. why they hesitated i never could tell, unless they did it by way of a joke. more probably, they found it difficult, on account of being so fat, to make up their minds. at all events, time flew; and, as a last resort they sent for trippetta and hop-frog. when the two little friends obeyed the summons of the king they found him sitting at his wine with the seven members of his cabinet council; but the monarch appeared to be in a very ill humor. he knew that hop-frog was not fond of wine, for it excited the poor cripple almost to madness; and madness is no comfortable feeling. but the king loved his practical jokes, and took pleasure in forcing hop-frog to drink and (as the king called it) ‘to be merry.’ “come here, hop-frog,” said he, as the jester and his friend entered the room; “swallow this bumper to the health of your absent friends, [here hop-frog sighed,] and then let us have the benefit of your invention. we want characters--characters, man--something novel--out of the way. we are wearied with this everlasting sameness. come, drink! the wine will brighten your wits.” hop-frog endeavored, as usual, to get up a jest in reply to these advances from the king; but the effort was too much. it happened to be the poor dwarf’s birthday, and the command to drink to his ‘absent friends’ forced the tears to his eyes. many large, bitter drops fell into the goblet as he took it, humbly, from the hand of the tyrant. “ah! ha! ha!” roared the latter, as the dwarf reluctantly drained the beaker.--“see what a glass of good wine can do! why, your eyes are shining already!” poor fellow! his large eyes gleamed, rather than shone; for the effect of wine on his excitable brain was not more powerful than instantaneous. he placed the goblet nervously on the table, and looked round upon the company with a half--insane stare. they all seemed highly amused at the success of the king’s ‘joke.’ “and now to business,” said the prime minister, a very fat man. “yes,” said the king; “come lend us your assistance. characters, my fine fellow; we stand in need of characters--all of us--ha! ha! ha!” and as this was seriously meant for a joke, his laugh was chorused by the seven. hop-frog also laughed although feebly and somewhat vacantly. “come, come,” said the king, impatiently, “have you nothing to suggest?” “i am endeavoring to think of something novel,” replied the dwarf, abstractedly, for he was quite bewildered by the wine. “endeavoring!” cried the tyrant, fiercely; “what do you mean by that? ah, i perceive. you are sulky, and want more wine. here, drink this!” and he poured out another goblet full and offered it to the cripple, who merely gazed at it, gasping for breath. “drink, i say!” shouted the monster, “or by the fiends-” the dwarf hesitated. the king grew purple with rage. the courtiers smirked. trippetta, pale as a corpse, advanced to the monarch’s seat, and, falling on her knees before him, implored him to spare her friend. the tyrant regarded her, for some moments, in evident wonder at her audacity. he seemed quite at a loss what to do or say--how most becomingly to express his indignation. at last, without uttering a syllable, he pushed her violently from him, and threw the contents of the brimming goblet in her face. the poor girl got up the best she could, and, not daring even to sigh, resumed her position at the foot of the table. there was a dead silence for about half a minute, during which the falling of a leaf, or of a feather, might have been heard. it was interrupted by a low, but harsh and protracted grating sound which seemed to come at once from every corner of the room. “what--what--what are you making that noise for?” demanded the king, turning furiously to the dwarf. the latter seemed to have recovered, in great measure, from his intoxication, and looking fixedly but quietly into the tyrant’s face, merely ejaculated: “i--i? how could it have been me?” “the sound appeared to come from without,” observed one of the courtiers. “i fancy it was the parrot at the window, whetting his bill upon his cage-wires.” “true,” replied the monarch, as if much relieved by the suggestion; “but, on the honor of a knight, i could have sworn that it was the gritting of this vagabond’s teeth.” hereupon the dwarf laughed (the king was too confirmed a joker to object to any one’s laughing), and displayed a set of large, powerful, and very repulsive teeth. moreover, he avowed his perfect willingness to swallow as much wine as desired. the monarch was pacified; and having drained another bumper with no very perceptible ill effect, hop-frog entered at once, and with spirit, into the plans for the masquerade. “i cannot tell what was the association of idea,” observed he, very tranquilly, and as if he had never tasted wine in his life, “but just after your majesty, had struck the girl and thrown the wine in her face--just after your majesty had done this, and while the parrot was making that odd noise outside the window, there came into my mind a capital diversion--one of my own country frolics--often enacted among us, at our masquerades: but here it will be new altogether. unfortunately, however, it requires a company of eight persons and-” “here we are!” cried the king, laughing at his acute discovery of the coincidence; “eight to a fraction--i and my seven ministers. come! what is the diversion?” “we call it,” replied the cripple, “the eight chained ourang-outangs, and it really is excellent sport if well enacted.” “we will enact it,” remarked the king, drawing himself up, and lowering his eyelids. “the beauty of the game,” continued hop-frog, “lies in the fright it occasions among the women.” “capital!” roared in chorus the monarch and his ministry. “i will equip you as ourang-outangs,” proceeded the dwarf; “leave all that to me. the resemblance shall be so striking, that the company of masqueraders will take you for real beasts--and of course, they will be as much terrified as astonished.” “oh, this is exquisite!” exclaimed the king. “hop-frog! i will make a man of you.” “the chains are for the purpose of increasing the confusion by their jangling. you are supposed to have escaped, en masse, from your keepers. your majesty cannot conceive the effect produced, at a masquerade, by eight chained ourang-outangs, imagined to be real ones by most of the company; and rushing in with savage cries, among the crowd of delicately and gorgeously habited men and women. the contrast is inimitable!” “it must be,” said the king: and the council arose hurriedly (as it was growing late), to put in execution the scheme of hop-frog. his mode of equipping the party as ourang-outangs was very simple, but effective enough for his purposes. the animals in question had, at the epoch of my story, very rarely been seen in any part of the civilized world; and as the imitations made by the dwarf were sufficiently beast-like and more than sufficiently hideous, their truthfulness to nature was thus thought to be secured. the king and his ministers were first encased in tight-fitting stockinet shirts and drawers. they were then saturated with tar. at this stage of the process, some one of the party suggested feathers; but the suggestion was at once overruled by the dwarf, who soon convinced the eight, by ocular demonstration, that the hair of such a brute as the ourang-outang was much more efficiently represented by flu. a thick coating of the latter was accordingly plastered upon the coating of tar. a long chain was now procured. first, it was passed about the waist of the king, and tied, then about another of the party, and also tied; then about all successively, in the same manner. when this chaining arrangement was complete, and the party stood as far apart from each other as possible, they formed a circle; and to make all things appear natural, hop-frog passed the residue of the chain in two diameters, at right angles, across the circle, after the fashion adopted, at the present day, by those who capture chimpanzees, or other large apes, in borneo. the grand saloon in which the masquerade was to take place, was a circular room, very lofty, and receiving the light of the sun only through a single window at top. at night (the season for which the apartment was especially designed) it was illuminated principally by a large chandelier, depending by a chain from the centre of the sky-light, and lowered, or elevated, by means of a counter-balance as usual; but (in order not to look unsightly) this latter passed outside the cupola and over the roof. the arrangements of the room had been left to trippetta’s superintendence; but, in some particulars, it seems, she had been guided by the calmer judgment of her friend the dwarf. at his suggestion it was that, on this occasion, the chandelier was removed. its waxen drippings (which, in weather so warm, it was quite impossible to prevent) would have been seriously detrimental to the rich dresses of the guests, who, on account of the crowded state of the saloon, could not all be expected to keep from out its centre; that is to say, from under the chandelier. additional sconces were set in various parts of the hall, out of the war, and a flambeau, emitting sweet odor, was placed in the right hand of each of the caryaides [caryatides] that stood against the wall--some fifty or sixty altogether. the eight ourang-outangs, taking hop-frog’s advice, waited patiently until midnight (when the room was thoroughly filled with masqueraders) before making their appearance. no sooner had the clock ceased striking, however, than they rushed, or rather rolled in, all together--for the impediments of their chains caused most of the party to fall, and all to stumble as they entered. the excitement among the masqueraders was prodigious, and filled the heart of the king with glee. as had been anticipated, there were not a few of the guests who supposed the ferocious-looking creatures to be beasts of some kind in reality, if not precisely ourang-outangs. many of the women swooned with affright; and had not the king taken the precaution to exclude all weapons from the saloon, his party might soon have expiated their frolic in their blood. as it was, a general rush was made for the doors; but the king had ordered them to be locked immediately upon his entrance; and, at the dwarf’s suggestion, the keys had been deposited with him. while the tumult was at its height, and each masquerader attentive only to his own safety (for, in fact, there was much real danger from the pressure of the excited crowd), the chain by which the chandelier ordinarily hung, and which had been drawn up on its removal, might have been seen very gradually to descend, until its hooked extremity came within three feet of the floor. soon after this, the king and his seven friends having reeled about the hall in all directions, found themselves, at length, in its centre, and, of course, in immediate contact with the chain. while they were thus situated, the dwarf, who had followed noiselessly at their heels, inciting them to keep up the commotion, took hold of their own chain at the intersection of the two portions which crossed the circle diametrically and at right angles. here, with the rapidity of thought, he inserted the hook from which the chandelier had been wont to depend; and, in an instant, by some unseen agency, the chandelier-chain was drawn so far upward as to take the hook out of reach, and, as an inevitable consequence, to drag the ourang-outangs together in close connection, and face to face. the masqueraders, by this time, had recovered, in some measure, from their alarm; and, beginning to regard the whole matter as a well-contrived pleasantry, set up a loud shout of laughter at the predicament of the apes. “leave them to me!” now screamed hop-frog, his shrill voice making itself easily heard through all the din. “leave them to me. i fancy i know them. if i can only get a good look at them, i can soon tell who they are.” here, scrambling over the heads of the crowd, he managed to get to the wall; when, seizing a flambeau from one of the caryatides, he returned, as he went, to the centre of the room-leaping, with the agility of a monkey, upon the kings head, and thence clambered a few feet up the chain; holding down the torch to examine the group of ourang-outangs, and still screaming: “i shall soon find out who they are!” and now, while the whole assembly (the apes included) were convulsed with laughter, the jester suddenly uttered a shrill whistle; when the chain flew violently up for about thirty feet--dragging with it the dismayed and struggling ourang-outangs, and leaving them suspended in mid-air between the sky-light and the floor. hop-frog, clinging to the chain as it rose, still maintained his relative position in respect to the eight maskers, and still (as if nothing were the matter) continued to thrust his torch down toward them, as though endeavoring to discover who they were. so thoroughly astonished was the whole company at this ascent, that a dead silence, of about a minute’s duration, ensued. it was broken by just such a low, harsh, grating sound, as had before attracted the attention of the king and his councillors when the former threw the wine in the face of trippetta. but, on the present occasion, there could be no question as to whence the sound issued. it came from the fang--like teeth of the dwarf, who ground them and gnashed them as he foamed at the mouth, and glared, with an expression of maniacal rage, into the upturned countenances of the king and his seven companions. “ah, ha!” said at length the infuriated jester. “ah, ha! i begin to see who these people are now!” here, pretending to scrutinize the king more closely, he held the flambeau to the flaxen coat which enveloped him, and which instantly burst into a sheet of vivid flame. in less than half a minute the whole eight ourang-outangs were blazing fiercely, amid the shrieks of the multitude who gazed at them from below, horror-stricken, and without the power to render them the slightest assistance. at length the flames, suddenly increasing in virulence, forced the jester to climb higher up the chain, to be out of their reach; and, as he made this movement, the crowd again sank, for a brief instant, into silence. the dwarf seized his opportunity, and once more spoke: “i now see distinctly.” he said, “what manner of people these maskers are. they are a great king and his seven privy-councillors,--a king who does not scruple to strike a defenceless girl and his seven councillors who abet him in the outrage. as for myself, i am simply hop-frog, the jester--and this is my last jest.” owing to the high combustibility of both the flax and the tar to which it adhered, the dwarf had scarcely made an end of his brief speech before the work of vengeance was complete. the eight corpses swung in their chains, a fetid, blackened, hideous, and indistinguishable mass. the cripple hurled his torch at them, clambered leisurely to the ceiling, and disappeared through the sky-light. it is supposed that trippetta, stationed on the roof of the saloon, had been the accomplice of her friend in his fiery revenge, and that, together, they effected their escape to their own country: for neither was seen again. the man of the crowd. ce grand malheur, de ne pouvoir être seul. _la bruyère_. it was well said of a certain german book that “_er lasst sich nicht lesen_”--it does not permit itself to be read. there are some secrets which do not permit themselves to be told. men die nightly in their beds, wringing the hands of ghostly confessors and looking them piteously in the eyes--die with despair of heart and convulsion of throat, on account of the hideousness of mysteries which will not suffer themselves to be revealed. now and then, alas, the conscience of man takes up a burthen so heavy in horror that it can be thrown down only into the grave. and thus the essence of all crime is undivulged. not long ago, about the closing in of an evening in autumn, i sat at the large bow window of the d----- coffee-house in london. for some months i had been ill in health, but was now convalescent, and, with returning strength, found myself in one of those happy moods which are so precisely the converse of ennui--moods of the keenest appetency, when the film from the mental vision departs--the [greek phrase]--and the intellect, electrified, surpasses as greatly its every-day condition, as does the vivid yet candid reason of leibnitz, the mad and flimsy rhetoric of gorgias. merely to breathe was enjoyment; and i derived positive pleasure even from many of the legitimate sources of pain. i felt a calm but inquisitive interest in every thing. with a cigar in my mouth and a newspaper in my lap, i had been amusing myself for the greater part of the afternoon, now in poring over advertisements, now in observing the promiscuous company in the room, and now in peering through the smoky panes into the street. this latter is one of the principal thoroughfares of the city, and had been very much crowded during the whole day. but, as the darkness came on, the throng momently increased; and, by the time the lamps were well lighted, two dense and continuous tides of population were rushing past the door. at this particular period of the evening i had never before been in a similar situation, and the tumultuous sea of human heads filled me, therefore, with a delicious novelty of emotion. i gave up, at length, all care of things within the hotel, and became absorbed in contemplation of the scene without. at first my observations took an abstract and generalizing turn. i looked at the passengers in masses, and thought of them in their aggregate relations. soon, however, i descended to details, and regarded with minute interest the innumerable varieties of figure, dress, air, gait, visage, and expression of countenance. by far the greater number of those who went by had a satisfied business-like demeanor, and seemed to be thinking only of making their way through the press. their brows were knit, and their eyes rolled quickly; when pushed against by fellow-wayfarers they evinced no symptom of impatience, but adjusted their clothes and hurried on. others, still a numerous class, were restless in their movements, had flushed faces, and talked and gesticulated to themselves, as if feeling in solitude on account of the very denseness of the company around. when impeded in their progress, these people suddenly ceased muttering, but re-doubled their gesticulations, and awaited, with an absent and overdone smile upon the lips, the course of the persons impeding them. if jostled, they bowed profusely to the jostlers, and appeared overwhelmed with confusion.--there was nothing very distinctive about these two large classes beyond what i have noted. their habiliments belonged to that order which is pointedly termed the decent. they were undoubtedly noblemen, merchants, attorneys, tradesmen, stock-jobbers--the eupatrids and the common-places of society--men of leisure and men actively engaged in affairs of their own--conducting business upon their own responsibility. they did not greatly excite my attention. the tribe of clerks was an obvious one and here i discerned two remarkable divisions. there were the junior clerks of flash houses--young gentlemen with tight coats, bright boots, well-oiled hair, and supercilious lips. setting aside a certain dapperness of carriage, which may be termed deskism for want of a better word, the manner of these persons seemed to me an exact fac-simile of what had been the perfection of bon ton about twelve or eighteen months before. they wore the cast-off graces of the gentry;--and this, i believe, involves the best definition of the class. the division of the upper clerks of staunch firms, or of the “steady old fellows,” it was not possible to mistake. these were known by their coats and pantaloons of black or brown, made to sit comfortably, with white cravats and waistcoats, broad solid-looking shoes, and thick hose or gaiters.--they had all slightly bald heads, from which the right ears, long used to pen-holding, had an odd habit of standing off on end. i observed that they always removed or settled their hats with both hands, and wore watches, with short gold chains of a substantial and ancient pattern. theirs was the affectation of respectability;--if indeed there be an affectation so honorable. there were many individuals of dashing appearance, whom i easily understood as belonging to the race of swell pick-pockets with which all great cities are infested. i watched these gentry with much inquisitiveness, and found it difficult to imagine how they should ever be mistaken for gentlemen by gentlemen themselves. their voluminousness of wristband, with an air of excessive frankness, should betray them at once. the gamblers, of whom i descried not a few, were still more easily recognisable. they wore every variety of dress, from that of the desperate thimble-rig bully, with velvet waistcoat, fancy neckerchief, gilt chains, and filagreed buttons, to that of the scrupulously inornate clergyman, than which nothing could be less liable to suspicion. still all were distinguished by a certain sodden swarthiness of complexion, a filmy dimness of eye, and pallor and compression of lip. there were two other traits, moreover, by which i could always detect them;--a guarded lowness of tone in conversation, and a more than ordinary extension of the thumb in a direction at right angles with the fingers.--very often, in company with these sharpers, i observed an order of men somewhat different in habits, but still birds of a kindred feather. they may be defined as the gentlemen who live by their wits. they seem to prey upon the public in two battalions--that of the dandies and that of the military men. of the first grade the leading features are long locks and smiles; of the second frogged coats and frowns. descending in the scale of what is termed gentility, i found darker and deeper themes for speculation. i saw jew pedlars, with hawk eyes flashing from countenances whose every other feature wore only an expression of abject humility; sturdy professional street beggars scowling upon mendicants of a better stamp, whom despair alone had driven forth into the night for charity; feeble and ghastly invalids, upon whom death had placed a sure hand, and who sidled and tottered through the mob, looking every one beseechingly in the face, as if in search of some chance consolation, some lost hope; modest young girls returning from long and late labor to a cheerless home, and shrinking more tearfully than indignantly from the glances of ruffians, whose direct contact, even, could not be avoided; women of the town of all kinds and of all ages--the unequivocal beauty in the prime of her womanhood, putting one in mind of the statue in lucian, with the surface of parian marble, and the interior filled with filth--the loathsome and utterly lost leper in rags--the wrinkled, bejewelled and paint-begrimed beldame, making a last effort at youth--the mere child of immature form, yet, from long association, an adept in the dreadful coquetries of her trade, and burning with a rabid ambition to be ranked the equal of her elders in vice; drunkards innumerable and indescribable--some in shreds and patches, reeling, inarticulate, with bruised visage and lack-lustre eyes--some in whole although filthy garments, with a slightly unsteady swagger, thick sensual lips, and hearty-looking rubicund faces--others clothed in materials which had once been good, and which even now were scrupulously well brushed--men who walked with a more than naturally firm and springy step, but whose countenances were fearfully pale, whose eyes hideously wild and red, and who clutched with quivering fingers, as they strode through the crowd, at every object which came within their reach; beside these, pie-men, porters, coal--heavers, sweeps; organ-grinders, monkey-exhibiters and ballad mongers, those who vended with those who sang; ragged artizans and exhausted laborers of every description, and all full of a noisy and inordinate vivacity which jarred discordantly upon the ear, and gave an aching sensation to the eye. as the night deepened, so deepened to me the interest of the scene; for not only did the general character of the crowd materially alter (its gentler features retiring in the gradual withdrawal of the more orderly portion of the people, and its harsher ones coming out into bolder relief, as the late hour brought forth every species of infamy from its den,) but the rays of the gas-lamps, feeble at first in their struggle with the dying day, had now at length gained ascendancy, and threw over every thing a fitful and garish lustre. all was dark yet splendid--as that ebony to which has been likened the style of tertullian. the wild effects of the light enchained me to an examination of individual faces; and although the rapidity with which the world of light flitted before the window, prevented me from casting more than a glance upon each visage, still it seemed that, in my then peculiar mental state, i could frequently read, even in that brief interval of a glance, the history of long years. with my brow to the glass, i was thus occupied in scrutinizing the mob, when suddenly there came into view a countenance (that of a decrepid old man, some sixty-five or seventy years of age,)--a countenance which at once arrested and absorbed my whole attention, on account of the absolute idiosyncrasy of its expression. any thing even remotely resembling that expression i had never seen before. i well remember that my first thought, upon beholding it, was that retzch, had he viewed it, would have greatly preferred it to his own pictural incarnations of the fiend. as i endeavored, during the brief minute of my original survey, to form some analysis of the meaning conveyed, there arose confusedly and paradoxically within my mind, the ideas of vast mental power, of caution, of penuriousness, of avarice, of coolness, of malice, of blood thirstiness, of triumph, of merriment, of excessive terror, of intense--of supreme despair. i felt singularly aroused, startled, fascinated. “how wild a history,” i said to myself, “is written within that bosom!” then came a craving desire to keep the man in view--to know more of him. hurriedly putting on an overcoat, and seizing my hat and cane, i made my way into the street, and pushed through the crowd in the direction which i had seen him take; for he had already disappeared. with some little difficulty i at length came within sight of him, approached, and followed him closely, yet cautiously, so as not to attract his attention. i had now a good opportunity of examining his person. he was short in stature, very thin, and apparently very feeble. his clothes, generally, were filthy and ragged; but as he came, now and then, within the strong glare of a lamp, i perceived that his linen, although dirty, was of beautiful texture; and my vision deceived me, or, through a rent in a closely-buttoned and evidently second-handed roquelaire which enveloped him, i caught a glimpse both of a diamond and of a dagger. these observations heightened my curiosity, and i resolved to follow the stranger whithersoever he should go. it was now fully night-fall, and a thick humid fog hung over the city, soon ending in a settled and heavy rain. this change of weather had an odd effect upon the crowd, the whole of which was at once put into new commotion, and overshadowed by a world of umbrellas. the waver, the jostle, and the hum increased in a tenfold degree. for my own part i did not much regard the rain--the lurking of an old fever in my system rendering the moisture somewhat too dangerously pleasant. tying a handkerchief about my mouth, i kept on. for half an hour the old man held his way with difficulty along the great thoroughfare; and i here walked close at his elbow through fear of losing sight of him. never once turning his head to look back, he did not observe me. by and bye he passed into a cross street, which, although densely filled with people, was not quite so much thronged as the main one he had quitted. here a change in his demeanor became evident. he walked more slowly and with less object than before--more hesitatingly. he crossed and re-crossed the way repeatedly without apparent aim; and the press was still so thick that, at every such movement, i was obliged to follow him closely. the street was a narrow and long one, and his course lay within it for nearly an hour, during which the passengers had gradually diminished to about that number which is ordinarily seen at noon in broadway near the park--so vast a difference is there between a london populace and that of the most frequented american city. a second turn brought us into a square, brilliantly lighted, and overflowing with life. the old manner of the stranger re-appeared. his chin fell upon his breast, while his eyes rolled wildly from under his knit brows, in every direction, upon those who hemmed him in. he urged his way steadily and perseveringly. i was surprised, however, to find, upon his having made the circuit of the square, that he turned and retraced his steps. still more was i astonished to see him repeat the same walk several times--once nearly detecting me as he came round with a sudden movement. in this exercise he spent another hour, at the end of which we met with far less interruption from passengers than at first. the rain fell fast; the air grew cool; and the people were retiring to their homes. with a gesture of impatience, the wanderer passed into a bye-street comparatively deserted. down this, some quarter of a mile long, he rushed with an activity i could not have dreamed of seeing in one so aged, and which put me to much trouble in pursuit. a few minutes brought us to a large and busy bazaar, with the localities of which the stranger appeared well acquainted, and where his original demeanor again became apparent, as he forced his way to and fro, without aim, among the host of buyers and sellers. during the hour and a half, or thereabouts, which we passed in this place, it required much caution on my part to keep him within reach without attracting his observation. luckily i wore a pair of caoutchouc over-shoes, and could move about in perfect silence. at no moment did he see that i watched him. he entered shop after shop, priced nothing, spoke no word, and looked at all objects with a wild and vacant stare. i was now utterly amazed at his behavior, and firmly resolved that we should not part until i had satisfied myself in some measure respecting him. a loud-toned clock struck eleven, and the company were fast deserting the bazaar. a shop-keeper, in putting up a shutter, jostled the old man, and at the instant i saw a strong shudder come over his frame. he hurried into the street, looked anxiously around him for an instant, and then ran with incredible swiftness through many crooked and people-less lanes, until we emerged once more upon the great thoroughfare whence we had started--the street of the d---- hotel. it no longer wore, however, the same aspect. it was still brilliant with gas; but the rain fell fiercely, and there were few persons to be seen. the stranger grew pale. he walked moodily some paces up the once populous avenue, then, with a heavy sigh, turned in the direction of the river, and, plunging through a great variety of devious ways, came out, at length, in view of one of the principal theatres. it was about being closed, and the audience were thronging from the doors. i saw the old man gasp as if for breath while he threw himself amid the crowd; but i thought that the intense agony of his countenance had, in some measure, abated. his head again fell upon his breast; he appeared as i had seen him at first. i observed that he now took the course in which had gone the greater number of the audience--but, upon the whole, i was at a loss to comprehend the waywardness of his actions. as he proceeded, the company grew more scattered, and his old uneasiness and vacillation were resumed. for some time he followed closely a party of some ten or twelve roisterers; but from this number one by one dropped off, until three only remained together, in a narrow and gloomy lane little frequented. the stranger paused, and, for a moment, seemed lost in thought; then, with every mark of agitation, pursued rapidly a route which brought us to the verge of the city, amid regions very different from those we had hitherto traversed. it was the most noisome quarter of london, where every thing wore the worst impress of the most deplorable poverty, and of the most desperate crime. by the dim light of an accidental lamp, tall, antique, worm-eaten, wooden tenements were seen tottering to their fall, in directions so many and capricious that scarce the semblance of a passage was discernible between them. the paving-stones lay at random, displaced from their beds by the rankly-growing grass. horrible filth festered in the dammed-up gutters. the whole atmosphere teemed with desolation. yet, as we proceeded, the sounds of human life revived by sure degrees, and at length large bands of the most abandoned of a london populace were seen reeling to and fro. the spirits of the old man again flickered up, as a lamp which is near its death hour. once more he strode onward with elastic tread. suddenly a corner was turned, a blaze of light burst upon our sight, and we stood before one of the huge suburban temples of intemperance--one of the palaces of the fiend, gin. it was now nearly day-break; but a number of wretched inebriates still pressed in and out of the flaunting entrance. with a half shriek of joy the old man forced a passage within, resumed at once his original bearing, and stalked backward and forward, without apparent object, among the throng. he had not been thus long occupied, however, before a rush to the doors gave token that the host was closing them for the night. it was something even more intense than despair that i then observed upon the countenance of the singular being whom i had watched so pertinaciously. yet he did not hesitate in his career, but, with a mad energy, retraced his steps at once, to the heart of the mighty london. long and swiftly he fled, while i followed him in the wildest amazement, resolute not to abandon a scrutiny in which i now felt an interest all-absorbing. the sun arose while we proceeded, and, when we had once again reached that most thronged mart of the populous town, the street of the d----- hotel, it presented an appearance of human bustle and activity scarcely inferior to what i had seen on the evening before. and here, long, amid the momently increasing confusion, did i persist in my pursuit of the stranger. but, as usual, he walked to and fro, and during the day did not pass from out the turmoil of that street. and, as the shades of the second evening came on, i grew wearied unto death, and, stopping fully in front of the wanderer, gazed at him steadfastly in the face. he noticed me not, but resumed his solemn walk, while i, ceasing to follow, remained absorbed in contemplation. “this old man,” i said at length, “is the type and the genius of deep crime. he refuses to be alone. [page <UNK> he is the man of the crowd. it will be in vain to follow; for i shall learn no more of him, nor of his deeds. the worst heart of the world is a grosser book than the ‘hortulus animæ,’ <UNK> and perhaps it is but one of the great mercies of god that ‘er lasst sich nicht lesen.’” <UNK> the “_hortulus animæ cum oratiunculis aliquibus superadditis_” of grünninger never bet the devil your head a tale with a moral. “_con tal que las costumbres de un autor_,” says don thomas de las torres, in the preface to his “amatory poems” _“sean puras y castas, importo muy poco que no sean igualmente severas sus obras”_--meaning, in plain english, that, provided the morals of an author are pure personally, it signifies nothing what are the morals of his books. we presume that don thomas is now in purgatory for the assertion. it would be a clever thing, too, in the way of poetical justice, to keep him there until his “amatory poems” get out of print, or are laid definitely upon the shelf through lack of readers. every fiction should have a moral; and, what is more to the purpose, the critics have discovered that every fiction has. philip melanchthon, some time ago, wrote a commentary upon the “batrachomyomachia,” and proved that the poet’s object was to excite a distaste for sedition. pierre la seine, going a step farther, shows that the intention was to recommend to young men temperance in eating and drinking. just so, too, jacobus hugo has satisfied himself that, by euenis, homer meant to insinuate john calvin; by antinous, martin luther; by the lotophagi, protestants in general; and, by the harpies, the dutch. our more modern scholiasts are equally acute. these fellows demonstrate a hidden meaning in “the antediluvians,” a parable in powhatan, “new views in cock robin,” and transcendentalism in “hop o’ my thumb.” in short, it has been shown that no man can sit down to write without a very profound design. thus to authors in general much trouble is spared. a novelist, for example, need have no care of his moral. it is there--that is to say, it is somewhere--and the moral and the critics can take care of themselves. when the proper time arrives, all that the gentleman intended, and all that he did not intend, will be brought to light, in the “dial,” or the “down-easter,” together with all that he ought to have intended, and the rest that he clearly meant to intend:--so that it will all come very straight in the end. there is no just ground, therefore, for the charge brought against me by certain ignoramuses--that i have never written a moral tale, or, in more precise words, a tale with a moral. they are not the critics predestined to bring me out, and develop my morals:--that is the secret. by and by the “north american quarterly humdrum” will make them ashamed of their stupidity. in the meantime, by way of staying execution--by way of mitigating the accusations against me--i offer the sad history appended,--a history about whose obvious moral there can be no question whatever, since he who runs may read it in the large capitals which form the title of the tale. i should have credit for this arrangement--a far wiser one than that of la fontaine and others, who reserve the impression to be conveyed until the last moment, and thus sneak it in at the fag end of their fables. defuncti injuria ne afficiantur was a law of the twelve tables, and de mortuis nil nisi bonum is an excellent injunction--even if the dead in question be nothing but dead small beer. it is not my design, therefore, to vituperate my deceased friend, toby dammit. he was a sad dog, it is true, and a dog’s death it was that he died; but he himself was not to blame for his vices. they grew out of a personal defect in his mother. she did her best in the way of flogging him while an infant--for duties to her well--regulated mind were always pleasures, and babies, like tough steaks, or the modern greek olive trees, are invariably the better for beating--but, poor woman! she had the misfortune to be left-handed, and a child flogged left-handedly had better be left unflogged. the world revolves from right to left. it will not do to whip a baby from left to right. if each blow in the proper direction drives an evil propensity out, it follows that every thump in an opposite one knocks its quota of wickedness in. i was often present at toby’s chastisements, and, even by the way in which he kicked, i could perceive that he was getting worse and worse every day. at last i saw, through the tears in my eyes, that there was no hope of the villain at all, and one day when he had been cuffed until he grew so black in the face that one might have mistaken him for a little african, and no effect had been produced beyond that of making him wriggle himself into a fit, i could stand it no longer, but went down upon my knees forthwith, and, uplifting my voice, made prophecy of his ruin. the fact is that his precocity in vice was awful. at five months of age he used to get into such passions that he was unable to articulate. at six months, i caught him gnawing a pack of cards. at seven months he was in the constant habit of catching and kissing the female babies. at eight months he peremptorily refused to put his signature to the temperance pledge. thus he went on increasing in iniquity, month after month, until, at the close of the first year, he not only insisted upon wearing moustaches, but had contracted a propensity for cursing and swearing, and for backing his assertions by bets. through this latter most ungentlemanly practice, the ruin which i had predicted to toby dammit overtook him at last. the fashion had “grown with his growth and strengthened with his strength,” so that, when he came to be a man, he could scarcely utter a sentence without interlarding it with a proposition to gamble. not that he actually laid wagers--no. i will do my friend the justice to say that he would as soon have laid eggs. with him the thing was a mere formula--nothing more. his expressions on this head had no meaning attached to them whatever. they were simple if not altogether innocent expletives--imaginative phrases wherewith to round off a sentence. when he said “i’ll bet you so and so,” nobody ever thought of taking him up; but still i could not help thinking it my duty to put him down. the habit was an immoral one, and so i told him. it was a vulgar one--this i begged him to believe. it was discountenanced by society--here i said nothing but the truth. it was forbidden by act of congress--here i had not the slightest intention of telling a lie. i remonstrated--but to no purpose. i demonstrated--in vain. i entreated--he smiled. i implored--he laughed. i preached--he sneered. i threatened--he swore. i kicked him--he called for the police. i pulled his nose--he blew it, and offered to bet the devil his head that i would not venture to try that experiment again. poverty was another vice which the peculiar physical deficiency of dammit’s mother had entailed upon her son. he was detestably poor, and this was the reason, no doubt, that his expletive expressions about betting, seldom took a pecuniary turn. i will not be bound to say that i ever heard him make use of such a figure of speech as “i’ll bet you a dollar.” it was usually “i’ll bet you what you please,” or “i’ll bet you what you dare,” or “i’ll bet you a trifle,” or else, more significantly still, “i’ll bet the devil my head.” this latter form seemed to please him best;--perhaps because it involved the least risk; for dammit had become excessively parsimonious. had any one taken him up, his head was small, and thus his loss would have been small too. but these are my own reflections and i am by no means sure that i am right in attributing them to him. at all events the phrase in question grew daily in favor, notwithstanding the gross impropriety of a man betting his brains like bank-notes:--but this was a point which my friend’s perversity of disposition would not permit him to comprehend. in the end, he abandoned all other forms of wager, and gave himself up to “i’ll bet the devil my head,” with a pertinacity and exclusiveness of devotion that displeased not less than it surprised me. i am always displeased by circumstances for which i cannot account. mysteries force a man to think, and so injure his health. the truth is, there was something in the air with which mr. dammit was wont to give utterance to his offensive expression--something in his manner of enunciation--which at first interested, and afterwards made me very uneasy--something which, for want of a more definite term at present, i must be permitted to call queer; but which mr. coleridge would have called mystical, mr. kant pantheistical, mr. carlyle twistical, and mr. emerson hyperquizzitistical. i began not to like it at all. mr. dammits soul was in a perilous state. i resolved to bring all my eloquence into play to save it. i vowed to serve him as st. patrick, in the irish chronicle, is said to have served the toad,--that is to say, “awaken him to a sense of his situation.” i addressed myself to the task forthwith. once more i betook myself to remonstrance. again i collected my energies for a final attempt at expostulation. when i had made an end of my lecture, mr. dammit indulged himself in some very equivocal behavior. for some moments he remained silent, merely looking me inquisitively in the face. but presently he threw his head to one side, and elevated his eyebrows to a great extent. then he spread out the palms of his hands and shrugged up his shoulders. then he winked with the right eye. then he repeated the operation with the left. then he shut them both up very tight. then he opened them both so very wide that i became seriously alarmed for the consequences. then, applying his thumb to his nose, he thought proper to make an indescribable movement with the rest of his fingers. finally, setting his arms a-kimbo, he condescended to reply. i can call to mind only the beads of his discourse. he would be obliged to me if i would hold my tongue. he wished none of my advice. he despised all my insinuations. he was old enough to take care of himself. did i still think him baby dammit? did i mean to say any thing against his character? did i intend to insult him? was i a fool? was my maternal parent aware, in a word, of my absence from the domiciliary residence? he would put this latter question to me as to a man of veracity, and he would bind himself to abide by my reply. once more he would demand explicitly if my mother knew that i was out. my confusion, he said, betrayed me, and he would be willing to bet the devil his head that she did not. mr. dammit did not pause for my rejoinder. turning upon his heel, he left my presence with undignified precipitation. it was well for him that he did so. my feelings had been wounded. even my anger had been aroused. for once i would have taken him up upon his insulting wager. i would have won for the arch-enemy mr. dammit’s little head--for the fact is, my mamma was very well aware of my merely temporary absence from home. but khoda shefa midêhed--heaven gives relief--as the mussulmans say when you tread upon their toes. it was in pursuance of my duty that i had been insulted, and i bore the insult like a man. it now seemed to me, however, that i had done all that could be required of me, in the case of this miserable individual, and i resolved to trouble him no longer with my counsel, but to leave him to his conscience and himself. but although i forebore to intrude with my advice, i could not bring myself to give up his society altogether. i even went so far as to humor some of his less reprehensible propensities; and there were times when i found myself lauding his wicked jokes, as epicures do mustard, with tears in my eyes:--so profoundly did it grieve me to hear his evil talk. one fine day, having strolled out together, arm in arm, our route led us in the direction of a river. there was a bridge, and we resolved to cross it. it was roofed over, by way of protection from the weather, and the archway, having but few windows, was thus very uncomfortably dark. as we entered the passage, the contrast between the external glare and the interior gloom struck heavily upon my spirits. not so upon those of the unhappy dammit, who offered to bet the devil his head that i was hipped. he seemed to be in an unusual good humor. he was excessively lively--so much so that i entertained i know not what of uneasy suspicion. it is not impossible that he was affected with the transcendentals. i am not well enough versed, however, in the diagnosis of this disease to speak with decision upon the point; and unhappily there were none of my friends of the “dial” present. i suggest the idea, nevertheless, because of a certain species of austere merry-andrewism which seemed to beset my poor friend, and caused him to make quite a tom-fool of himself. nothing would serve him but wriggling and skipping about under and over every thing that came in his way; now shouting out, and now lisping out, all manner of odd little and big words, yet preserving the gravest face in the world all the time. i really could not make up my mind whether to kick or to pity him. at length, having passed nearly across the bridge, we approached the termination of the footway, when our progress was impeded by a turnstile of some height. through this i made my way quietly, pushing it around as usual. but this turn would not serve the turn of mr. dammit. he insisted upon leaping the stile, and said he could cut a pigeon-wing over it in the air. now this, conscientiously speaking, i did not think he could do. the best pigeon-winger over all kinds of style was my friend mr. carlyle, and as i knew he could not do it, i would not believe that it could be done by toby dammit. i therefore told him, in so many words, that he was a braggadocio, and could not do what he said. for this i had reason to be sorry afterward;--for he straightway offered to bet the devil his head that he could. i was about to reply, notwithstanding my previous resolutions, with some remonstrance against his impiety, when i heard, close at my elbow, a slight cough, which sounded very much like the ejaculation “ahem!” i started, and looked about me in surprise. my glance at length fell into a nook of the frame--work of the bridge, and upon the figure of a little lame old gentleman of venerable aspect. nothing could be more reverend than his whole appearance; for he not only had on a full suit of black, but his shirt was perfectly clean and the collar turned very neatly down over a white cravat, while his hair was parted in front like a girl’s. his hands were clasped pensively together over his stomach, and his two eyes were carefully rolled up into the top of his head. upon observing him more closely, i perceived that he wore a black silk apron over his small-clothes; and this was a thing which i thought very odd. before i had time to make any remark, however, upon so singular a circumstance, he interrupted me with a second “ahem!” to this observation i was not immediately prepared to reply. the fact is, remarks of this laconic nature are nearly unanswerable. i have known a quarterly review non-plussed by the word “fudge!” i am not ashamed to say, therefore, that i turned to mr. dammit for assistance. “dammit,” said i, “what are you about? don’t you hear?--the gentleman says ‘ahem!’” i looked sternly at my friend while i thus addressed him; for, to say the truth, i felt particularly puzzled, and when a man is particularly puzzled he must knit his brows and look savage, or else he is pretty sure to look like a fool. “dammit,” observed i--although this sounded very much like an oath, than which nothing was further from my thoughts--“dammit,” i suggested--“the gentleman says ‘ahem!’” i do not attempt to defend my remark on the score of profundity; i did not think it profound myself; but i have noticed that the effect of our speeches is not always proportionate with their importance in our own eyes; and if i had shot mr. d. through and through with a paixhan bomb, or knocked him in the head with the “poets and poetry of america,” he could hardly have been more discomfited than when i addressed him with those simple words: “dammit, what are you about?--don’t you hear?--the gentleman says ‘ahem!’” “you don’t say so?” gasped he at length, after turning more colors than a pirate runs up, one after the other, when chased by a man-of-war. “are you quite sure he said that? well, at all events i am in for it now, and may as well put a bold face upon the matter. here goes, then--ahem!” at this the little old gentleman seemed pleased--god only knows why. he left his station at the nook of the bridge, limped forward with a gracious air, took dammit by the hand and shook it cordially, looking all the while straight up in his face with an air of the most unadulterated benignity which it is possible for the mind of man to imagine. “i am quite sure you will win it, dammit,” said he, with the frankest of all smiles, “but we are obliged to have a trial, you know, for the sake of mere form.” “ahem!” replied my friend, taking off his coat, with a deep sigh, tying a pocket-handkerchief around his waist, and producing an unaccountable alteration in his countenance by twisting up his eyes and bringing down the corners of his mouth--“ahem!” and “ahem!” said he again, after a pause; and not another word more than “ahem!” did i ever know him to say after that. “aha!” thought i, without expressing myself aloud--“this is quite a remarkable silence on the part of toby dammit, and is no doubt a consequence of his verbosity upon a previous occasion. one extreme induces another. i wonder if he has forgotten the many unanswerable questions which he propounded to me so fluently on the day when i gave him my last lecture? at all events, he is cured of the transcendentals.” “ahem!” here replied toby, just as if he had been reading my thoughts, and looking like a very old sheep in a revery. the old gentleman now took him by the arm, and led him more into the shade of the bridge--a few paces back from the turnstile. “my good fellow,” said he, “i make it a point of conscience to allow you this much run. wait here, till i take my place by the stile, so that i may see whether you go over it handsomely, and transcendentally, and don’t omit any flourishes of the pigeon-wing. a mere form, you know. i will say ‘one, two, three, and away.’ mind you, start at the word ‘away’” here he took his position by the stile, paused a moment as if in profound reflection, then looked up and, i thought, smiled very slightly, then tightened the strings of his apron, then took a long look at dammit, and finally gave the word as agreed upon- _one--two--three--and--away!_ punctually at the word “away,” my poor friend set off in a strong gallop. the stile was not very high, like mr. lord’s--nor yet very low, like that of mr. lord’s reviewers, but upon the whole i made sure that he would clear it. and then what if he did not?--ah, that was the question--what if he did not? “what right,” said i, “had the old gentleman to make any other gentleman jump? the little old dot-and-carry-one! who is he? if he asks me to jump, i won’t do it, that’s flat, and i don’t care who the devil he is.” the bridge, as i say, was arched and covered in, in a very ridiculous manner, and there was a most uncomfortable echo about it at all times--an echo which i never before so particularly observed as when i uttered the four last words of my remark. but what i said, or what i thought, or what i heard, occupied only an instant. in less than five seconds from his starting, my poor toby had taken the leap. i saw him run nimbly, and spring grandly from the floor of the bridge, cutting the most awful flourishes with his legs as he went up. i saw him high in the air, pigeon-winging it to admiration just over the top of the stile; and of course i thought it an unusually singular thing that he did not continue to go over. but the whole leap was the affair of a moment, and, before i had a chance to make any profound reflections, down came mr. dammit on the flat of his back, on the same side of the stile from which he had started. at the same instant i saw the old gentleman limping off at the top of his speed, having caught and wrapt up in his apron something that fell heavily into it from the darkness of the arch just over the turnstile. at all this i was much astonished; but i had no leisure to think, for dammit lay particularly still, and i concluded that his feelings had been hurt, and that he stood in need of my assistance. i hurried up to him and found that he had received what might be termed a serious injury. the truth is, he had been deprived of his head, which after a close search i could not find anywhere; so i determined to take him home and send for the homoeopathists. in the meantime a thought struck me, and i threw open an adjacent window of the bridge, when the sad truth flashed upon me at once. about five feet just above the top of the turnstile, and crossing the arch of the foot-path so as to constitute a brace, there extended a flat iron bar, lying with its breadth horizontally, and forming one of a series that served to strengthen the structure throughout its extent. with the edge of this brace it appeared evident that the neck of my unfortunate friend had come precisely in contact. he did not long survive his terrible loss. the homoeopathists did not give him little enough physic, and what little they did give him he hesitated to take. so in the end he grew worse, and at length died, a lesson to all riotous livers. i bedewed his grave with my tears, worked a bar sinister on his family escutcheon, and, for the general expenses of his funeral, sent in my very moderate bill to the transcendentalists. the scoundrels refused to pay it, so i had mr. dammit dug up at once, and sold him for dog’s meat. thou art the man i will now play the oedipus to the rattleborough enigma. i will expound to you--as i alone can--the secret of the enginery that effected the rattleborough miracle--the one, the true, the admitted, the undisputed, the indisputable miracle, which put a definite end to infidelity among the rattleburghers and converted to the orthodoxy of the grandames all the carnal-minded who had ventured to be sceptical before. this event--which i should be sorry to discuss in a tone of unsuitable levity--occurred in the summer of <UNK> mr. barnabas shuttleworthy--one of the wealthiest and most respectable citizens of the borough--had been missing for several days under circumstances which gave rise to suspicion of foul play. mr. shuttleworthy had set out from rattleborough very early one saturday morning, on horseback, with the avowed intention of proceeding to the city of-, about fifteen miles distant, and of returning the night of the same day. two hours after his departure, however, his horse returned without him, and without the saddle-bags which had been strapped on his back at starting. the animal was wounded, too, and covered with mud. these circumstances naturally gave rise to much alarm among the friends of the missing man; and when it was found, on sunday morning, that he had not yet made his appearance, the whole borough arose en masse to go and look for his body. the foremost and most energetic in instituting this search was the bosom friend of mr. shuttleworthy--a mr. charles goodfellow, or, as he was universally called, “charley goodfellow,” or “old charley goodfellow.” now, whether it is a marvellous coincidence, or whether it is that the name itself has an imperceptible effect upon the character, i have never yet been able to ascertain; but the fact is unquestionable, that there never yet was any person named charles who was not an open, manly, honest, good-natured, and frank-hearted fellow, with a rich, clear voice, that did you good to hear it, and an eye that looked you always straight in the face, as much as to say: “i have a clear conscience myself, am afraid of no man, and am altogether above doing a mean action.” and thus all the hearty, careless, “walking gentlemen” of the stage are very certain to be called charles. now, “old charley goodfellow,” although he had been in rattleborough not longer than six months or thereabouts, and although nobody knew any thing about him before he came to settle in the neighborhood, had experienced no difficulty in the world in making the acquaintance of all the respectable people in the borough. not a man of them but would have taken his bare word for a thousand at any moment; and as for the women, there is no saying what they would not have done to oblige him. and all this came of his having been christened charles, and of his possessing, in consequence, that ingenuous face which is proverbially the very “best letter of recommendation.” i have already said that mr. shuttleworthy was one of the most respectable and, undoubtedly, he was the most wealthy man in rattleborough, while “old charley goodfellow” was upon as intimate terms with him as if he had been his own brother. the two old gentlemen were next-door neighbours, and, although mr. shuttleworthy seldom, if ever, visited “old charley,” and never was known to take a meal in his house, still this did not prevent the two friends from being exceedingly intimate, as i have just observed; for “old charley” never let a day pass without stepping in three or four times to see how his neighbour came on, and very often he would stay to breakfast or tea, and almost always to dinner, and then the amount of wine that was made way with by the two cronies at a sitting, it would really be a difficult thing to ascertain. “old charleys” favorite beverage was chateau-margaux, and it appeared to do mr. shuttleworthy’s heart good to see the old fellow swallow it, as he did, quart after quart; so that, one day, when the wine was in and the wit as a natural consequence, somewhat out, he said to his crony, as he slapped him upon the back--“i tell you what it is, ‘old charley,’ you are, by all odds, the heartiest old fellow i ever came across in all my born days; and, since you love to guzzle the wine at that fashion, i’ll be darned if i don’t have to make thee a present of a big box of the chateau-margaux. od rot me,”--(mr. shuttleworthy had a sad habit of swearing, although he seldom went beyond “od rot me,” or “by gosh,” or “by the jolly golly,”)--“od rot me,” says he, “if i don’t send an order to town this very afternoon for a double box of the best that can be got, and i’ll make ye a present of it, i will!--ye needn’t say a word now--i will, i tell ye, and there’s an end of it; so look out for it--it will come to hand some of these fine days, precisely when ye are looking for it the least!” i mention this little bit of liberality on the part of mr. shuttleworthy, just by way of showing you how very intimate an understanding existed between the two friends. well, on the sunday morning in question, when it came to be fairly understood that mr. shuttleworthy had met with foul play, i never saw any one so profoundly affected as “old charley goodfellow.” when he first heard that the horse had come home without his master, and without his master’s saddle-bags, and all bloody from a pistol-shot, that had gone clean through and through the poor animal’s chest without quite killing him; when he heard all this, he turned as pale as if the missing man had been his own dear brother or father, and shivered and shook all over as if he had had a fit of the ague. at first he was too much overpowered with grief to be able to do any thing at all, or to concert upon any plan of action; so that for a long time he endeavored to dissuade mr. shuttleworthy’s other friends from making a stir about the matter, thinking it best to wait awhile--say for a week or two, or a month, or two--to see if something wouldn’t turn up, or if mr. shuttleworthy wouldn’t come in the natural way, and explain his reasons for sending his horse on before. i dare say you have often observed this disposition to temporize, or to procrastinate, in people who are labouring under any very poignant sorrow. their powers of mind seem to be rendered torpid, so that they have a horror of any thing like action, and like nothing in the world so well as to lie quietly in bed and “nurse their grief,” as the old ladies express it--that is to say, ruminate over the trouble. the people of rattleborough had, indeed, so high an opinion of the wisdom and discretion of “old charley,” that the greater part of them felt disposed to agree with him, and not make a stir in the business “until something should turn up,” as the honest old gentleman worded it; and i believe that, after all this would have been the general determination, but for the very suspicious interference of mr. shuttleworthy’s nephew, a young man of very dissipated habits, and otherwise of rather bad character. this nephew, whose name was pennifeather, would listen to nothing like reason in the matter of “lying quiet,” but insisted upon making immediate search for the “corpse of the murdered man.”--this was the expression he employed; and mr. goodfellow acutely remarked at the time, that it was “a singular expression, to say no more.” this remark of ‘old charley’s,’ too, had great effect upon the crowd; and one of the party was heard to ask, very impressively, “how it happened that young mr. pennifeather was so intimately cognizant of all the circumstances connected with his wealthy uncle’s disappearance, as to feel authorized to assert, distinctly and unequivocally, that his uncle was ‘a murdered man.’” hereupon some little squibbing and bickering occurred among various members of the crowd, and especially between “old charley” and mr. pennifeather--although this latter occurrence was, indeed, by no means a novelty, for no good will had subsisted between the parties for the last three or four months; and matters had even gone so far that mr. pennifeather had actually knocked down his uncles friend for some alleged excess of liberty that the latter had taken in the uncle’s house, of which the nephew was an inmate. upon this occasion “old charley” is said to have behaved with exemplary moderation and christian charity. he arose from the blow, adjusted his clothes, and made no attempt at retaliation at all--merely muttering a few words about “taking summary vengeance at the first convenient opportunity,”--a natural and very justifiable ebullition of anger, which meant nothing, however, and, beyond doubt, was no sooner given vent to than forgotten. however these matters may be (which have no reference to the point now at issue), it is quite certain that the people of rattleborough, principally through the persuasion of mr. pennifeather, came at length to the determination of dispersion over the adjacent country in search of the missing mr. shuttleworthy. i say they came to this determination in the first instance. after it had been fully resolved that a search should be made, it was considered almost a matter of course that the seekers should disperse--that is to say, distribute themselves in parties--for the more thorough examination of the region round about. i forget, however, by what ingenious train of reasoning it was that “old charley” finally convinced the assembly that this was the most injudicious plan that could be pursued. convince them, however, he did--all except mr. pennifeather, and, in the end, it was arranged that a search should be instituted, carefully and very thoroughly, by the burghers en masse, “old charley” himself leading the way. as for the matter of that, there could have been no better pioneer than “old charley,” whom everybody knew to have the eye of a lynx; but, although he led them into all manner of out-of-the-way holes and corners, by routes that nobody had ever suspected of existing in the neighbourhood, and although the search was incessantly kept up day and night for nearly a week, still no trace of mr. shuttleworthy could be discovered. when i say no trace, however, i must not be understood to speak literally, for trace, to some extent, there certainly was. the poor gentleman had been tracked, by his horses shoes (which were peculiar), to a spot about three miles to the east of the borough, on the main road leading to the city. here the track made off into a by-path through a piece of woodland--the path coming out again into the main road, and cutting off about half a mile of the regular distance. following the shoe-marks down this lane, the party came at length to a pool of stagnant water, half hidden by the brambles, to the right of the lane, and opposite this pool all vestige of the track was lost sight of. it appeared, however, that a struggle of some nature had here taken place, and it seemed as if some large and heavy body, much larger and heavier than a man, had been drawn from the by-path to the pool. this latter was carefully dragged twice, but nothing was found; and the party was upon the point of going away, in despair of coming to any result, when providence suggested to mr. goodfellow the expediency of draining the water off altogether. this project was received with cheers, and many high compliments to “old charley” upon his sagacity and consideration. as many of the burghers had brought spades with them, supposing that they might possibly be called upon to disinter a corpse, the drain was easily and speedily effected; and no sooner was the bottom visible, than right in the middle of the mud that remained was discovered a black silk velvet waistcoat, which nearly every one present immediately recognized as the property of mr. pennifeather. this waistcoat was much torn and stained with blood, and there were several persons among the party who had a distinct remembrance of its having been worn by its owner on the very morning of mr. shuttleworthy’s departure for the city; while there were others, again, ready to testify upon oath, if required, that mr. p. did not wear the garment in question at any period during the remainder of that memorable day, nor could any one be found to say that he had seen it upon mr. p.’s person at any period at all subsequent to mr. shuttleworthy’s disappearance. matters now wore a very serious aspect for mr. pennifeather, and it was observed, as an indubitable confirmation of the suspicions which were excited against him, that he grew exceedingly pale, and when asked what he had to say for himself, was utterly incapable of saying a word. hereupon, the few friends his riotous mode of living had left him, deserted him at once to a man, and were even more clamorous than his ancient and avowed enemies for his instantaneous arrest. but, on the other hand, the magnanimity of mr. goodfellow shone forth with only the more brilliant lustre through contrast. he made a warm and intensely eloquent defence of mr. pennifeather, in which he alluded more than once to his own sincere forgiveness of that wild young gentleman--“the heir of the worthy mr. shuttleworthy,”--for the insult which he (the young gentleman) had, no doubt in the heat of passion, thought proper to put upon him (mr. goodfellow). “he forgave him for it,” he said, “from the very bottom of his heart; and for himself (mr. goodfellow), so far from pushing the suspicious circumstances to extremity, which he was sorry to say, really had arisen against mr. pennifeather, he (mr. goodfellow) would make every exertion in his power, would employ all the little eloquence in his possession to--to--to--soften down, as much as he could conscientiously do so, the worst features of this really exceedingly perplexing piece of business.” mr. goodfellow went on for some half hour longer in this strain, very much to the credit both of his head and of his heart; but your warm-hearted people are seldom apposite in their observations--they run into all sorts of blunders, contre-temps and mal apropos-isms, in the hot-headedness of their zeal to serve a friend--thus, often with the kindest intentions in the world, doing infinitely more to prejudice his cause than to advance it. so, in the present instance, it turned out with all the eloquence of “old charley”; for, although he laboured earnestly in behalf of the suspected, yet it so happened, somehow or other, that every syllable he uttered of which the direct but unwitting tendency was not to exalt the speaker in the good opinion of his audience, had the effect to deepen the suspicion already attached to the individual whose cause he pleaded, and to arouse against him the fury of the mob. one of the most unaccountable errors committed by the orator was his allusion to the suspected as “the heir of the worthy old gentleman mr. shuttleworthy.” the people had really never thought of this before. they had only remembered certain threats of disinheritance uttered a year or two previously by the uncle (who had no living relative except the nephew), and they had, therefore, always looked upon this disinheritance as a matter that was settled--so single-minded a race of beings were the rattleburghers; but the remark of “old charley” brought them at once to a consideration of this point, and thus gave them to see the possibility of the threats having been nothing more than a threat. and straightway hereupon, arose the natural question of cui bono?--a question that tended even more than the waistcoat to fasten the terrible crime upon the young man. and here, lest i may be misunderstood, permit me to digress for one moment merely to observe that the exceedingly brief and simple latin phrase which i have employed, is invariably mistranslated and misconceived. “cui bono?” in all the crack novels and elsewhere,--in those of mrs. gore, for example, (the author of “cecil,”) a lady who quotes all tongues from the chaldaean to chickasaw, and is helped to her learning, “as needed,” upon a systematic plan, by mr. beckford,--in all the crack novels, i say, from those of bulwer and dickens to those of bulwer and dickens to those of turnapenny and ainsworth, the two little latin words cui bono are rendered “to what purpose?” or, (as if quo bono,) “to what good.” their true meaning, nevertheless, is “for whose advantage.” cui, to whom; bono, is it for a benefit. it is a purely legal phrase, and applicable precisely in cases such as we have now under consideration, where the probability of the doer of a deed hinges upon the probability of the benefit accruing to this individual or to that from the deed’s accomplishment. now in the present instance, the question cui bono? very pointedly implicated mr. pennifeather. his uncle had threatened him, after making a will in his favour, with disinheritance. but the threat had not been actually kept; the original will, it appeared, had not been altered. had it been altered, the only supposable motive for murder on the part of the suspected would have been the ordinary one of revenge; and even this would have been counteracted by the hope of reinstation into the good graces of the uncle. but the will being unaltered, while the threat to alter remained suspended over the nephew’s head, there appears at once the very strongest possible inducement for the atrocity, and so concluded, very sagaciously, the worthy citizens of the borough of rattle. mr. pennifeather was, accordingly, arrested upon the spot, and the crowd, after some further search, proceeded homeward, having him in custody. on the route, however, another circumstance occurred tending to confirm the suspicion entertained. mr. goodfellow, whose zeal led him to be always a little in advance of the party, was seen suddenly to run forward a few paces, stoop, and then apparently to pick up some small object from the grass. having quickly examined it he was observed, too, to make a sort of half attempt at concealing it in his coat pocket; but this action was noticed, as i say, and consequently prevented, when the object picked up was found to be a spanish knife which a dozen persons at once recognized as belonging to mr. pennifeather. moreover, his initials were engraved upon the handle. the blade of this knife was open and bloody. no doubt now remained of the guilt of the nephew, and immediately upon reaching rattleborough he was taken before a magistrate for examination. here matters again took a most unfavourable turn. the prisoner, being questioned as to his whereabouts on the morning of mr. shuttleworthy’s disappearance, had absolutely the audacity to acknowledge that on that very morning he had been out with his rifle deer-stalking, in the immediate neighbourhood of the pool where the blood-stained waistcoat had been discovered through the sagacity of mr. goodfellow. this latter now came forward, and, with tears in his eyes, asked permission to be examined. he said that a stern sense of the duty he owed his maker, not less than his fellow-men, would permit him no longer to remain silent. hitherto, the sincerest affection for the young man (notwithstanding the latter’s ill-treatment of himself, mr. goodfellow) had induced him to make every hypothesis which imagination could suggest, by way of endeavoring to account for what appeared suspicious in the circumstances that told so seriously against mr. pennifeather, but these circumstances were now altogether too convincing--too damning, he would hesitate no longer--he would tell all he knew, although his heart (mr. goodfellow’s) should absolutely burst asunder in the effort. he then went on to state that, on the afternoon of the day previous to mr. shuttleworthy’s departure for the city, that worthy old gentleman had mentioned to his nephew, in his hearing (mr. goodfellow’s), that his object in going to town on the morrow was to make a deposit of an unusually large sum of money in the “farmers and mechanics’ bank,” and that, then and there, the said mr. shuttleworthy had distinctly avowed to the said nephew his irrevocable determination of rescinding the will originally made, and of cutting him off with a shilling. he (the witness) now solemnly called upon the accused to state whether what he (the witness) had just stated was or was not the truth in every substantial particular. much to the astonishment of every one present, mr. pennifeather frankly admitted that it was. the magistrate now considered it his duty to send a couple of constables to search the chamber of the accused in the house of his uncle. from this search they almost immediately returned with the well-known steel-bound, russet leather pocket-book which the old gentleman had been in the habit of carrying for years. its valuable contents, however, had been abstracted, and the magistrate in vain endeavored to extort from the prisoner the use which had been made of them, or the place of their concealment. indeed, he obstinately denied all knowledge of the matter. the constables, also, discovered, between the bed and sacking of the unhappy man, a shirt and neck-handkerchief both marked with the initials of his name, and both hideously besmeared with the blood of the victim. at this juncture, it was announced that the horse of the murdered man had just expired in the stable from the effects of the wound he had received, and it was proposed by mr. goodfellow that a post mortem examination of the beast should be immediately made, with the view, if possible, of discovering the ball. this was accordingly done; and, as if to demonstrate beyond a question the guilt of the accused, mr. goodfellow, after considerable searching in the cavity of the chest was enabled to detect and to pull forth a bullet of very extraordinary size, which, upon trial, was found to be exactly adapted to the bore of mr. pennifeather’s rifle, while it was far too large for that of any other person in the borough or its vicinity. to render the matter even surer yet, however, this bullet was discovered to have a flaw or seam at right angles to the usual suture, and upon examination, this seam corresponded precisely with an accidental ridge or elevation in a pair of moulds acknowledged by the accused himself to be his own property. upon finding of this bullet, the examining magistrate refused to listen to any farther testimony, and immediately committed the prisoner for trial-declining resolutely to take any bail in the case, although against this severity mr. goodfellow very warmly remonstrated, and offered to become surety in whatever amount might be required. this generosity on the part of “old charley” was only in accordance with the whole tenour of his amiable and chivalrous conduct during the entire period of his sojourn in the borough of rattle. in the present instance the worthy man was so entirely carried away by the excessive warmth of his sympathy, that he seemed to have quite forgotten, when he offered to go bail for his young friend, that he himself (mr. goodfellow) did not possess a single dollar’s worth of property upon the face of the earth. the result of the committal may be readily foreseen. mr. pennifeather, amid the loud execrations of all rattleborough, was brought to trial at the next criminal sessions, when the chain of circumstantial evidence (strengthened as it was by some additional damning facts, which mr. goodfellow’s sensitive conscientiousness forbade him to withhold from the court) was considered so unbroken and so thoroughly conclusive, that the jury, without leaving their seats, returned an immediate verdict of “guilty of murder in the first degree.” soon afterward the unhappy wretch received sentence of death, and was remanded to the county jail to await the inexorable vengeance of the law. in the meantime, the noble behavior of “old charley goodfellow,” had doubly endeared him to the honest citizens of the borough. he became ten times a greater favorite than ever, and, as a natural result of the hospitality with which he was treated, he relaxed, as it were, perforce, the extremely parsimonious habits which his poverty had hitherto impelled him to observe, and very frequently had little reunions at his own house, when wit and jollity reigned supreme-dampened a little, of course, by the occasional remembrance of the untoward and melancholy fate which impended over the nephew of the late lamented bosom friend of the generous host. one fine day, this magnanimous old gentleman was agreeably surprised at the receipt of the following letter:- charles goodfellow, esq., rattleborough from h.f.b. & co. chat. mar. a--no. <UNK> doz. bottles <UNK> gross) “charles goodfellow, esquire. “dear sir--in conformity with an order transmitted to our firm about two months since, by our esteemed correspondent, mr. barnabus shuttleworthy, we have the honor of forwarding this morning, to your address, a double box of chateau-margaux of the antelope brand, violet seal. box numbered and marked as per margin. “we remain, sir, “your most ob’nt ser’ts, “hoggs, frogs, bogs, & co. “city of--, june <UNK> <UNK> “p.s.--the box will reach you by wagon, on the day after your receipt of this letter. our respects to mr. shuttleworthy. “h., f., b., & co.” the fact is, that mr. goodfellow had, since the death of mr. shuttleworthy, given over all expectation of ever receiving the promised chateau-margaux; and he, therefore, looked upon it now as a sort of especial dispensation of providence in his behalf. he was highly delighted, of course, and in the exuberance of his joy invited a large party of friends to a petit souper on the morrow, for the purpose of broaching the good old mr. shuttleworthy’s present. not that he said any thing about “the good old mr. shuttleworthy” when he issued the invitations. the fact is, he thought much and concluded to say nothing at all. he did not mention to any one--if i remember aright--that he had received a present of chateau-margaux. he merely asked his friends to come and help him drink some, of a remarkable fine quality and rich flavour, that he had ordered up from the city a couple of months ago, and of which he would be in the receipt upon the morrow. i have often puzzled myself to imagine why it was that “old charley” came to the conclusion to say nothing about having received the wine from his old friend, but i could never precisely understand his reason for the silence, although he had some excellent and very magnanimous reason, no doubt. the morrow at length arrived, and with it a very large and highly respectable company at mr. goodfellow’s house. indeed, half the borough was there,--i myself among the number,--but, much to the vexation of the host, the chateau-margaux did not arrive until a late hour, and when the sumptuous supper supplied by “old charley” had been done very ample justice by the guests. it came at length, however,--a monstrously big box of it there was, too--and as the whole party were in excessively good humor, it was decided, nem. con., that it should be lifted upon the table and its contents disembowelled forthwith. no sooner said than done. i lent a helping hand; and, in a trice we had the box upon the table, in the midst of all the bottles and glasses, not a few of which were demolished in the scuffle. “old charley,” who was pretty much intoxicated, and excessively red in the face, now took a seat, with an air of mock dignity, at the head of the board, and thumped furiously upon it with a decanter, calling upon the company to keep order “during the ceremony of disinterring the treasure.” after some vociferation, quiet was at length fully restored, and, as very often happens in similar cases, a profound and remarkable silence ensued. being then requested to force open the lid, i complied, of course, “with an infinite deal of pleasure.” i inserted a chisel, and giving it a few slight taps with a hammer, the top of the box flew suddenly off, and at the same instant, there sprang up into a sitting position, directly facing the host, the bruised, bloody, and nearly putrid corpse of the murdered mr. shuttleworthy himself. it gazed for a few seconds, fixedly and sorrowfully, with its decaying and lack-lustre eyes, full into the countenance of mr. goodfellow; uttered slowly, but clearly and impressively, the words--“thou art the man!” and then, falling over the side of the chest as if thoroughly satisfied, stretched out its limbs quiveringly upon the table. the scene that ensued is altogether beyond description. the rush for the doors and windows was terrific, and many of the most robust men in the room fainted outright through sheer horror. but after the first wild, shrieking burst of affright, all eyes were directed to mr. goodfellow. if i live a thousand years, i can never forget the more than mortal agony which was depicted in that ghastly face of his, so lately rubicund with triumph and wine. for several minutes he sat rigidly as a statue of marble; his eyes seeming, in the intense vacancy of their gaze, to be turned inward and absorbed in the contemplation of his own miserable, murderous soul. at length their expression appeared to flash suddenly out into the external world, when, with a quick leap, he sprang from his chair, and falling heavily with his head and shoulders upon the table, and in contact with the corpse, poured out rapidly and vehemently a detailed confession of the hideous crime for which mr. pennifeather was then imprisoned and doomed to die. what he recounted was in substance this:--he followed his victim to the vicinity of the pool; there shot his horse with a pistol; despatched its rider with the butt end; possessed himself of the pocket-book, and, supposing the horse dead, dragged it with great labour to the brambles by the pond. upon his own beast he slung the corpse of mr. shuttleworthy, and thus bore it to a secure place of concealment a long distance off through the woods. the waistcoat, the knife, the pocket-book, and bullet, had been placed by himself where found, with the view of avenging himself upon mr. pennifeather. he had also contrived the discovery of the stained handkerchief and shirt. towards the end of the blood-churning recital the words of the guilty wretch faltered and grew hollow. when the record was finally exhausted, he arose, staggered backward from the table, and fell-dead. ***** the means by which this happily-timed confession was extorted, although efficient, were simple indeed. mr. goodfellow’s excess of frankness had disgusted me, and excited my suspicions from the first. i was present when mr. pennifeather had struck him, and the fiendish expression which then arose upon his countenance, although momentary, assured me that his threat of vengeance would, if possible, be rigidly fulfilled. i was thus prepared to view the manoeuvering of “old charley” in a very different light from that in which it was regarded by the good citizens of rattleborough. i saw at once that all the criminating discoveries arose, either directly or indirectly, from himself. but the fact which clearly opened my eyes to the true state of the case, was the affair of the bullet, found by mr. g. in the carcass of the horse. i had not forgotten, although the rattleburghers had, that there was a hole where the ball had entered the horse, and another where it went out. if it were found in the animal then, after having made its exit, i saw clearly that it must have been deposited by the person who found it. the bloody shirt and handkerchief confirmed the idea suggested by the bullet; for the blood on examination proved to be capital claret, and no more. when i came to think of these things, and also of the late increase of liberality and expenditure on the part of mr. goodfellow, i entertained a suspicion which was none the less strong because i kept it altogether to myself. in the meantime, i instituted a rigorous private search for the corpse of mr. shuttleworthy, and, for good reasons, searched in quarters as divergent as possible from those to which mr. goodfellow conducted his party. the result was that, after some days, i came across an old dry well, the mouth of which was nearly hidden by brambles; and here, at the bottom, i discovered what i sought. now it so happened that i had overheard the colloquy between the two cronies, when mr. goodfellow had contrived to cajole his host into the promise of a box of chateaux-margaux. upon this hint i acted. i procured a stiff piece of whalebone, thrust it down the throat of the corpse, and deposited the latter in an old wine box-taking care so to double the body up as to double the whalebone with it. in this manner i had to press forcibly upon the lid to keep it down while i secured it with nails; and i anticipated, of course, that as soon as these latter were removed, the top would fly off and the body up. having thus arranged the box, i marked, numbered, and addressed it as already told; and then writing a letter in the name of the wine merchants with whom mr. shuttleworthy dealt, i gave instructions to my servant to wheel the box to mr. goodfellow’s door, in a barrow, at a given signal from myself. for the words which i intended the corpse to speak, i confidently depended upon my ventriloquial abilities; for their effect, i counted upon the conscience of the murderous wretch. i believe there is nothing more to be explained. mr. pennifeather was released upon the spot, inherited the fortune of his uncle, profited by the lessons of experience, turned over a new leaf, and led happily ever afterward a new life. why the little frenchman wears his hand in a sling it’s on my visiting cards sure enough (and it’s them that’s all o’ pink satin paper) that inny gintleman that plases may behould the intheristhin words, “sir pathrick o’grandison, barronitt, <UNK> southampton row, russell square, parrish o’ bloomsbury.” and shud ye be wantin’ to diskiver who is the pink of purliteness quite, and the laider of the hot tun in the houl city o’ lonon--why it’s jist mesilf. and fait that same is no wonder at all at all (so be plased to stop curlin your nose), for every inch o’ the six wakes that i’ve been a gintleman, and left aff wid the bogthrothing to take up wid the barronissy, it’s pathrick that’s been living like a houly imperor, and gitting the iddication and the graces. och! and wouldn’t it be a blessed thing for your spirrits if ye cud lay your two peepers jist, upon sir pathrick o’grandison, barronitt, when he is all riddy drissed for the hopperer, or stipping into the brisky for the drive into the hyde park. but it’s the illigant big figgur that i ave, for the rason o’ which all the ladies fall in love wid me. isn’t it my own swate silf now that’ll missure the six fut, and the three inches more nor that, in me stockins, and that am excadingly will proportioned all over to match? and it is ralelly more than three fut and a bit that there is, inny how, of the little ould furrener frinchman that lives jist over the way, and that’s a oggling and a goggling the houl day, (and bad luck to him,) at the purty widdy misthress tracle that’s my own nixt-door neighbor, (god bliss her!) and a most particuller frind and acquaintance? you percave the little spalpeen is summat down in the mouth, and wears his lift hand in a sling, and it’s for that same thing, by yur lave, that i’m going to give you the good rason. the truth of the houl matter is jist simple enough; for the very first day that i com’d from connaught, and showd my swate little silf in the strait to the widdy, who was looking through the windy, it was a gone case althegither with the heart o’ the purty misthress tracle. i percaved it, ye see, all at once, and no mistake, and that’s god’s truth. first of all it was up wid the windy in a jiffy, and thin she threw open her two peepers to the itmost, and thin it was a little gould spy-glass that she clapped tight to one o’ them and divil may burn me if it didn’t spake to me as plain as a peeper cud spake, and says it, through the spy-glass: “och! the tip o’ the mornin’ to ye, sir pathrick o’grandison, barronitt, mavourneen; and it’s a nate gintleman that ye are, sure enough, and it’s mesilf and me forten jist that’ll be at yur sarvice, dear, inny time o’ day at all at all for the asking.” and it’s not mesilf ye wud have to be bate in the purliteness; so i made her a bow that wud ha’ broken yur heart altegither to behould, and thin i pulled aff me hat with a flourish, and thin i winked at her hard wid both eyes, as much as to say, “true for you, yer a swate little crature, mrs. tracle, me darlint, and i wish i may be drownthed dead in a bog, if it’s not mesilf, sir pathrick o’grandison, barronitt, that’ll make a houl bushel o’ love to yur leddyship, in the twinkling o’ the eye of a londonderry purraty.” and it was the nixt mornin’, sure, jist as i was making up me mind whither it wouldn’t be the purlite thing to sind a bit o’ writin’ to the widdy by way of a love-litter, when up com’d the delivery servant wid an illigant card, and he tould me that the name on it (for i niver could rade the copperplate printin on account of being lift handed) was all about mounseer, the count, a goose, look--aisy, maiter-di-dauns, and that the houl of the divilish lingo was the spalpeeny long name of the little ould furrener frinchman as lived over the way. and jist wid that in cum’d the little willian himself, and then he made me a broth of a bow, and thin he said he had ounly taken the liberty of doing me the honor of the giving me a call, and thin he went on to palaver at a great rate, and divil the bit did i comprehind what he wud be afther the tilling me at all at all, excipting and saving that he said “pully wou, woolly wou,” and tould me, among a bushel o’ lies, bad luck to him, that he was mad for the love o’ my widdy misthress tracle, and that my widdy mrs. tracle had a puncheon for him. at the hearin’ of this, ye may swear, though, i was as mad as a grasshopper, but i remimbered that i was sir pathrick o’grandison, barronitt, and that it wasn’t althegither gentaal to lit the anger git the upper hand o’ the purliteness, so i made light o’ the matter and kipt dark, and got quite sociable wid the little chap, and afther a while what did he do but ask me to go wid him to the widdy’s, saying he wud give me the feshionable inthroduction to her leddyship. “is it there ye are?” said i thin to mesilf, “and it’s thrue for you, pathrick, that ye’re the fortunittest mortal in life. we’ll soon see now whither it’s your swate silf, or whither it’s little mounseer maiter-di-dauns, that misthress tracle is head and ears in the love wid.” wid that we wint aff to the widdy’s, next door, and ye may well say it was an illigant place; so it was. there was a carpet all over the floor, and in one corner there was a forty-pinny and a jew’s harp and the divil knows what ilse, and in another corner was a sofy, the beautifullest thing in all natur, and sitting on the sofy, sure enough, there was the swate little angel, misthress tracle. “the tip o’ the mornin’ to ye,” says i, “mrs. tracle,” and thin i made sich an illigant obaysance that it wud ha quite althegither bewildered the brain o’ ye. “wully woo, pully woo, plump in the mud,” says the little furrenner frinchman, “and sure mrs. tracle,” says he, that he did, “isn’t this gintleman here jist his reverence sir pathrick o’grandison, barronitt, and isn’t he althegither and entirely the most particular frind and acquaintance that i have in the houl world?” and wid that the widdy, she gits up from the sofy, and makes the swatest curthchy nor iver was seen; and thin down she sits like an angel; and thin, by the powers, it was that little spalpeen mounseer maiter-di-dauns that plumped his silf right down by the right side of her. och hon! i ixpicted the two eyes o’ me wud ha cum’d out of my head on the spot, i was so dispirate mad! howiver, “bait who!” says i, after awhile. “is it there ye are, mounseer maiter-di-dauns?” and so down i plumped on the lift side of her leddyship, to be aven with the willain. botheration! it wud ha done your heart good to percave the illigant double wink that i gived her jist thin right in the face with both eyes. but the little ould frinchman he niver beginned to suspict me at all at all, and disperate hard it was he made the love to her leddyship. “woully wou,” says he, “pully wou,” says he, “plump in the mud,” says he. “that’s all to no use, mounseer frog, mavourneen,” thinks i; and i talked as hard and as fast as i could all the while, and throth it was mesilf jist that divarted her leddyship complately and intirely, by rason of the illigant conversation that i kipt up wid her all about the dear bogs of connaught. and by and by she gived me such a swate smile, from one ind of her mouth to the ither, that it made me as bould as a pig, and i jist took hould of the ind of her little finger in the most dillikitest manner in natur, looking at her all the while out o’ the whites of my eyes. and then ounly percave the cuteness of the swate angel, for no sooner did she obsarve that i was afther the squazing of her flipper, than she up wid it in a jiffy, and put it away behind her back, jist as much as to say, “now thin, sir pathrick o’grandison, there’s a bitther chance for ye, mavourneen, for it’s not altogether the gentaal thing to be afther the squazing of my flipper right full in the sight of that little furrenner frinchman, mounseer maiter-di-dauns.” wid that i giv’d her a big wink jist to say, “lit sir pathrick alone for the likes o’ them thricks,” and thin i wint aisy to work, and you’d have died wid the divarsion to behould how cliverly i slipped my right arm betwane the back o’ the sofy, and the back of her leddyship, and there, sure enough, i found a swate little flipper all a waiting to say, “the tip o’ the mornin’ to ye, sir pathrick o’grandison, barronitt.” and wasn’t it mesilf, sure, that jist giv’d it the laste little bit of a squaze in the world, all in the way of a commincement, and not to be too rough wid her leddyship? and och, botheration, wasn’t it the gentaalest and dilikittest of all the little squazes that i got in return? “blood and thunder, sir pathrick, mavourneen,” thinks i to mesilf, “fait it’s jist the mother’s son of you, and nobody else at all at all, that’s the handsomest and the fortunittest young bog-throtter that ever cum’d out of connaught!” and with that i givd the flipper a big squaze, and a big squaze it was, by the powers, that her leddyship giv’d to me back. but it would ha split the seven sides of you wid the laffin’ to behould, jist then all at once, the consated behavior of mounseer maiter-di-dauns. the likes o’ sich a jabbering, and a smirking, and a parley-wouing as he begin’d wid her leddyship, niver was known before upon arth; and divil may burn me if it wasn’t me own very two peepers that cotch’d him tipping her the wink out of one eye. och, hon! if it wasn’t mesilf thin that was mad as a kilkenny cat i shud like to be tould who it was! “let me infarm you, mounseer maiter-di-dauns,” said i, as purlite as iver ye seed, “that it’s not the gintaal thing at all at all, and not for the likes o’ you inny how, to be afther the oggling and a goggling at her leddyship in that fashion,” and jist wid that such another squaze as it was i giv’d her flipper, all as much as to say, “isn’t it sir pathrick now, my jewel, that’ll be able to the proticting o’ you, my darlint?” and then there cum’d another squaze back, all by way of the answer. “thrue for you, sir pathrick,” it said as plain as iver a squaze said in the world, “thrue for you, sir pathrick, mavourneen, and it’s a proper nate gintleman ye are--that’s god’s truth,” and with that she opened her two beautiful peepers till i belaved they wud ha’ cum’d out of her hid althegither and intirely, and she looked first as mad as a cat at mounseer frog, and thin as smiling as all out o’ doors at mesilf. “thin,” says he, the willian, “och hon! and a wolly-wou, pully-wou,” and then wid that he shoved up his two shoulders till the divil the bit of his hid was to be diskivered, and then he let down the two corners of his purraty-trap, and thin not a haporth more of the satisfaction could i git out o’ the spalpeen. belave me, my jewel, it was sir pathrick that was unreasonable mad thin, and the more by token that the frinchman kipt an wid his winking at the widdy; and the widdy she kept an wid the squazing of my flipper, as much as to say, “at him again, sir pathrick o’grandison, mavourneen:” so i just ripped out wid a big oath, and says i; “ye little spalpeeny frog of a bog-throtting son of a bloody noun!”--and jist thin what d’ye think it was that her leddyship did? troth she jumped up from the sofy as if she was bit, and made off through the door, while i turned my head round afther her, in a complate bewilderment and botheration, and followed her wid me two peepers. you percave i had a reason of my own for knowing that she couldn’t git down the stares althegither and intirely; for i knew very well that i had hould of her hand, for the divil the bit had i iver lit it go. and says i; “isn’t it the laste little bit of a mistake in the world that ye’ve been afther the making, yer leddyship? come back now, that’s a darlint, and i’ll give ye yur flipper.” but aff she wint down the stairs like a shot, and thin i turned round to the little frinch furrenner. och hon! if it wasn’t his spalpeeny little paw that i had hould of in my own--why thin--thin it wasn’t--that’s all. and maybe it wasn’t mesilf that jist died then outright wid the laffin’, to behold the little chap when he found out that it wasn’t the widdy at all at all that he had had hould of all the time, but only sir pathrick o’grandison. the ould divil himself niver behild sich a long face as he pet an! as for sir pathrick o’grandison, barronitt, it wasn’t for the likes of his riverence to be afther the minding of a thrifle of a mistake. ye may jist say, though (for it’s god’s thruth), that afore i left hould of the flipper of the spalpeen (which was not till afther her leddyship’s futman had kicked us both down the stairs), i giv’d it such a nate little broth of a squaze as made it all up into raspberry jam. “woully wou,” says he, “pully wou,” says he--“cot tam!” and that’s jist the thruth of the rason why he wears his lift hand in a sling. bon-bon. quand un bon vin meuble mon estomac, je suis plus savant que balzac-- plus sage que pibrac; mon brass seul faisant l’attaque de la nation coseaque, la mettroit au sac; de charon je passerois le lac, en dormant dans son bac; j’irois au fier eac, sans que mon cœur fit tic ni tac, présenter du tabac. french vaudeville that pierre bon-bon was a _restaurateur_ of uncommon qualifications, no man who, during the reign of----, frequented the little câfé in the cul-de-sac le febvre at rouen, will, i imagine, feel himself at liberty to dispute. that pierre bon-bon was, in an equal degree, skilled in the philosophy of that period is, i presume, still more especially undeniable. his _patés à la fois_ were beyond doubt immaculate; but what pen can do justice to his essays _sur la nature_--his thoughts sur _l’ame_--his observations _sur l’esprit?_ if his _omelettes_--if his _fricandeaux_ were inestimable, what _littérateur_ of that day would not have given twice as much for an “_idée de bon-bon_” as for all the trash of “_idées_” of all the rest of the _savants?_ bon-bon had ransacked libraries which no other man had ransacked--had more than any other would have entertained a notion of reading--had understood more than any other would have conceived the possibility of understanding; and although, while he flourished, there were not wanting some authors at rouen to assert “that his _dicta_ evinced neither the purity of the academy, nor the depth of the lyceum”--although, mark me, his doctrines were by no means very generally comprehended, still it did not follow that they were difficult of comprehension. it was, i think, on account of their self-evidency that many persons were led to consider them abstruse. it is to bon-bon--but let this go no farther--it is to bon-bon that kant himself is mainly indebted for his metaphysics. the former was indeed not a platonist, nor strictly speaking an aristotelian--nor did he, like the modern leibnitz, waste those precious hours which might be employed in the invention of a _fricasée_ or, _facili gradu_, the analysis of a sensation, in frivolous attempts at reconciling the obstinate oils and waters of ethical discussion. not at all. bon-bon was ionic--bon-bon was equally italic. he reasoned _à priori_--he reasoned also _à posteriori_. his ideas were innate--or otherwise. he believed in george of trebizonde--he believed in bossarion [bessarion]. bon-bon was emphatically a--bon-bonist. i have spoken of the philosopher in his capacity of _restaurateur_. i would not, however, have any friend of mine imagine that, in fulfilling his hereditary duties in that line, our hero wanted a proper estimation of their dignity and importance. far from it. it was impossible to say in which branch of his profession he took the greater pride. in his opinion the powers of the intellect held intimate connection with the capabilities of the stomach. i am not sure, indeed, that he greatly disagreed with the chinese, who held that the soul lies in the abdomen. the greeks at all events were right, he thought, who employed the same words for the mind and the diaphragm. <UNK> by this i do not mean to insinuate a charge of gluttony, or indeed any other serious charge to the prejudice of the metaphysician. if pierre bon-bon had his failings--and what great man has not a thousand?--if pierre bon-bon, i say, had his failings, they were failings of very little importance--faults indeed which, in other tempers, have often been looked upon rather in the light of virtues. as regards one of these foibles, i should not even have mentioned it in this history but for the remarkable prominency--the extreme _alto relievo_--in which it jutted out from the plane of his general disposition. he could never let slip an opportunity of making a bargain. <UNK> md not that he was avaricious--no. it was by no means necessary to the satisfaction of the philosopher, that the bargain should be to his own proper advantage. provided a trade could be effected--a trade of any kind, upon any terms, or under any circumstances--a triumphant smile was seen for many days thereafter to enlighten his countenance, and a knowing wink of the eye to give evidence of his sagacity. at any epoch it would not be very wonderful if a humor so peculiar as the one i have just mentioned, should elicit attention and remark. at the epoch of our narrative, had this peculiarity not attracted observation, there would have been room for wonder indeed. it was soon reported that, upon all occasions of the kind, the smile of bon-bon was wont to differ widely from the downright grin with which he would laugh at his own jokes, or welcome an acquaintance. hints were thrown out of an exciting nature; stories were told of perilous bargains made in a hurry and repented of at leisure; and instances were adduced of unaccountable capacities, vague longings, and unnatural inclinations implanted by the author of all evil for wise purposes of his own. the philosopher had other weaknesses--but they are scarcely worthy our serious examination. for example, there are few men of extraordinary profundity who are found wanting in an inclination for the bottle. whether this inclination be an exciting cause, or rather a valid proof of such profundity, it is a nice thing to say. bon-bon, as far as i can learn, did not think the subject adapted to minute investigation;--nor do i. yet in the indulgence of a propensity so truly classical, it is not to be supposed that the restaurateur would lose sight of that intuitive discrimination which was wont to characterize, at one and the same time, his essais and his omelettes. in his seclusions the vin de bourgogne had its allotted hour, and there were appropriate moments for the cotes du rhone. with him sauterne was to medoc what catullus was to homer. he would sport with a syllogism in sipping st. peray, but unravel an argument over clos de vougeot, and upset a theory in a torrent of chambertin. well had it been if the same quick sense of propriety had attended him in the peddling propensity to which i have formerly alluded--but this was by no means the case. indeed to say the truth, that trait of mind in the philosophic bon-bon did begin at length to assume a character of strange intensity and mysticism, and appeared deeply tinctured with the diablerie of his favorite german studies. to enter the little cafe in the cul-de-sac le febvre was, at the period of our tale, to enter the sanctum of a man of genius. bon-bon was a man of genius. there was not a sous-cusinier in rouen, who could not have told you that bon-bon was a man of genius. his very cat knew it, and forebore to whisk her tail in the presence of the man of genius. his large water-dog was acquainted with the fact, and upon the approach of his master, betrayed his sense of inferiority by a sanctity of deportment, a debasement of the ears, and a dropping of the lower jaw not altogether unworthy of a dog. it is, however, true that much of this habitual respect might have been attributed to the personal appearance of the metaphysician. a distinguished exterior will, i am constrained to say, have its way even with a beast; and i am willing to allow much in the outward man of the restaurateur calculated to impress the imagination of the quadruped. there is a peculiar majesty about the atmosphere of the little great--if i may be permitted so equivocal an expression--which mere physical bulk alone will be found at all times inefficient in creating. if, however, bon-bon was barely three feet in height, and if his head was diminutively small, still it was impossible to behold the rotundity of his stomach without a sense of magnificence nearly bordering upon the sublime. in its size both dogs and men must have seen a type of his acquirements--in its immensity a fitting habitation for his immortal soul. i might here--if it so pleased me--dilate upon the matter of habiliment, and other mere circumstances of the external metaphysician. i might hint that the hair of our hero was worn short, combed smoothly over his forehead, and surmounted by a conical-shaped white flannel cap and tassels--that his pea-green jerkin was not after the fashion of those worn by the common class of restaurateurs at that day--that the sleeves were something fuller than the reigning costume permitted--that the cuffs were turned up, not as usual in that barbarous period, with cloth of the same quality and color as the garment, but faced in a more fanciful manner with the particolored velvet of genoa--that his slippers were of a bright purple, curiously filigreed, and might have been manufactured in japan, but for the exquisite pointing of the toes, and the brilliant tints of the binding and embroidery--that his breeches were of the yellow satin-like material called aimable--that his sky-blue cloak, resembling in form a dressing-wrapper, and richly bestudded all over with crimson devices, floated cavalierly upon his shoulders like a mist of the morning--and that his tout ensemble gave rise to the remarkable words of benevenuta, the improvisatrice of florence, “that it was difficult to say whether pierre bon-bon was indeed a bird of paradise, or rather a very paradise of perfection.” i might, i say, expatiate upon all these points if i pleased,--but i forbear, merely personal details may be left to historical novelists,--they are beneath the moral dignity of matter-of-fact. i have said that “to enter the cafe in the cul-de-sac le febvre was to enter the sanctum of a man of genius”--but then it was only the man of genius who could duly estimate the merits of the sanctum. a sign, consisting of a vast folio, swung before the entrance. on one side of the volume was painted a bottle; on the reverse a pate. on the back were visible in large letters oeuvres de bon-bon. thus was delicately shadowed forth the two-fold occupation of the proprietor. upon stepping over the threshold, the whole interior of the building presented itself to view. a long, low-pitched room, of antique construction, was indeed all the accommodation afforded by the cafe. in a corner of the apartment stood the bed of the metaphysician. an army of curtains, together with a canopy a la grecque, gave it an air at once classic and comfortable. in the corner diagonary opposite, appeared, in direct family communion, the properties of the kitchen and the bibliotheque. a dish of polemics stood peacefully upon the dresser. here lay an ovenful of the latest ethics--there a kettle of dudecimo melanges. volumes of german morality were hand and glove with the gridiron--a toasting-fork might be discovered by the side of eusebius--plato reclined at his ease in the frying-pan--and contemporary manuscripts were filed away upon the spit. in other respects the cafe de bon-bon might be said to differ little from the usual restaurants of the period. a fireplace yawned opposite the door. on the right of the fireplace an open cupboard displayed a formidable array of labelled bottles. it was here, about twelve o’clock one night during the severe winter the comments of his neighbours upon his singular propensity--that pierre bon-bon, i say, having turned them all out of his house, locked the door upon them with an oath, and betook himself in no very pacific mood to the comforts of a leather-bottomed arm-chair, and a fire of blazing fagots. it was one of those terrific nights which are only met with once or twice during a century. it snowed fiercely, and the house tottered to its centre with the floods of wind that, rushing through the crannies in the wall, and pouring impetuously down the chimney, shook awfully the curtains of the philosopher’s bed, and disorganized the economy of his pate-pans and papers. the huge folio sign that swung without, exposed to the fury of the tempest, creaked ominously, and gave out a moaning sound from its stanchions of solid oak. it was in no placid temper, i say, that the metaphysician drew up his chair to its customary station by the hearth. many circumstances of a perplexing nature had occurred during the day, to disturb the serenity of his meditations. in attempting des oeufs a la princesse, he had unfortunately perpetrated an omelette a la reine; the discovery of a principle in ethics had been frustrated by the overturning of a stew; and last, not least, he had been thwarted in one of those admirable bargains which he at all times took such especial delight in bringing to a successful termination. but in the chafing of his mind at these unaccountable vicissitudes, there did not fail to be mingled some degree of that nervous anxiety which the fury of a boisterous night is so well calculated to produce. whistling to his more immediate vicinity the large black water-dog we have spoken of before, and settling himself uneasily in his chair, he could not help casting a wary and unquiet eye toward those distant recesses of the apartment whose inexorable shadows not even the red firelight itself could more than partially succeed in overcoming. having completed a scrutiny whose exact purpose was perhaps unintelligible to himself, he drew close to his seat a small table covered with books and papers, and soon became absorbed in the task of retouching a voluminous manuscript, intended for publication on the morrow. he had been thus occupied for some minutes when “i am in no hurry, monsieur bon-bon,” suddenly whispered a whining voice in the apartment. “the devil!” ejaculated our hero, starting to his feet, overturning the table at his side, and staring around him in astonishment. “very true,” calmly replied the voice. “very true!--what is very true?--how came you here?” vociferated the metaphysician, as his eye fell upon something which lay stretched at full length upon the bed. “i was saying,” said the intruder, without attending to the interrogatives,--“i was saying that i am not at all pushed for time--that the business upon which i took the liberty of calling, is of no pressing importance--in short, that i can very well wait until you have finished your exposition.” “my exposition!--there now!--how do you know?--how came you to understand that i was writing an exposition?--good god!” “hush!” replied the figure, in a shrill undertone; and, arising quickly from the bed, he made a single step toward our hero, while an iron lamp that depended over-head swung convulsively back from his approach. the philosopher’s amazement did not prevent a narrow scrutiny of the stranger’s dress and appearance. the outlines of his figure, exceedingly lean, but much above the common height, were rendered minutely distinct, by means of a faded suit of black cloth which fitted tight to the skin, but was otherwise cut very much in the style of a century ago. these garments had evidently been intended for a much shorter person than their present owner. his ankles and wrists were left naked for several inches. in his shoes, however, a pair of very brilliant buckles gave the lie to the extreme poverty implied by the other portions of his dress. his head was bare, and entirely bald, with the exception of a hinder part, from which depended a queue of considerable length. a pair of green spectacles, with side glasses, protected his eyes from the influence of the light, and at the same time prevented our hero from ascertaining either their color or their conformation. about the entire person there was no evidence of a shirt, but a white cravat, of filthy appearance, was tied with extreme precision around the throat and the ends hanging down formally side by side gave (although i dare say unintentionally) the idea of an ecclesiastic. indeed, many other points both in his appearance and demeanor might have very well sustained a conception of that nature. over his left ear, he carried, after the fashion of a modern clerk, an instrument resembling the stylus of the ancients. in a breast-pocket of his coat appeared conspicuously a small black volume fastened with clasps of steel. this book, whether accidentally or not, was so turned outwardly from the person as to discover the words “rituel catholique” in white letters upon the back. his entire physiognomy was interestingly saturnine--even cadaverously pale. the forehead was lofty, and deeply furrowed with the ridges of contemplation. the corners of the mouth were drawn down into an expression of the most submissive humility. there was also a clasping of the hands, as he stepped toward our hero--a deep sigh--and altogether a look of such utter sanctity as could not have failed to be unequivocally preposessing. every shadow of anger faded from the countenance of the metaphysician, as, having completed a satisfactory survey of his visiter’s person, he shook him cordially by the hand, and conducted him to a seat. there would however be a radical error in attributing this instantaneous transition of feeling in the philosopher, to any one of those causes which might naturally be supposed to have had an influence. indeed, pierre bon-bon, from what i have been able to understand of his disposition, was of all men the least likely to be imposed upon by any speciousness of exterior deportment. it was impossible that so accurate an observer of men and things should have failed to discover, upon the moment, the real character of the personage who had thus intruded upon his hospitality. to say no more, the conformation of his visiter’s feet was sufficiently remarkable--he maintained lightly upon his head an inordinately tall hat--there was a tremulous swelling about the hinder part of his breeches--and the vibration of his coat tail was a palpable fact. judge, then, with what feelings of satisfaction our hero found himself thrown thus at once into the society of a person for whom he had at all times entertained the most unqualified respect. he was, however, too much of the diplomatist to let escape him any intimation of his suspicions in regard to the true state of affairs. it was not his cue to appear at all conscious of the high honor he thus unexpectedly enjoyed; but, by leading his guest into the conversation, to elicit some important ethical ideas, which might, in obtaining a place in his contemplated publication, enlighten the human race, and at the same time immortalize himself--ideas which, i should have added, his visitor’s great age, and well-known proficiency in the science of morals, might very well have enabled him to afford. actuated by these enlightened views, our hero bade the gentleman sit down, while he himself took occasion to throw some fagots upon the fire, and place upon the now re-established table some bottles of mousseux. having quickly completed these operations, he drew his chair vis-a-vis to his companion’s, and waited until the latter should open the conversation. but plans even the most skilfully matured are often thwarted in the outset of their application--and the restaurateur found himself nonplussed by the very first words of his visiter’s speech. “i see you know me, bon-bon,” said he; “ha! ha! ha!--he! he! he!--hi! hi! hi!--ho! ho! ho!--hu! hu! hu!”--and the devil, dropping at once the sanctity of his demeanor, opened to its fullest extent a mouth from ear to ear, so as to display a set of jagged and fang-like teeth, and, throwing back his head, laughed long, loudly, wickedly, and uproariously, while the black dog, crouching down upon his haunches, joined lustily in the chorus, and the tabby cat, flying off at a tangent, stood up on end, and shrieked in the farthest corner of the apartment. not so the philosopher; he was too much a man of the world either to laugh like the dog, or by shrieks to betray the indecorous trepidation of the cat. it must be confessed, he felt a little astonishment to see the white letters which formed the words “rituel catholique” on the book in his guest’s pocket, momently changing both their color and their import, and in a few seconds, in place of the original title the words regitre des condamnes blazed forth in characters of red. this startling circumstance, when bon-bon replied to his visiter’s remark, imparted to his manner an air of embarrassment which probably might, not otherwise have been observed. “why sir,” said the philosopher, “why sir, to speak sincerely--i i imagine--i have some faint--some very faint idea--of the remarkable honor-” “oh!--ah!--yes!--very well!” interrupted his majesty; “say no more--i see how it is.” and hereupon, taking off his green spectacles, he wiped the glasses carefully with the sleeve of his coat, and deposited them in his pocket. if bon-bon had been astonished at the incident of the book, his amazement was now much increased by the spectacle which here presented itself to view. in raising his eyes, with a strong feeling of curiosity to ascertain the color of his guest’s, he found them by no means black, as he had anticipated--nor gray, as might have been imagined--nor yet hazel nor blue--nor indeed yellow nor red--nor purple--nor white--nor green--nor any other color in the heavens above, or in the earth beneath, or in the waters under the earth. in short, pierre bon-bon not only saw plainly that his majesty had no eyes whatsoever, but could discover no indications of their having existed at any previous period--for the space where eyes should naturally have been was, i am constrained to say, simply a dead level of flesh. it was not in the nature of the metaphysician to forbear making some inquiry into the sources of so strange a phenomenon, and the reply of his majesty was at once prompt, dignified, and satisfactory. “eyes! my dear bon-bon--eyes! did you say?--oh!--ah!--i perceive! the ridiculous prints, eh, which are in, circulation, have given you a false idea of my personal appearance? eyes!--true. eyes, pierre bon-bon, are very well in their proper place--that, you would say, is the head?--right--the head of a worm. to you, likewise, these optics are indispensable--yet i will convince you that my vision is more penetrating than your own. there is a cat i see in the corner--a pretty cat--look at her--observe her well. now, bon-bon, do you behold the thoughts--the thoughts, i say,--the ideas--the reflections--which are being engendered in her pericranium? there it is, now--you do not! she is thinking we admire the length of her tail and the profundity of her mind. she has just concluded that i am the most distinguished of ecclesiastics, and that you are the most superficial of metaphysicians. thus you see i am not altogether blind; but to one of my profession, the eyes you speak of would be merely an incumbrance, liable at any time to be put out by a toasting-iron, or a pitchfork. to you, i allow, these optical affairs are indispensable. endeavor, bon-bon, to use them well;--my vision is the soul.” hereupon the guest helped himself to the wine upon the table, and pouring out a bumper for bon-bon, requested him to drink it without scruple, and make himself perfectly at home. “a clever book that of yours, pierre,” resumed his majesty, tapping our friend knowingly upon the shoulder, as the latter put down his glass after a thorough compliance with his visiter’s injunction. “a clever book that of yours, upon my honor. it’s a work after my own heart. your arrangement of the matter, i think, however, might be improved, and many of your notions remind me of aristotle. that philosopher was one of my most intimate acquaintances. i liked him as much for his terrible ill temper, as for his happy knack at making a blunder. there is only one solid truth in all that he has written, and for that i gave him the hint out of pure compassion for his absurdity. i suppose, pierre bon-bon, you very well know to what divine moral truth i am alluding?” “cannot say that i--” “indeed!--why it was i who told aristotle that by sneezing, men expelled superfluous ideas through the proboscis.” “which is--hiccup!--undoubtedly the case,” said the metaphysician, while he poured out for himself another bumper of mousseux, and offered his snuff-box to the fingers of his visiter. “there was plato, too,” continued his majesty, modestly declining the snuff-box and the compliment it implied--“there was plato, too, for whom i, at one time, felt all the affection of a friend. you knew plato, bon-bon?--ah, no, i beg a thousand pardons. he met me at athens, one day, in the parthenon, and told me he was distressed for an idea. i bade him write, down that o nous estin aulos. he said that he would do so, and went home, while i stepped over to the pyramids. but my conscience smote me for having uttered a truth, even to aid a friend, and hastening back to athens, i arrived behind the philosopher’s chair as he was inditing the ‘aulos.’” “giving the lambda a fillip with my finger, i turned it upside down. so the sentence now read ‘o nous estin augos’, and is, you perceive, the fundamental doctrines in his metaphysics.” “were you ever at rome?” asked the restaurateur, as he finished his second bottle of mousseux, and drew from the closet a larger supply of chambertin. “but once, monsieur bon-bon, but once. there was a time,” said the devil, as if reciting some passage from a book--“there was a time when occurred an anarchy of five years, during which the republic, bereft of all its officers, had no magistracy besides the tribunes of the people, and these were not legally vested with any degree of executive power--at that time, monsieur bon-bon--at that time only i was in rome, and i have no earthly acquaintance, consequently, with any of its philosophy.” <UNK> <UNK> ils ecrivaient sur la philosophie (_cicero, lucretius, seneca_) mais c’etait la philosophie grecque.--_condorcet_. “what do you think of--what do you think of--hiccup!--epicurus?” “what do i think of whom?” said the devil, in astonishment, “you cannot surely mean to find any fault with epicurus! what do i think of epicurus! do you mean me, sir?--i am epicurus! i am the same philosopher who wrote each of the three hundred treatises commemorated by diogenes laertes.” “that’s a lie!” said the metaphysician, for the wine had gotten a little into his head. “very well!--very well, sir!--very well, indeed, sir!” said his majesty, apparently much flattered. “that’s a lie!” repeated the restaurateur, dogmatically; “that’s a--hiccup!--a lie!” “well, well, have it your own way!” said the devil, pacifically, and bon-bon, having beaten his majesty at argument, thought it his duty to conclude a second bottle of chambertin. “as i was saying,” resumed the visiter--“as i was observing a little while ago, there are some very outre notions in that book of yours monsieur bon-bon. what, for instance, do you mean by all that humbug about the soul? pray, sir, what is the soul?” “the--hiccup!--soul,” replied the metaphysician, referring to his ms., “is undoubtedly-” “no, sir!” “indubitably-” “no, sir!” “indisputably-” “no, sir!” “evidently-” “no, sir!” “incontrovertibly-” “no, sir!” “hiccup!--” “no, sir!” “and beyond all question, a-” “no sir, the soul is no such thing!” (here the philosopher, looking daggers, took occasion to make an end, upon the spot, of his third bottle of chambertin.) “then--hic-cup!--pray, sir--what--what is it?” “that is neither here nor there, monsieur bon-bon,” replied his majesty, musingly. “i have tasted--that is to say, i have known some very bad souls, and some too--pretty good ones.” here he smacked his lips, and, having unconsciously let fall his hand upon the volume in his pocket, was seized with a violent fit of sneezing. he continued. “there was the soul of cratinus--passable: aristophanes--racy: plato--exquisite--not your plato, but plato the comic poet; your plato would have turned the stomach of cerberus--faugh! then let me see! there were naevius, and andronicus, and plautus, and terentius. then there were lucilius, and catullus, and naso, and quintus flaccus,--dear quinty! as i called him when he sung a seculare for my amusement, while i toasted him, in pure good humor, on a fork. but they want flavor, these romans. one fat greek is worth a dozen of them, and besides will keep, which cannot be said of a quirite.--let us taste your sauterne.” bon-bon had by this time made up his mind to nil admirari and endeavored to hand down the bottles in question. he was, however, conscious of a strange sound in the room like the wagging of a tail. of this, although extremely indecent in his majesty, the philosopher took no notice:--simply kicking the dog, and requesting him to be quiet. the visiter continued: “i found that horace tasted very much like aristotle;--you know i am fond of variety. terentius i could not have told from menander. naso, to my astonishment, was nicander in disguise. virgilius had a strong twang of theocritus. martial put me much in mind of archilochus--and titus livius was positively polybius and none other.” “hic-cup!” here replied bon-bon, and his majesty proceeded: “but if i have a penchant, monsieur bon-bon--if i have a penchant, it is for a philosopher. yet, let me tell you, sir, it is not every dev--i mean it is not every gentleman who knows how to choose a philosopher. long ones are not good; and the best, if not carefully shelled, are apt to be a little rancid on account of the gall!” “shelled!” “i mean taken out of the carcass.” “what do you think of a--hic-cup!--physician?” “don’t mention them!--ugh! ugh! ugh!” (here his majesty retched violently.) “i never tasted but one--that rascal hippocrates!--smelt of asafoetida--ugh! ugh! ugh!--caught a wretched cold washing him in the styx--and after all he gave me the cholera morbus.” “the--hiccup--wretch!” ejaculated bon-bon, “the--hic-cup!--absorption of a pill-box!”--and the philosopher dropped a tear. “after all,” continued the visiter, “after all, if a dev--if a gentleman wishes to live, he must have more talents than one or two; and with us a fat face is an evidence of diplomacy.” “how so?” “why, we are sometimes exceedingly pushed for provisions. you must know that, in a climate so sultry as mine, it is frequently impossible to keep a spirit alive for more than two or three hours; and after death, unless pickled immediately (and a pickled spirit is not good), they will--smell--you understand, eh? putrefaction is always to be apprehended when the souls are consigned to us in the usual way.” “hiccup!--hiccup!--good god! how do you manage?” here the iron lamp commenced swinging with redoubled violence, and the devil half started from his seat;--however, with a slight sigh, he recovered his composure, merely saying to our hero in a low tone: “i tell you what, pierre bon-bon, we must have no more swearing.” the host swallowed another bumper, by way of denoting thorough comprehension and acquiescence, and the visiter continued. “why, there are several ways of managing. the most of us starve: some put up with the pickle: for my part i purchase my spirits vivente corpore, in which case i find they keep very well.” “but the body!--hiccup!--the body!” “the body, the body--well, what of the body?--oh! ah! i perceive. why, sir, the body is not at all affected by the transaction. i have made innumerable purchases of the kind in my day, and the parties never experienced any inconvenience. there were cain and nimrod, and nero, and caligula, and dionysius, and pisistratus, and--and a thousand others, who never knew what it was to have a soul during the latter part of their lives; yet, sir, these men adorned society. why possession of his faculties, mental and corporeal? who writes a keener epigram? who reasons more wittily? who--but stay! i have his agreement in my pocket-book.” thus saying, he produced a red leather wallet, and took from it a number of papers. upon some of these bon-bon caught a glimpse of the letters machi--maza--robesp--with the words caligula, george, elizabeth. his majesty selected a narrow slip of parchment, and from it read aloud the following words: “in consideration of certain mental endowments which it is unnecessary to specify, and in further consideration of one thousand louis d’or, i being aged one year and one month, do hereby make over to the bearer of this agreement all my right, title, and appurtenance in the shadow called my soul. (signed) a....” <UNK> (here his majesty repeated a name which i did not feel justified in indicating more unequivocally.) <UNK> quere-arouet? “a clever fellow that,” resumed he; “but like you, monsieur bon-bon, he was mistaken about the soul. the soul a shadow, truly! the soul a shadow; ha! ha! ha!--he! he! he!--hu! hu! hu! only think of a fricasseed shadow!” “only think--hiccup!--of a fricasseed shadow!” exclaimed our hero, whose faculties were becoming much illuminated by the profundity of his majesty’s discourse. “only think of a hiccup!--fricasseed shadow!! now, damme!--hiccup!--humph! if i would have been such a--hiccup!--nincompoop! my soul, mr.--humph!” “your soul, monsieur bon-bon?” “yes, sir--hiccup!--my soul is-” “what, sir?” “no shadow, damme!” “did you mean to say-” “yes, sir, my soul is--hiccup!--humph!--yes, sir.” “did you not intend to assert-” “my soul is--hiccup!--peculiarly qualified for--hiccup!--a-” “what, sir?” “stew.” “ha!” “soufflee.” “eh!” “fricassee.” “indeed!” “ragout and fricandeau--and see here, my good fellow! i’ll let you have it--hiccup!--a bargain.” here the philosopher slapped his majesty upon the back. “couldn’t think of such a thing,” said the latter calmly, at the same time rising from his seat. the metaphysician stared. “am supplied at present,” said his majesty. “hiccup--e-h?” said the philosopher. “have no funds on hand.” “what?” “besides, very unhandsome in me--” “sir!” “to take advantage of-” “hiccup!” “your present disgusting and ungentlemanly situation.” here the visiter bowed and withdrew--in what manner could not precisely be ascertained--but in a well-concerted effort to discharge a bottle at “the villain,” the slender chain was severed that depended from the ceiling, and the metaphysician prostrated by the downfall of the lamp. some words with a mummy. the _symposium_ of the preceding evening had been a little too much for my nerves. i had a wretched headache, and was desperately drowsy. instead of going out therefore to spend the evening as i had proposed, it occurred to me that i could not do a wiser thing than just eat a mouthful of supper and go immediately to bed. a light supper of course. i am exceedingly fond of welsh rabbit. more than a pound at once, however, may not at all times be advisable. still, there can be no material objection to two. and really between two and three, there is merely a single unit of difference. i ventured, perhaps, upon four. my wife will have it five;--but, clearly, she has confounded two very distinct affairs. the abstract number, five, i am willing to admit; but, concretely, it has reference to bottles of brown stout, without which, in the way of condiment, welsh rabbit is to be eschewed. having thus concluded a frugal meal, and donned my night-cap, with the serene hope of enjoying it till noon the next day, i placed my head upon the pillow, and, through the aid of a capital conscience, fell into a profound slumber forthwith. but when were the hopes of humanity fulfilled? i could not have completed my third snore when there came a furious ringing at the street-door bell, and then an impatient thumping at the knocker, which awakened me at once. in a minute afterward, and while i was still rubbing my eyes, my wife thrust in my face a note, from my old friend, doctor ponnonner. it ran thus: “come to me, by all means, my dear good friend, as soon as you receive this. come and help us to rejoice. at last, by long persevering diplomacy, i have gained the assent of the directors of the city museum, to my examination of the mummy--you know the one i mean. i have permission to unswathe it and open it, if desirable. a few friends only will be present--you, of course. the mummy is now at my house, and we shall begin to unroll it at eleven to-night. “yours, ever, ponnonner. by the time i had reached the “ponnonner,” it struck me that i was as wide awake as a man need be. i leaped out of bed in an ecstacy, overthrowing all in my way; dressed myself with a rapidity truly marvellous; and set off, at the top of my speed, for the doctor’s. there i found a very eager company assembled. they had been awaiting me with much impatience; the mummy was extended upon the dining-table; and the moment i entered its examination was commenced. it was one of a pair brought, several years previously, by captain arthur sabretash, a cousin of ponnonner’s from a tomb near eleithias, in the lybian mountains, a considerable distance above thebes on the nile. the grottoes at this point, although less magnificent than the theban sepulchres, are of higher interest, on account of affording more numerous illustrations of the private life of the egyptians. the chamber from which our specimen was taken, was said to be very rich in such illustrations; the walls being completely covered with fresco paintings and bas-reliefs, while statues, vases, and mosaic work of rich patterns, indicated the vast wealth of the deceased. the treasure had been deposited in the museum precisely in the same condition in which captain sabretash had found it;--that is to say, the coffin had not been disturbed. for eight years it had thus stood, subject only externally to public inspection. we had now, therefore, the complete mummy at our disposal; and to those who are aware how very rarely the unransacked antique reaches our shores, it will be evident, at once that we had great reason to congratulate ourselves upon our good fortune. approaching the table, i saw on it a large box, or case, nearly seven feet long, and perhaps three feet wide, by two feet and a half deep. it was oblong--not coffin-shaped. the material was at first supposed to be the wood of the sycamore (_platanus_), but, upon cutting into it, we found it to be pasteboard, or, more properly, _papier mache_, composed of papyrus. it was thickly ornamented with paintings, representing funeral scenes, and other mournful subjects--interspersed among which, in every variety of position, were certain series of hieroglyphical characters, intended, no doubt, for the name of the departed. by good luck, mr. gliddon formed one of our party; and he had no difficulty in translating the letters, which were simply phonetic, and represented the word _allamistakeo_. we had some difficulty in getting this case open without injury; but having at length accomplished the task, we came to a second, coffin-shaped, and very considerably less in size than the exterior one, but resembling it precisely in every other respect. the interval between the two was filled with resin, which had, in some degree, defaced the colors of the interior box. upon opening this latter (which we did quite easily), we arrived at a third case, also coffin-shaped, and varying from the second one in no particular, except in that of its material, which was cedar, and still emitted the peculiar and highly aromatic odor of that wood. between the second and the third case there was no interval--the one fitting accurately within the other. removing the third case, we discovered and took out the body itself. we had expected to find it, as usual, enveloped in frequent rolls, or bandages, of linen; but, in place of these, we found a sort of sheath, made of papyrus, and coated with a layer of plaster, thickly gilt and painted. the paintings represented subjects connected with the various supposed duties of the soul, and its presentation to different divinities, with numerous identical human figures, intended, very probably, as portraits of the persons embalmed. extending from head to foot was a columnar, or perpendicular, inscription, in phonetic hieroglyphics, giving again his name and titles, and the names and titles of his relations. around the neck thus ensheathed, was a collar of cylindrical glass beads, diverse in color, and so arranged as to form images of deities, of the scarabaeus, etc, with the winged globe. around the small of the waist was a similar collar or belt. stripping off the papyrus, we found the flesh in excellent preservation, with no perceptible odor. the color was reddish. the skin was hard, smooth, and glossy. the teeth and hair were in good condition. the eyes (it seemed) had been removed, and glass ones substituted, which were very beautiful and wonderfully life-like, with the exception of somewhat too determined a stare. the fingers and the nails were brilliantly gilded. mr. gliddon was of opinion, from the redness of the epidermis, that the embalmment had been effected altogether by asphaltum; but, on scraping the surface with a steel instrument, and throwing into the fire some of the powder thus obtained, the flavor of camphor and other sweet-scented gums became apparent. we searched the corpse very carefully for the usual openings through which the entrails are extracted, but, to our surprise, we could discover none. no member of the party was at that period aware that entire or unopened mummies are not infrequently met. the brain it was customary to withdraw through the nose; the intestines through an incision in the side; the body was then shaved, washed, and salted; then laid aside for several weeks, when the operation of embalming, properly so called, began. as no trace of an opening could be found, doctor ponnonner was preparing his instruments for dissection, when i observed that it was then past two o’clock. hereupon it was agreed to postpone the internal examination until the next evening; and we were about to separate for the present, when some one suggested an experiment or two with the voltaic pile. the application of electricity to a mummy three or four thousand years old at the least, was an idea, if not very sage, still sufficiently original, and we all caught it at once. about one-tenth in earnest and nine-tenths in jest, we arranged a battery in the doctor’s study, and conveyed thither the egyptian. it was only after much trouble that we succeeded in laying bare some portions of the temporal muscle which appeared of less stony rigidity than other parts of the frame, but which, as we had anticipated, of course, gave no indication of galvanic susceptibility when brought in contact with the wire. this, the first trial, indeed, seemed decisive, and, with a hearty laugh at our own absurdity, we were bidding each other good night, when my eyes, happening to fall upon those of the mummy, were there immediately riveted in amazement. my brief glance, in fact, had sufficed to assure me that the orbs which we had all supposed to be glass, and which were originally noticeable for a certain wild stare, were now so far covered by the lids, that only a small portion of the _tunica albuginea_ remained visible. with a shout i called attention to the fact, and it became immediately obvious to all. i cannot say that i was alarmed at the phenomenon, because “alarmed” is, in my case, not exactly the word. it is possible, however, that, but for the brown stout, i might have been a little nervous. as for the rest of the company, they really made no attempt at concealing the downright fright which possessed them. doctor ponnonner was a man to be pitied. mr. gliddon, by some peculiar process, rendered himself invisible. mr. silk buckingham, i fancy, will scarcely be so bold as to deny that he made his way, upon all fours, under the table. after the first shock of astonishment, however, we resolved, as a matter of course, upon further experiment forthwith. our operations were now directed against the great toe of the right foot. we made an incision over the outside of the exterior _os sesamoideum pollicis pedis,_ and thus got at the root of the abductor muscle. readjusting the battery, we now applied the fluid to the bisected nerves--when, with a movement of exceeding life-likeness, the mummy first drew up its right knee so as to bring it nearly in contact with the abdomen, and then, straightening the limb with inconceivable force, bestowed a kick upon doctor ponnonner, which had the effect of discharging that gentleman, like an arrow from a catapult, through a window into the street below. we rushed out _en masse_ to bring in the mangled remains of the victim, but had the happiness to meet him upon the staircase, coming up in an unaccountable hurry, brimful of the most ardent philosophy, and more than ever impressed with the necessity of prosecuting our experiment with vigor and with zeal. it was by his advice, accordingly, that we made, upon the spot, a profound incision into the tip of the subject’s nose, while the doctor himself, laying violent hands upon it, pulled it into vehement contact with the wire. morally and physically--figuratively and literally--was the effect electric. in the first place, the corpse opened its eyes and winked very rapidly for several minutes, as does mr. barnes in the pantomime, in the second place, it sneezed; in the third, it sat upon end; in the fourth, it shook its fist in doctor ponnonner’s face; in the fifth, turning to messieurs gliddon and buckingham, it addressed them, in very capital egyptian, thus: “i must say, gentlemen, that i am as much surprised as i am mortified at your behavior. of doctor ponnonner nothing better was to be expected. he is a poor little fat fool who knows no better. i pity and forgive him. but you, mr. gliddon--and you, silk--who have travelled and resided in egypt until one might imagine you to the manner born--you, i say who have been so much among us that you speak egyptian fully as well, i think, as you write your mother tongue--you, whom i have always been led to regard as the firm friend of the mummies--i really did anticipate more gentlemanly conduct from you. what am i to think of your standing quietly by and seeing me thus unhandsomely used? what am i to suppose by your permitting tom, dick, and harry to strip me of my coffins, and my clothes, in this wretchedly cold climate? in what light (to come to the point) am i to regard your aiding and abetting that miserable little villain, doctor ponnonner, in pulling me by the nose?” it will be taken for granted, no doubt, that upon hearing this speech under the circumstances, we all either made for the door, or fell into violent hysterics, or went off in a general swoon. one of these three things was, i say, to be expected. indeed each and all of these lines of conduct might have been very plausibly pursued. and, upon my word, i am at a loss to know how or why it was that we pursued neither the one nor the other. but, perhaps, the true reason is to be sought in the spirit of the age, which proceeds by the rule of contraries altogether, and is now usually admitted as the solution of every thing in the way of paradox and impossibility. or, perhaps, after all, it was only the mummy’s exceedingly natural and matter-of-course air that divested his words of the terrible. however this may be, the facts are clear, and no member of our party betrayed any very particular trepidation, or seemed to consider that any thing had gone very especially wrong. for my part i was convinced it was all right, and merely stepped aside, out of the range of the egyptian’s fist. doctor ponnonner thrust his hands into his breeches’ pockets, looked hard at the mummy, and grew excessively red in the face. mr. glidden stroked his whiskers and drew up the collar of his shirt. mr. buckingham hung down his head, and put his right thumb into the left corner of his mouth. the egyptian regarded him with a severe countenance for some minutes and at length, with a sneer, said: “why don’t you speak, mr. buckingham? did you hear what i asked you, or not? do take your thumb out of your mouth!” mr. buckingham, hereupon, gave a slight start, took his right thumb out of the left corner of his mouth, and, by way of indemnification inserted his left thumb in the right corner of the aperture above-mentioned. not being able to get an answer from mr. b., the figure turned peevishly to mr. gliddon, and, in a peremptory tone, demanded in general terms what we all meant. mr. gliddon replied at great length, in phonetics; and but for the deficiency of american printing-offices in hieroglyphical type, it would afford me much pleasure to record here, in the original, the whole of his very excellent speech. i may as well take this occasion to remark, that all the subsequent conversation in which the mummy took a part, was carried on in primitive egyptian, through the medium (so far as concerned myself and other untravelled members of the company)--through the medium, i say, of messieurs gliddon and buckingham, as interpreters. these gentlemen spoke the mother tongue of the mummy with inimitable fluency and grace; but i could not help observing that (owing, no doubt, to the introduction of images entirely modern, and, of course, entirely novel to the stranger) the two travellers were reduced, occasionally, to the employment of sensible forms for the purpose of conveying a particular meaning. mr. gliddon, at one period, for example, could not make the egyptian comprehend the term “politics,” until he sketched upon the wall, with a bit of charcoal a little carbuncle-nosed gentleman, out at elbows, standing upon a stump, with his left leg drawn back, right arm thrown forward, with his fist shut, the eyes rolled up toward heaven, and the mouth open at an angle of ninety degrees. just in the same way mr. buckingham failed to convey the absolutely modern idea “wig,” until (at doctor ponnonner’s suggestion) he grew very pale in the face, and consented to take off his own. it will be readily understood that mr. gliddon’s discourse turned chiefly upon the vast benefits accruing to science from the unrolling and disembowelling of mummies; apologizing, upon this score, for any disturbance that might have been occasioned him, in particular, the individual mummy called allamistakeo; and concluding with a mere hint (for it could scarcely be considered more) that, as these little matters were now explained, it might be as well to proceed with the investigation intended. here doctor ponnonner made ready his instruments. in regard to the latter suggestions of the orator, it appears that allamistakeo had certain scruples of conscience, the nature of which i did not distinctly learn; but he expressed himself satisfied with the apologies tendered, and, getting down from the table, shook hands with the company all round. when this ceremony was at an end, we immediately busied ourselves in repairing the damages which our subject had sustained from the scalpel. we sewed up the wound in his temple, bandaged his foot, and applied a square inch of black plaster to the tip of his nose. it was now observed that the count (this was the title, it seems, of allamistakeo) had a slight fit of shivering--no doubt from the cold. the doctor immediately repaired to his wardrobe, and soon returned with a black dress coat, made in jennings’ best manner, a pair of sky-blue plaid pantaloons with straps, a pink gingham chemise, a flapped vest of brocade, a white sack overcoat, a walking cane with a hook, a hat with no brim, patent-leather boots, straw-colored kid gloves, an eye-glass, a pair of whiskers, and a waterfall cravat. owing to the disparity of size between the count and the doctor (the proportion being as two to one), there was some little difficulty in adjusting these habiliments upon the person of the egyptian; but when all was arranged, he might have been said to be dressed. mr. gliddon, therefore, gave him his arm, and led him to a comfortable chair by the fire, while the doctor rang the bell upon the spot and ordered a supply of cigars and wine. the conversation soon grew animated. much curiosity was, of course, expressed in regard to the somewhat remarkable fact of allamistakeo’s still remaining alive. “i should have thought,” observed mr. buckingham, “that it is high time you were dead.” “why,” replied the count, very much astonished, “i am little more than seven hundred years old! my father lived a thousand, and was by no means in his dotage when he died.” here ensued a brisk series of questions and computations, by means of which it became evident that the antiquity of the mummy had been grossly misjudged. it had been five thousand and fifty years and some months since he had been consigned to the catacombs at eleithias. “but my remark,” resumed mr. buckingham, “had no reference to your age at the period of interment (i am willing to grant, in fact, that you are still a young man), and my illusion was to the immensity of time during which, by your own showing, you must have been done up in asphaltum.” “in what?” said the count. “in asphaltum,” persisted mr. b. “ah, yes; i have some faint notion of what you mean; it might be made to answer, no doubt--but in my time we employed scarcely any thing else than the bichloride of mercury.” “but what we are especially at a loss to understand,” said doctor ponnonner, “is how it happens that, having been dead and buried in egypt five thousand years ago, you are here to-day all alive and looking so delightfully well.” “had i been, as you say, dead,” replied the count, “it is more than probable that dead, i should still be; for i perceive you are yet in the infancy of calvanism, and cannot accomplish with it what was a common thing among us in the old days. but the fact is, i fell into catalepsy, and it was considered by my best friends that i was either dead or should be; they accordingly embalmed me at once--i presume you are aware of the chief principle of the embalming process?” “why not altogether.” “why, i perceive--a deplorable condition of ignorance! well i cannot enter into details just now: but it is necessary to explain that to embalm (properly speaking), in egypt, was to arrest indefinitely all the animal functions subjected to the process. i use the word ‘animal’ in its widest sense, as including the physical not more than the moral and vital being. i repeat that the leading principle of embalmment consisted, with us, in the immediately arresting, and holding in perpetual abeyance, all the animal functions subjected to the process. to be brief, in whatever condition the individual was, at the period of embalmment, in that condition he remained. now, as it is my good fortune to be of the blood of the scarabaeus, i was embalmed alive, as you see me at present.” “the blood of the scarabaeus!” exclaimed doctor ponnonner. “yes. the scarabaeus was the insignium or the ‘arms,’ of a very distinguished and very rare patrician family. to be ‘of the blood of the scarabaeus,’ is merely to be one of that family of which the scarabaeus is the insignium. i speak figuratively.” “but what has this to do with you being alive?” “why, it is the general custom in egypt to deprive a corpse, before embalmment, of its bowels and brains; the race of the scarabaei alone did not coincide with the custom. had i not been a scarabeus, therefore, i should have been without bowels and brains; and without either it is inconvenient to live.” “i perceive that,” said mr. buckingham, “and i presume that all the entire mummies that come to hand are of the race of scarabaei.” “beyond doubt.” “i thought,” said mr. gliddon, very meekly, “that the scarabaeus was one of the egyptian gods.” “one of the egyptian _what?”_ exclaimed the mummy, starting to its feet. “gods!” repeated the traveller. “mr. gliddon, i really am astonished to hear you talk in this style,” said the count, resuming his chair. “no nation upon the face of the earth has ever acknowledged more than one god. the scarabaeus, the ibis, etc., were with us (as similar creatures have been with others) the symbols, or media, through which we offered worship to the creator too august to be more directly approached.” there was here a pause. at length the colloquy was renewed by doctor ponnonner. “it is not improbable, then, from what you have explained,” said he, “that among the catacombs near the nile there may exist other mummies of the scarabaeus tribe, in a condition of vitality?” “there can be no question of it,” replied the count; “all the scarabaei embalmed accidentally while alive, are alive now. even some of those purposely so embalmed, may have been overlooked by their executors, and still remain in the tomb.” “will you be kind enough to explain,” i said, “what you mean by ‘purposely so embalmed’?” “with great pleasure!” answered the mummy, after surveying me leisurely through his eye-glass--for it was the first time i had ventured to address him a direct question. “with great pleasure,” he said. “the usual duration of man’s life, in my time, was about eight hundred years. few men died, unless by most extraordinary accident, before the age of six hundred; few lived longer than a decade of centuries; but eight were considered the natural term. after the discovery of the embalming principle, as i have already described it to you, it occurred to our philosophers that a laudable curiosity might be gratified, and, at the same time, the interests of science much advanced, by living this natural term in installments. in the case of history, indeed, experience demonstrated that something of this kind was indispensable. an historian, for example, having attained the age of five hundred, would write a book with great labor and then get himself carefully embalmed; leaving instructions to his executors pro tem., that they should cause him to be revivified after the lapse of a certain period--say five or six hundred years. resuming existence at the expiration of this time, he would invariably find his great work converted into a species of hap-hazard note-book--that is to say, into a kind of literary arena for the conflicting guesses, riddles, and personal squabbles of whole herds of exasperated commentators. these guesses, etc., which passed under the name of annotations, or emendations, were found so completely to have enveloped, distorted, and overwhelmed the text, that the author had to go about with a lantern to discover his own book. when discovered, it was never worth the trouble of the search. after re-writing it throughout, it was regarded as the bounden duty of the historian to set himself to work immediately in correcting, from his own private knowledge and experience, the traditions of the day concerning the epoch at which he had originally lived. now this process of re-scription and personal rectification, pursued by various individual sages from time to time, had the effect of preventing our history from degenerating into absolute fable.” “i beg your pardon,” said doctor ponnonner at this point, laying his hand gently upon the arm of the egyptian--“i beg your pardon, sir, but may i presume to interrupt you for one moment?” “by all means, sir,” replied the count, drawing up. “i merely wished to ask you a question,” said the doctor. “you mentioned the historian’s personal correction of traditions respecting his own epoch. pray, sir, upon an average what proportion of these kabbala were usually found to be right?” “the kabbala, as you properly term them, sir, were generally discovered to be precisely on a par with the facts recorded in the un-re-written histories themselves;--that is to say, not one individual iota of either was ever known, under any circumstances, to be not totally and radically wrong.” “but since it is quite clear,” resumed the doctor, “that at least five thousand years have elapsed since your entombment, i take it for granted that your histories at that period, if not your traditions were sufficiently explicit on that one topic of universal interest, the creation, which took place, as i presume you are aware, only about ten centuries before.” “sir!” said the count allamistakeo. the doctor repeated his remarks, but it was only after much additional explanation that the foreigner could be made to comprehend them. the latter at length said, hesitatingly: “the ideas you have suggested are to me, i confess, utterly novel. during my time i never knew any one to entertain so singular a fancy as that the universe (or this world if you will have it so) ever had a beginning at all. i remember once, and once only, hearing something remotely hinted, by a man of many speculations, concerning the origin _of the human race;_ and by this individual, the very word _adam_ (or red earth), which you make use of, was employed. he employed it, however, in a generical sense, with reference to the spontaneous germination from rank soil (just as a thousand of the lower genera of creatures are germinated)--the spontaneous germination, i say, of five vast hordes of men, simultaneously upspringing in five distinct and nearly equal divisions of the globe.” here, in general, the company shrugged their shoulders, and one or two of us touched our foreheads with a very significant air. mr. silk buckingham, first glancing slightly at the occiput and then at the sinciput of allamistakeo, spoke as follows: “the long duration of human life in your time, together with the occasional practice of passing it, as you have explained, in installments, must have had, indeed, a strong tendency to the general development and conglomeration of knowledge. i presume, therefore, that we are to attribute the marked inferiority of the old egyptians in all particulars of science, when compared with the moderns, and more especially with the yankees, altogether to the superior solidity of the egyptian skull.” “i confess again,” replied the count, with much suavity, “that i am somewhat at a loss to comprehend you; pray, to what particulars of science do you allude?” here our whole party, joining voices, detailed, at great length, the assumptions of phrenology and the marvels of animal magnetism. having heard us to an end, the count proceeded to relate a few anecdotes, which rendered it evident that prototypes of gall and spurzheim had flourished and faded in egypt so long ago as to have been nearly forgotten, and that the manoeuvres of mesmer were really very contemptible tricks when put in collation with the positive miracles of the theban savans, who created lice and a great many other similar things. i here asked the count if his people were able to calculate eclipses. he smiled rather contemptuously, and said they were. this put me a little out, but i began to make other inquiries in regard to his astronomical knowledge, when a member of the company, who had never as yet opened his mouth, whispered in my ear, that for information on this head, i had better consult ptolemy (whoever ptolemy is), as well as one plutarch de facie lunae. i then questioned the mummy about burning-glasses and lenses, and, in general, about the manufacture of glass; but i had not made an end of my queries before the silent member again touched me quietly on the elbow, and begged me for god’s sake to take a peep at diodorus siculus. as for the count, he merely asked me, in the way of reply, if we moderns possessed any such microscopes as would enable us to cut cameos in the style of the egyptians. while i was thinking how i should answer this question, little doctor ponnonner committed himself in a very extraordinary way. “look at our architecture!” he exclaimed, greatly to the indignation of both the travellers, who pinched him black and blue to no purpose. “look,” he cried with enthusiasm, “at the bowling-green fountain in new york! or if this be too vast a contemplation, regard for a moment the capitol at washington, d. c.!”--and the good little medical man went on to detail very minutely, the proportions of the fabric to which he referred. he explained that the portico alone was adorned with no less than four and twenty columns, five feet in diameter, and ten feet apart. the count said that he regretted not being able to remember, just at that moment, the precise dimensions of any one of the principal buildings of the city of aznac, whose foundations were laid in the night of time, but the ruins of which were still standing, at the epoch of his entombment, in a vast plain of sand to the westward of thebes. he recollected, however, (talking of the porticoes,) that one affixed to an inferior palace in a kind of suburb called carnac, consisted of a hundred and forty-four columns, thirty-seven feet in circumference, and twenty-five feet apart. the approach to this portico, from the nile, was through an avenue two miles long, composed of sphynxes, statues, and obelisks, twenty, sixty, and a hundred feet in height. the palace itself (as well as he could remember) was, in one direction, two miles long, and might have been altogether about seven in circuit. its walls were richly painted all over, within and without, with hieroglyphics. he would not pretend to assert that even fifty or sixty of the doctor’s capitols might have been built within these walls, but he was by no means sure that two or three hundred of them might not have been squeezed in with some trouble. that palace at carnac was an insignificant little building after all. he (the count), however, could not conscientiously refuse to admit the ingenuity, magnificence, and superiority of the fountain at the bowling green, as described by the doctor. nothing like it, he was forced to allow, had ever been seen in egypt or elsewhere. i here asked the count what he had to say to our railroads. “nothing,” he replied, “in particular.” they were rather slight, rather ill-conceived, and clumsily put together. they could not be compared, of course, with the vast, level, direct, iron-grooved causeways upon which the egyptians conveyed entire temples and solid obelisks of a hundred and fifty feet in altitude. i spoke of our gigantic mechanical forces. he agreed that we knew something in that way, but inquired how i should have gone to work in getting up the imposts on the lintels of even the little palace at carnac. this question i concluded not to hear, and demanded if he had any idea of artesian wells; but he simply raised his eyebrows; while mr. gliddon winked at me very hard and said, in a low tone, that one had been recently discovered by the engineers employed to bore for water in the great oasis. i then mentioned our steel; but the foreigner elevated his nose, and asked me if our steel could have executed the sharp carved work seen on the obelisks, and which was wrought altogether by edge-tools of copper. this disconcerted us so greatly that we thought it advisable to vary the attack to metaphysics. we sent for a copy of a book called the “dial,” and read out of it a chapter or two about something that is not very clear, but which the bostonians call the great movement of progress. the count merely said that great movements were awfully common things in his day, and as for progress, it was at one time quite a nuisance, but it never progressed. we then spoke of the great beauty and importance of democracy, and were at much trouble in impressing the count with a due sense of the advantages we enjoyed in living where there was suffrage ad libitum, and no king. he listened with marked interest, and in fact seemed not a little amused. when we had done, he said that, a great while ago, there had occurred something of a very similar sort. thirteen egyptian provinces determined all at once to be free, and to set a magnificent example to the rest of mankind. they assembled their wise men, and concocted the most ingenious constitution it is possible to conceive. for a while they managed remarkably well; only their habit of bragging was prodigious. the thing ended, however, in the consolidation of the thirteen states, with some fifteen or twenty others, in the most odious and insupportable despotism that was ever heard of upon the face of the earth. i asked what was the name of the usurping tyrant. as well as the count could recollect, it was mob. not knowing what to say to this, i raised my voice, and deplored the egyptian ignorance of steam. the count looked at me with much astonishment, but made no answer. the silent gentleman, however, gave me a violent nudge in the ribs with his elbows--told me i had sufficiently exposed myself for once--and demanded if i was really such a fool as not to know that the modern steam-engine is derived from the invention of hero, through solomon de caus. we were now in imminent danger of being discomfited; but, as good luck would have it, doctor ponnonner, having rallied, returned to our rescue, and inquired if the people of egypt would seriously pretend to rival the moderns in the all--important particular of dress. the count, at this, glanced downward to the straps of his pantaloons, and then taking hold of the end of one of his coat-tails, held it up close to his eyes for some minutes. letting it fall, at last, his mouth extended itself very gradually from ear to ear; but i do not remember that he said any thing in the way of reply. hereupon we recovered our spirits, and the doctor, approaching the mummy with great dignity, desired it to say candidly, upon its honor as a gentleman, if the egyptians had comprehended, at any period, the manufacture of either ponnonner’s lozenges or brandreth’s pills. we looked, with profound anxiety, for an answer--but in vain. it was not forthcoming. the egyptian blushed and hung down his head. never was triumph more consummate; never was defeat borne with so ill a grace. indeed, i could not endure the spectacle of the poor mummy’s mortification. i reached my hat, bowed to him stiffly, and took leave. upon getting home i found it past four o’clock, and went immediately to bed. it is now ten a.m. i have been up since seven, penning these memoranda for the benefit of my family and of mankind. the former i shall behold no more. my wife is a shrew. the truth is, i am heartily sick of this life and of the nineteenth century in general. i am convinced that every thing is going wrong. besides, i am anxious to know who will be president in <UNK> as soon, therefore, as i shave and swallow a cup of coffee, i shall just step over to ponnonner’s and get embalmed for a couple of hundred years. the poetic principle in speaking of the poetic principle, i have no design to be either thorough or profound. while discussing, very much at random, the essentiality of what we call poetry, my principal purpose will be to cite for consideration, some few of those minor english or american poems which best suit my own taste, or which, upon my own fancy, have left the most definite impression. by “minor poems” i mean, of course, poems of little length. and here, in the beginning, permit me to say a few words in regard to a somewhat peculiar principle, which, whether rightfully or wrongfully, has always had its influence in my own critical estimate of the poem. i hold that a long poem does not exist. i maintain that the phrase, “a long poem,” is simply a flat contradiction in terms. i need scarcely observe that a poem deserves its title only inasmuch as it excites, by elevating the soul. the value of the poem is in the ratio of this elevating excitement. but all excitements are, through a psychal necessity, transient. that degree of excitement which would entitle a poem to be so called at all, cannot be sustained throughout a composition of any great length. after the lapse of half an hour, at the very utmost, it flags--fails--a revulsion ensues--and then the poem is, in effect, and in fact, no longer such. there are, no doubt, many who have found difficulty in reconciling the critical dictum that the “paradise lost” is to be devoutly admired throughout, with the absolute impossibility of maintaining for it, during perusal, the amount of enthusiasm which that critical dictum would demand. this great work, in fact, is to be regarded as poetical, only when, losing sight of that vital requisite in all works of art, unity, we view it merely as a series of minor poems. if, to preserve its unity--its totality of effect or impression--we read it (as would be necessary) at a single sitting, the result is but a constant alternation of excitement and depression. after a passage of what we feel to be true poetry, there follows, inevitably, a passage of platitude which no critical prejudgment can force us to admire; but if, upon completing the work, we read it again, omitting the first book--that is to say, commencing with the second--we shall be surprised at now finding that admirable which we before condemned--that damnable which we had previously so much admired. it follows from all this that the ultimate, aggregate, or absolute effect of even the best epic under the sun, is a nullity:--and this is precisely the fact. in regard to the iliad, we have, if not positive proof, at least very good reason for believing it intended as a series of lyrics; but, granting the epic intention, i can say only that the work is based in an imperfect sense of art. the modern epic is, of the supposititious ancient model, but an inconsiderate and blindfold imitation. but the day of these artistic anomalies is over. if, at any time, any very long poem _were _popular in reality, which i doubt, it is at least clear that no very long poem will ever be popular again. that the extent of a poetical work is, _ceteris paribus, _the measure of its merit, seems undoubtedly, when we thus state it, a proposition sufficiently absurd--yet we are indebted for it to the quarterly reviews. surely there can be nothing in mere _size, _abstractly considered--there can be nothing in mere _bulk, so _far as a volume is concerned, which has so continuously elicited admiration from these saturnine pamphlets! a mountain, to be sure, by the mere sentiment of physical magnitude which it conveys, _does _impress us with a sense of the sublime--but no man is impressed after _this _fashion by the material grandeur of even “the columbiad.” even the quarterlies have not instructed us to be so impressed by it. as _yet, _they have not _insisted _on our estimating “lamar” tine by the cubic foot, or pollock by the pound--but what else are we to _infer _from their continual plating about “sustained effort”? if, by “sustained effort,” any little gentleman has accomplished an epic, let us frankly commend him for the effort--if this indeed be a thing conk mendable--but let us forbear praising the epic on the effort’s account. it is to be hoped that common sense, in the time to come, will prefer deciding upon a work of art rather by the impression it makes--by the effect it produces--than by the time it took to impress the effect, or by the amount of “sustained effort” which had been found necessary in effecting the impression. the fact is, that perseverance is one thing and genius quite another--nor can all the quarterlies in christendom confound them. by and by, this proposition, with many which i have been just urging, will be received as self-evident. in the meantime, by being generally condemned as falsities, they will not be essentially damaged as truths. on the other hand, it is clear that a poem may be improperly brief. undue brevity degenerates into mere epigrammatism. a very short poem, while now and then producing a brilliant or vivid, never produces a profound or enduring effect. there must be the steady pressing down of the stamp upon the wax. de beranger has wrought innumerable things, pungent and spirit-stirring, but in general they have been too imponderous to stamp themselves deeply into the public attention, and thus, as so many feathers of fancy, have been blown aloft only to be whistled down the wind. a remarkable instance of the effect of undue brevity in depressing a poem, in keeping it out of the popular view, is afforded by the following exquisite little serenade-- i arise from dreams of thee in the first sweet sleep of night, when the winds are breathing low, and the stars are shining bright. i arise from dreams of thee, and a spirit in my feet has led me--who knows how?-- to thy chamber-window, sweet! the wandering airs they faint on the dark the silent stream-- the champak odors fail like sweet thoughts in a dream; the nightingale’s complaint, it dies upon her heart, as i must die on shine, o, beloved as thou art! o, lift me from the grass! i die, i faint, i fail! let thy love in kisses rain on my lips and eyelids pale. my cheek is cold and white, alas! my heart beats loud and fast: o, press it close to shine again, where it will break at last. very few perhaps are familiar with these lines--yet no less a poet than shelley is their author. their warm, yet delicate and ethereal imagination will be appreciated by all, but by none so thoroughly as by him who has himself arisen from sweet dreams of one beloved to bathe in the aromatic air of a southern midsummer night. one of the finest poems by willis--the very best in my opinion which he has ever written--has no doubt, through this same defect of undue brevity, been kept back from its proper position, not less in the the shadows lay along broadway, ‘twas near the twilight-tide-- and slowly there a lady fair was walking in her pride. alone walk’d she; but, viewlessly, walk’d spirits at her side. peace charm’d the street beneath her feet, and honor charm’d the air; and all astir looked kind on her, and called her good as fair-- for all god ever gave to her she kept with chary care. she kept with care her beauties rare from lovers warm and true-- for heart was cold to all but gold, and the rich came not to won, but honor’d well her charms to sell. if priests the selling do. now walking there was one more fair-- a slight girl, lily-pale; and she had unseen company to make the spirit quail-- ‘twixt want and scorn she walk’d forlorn, and nothing could avail. no mercy now can clear her brow from this world’s peace to pray for as love’s wild prayer dissolved in air, her woman’s heart gave way!-- but the sin forgiven by christ in heaven by man is cursed alway! in this composition we find it difficult to recognize the willis who has written so many mere “verses of society.” the lines are not only richly ideal, but full of energy, while they breathe an earnestness, an evident sincerity of sentiment, for which we look in vain throughout all the other works of this author. while the epic mania, while the idea that to merit in poetry prolixity is indispensable, has for some years past been gradually dying out of the public mind, by mere dint of its own absurdity, we find it succeeded by a heresy too palpably false to be long tolerated, but one which, in the brief period it has already endured, may be said to have accomplished more in the corruption of our poetical literature than all its other enemies combined. i allude to the heresy of _the didactic. _it has been assumed, tacitly and avowedly, directly and indirectly, that the ultimate object of all poetry is truth. every poem, it is said, should inculcate a morals and by this moral is the poetical merit of the work to be adjudged. we americans especially have patronized this happy idea, and we bostonians very especially have developed it in full. we have taken it into our heads that to write a poem simply for the poem’s sake, and to acknowledge such to have been our design, would be to confess ourselves radically wanting in the true poetic dignity and force:--but the simple fact is that would we but permit ourselves to look into our own souls we should immediately there discover that under the sun there neither exists nor _can _exist any work more thoroughly dignified, more supremely noble, than this very poem, this poem _per se, _this poem which is a poem and nothing more, this poem written solely for the poem’s sake. with as deep a reverence for the true as ever inspired the bosom of man, i would nevertheless limit, in some measure, its modes of inculcation. i would limit to enforce them. i would not enfeeble them by dissipation. the demands of truth are severe. she has no sympathy with the myrtles. all _that _which is so indispensable in song is precisely all _that _with which _she _has nothing whatever to do. it is but making her a flaunting paradox to wreathe her in gems and flowers. in enforcing a truth we need severity rather than efflorescence of language. we must be simple, precise, terse. we must be cool, calm, unimpassioned. in a word, we must be in that mood which, as nearly as possible, is the exact converse of the poetical. _he _must be blind indeed who does not perceive the radical and chasmal difference between the truthful and the poetical modes of inculcation. he must be theory-mad beyond redemption who, in spite of these differences, shall still persist in attempting to reconcile the obstinate oils and waters of poetry and truth. dividing the world of mind into its three most immediately obvious distinctions, we have the pure intellect, taste, and the moral sense. i place taste in the middle, because it is just this position which in the mind it occupies. it holds intimate relations with either extreme; but from the moral sense is separated by so faint a difference that aristotle has not hesitated to place some of its operations among the virtues themselves. nevertheless we find the _offices _of the trio marked with a sufficient distinction. just as the intellect concerns itself with truth, so taste informs us of the beautiful, while the moral sense is regardful of duty. of this latter, while conscience teaches the obligation, and reason the expediency, taste contents herself with displaying the charms:--waging war upon vice solely on the ground of her deformity--her disproportion--her animosity to the fitting, to the appropriate, to the harmonious--in a word, to beauty. an immortal instinct deep within the spirit of man is thus plainly a sense of the beautiful. this it is which administers to his delight in the manifold forms, and sounds, and odors and sentiments amid which he exists. and just as the lily is repeated in the lake, or the eyes of amaryllis in the mirror, so is the mere oral or written repetition of these forms, and sounds, and colors, and odors, and sentiments a duplicate source of the light. but this mere repetition is not poetry. he who shall simply sing, with however glowing enthusiasm, or with however vivid a truth of description, of the sights, and sounds, and odors, and colors, and sentiments which greet _him _in common with all mankind--he, i say, has yet failed to prove his divine title. there is still a something in the distance which he has been unable to attain. we have still a thirst unquenchable, to allay which he has not shown us the crystal springs. this thirst belongs to the immortality of man. it is at once a consequence and an indication of his perennial existence. it is the desire of the moth for the star. it is no mere appreciation of the beauty before us, but a wild effort to reach the beauty above. inspired by an ecstatic prescience of the glories beyond the grave, we struggle by multiform combinations among the things and thoughts of time to attain a portion of that loveliness whose very elements perhaps appertain to eternity alone. and thus when by poetry, or when by music, the most entrancing of the poetic moods, we find ourselves melted into tears, we weep then, not as the abbate gravina supposes, through excess of pleasure, but through a certain petulant, impatient sorrow at our inability to grasp now, wholly, here on earth, at once and for ever, those divine and rapturous joys of which _through’ _the poem, or _through _the music, we attain to but brief and indeterminate glimpses. the struggle to apprehend the supernal loveliness--this struggle, on the part of souls fittingly constituted--has given to the world all _that _which it (the world) has ever been enabled at once to understand and _to feel _as poetic. the poetic sentiment, of course, may develop itself in various modes--in painting, in sculpture, in architecture, in the dance--very especially in music--and very peculiarly, and with a wide field, in the com position of the landscape garden. our present theme, however, has regard only to its manifestation in words. and here let me speak briefly on the topic of rhythm. contenting myself with the certainty that music, in its various modes of metre, rhythm, and rhyme, is of so vast a moment in poetry as never to be wisely rejected--is so vitally important an adjunct, that he is simply silly who declines its assistance, i will not now pause to maintain its absolute essentiality. it is in music perhaps that the soul most nearly attains the great end for which, when inspired by the poetic sentiment, it struggles--the creation of supernal beauty. it _may _be, indeed, that here this sublime end is, now and then, attained in _fact. _we are often made to feel, with a shivering delight, that from an earthly harp are stricken notes which _cannot _have been unfamiliar to the angels. and thus there can be little doubt that in the union of poetry with music in its popular sense, we shall find the widest field for the poetic development. the old bards and minnesingers had advantages which we do not possess--and thomas moore, singing his own songs, was, in the most legitimate manner, perfecting them as poems. to recapitulate then:--i would define, in brief, the poetry of words as _the rhythmical creation of beauty. _its sole arbiter is taste. with the intellect or with the conscience it has only collateral relations. unless incidentally, it has no concern whatever either with duty or with truth. a few words, however, in explanation. _that _pleasure which is at once the most pure, the most elevating, and the most intense, is derived, i maintain, from the contemplation of the beautiful. in the contemplation of beauty we alone find it possible to attain that pleasurable elevation, or excitement _of the soul, _which we recognize as the poetic sentiment, and which is so easily distinguished from truth, which is the satisfaction of the reason, or from passion, which is the excitement of the heart. i make beauty, therefore--using the word as inclusive of the sublime--i make beauty the province of the poem, simply because it is an obvious rule of art that effects should be made to spring as directly as possible from their causes:--no one as yet having been weak enough to deny that the peculiar elevation in question is at least _most readily _attainable in the poem. it by no means follows, however, that the incitements of passion’ or the precepts of duty, or even the lessons of truth, may not be introduced into a poem, and with advantage; for they may subserve incidentally, in various ways, the general purposes of the work: but the true artist will always contrive to tone them down in proper subjection to that _beauty _which is the atmosphere and the real essence of the poem. i cannot better introduce the few poems which i shall present for your consideration, than by the citation of the proem to longfellow’s “waif”:-- the day is done, and the darkness falls from the wings of night, as a feather is wafted downward from an eagle in his flight. i see the lights of the village gleam through the rain and the mist, and a feeling of sadness comes o’er me, that my soul cannot resist; a feeling of sadness and longing, that is not akin to pain, and resembles sorrow only as the mist resembles the rain. come, read to me some poem, some simple and heartfelt lay, that shall soothe this restless feeling, and banish the thoughts of day. not from the grand old masters, not from the bards sublime, whose distant footsteps echo through the corridors of time. for, like strains of martial music, their mighty thoughts suggest life’s endless toil and endeavor; and to-night i long for rest. read from some humbler poet, whose songs gushed from his heart, as showers from the clouds of summer, or tears from the eyelids start; who through long days of labor, and nights devoid of ease, still heard in his soul the music of wonderful melodies. such songs have power to quiet the restless pulse of care, and come like the benediction that follows after prayer. then read from the treasured volume the poem of thy choice, and lend to the rhyme of the poet the beauty of thy voice. and the night shall be filled with music, and the cares that infest the day shall fold their tents like the arabs, and as silently steal away. with no great range of imagination, these lines have been justly admired for their delicacy of expression. some of the images are very effective. nothing can be better than-- ---------------the bards sublime, whose distant footsteps echo down the corridors of time. the idea of the last quatrain is also very effective. the poem on the whole, however, is chiefly to be admired for the graceful _insouciance _of its metre, so well in accordance with the character of the sentiments, and especially for the _ease _of the general manner. this “ease” or naturalness, in a literary style, it has long been the fashion to regard as ease in appearance alone--as a point of really difficult attainment. but not so:--a natural manner is difficult only to him who should never meddle with it--to the unnatural. it is but the result of writing with the understanding, or with the instinct, that _the tone, _in composition, should always be that which the mass of mankind would adopt--and must perpetually vary, of course, with the occasion. the author who, after the fashion of “the north american review,” should be upon _all _occasions merely “quiet,” must necessarily upon _many _occasions be simply silly, or stupid; and has no more right to be considered “easy” or “natural” than a cockney exquisite, or than the sleeping beauty in the waxworks. among the minor poems of bryant, none has so much impressed me as the one which he entitles “june.” i quote only a portion of it:-- there, through the long, long summer hours, the golden light should lie, and thick young herbs and groups of flowers stand in their beauty by. the oriole should build and tell his love-tale, close beside my cell; the idle butterfly should rest him there, and there be heard the housewife-bee and humming bird. and what, if cheerful shouts at noon, come, from the village sent, or songs of maids, beneath the moon, with fairy laughter blent? and what if, in the evening light, betrothed lovers walk in sight of my low monument? i would the lovely scene around might know no sadder sight nor sound. i know, i know i should not see the season’s glorious show, nor would its brightness shine for me; nor its wild music flow; but if, around my place of sleep, the friends i love should come to weep, they might not haste to go. soft airs and song, and the light and bloom, should keep them lingering by my tomb. these to their soften’d hearts should bear the thoughts of what has been, and speak of one who cannot share the gladness of the scene; whose part in all the pomp that fills the circuit of the summer hills, is--that his grave is green; and deeply would their hearts rejoice to hear again his living voice. the rhythmical flow here is even voluptuous--nothing could be more melodious. the poem has always affected me in a remarkable manner. the intense melancholy which seems to well up, perforce, to the surface of all the poet’s cheerful sayings about his grave, we find thrilling us to the soul--while there is the truest poetic elevation in the thrill. the impression left is one of a pleasurable sadness. and if, in the remaining compositions which i shall introduce to you, there be more or less of a similar tone always apparent, let me remind you that (how or why we know not) this certain taint of sadness is inseparably connected with all the higher manifestations of true beauty. it is, nevertheless, a feeling of sadness and longing that is not akin to pain, and resembles sorrow only as the mist resembles the rain. the taint of which i speak is clearly perceptible even in a poem so full of brilliancy and spirit as “the health” of edward coate pinckney:-- i fill this cup to one made up of loveliness alone, a woman, of her gentle sex the seeming paragon; to whom the better elements and kindly stars have given a form so fair that, like the air, ‘tis less of earth than heaven. her every tone is music’s own, like those of morning birds, and something more than melody dwells ever in her words; the coinage of her heart are they, and from her lips each flows as one may see the burden’d bee forth issue from the rose. affections are as thoughts to her, the measures of her hours; her feelings have the flagrancy, the freshness of young flowers; and lovely passions, changing oft, so fill her, she appears the image of themselves by turns,-- the idol of past years! of her bright face one glance will trace a picture on the brain, and of her voice in echoing hearts a sound must long remain; but memory, such as mine of her, so very much endears, when death is nigh my latest sigh will not be life’s, but hers. i fill’d this cup to one made up of loveliness alone, a woman, of her gentle sex the seeming paragon-- her health! and would on earth there stood, some more of such a frame, that life might be all poetry, and weariness a name. it was the misfortune of mr. pinckney to have been born too far south. had he been a new englander, it is probable that he would have been ranked as the first of american lyrists by that magnanimous cabal which has so long controlled the destinies of american letters, in conducting the thing called “the north american review.” the poem just cited is especially beautiful; but the poetic elevation which it induces we must refer chiefly to our sympathy in the poet’s enthusiasm. we pardon his hyperboles for the evident earnestness with which they are uttered. it was by no means my design, however, to expatiate upon the _merits _of what i should read you. these will necessarily speak for themselves. boccalini, in his “advertisements from parnassus,” tells us that zoilus once presented apollo a very caustic criticism upon a very admirable book:--whereupon the god asked him for the beauties of the work. he replied that he only busied himself about the errors. on hearing this, apollo, handing him a sack of unwinnowed wheat, bade him pick out _all the chaff _for his reward. now this fable answers very well as a hit at the critics--but i am by no means sure that the god was in the right. i am by no means certain that the true limits of the critical duty are not grossly misunderstood. excellence, in a poem especially, may be considered in the light of an axiom, which need only be properly _put, _to become self-evident. it is _not _excellence if it require to be demonstrated as such:--and thus to point out too particularly the merits of a work of art, is to admit that they are _not _merits altogether. among the “melodies” of thomas moore is one whose distinguished character as a poem proper seems to have been singularly left out of view. i allude to his lines beginning--“come, rest in this bosom.” the intense energy of their expression is not surpassed by anything in byron. there are two of the lines in which a sentiment is conveyed that embodies the _all in all _of the divine passion of love--a sentiment which, perhaps, has found its echo in more, and in more passionate, human hearts than any other single sentiment ever embodied in words:-- come, rest in this bosom, my own stricken deer though the herd have fled from thee, thy home is still here; here still is the smile, that no cloud can o’ercast, and a heart and a hand all thy own to the last. oh! what was love made for, if ‘tis not the same through joy and through torment, through glory and shame? i know not, i ask not, if guilt’s in that heart, i but know that i love thee, whatever thou art. thou hast call’d me thy angel in moments of bliss, and thy angel i’ll be, ‘mid the horrors of this,-- through the furnace, unshrinking, thy steps to pursue, and shield thee, and save thee,--or perish there too! it has been the fashion of late days to deny moore imagination, while granting him fancy--a distinction originating with coleridge--than whom no man more fully comprehended the great powers of moore. the fact is, that the fancy of this poet so far predominates over all his other faculties, and over the fancy of all other men, as to have induced, very naturally, the idea that he is fanciful _only. _but never was there a greater mistake. never was a grosser wrong done the fame of a true poet. in the compass of the english language i can call to mind no poem more profoundly--more weirdly _imaginative, _in the best sense, than the lines commencing--“i would i were by that dim lake”--which are the com. position of thomas moore. i regret that i am unable to remember them. one of the noblest--and, speaking of fancy--one of the most singularly fanciful of modern poets, was thomas hood. his “fair ines” had always for me an inexpressible charm:-- o saw ye not fair ines? she’s gone into the west, to dazzle when the sun is down, and rob the world of rest; she took our daylight with her, the smiles that we love best, with morning blushes on her cheek, and pearls upon her breast. o turn again, fair ines, before the fall of night, for fear the moon should shine alone, and stars unrivalltd bright; and blessed will the lover be that walks beneath their light, and breathes the love against thy cheek i dare not even write! would i had been, fair ines, that gallant cavalier, who rode so gaily by thy side, and whisper’d thee so near! were there no bonny dames at home or no true lovers here, that he should cross the seas to win the dearest of the dear? i saw thee, lovely ines, descend along the shore, with bands of noble gentlemen, and banners waved before; and gentle youth and maidens gay, and snowy plumes they wore; it would have been a beauteous dream, if it had been no more! alas, alas, fair ines, she went away with song, with music waiting on her steps, and shootings of the throng; but some were sad and felt no mirth, but only music’s wrong, in sounds that sang farewell, farewell, to her you’ve loved so long. farewell, farewell, fair ines, that vessel never bore so fair a lady on its deck, nor danced so light before,-- alas for pleasure on the sea, and sorrow on the shorel the smile that blest one lover’s heart has broken many more! “the haunted house,” by the same author, is one of the truest poems ever written,--one of the truest, one of the most unexceptionable, one of the most thoroughly artistic, both in its theme and in its execution. it is, moreover, powerfully ideal--imaginative. i regret that its length renders it unsuitable for the purposes of this lecture. in place of it permit me to offer the universally appreciated “bridge of sighs”:-- one more unfortunate, weary of breath, rashly importunate gone to her death! take her up tenderly, lift her with care;-- fashion’d so slenderly, young and so fair! look at her garments clinging like cerements; whilst the wave constantly drips from her clothing; take her up instantly, loving not loathing. touch her not scornfully; think of her mournfully, gently and humanly; not of the stains of her, all that remains of her now is pure womanly. make no deep scrutiny into her mutiny rash and undutiful; past all dishonor, death has left on her only the beautiful. where the lamps quiver so far in the river, with many a light from window and casement from garret to basement, she stood, with amazement, houseless by night. the bleak wind of march made her tremble and shiver, but not the dark arch, or the black flowing river: mad from life’s history, glad to death’s mystery, swift to be hurl’d-- anywhere, anywhere out of the world! in she plunged boldly, no matter how coldly the rough river ran,-- over the brink of it, picture it,--think of it, dissolute man! lave in it, drink of it then, if you can! still, for all slips of hers, one of eve’s family-- wipe those poor lips of hers oozing so clammily, loop up her tresses escaped from the comb, her fair auburn tresses; whilst wonderment guesses where was her home? who was her father? who was her mother? had she a sister? had she a brother? or was there a dearer one still, and a nearer one yet, than all other? alas! for the rarity of christian charity under the sun! oh! it was pitiful! near a whole city full, home she had none. sisterly, brotherly, fatherly, motherly, feelings had changed: love, by harsh evidence, thrown from its eminence; even god’s providence seeming estranged. take her up tenderly; lift her with care; fashion’d so slenderly, young, and so fair! ere her limbs frigidly stiffen too rigidly, decently,--kindly,-- smooth and compose them; and her eyes, close them, staring so blindly! dreadfully staring through muddy impurity, as when with the daring last look of despairing fixed on futurity. perhishing gloomily, spurred by contumely, cold inhumanity, burning insanity, into her rest,-- cross her hands humbly, as if praying dumbly, over her breast! owning her weakness, her evil behavior, and leaving, with meekness, her sins to her saviour! the vigor of this poem is no less remarkable than its pathos. the versification although carrying the fanciful to the very verge of the fantastic, is nevertheless admirably adapted to the wild insanity which is the thesis of the poem. among the minor poems of lord byron is one which has never received from the critics the praise which it undoubtedly deserves:-- though the day of my destiny’s over, and the star of my fate bath declined thy soft heart refused to discover the faults which so many could find; though thy soul with my grief was acquainted, it shrunk not to share it with me, and the love which my spirit bath painted it never bath found but in _thee._ then when nature around me is smiling, the last smile which answers to mine, i do not believe it beguiling, because it reminds me of shine; and when winds are at war with the ocean, as the breasts i believed in with me, if their billows excite an emotion, it is that they bear me from _thee._ though the rock of my last hope is shivered, and its fragments are sunk in the wave, though i feel that my soul is delivered to pain--it shall not be its slave. there is many a pang to pursue me: they may crush, but they shall not contemn-- they may torture, but shall not subdue me-- ‘tis of _thee _that i think--not of them. though human, thou didst not deceive me, though woman, thou didst not forsake, though loved, thou forborest to grieve me, though slandered, thou never couldst shake,-- though trusted, thou didst not disclaim me, though parted, it was not to fly, though watchful, ‘twas not to defame me, nor mute, that the world might belie. yet i blame not the world, nor despise it, nor the war of the many with one-- if my soul was not fitted to prize it, ‘twas folly not sooner to shun: and if dearly that error bath cost me, and more than i once could foresee, i have found that whatever it lost me, it could not deprive me of _thee._ from the wreck of the past, which bath perished, thus much i at least may recall, it bath taught me that which i most cherished deserved to be dearest of all: in the desert a fountain is springing, in the wide waste there still is a tree, and a bird in the solitude singing, which speaks to my spirit of _thee._ although the rhythm here is one of the most difficult, the versification could scarcely be improved. no nobler _theme _ever engaged the pen of poet. it is the soul-elevating idea that no man can consider himself entitled to complain of fate while in his adversity he still retains the unwavering love of woman. from alfred tennyson, although in perfect sincerity i regard him as the noblest poet that ever lived, i have left myself time to cite only a very brief specimen. i call him, and _think _him the noblest of poets, _not _because the impressions he produces are at _all _times the most profound--_not _because the poetical excitement which he induces is at _all _times the most intense--but because it is at all times the most ethereal--in other words, the most elevating and most pure. no poet is so little of the earth, earthy. what i am about to read is from his last long poem, “the princess”:-- tears, idle tears, i know not what they mean, tears from the depth of some divine despair rise in the heart, and gather to the eyes, in looking on the happy autumn fields, and thinking of the days that are no more. fresh as the first beam glittering on a sail, that brings our friends up from the underworld, sad as the last which reddens over one that sinks with all we love below the verge; so sad, so fresh, the days that are no more. ah, sad and strange as in dark summer dawns the earliest pipe of half-awaken’d birds to dying ears, when unto dying eyes the casement slowly grows a glimmering square; so sad, so strange, the days that are no more. dear as remember’d kisses after death, and sweet as those by hopeless fancy feign’d on lips that are for others; deep as love, deep as first love, and wild with all regret; o death in life, the days that are no more. thus, although in a very cursory and imperfect manner, i have endeavored to convey to you my conception of the poetic principle. it has been my purpose to suggest that, while this principle itself is strictly and simply the human aspiration for supernal beauty, the manifestation of the principle is always found in _an elevating excitement of the soul, _quite independent of that passion which is the intoxication of the heart, or of that truth which is the satisfaction of the reason. for in regard to passion, alas! its tendency is to degrade rather than to elevate the soul. love, on the contrary--love--the true, the divine eros--the uranian as distinguished from the diona an venus--is unquestionably the purest and truest of all poetical themes. and in regard to truth, if, to be sure, through the attainment of a truth we are led to perceive a harmony where none was apparent before, we experience at once the true poetical effect; but this effect is referable to the harmony alone, and not in the least degree to the truth which merely served to render the harmony manifest. we shall reach, however, more immediately a distinct conception of what the true poetry is, by mere reference to a few of the simple elements which induce in the poet himself the poetical effect he recognizes the ambrosia which nourishes his soul in the bright orbs that shine in heaven--in the volutes of the flower--in the clustering of low shrubberies--in the waving of the grain-fields--in the slanting of tall eastern trees--in the blue distance of mountains--in the grouping of clouds--in the twinkling of half-hidden brooks--in the gleaming of silver rivers--in the repose of sequestered lakes--in the star-mirroring depths of lonely wells. he perceives it in the songs of birds--in the harp of bolos--in the sighing of the night-wind--in the repining voice of the forest--in the surf that complains to the shore--in the fresh breath of the woods--in the scent of the violet--in the voluptuous perfume of the hyacinth--in the suggestive odour that comes to him at eventide from far distant undiscovered islands, over dim oceans, illimitable and unexplored. he owns it in all noble thoughts--in all unworldly motives--in all holy impulses--in all chivalrous, generous, and self-sacrificing deeds. he feels it in the beauty of woman--in the grace of her step--in the lustre of her eye--in the melody of her voice--in her soft laughter, in her sigh--in the harmony of the rustling of her robes. he deeply feels it in her winning endearments--in her burning enthusiasms--in her gentle charities--in her meek and devotional endurances--but above all--ah, far above all, he kneels to it--he worships it in the faith, in the purity, in the strength, in the altogether divine majesty--of her love. let me conclude by--the recitation of yet another brief poem--one very different in character from any that i have before quoted. it is by motherwell, and is called “the song of the cavalier.” with our modern and altogether rational ideas of the absurdity and impiety of warfare, we are not precisely in that frame of mind best adapted to sympathize with the sentiments, and thus to appreciate the real excellence of the poem. to do this fully we must identify ourselves in fancy with the soul of the old cavalier:-- then mounte! then mounte, brave gallants all, and don your helmes amaine: deathe’s couriers. fame and honor call no shrewish teares shall fill your eye when the sword-hilt’s in our hand,-- heart-whole we’ll part, and no whit sighe for the fayrest of the land; let piping swaine, and craven wight, thus weepe and poling crye, our business is like men to fight. old english poetry (*) it should not be doubted that at least one-third of the affection with which we regard the elder poets of great britain should be-attributed to what is, in itself, a thing apart from poetry-we mean to the simple love of the antique-and that, again, a third of even the proper _poetic sentiment _inspired_ _by their writings should be ascribed to a fact which, while it has strict connection with poetry in the abstract, and with the old british poems themselves, should not be looked upon as a merit appertaining to the authors of the poems. almost every devout admirer of the old bards, if demanded his opinion of their productions, would mention vaguely, yet with perfect sincerity, a sense of dreamy, wild, indefinite, and he would perhaps say, indefinable delight; on being required to point out the source of this so shadowy pleasure, he would be apt to speak of the quaint in phraseology and in general handling. this quaintness is, in fact, a very powerful adjunct to ideality, but in the case in question it arises independently of the author’s will, and is altogether apart from his intention. words and their rhythm have varied. verses which affect us to-day with a vivid delight, and which delight, in many instances, may be traced to the one source, quaintness, must have worn in the days of their construction, a very commonplace air. this is, of course, no argument against the poems now-we mean it only as against the poets _thew. _there is a growing desire to overrate them. the old english muse was frank, guileless, sincere, and although very learned, still learned without art. no general error evinces a more thorough confusion of ideas than the error of supposing donne and cowley metaphysical in the sense wherein wordsworth and coleridge are so. with the two former ethics were the end-with the two latter the means. the poet of the “creation” wished, by highly artificial verse, to inculcate what he supposed to be moral truth-the poet of the “ancient mariner” to infuse the poetic sentiment through channels suggested by analysis. the one finished by complete failure what he commenced in the grossest misconception; the other, by a path which could not possibly lead him astray, arrived at a triumph which is not the less glorious because hidden from the profane eyes of the multitude. but in this view even the “metaphysical verse” of cowley is but evidence of the simplicity and single-heartedness of the man. and he was in this but a type of his school-for we may as well designate in this way the entire class of writers whose poems are bound up in the volume before us, and throughout all of whom there runs a very perceptible general character. they used little art in composition. their writings sprang immediately from the soul-and partook intensely of that soul’s nature. nor is it difficult to perceive the tendency of this _abandon-to elevate _immeasurably all the energies of mind-but, again, so to mingle the greatest possible fire, force, delicacy, and all good things, with the lowest possible bathos, baldness, and imbecility, as to render it not a matter of doubt that the average results of mind in such a school will be found inferior to those results in one _(ceteris _paribus) more artificial. we can not bring ourselves to believe that the selections of the “book of gems” are such as will impart to a poetical reader the clearest possible idea of the beauty of the school-but if the intention had been merely to show the school’s character, the attempt might have been considered successful in the highest degree. there are long passages now before us of the most despicable trash, with no merit whatever beyond that of their antiquity.. the criticisms of the editor do not particularly please us. his enthusiasm is too general and too vivid not to be false. his opinion, for example, of sir henry wotton’s “verses on the queen of bohemia”--that “there are few finer things in our language,” is untenable and absurd. in such lines we can perceive not one of those higher attributes of poesy which belong to her in all circumstances and throughout all time. here every thing is art, nakedly, or but awkwardly concealed. no prepossession for the mere antique (and in this case we can imagine no other prepossession) should induce us to dignify with the sacred name of poetry, a series, such as this, of elaborate and threadbare compliments, stitched, apparently, together, without fancy, without plausibility, and without even an attempt at adaptation. in common with all the world, we have been much delighted with “the shepherd’s hunting” by withers--a poem partaking, in a remarkable degree, of the peculiarities of “il penseroso.” speaking of poesy the author says: “by the murmur of a spring, or the least boughs rustleling, by a daisy whose leaves spread, shut when titan goes to bed, or a shady bush or tree, she could more infuse in me than all nature’s beauties can in some other wiser man. by her help i also now make this churlish place allow something that may sweeten gladness in the very gall of sadness-- the dull loneness, the black shade, that these hanging vaults have made the strange music of the waves beating on these hollow caves, this black den which rocks emboss, overgrown with eldest moss, the rude portals that give light more to terror than delight, this my chamber of neglect walled about with disrespect; from all these and this dull air a fit object for despair, she hath taught me by her might to draw comfort and delight.” but these lines, however good, do not bear with them much of the general character of the english antique. something more of this will be found in corbet’s “farewell to the fairies!” we copy a portion of marvell’s “maiden lamenting for her fawn,” which we prefer-not only as a specimen of the elder poets, but in itself as a beautiful poem, abounding in pathos, exquisitely delicate imagination and truthfulness-to anything of its species: “it is a wondrous thing how fleet ‘twas on those little silver feet, with what a pretty skipping grace it oft would challenge me the race, and when’t had left me far away ‘twould stay, and run again, and stay; for it was nimbler much than hinds, and trod as if on the four winds. i have a garden of my own, but so with roses overgrown, and lilies, that you would it guess to be a little wilderness; and all the spring-time of the year it only loved to be there. among the beds of lilies i have sought it oft where it should lie, yet could not, till itself would rise, find it, although before mine eyes. for in the flaxen lilies’ shade it like a bank of lilies laid; upon the roses it would feed until its lips even seemed to bleed, and then to me ‘twould boldly trip, and print those roses on my lip, but all its chief delight was still with roses thus itself to fill, and its pure virgin limbs to fold in whitest sheets of lilies cold. had it lived long, it would have been lilies without, roses within.” how truthful an air of lamentations hangs here upon every syllable! it pervades all.. it comes over the sweet melody of the words-over the gentleness and grace which we fancy in the little maiden herself-even over the half-playful, half-petulant air with which she lingers on the beauties and good qualities of her favorite-like the cool shadow of a summer cloud over a bed of lilies and violets, “and all sweet flowers.” the whole is redolent with poetry of a very lofty order. every line is an idea conveying either the beauty and playfulness of the fawn, or the artlessness of the maiden, or her love, or her admiration, or her grief, or the fragrance and warmth and _appropriateness _of the little nest-like bed of lilies and roses which the fawn devoured as it lay upon them, and could scarcely be distinguished from them by the once happy little damsel who went to seek her pet with an arch and rosy smile on her face. consider the great variety of truthful and delicate thought in the few lines we have quoted the _wonder _of the little maiden at the fleetness of her favorite-the “little silver feet”--the fawn challenging his mistress to a race with “a pretty skipping grace,” running on before, and then, with head turned back, awaiting her approach only to fly from it again-can we not distinctly perceive all these things? how exceedingly vigorous, too, is the line, “and trod as if on the four winds!” a vigor apparent only when we keep in mind the artless character of the speaker and the four feet of the favorite, one for each wind. then consider the garden of “my own,” so overgrown, entangled with roses and lilies, as to be “a little wilderness”--the fawn loving to be there, and there “only”--the maiden seeking it “where it _should _lie”--and not being able to distinguish it from the flowers until “itself would rise”--the lying among the lilies “like a bank of lilies”--the loving to “fill itself with roses,” “and its pure virgin limbs to fold in whitest sheets of lilies cold,” and these things being its “chief” delights-and then the pre-eminent beauty and naturalness of the concluding lines, whose very hyperbole only renders them more true to nature when we consider the innocence, the artlessness, the enthusiasm, the passionate girl, and more passionate admiration of the bereaved child-- “had it lived long, it would have been lilies without, roses within.” * “book of gems,” edited by s. c. hall poems to the noblest of her sex the author of “the drama of exile”-- to miss elizabeth barrett browning of england _i dedicate this volume_ with the most enthusiastic admiration and with the most sincere esteem <UNK> e.a.p. preface these trifles are collected and republished chiefly with a view to their redemption from the many improvements to which they have been subjected while going at random the “rounds of the press.” i am naturally anxious that what i have written should circulate as i wrote it, if it circulate at all. in defence of my own taste, nevertheless, it is incumbent upon me to say that i think nothing in this volume of much value to the public, or very creditable to myself. events not to be controlled have prevented me from making, at any time, any serious effort in what, under happier circumstances, would have been the field of my choice. with me poetry has been not a purpose, but a passion; and the passions should be held in reverence: they must not-they can not at will be excited, with an eye to the paltry compensations, or the more paltry commendations, of man-kind. e. a. p. <UNK> poems of later life the raven. once upon a midnight dreary, while i pondered, weak and weary, over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore, while i nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping, as of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door. “‘tis some visiter,” i muttered, “tapping at my chamber door-- only this, and nothing more.” ah, distinctly i remember it was in the bleak december, and each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor. eagerly i wished the morrow;--vainly i had sought to borrow from my books surcease of sorrow--sorrow for the lost lenore-- for the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name lenore-- nameless here for evermore. and the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain thrilled me--filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before; so that now, to still the beating of my heart, i stood repeating “‘tis some visiter entreating entrance at my chamber door-- some late visiter entreating entrance at my chamber door;-- this it is, and nothing more.” presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer, “sir,” said i, “or madam, truly your forgiveness i implore; but the fact is i was napping, and so gently you came rapping, and so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door, that i scarce was sure i heard you “--here i opened wide the door;---- darkness there and nothing more. deep into that darkness peering, long i stood there wondering, fearing, doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before; but the silence was unbroken, and the darkness gave no token, and the only word there spoken was the whispered word, “lenore!” this i whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, “lenore!”-- merely this, and nothing more. back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning, soon i heard again a tapping somewhat louder than before. “surely,” said i, “surely that is something at my window lattice; let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore-- let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;-- ‘tis the wind and nothing more!” open here i flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter, in there stepped a stately raven of the saintly days of yore; not the least obeisance made he; not an instant stopped or stayed he; but, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door-- perched upon a bust of pallas just above my chamber door-- perched, and sat, and nothing more. then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling, by the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore, “though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,” i said, “art sure no craven, ghastly grim and ancient raven wandering from the nightly shore-- tell me what thy lordly name is on the night’s plutonian shore!” quoth the raven “nevermore.” much i marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly, though its answer little meaning--little relevancy bore; for we cannot help agreeing that no living human being ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door-- bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door, with such name as “nevermore.” but the raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only that one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour. nothing farther then he uttered--not a feather then he fluttered-- till i scarcely more than muttered “other friends have flown before-- on the morrow _he_ will leave me, as my hopes have flown before.” then the bird said “nevermore.” startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken, “doubtless,” said i, “what it utters is its only stock and store caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful disaster followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore-- till the dirges of his hope that melancholy burden bore of “never--nevermore.” but the raven still beguiling all my sad soul into smiling, straight i wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird, and bust and door; then, upon the velvet sinking, i betook myself to linking fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore-- what this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt and ominous bird of yore meant in croaking “nevermore.” this i sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing to the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom’s core; this and more i sat divining, with my head at ease reclining on the cushion’s velvet lining that the lamplght gloated o’er, but whose velvet violet lining with the lamplight gloating o’er, _she_ shall press, ah, nevermore! then, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer swung by angels whose faint foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor. “wretch,” i cried, “thy god hath lent thee--by these angels he hath sent thee respite--respite and nepenthe from thy memories of lenore; quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost lenore!” quoth the raven, “nevermore.” “prophet!” said i, “thing of evil!--prophet still, if bird or devil!-- whether tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore, desolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted-- on this home by horror haunted--tell me truly, i implore-- is there--_is_ there balm in gilead?--tell me--tell me, i implore!” quoth the raven, “nevermore.” “prophet!” said i, “thing of evil--prophet still, if bird or devil! by that heaven that bends above us--by that god we both adore-- tell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant aidenn, it shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name lenore-- clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name lenore.” quoth the raven, “nevermore.” “be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!” i shrieked, upstarting-- “get thee back into the tempest and the night’s plutonian shore! leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken! leave my loneliness unbroken!--quit the bust above my door! take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!” quoth the raven, “nevermore.” and the raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting on the pallid bust of pallas just above my chamber door; and his eyes have all the seeming of a demon’s that is dreaming, and the lamp-light o’er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor; and my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor shall be lifted--nevermore! published <UNK> the bells. i. hear the sledges with the bells-- silver bells! what a world of merriment their melody foretells! how they tinkle, tinkle, tinkle, in the icy air of night! while the stars that oversprinkle all the heavens, seem to twinkle with a crystalline delight; keeping time, time, time, in a sort of runic rhyme, to the tintinnabulation that so musically wells from the bells, bells, bells, bells, bells, bells, bells-- from the jingling and the tinkling of the bells. ii. hear the mellow wedding-bells golden bells! what a world of happiness their harmony foretells! through the balmy air of night how they ring out their delight!-- from the molten-golden notes, and all in tune, what a liquid ditty floats to the turtle-dove that listens, while she gloats on the moon! oh, from out the sounding cells, what a gush of euphony voluminously wells! how it swells! how it dwells on the future!--how it tells of the rapture that impels to the swinging and the ringing of the bells, bells, bells-- of the bells, bells, bells, bells, bells, bells, bells-- to the rhyming and the chiming of the bells! iii. hear the loud alarum bells-- brazen bells! what tale of terror, now, their turbulency tells! in the startled ear of night how they scream out their affright! too much horrified to speak, they can only shriek, shriek, out of tune, in a clamorous appealing to the mercy of the fire, in a mad expostulation with the deaf and frantic fire, leaping higher, higher, higher, with a desperate desire, and a resolute endeavor now--now to sit, or never, by the side of the pale-faced moon. oh, the bells, bells, bells! what a tale their terror tells of despair! how they clang, and clash, and roar! what a horror they outpour on the bosom of the palpitating air! yet the ear, it fully knows, by the twanging and the clanging, how the danger ebbs and flows; yet, the ear distinctly tells, in the jangling and the wrangling, how the danger sinks and swells, by the sinking or the swelling in the anger of the bells-- of the bells-- of the bells, bells, bells, bells, bells, bells, bells-- in the clamour and the clangour of the bells! iv. hear the tolling of the bells-- iron bells! what a world of solemn thought their monody compels! in the silence of the night, how we shiver with affright at the melancholy meaning of their tone! for every sound that floats from the rust within their throats is a groan. and the people--ah, the people-- they that dwell up in the steeple, all alone, and who, tolling, tolling, tolling, in that muffled monotone, feel a glory in so rolling on the human heart a stone-- they are neither man nor woman-- they are neither brute nor human-- they are ghouls:-- and their king it is who tolls:-- and he rolls, rolls, rolls, rolls, rolls a pæan from the bells! and his merry bosom swells with the pæan of the bells! and he dances, and he yells; keeping time, time, time, in a sort of runic rhyme, to the pæan of the bells-- of the bells:-- keeping time, time, time, in a sort of runic rhyme, to the throbbing of the bells-- of the bells, bells, bells-- to the sobbing of the bells:-- keeping time, time, time, as he knells, knells, knells, in a happy runic rhyme, to the rolling of the bells-- of the bells, bells, bells:-- to the tolling of the bells-- of the bells, bells, bells, bells, bells, bells, bells-- to the moaning and the groaning of the bells. <UNK> ulalume the skies they were ashen and sober; the leaves they were crisped and sere-- the leaves they were withering and sere; it was night in the lonesome october of my most immemorial year: it was hard by the dim lake of auber, in the misty mid region of weir:-- it was down by the dank tarn of auber, in the ghoul-haunted woodland of weir. here once, through an alley titanic, of cypress, i roamed with my soul-- of cypress, with psyche, my soul. there were days when my heart was volcanic as the scoriac rivers that roll-- as the lavas that restlessly roll their sulphurous currents down yaanek, in the ultimate climes of the pole-- that groan as they roll down mount yaanek in the realms of the boreal pole. our talk had been serious and sober, but our thoughts they were palsied and sere-- our memories were treacherous and sere; for we knew not the month was october, and we marked not the night of the year-- (ah, night of all nights in the year!) we noted not the dim lake of auber, (though once we had journeyed down here) we remembered not the dank tarn of auber, nor the ghoul-haunted woodland of weir. and now, as the night was senescent, and star-dials pointed to morn-- as the star-dials hinted of morn-- at the end of our path a liquescent and nebulous lustre was born, out of which a miraculous crescent arose with a duplicate horn-- astarte’s bediamonded crescent, distinct with its duplicate horn. and i said--“she is warmer than dian: she rolls through an ether of sighs-- she revels in a region of sighs. she has seen that the tears are not dry on these cheeks, where the worm never dies, and has come past the stars of the lion, to point us the path to the skies-- to the lethean peace of the skies-- come up, in despite of the lion, to shine on us with her bright eyes-- come up, through the lair of the lion, with love in her luminous eyes.” but psyche, uplifting her finger, said--“sadly this star i mistrust-- her pallor i strangely mistrust-- ah, hasten!--ah, let us not linger! ah, fly!--let us fly!--for we must.” in terror she spoke; letting sink her wings till they trailed in the dust-- in agony sobbed, letting sink her plumes till they trailed in the dust-- till they sorrowfully trailed in the dust. i replied--“this is nothing but dreaming. let us on, by this tremulous light! let us bathe in this crystalline light! its sybillic splendor is beaming with hope and in beauty to-night-- see!--it flickers up the sky through the night! ah, we safely may trust to its gleaming, and be sure it will lead us aright-- we safely may trust to a gleaming that cannot but guide us aright, since it flickers up to heaven through the night.” thus i pacified psyche and kissed her, and tempted her out of her gloom-- and conquered her scruples and gloom; and we passed to the end of the vista-- but were stopped by the door of a tomb-- by the door of a legended tomb:-- and i said--“what is written, sweet sister, on the door of this legended tomb?” she replied--“ulalume--ulalume-- ‘t is the vault of thy lost ulalume!” then my heart it grew ashen and sober as the leaves that were crisped and sere-- as the leaves that were withering and sere-- and i cried--“it was surely october on _this_ very night of last year, that i journeyed--i journeyed down here!-- that i brought a dread burden down here-- on this night, of all nights in the year, ah, what demon has tempted me here? well i know, now, this dim lake of auber-- this misty mid region of weir:-- well i know, now, this dank tarn of auber-- this ghoul-haunted woodland of weir.” <UNK> to helen i saw thee once--once only--years ago: i must not say how many--but not many. it was a july midnight; and from out a full-orbed moon, that, like thine own soul, soaring, sought a precipitate pathway up through heaven, there fell a silvery-silken veil of light, with quietude, and sultriness, and slumber, upon the upturned faces of a thousand roses that grew in an enchanted garden, where no wind dared to stir, unless on tiptoe-- fell on the upturn’d faces of these roses that gave out, in return for the love-light, their odorous souls in an ecstatic death-- fell on the upturn’d faces of these roses that smiled and died in this parterre, enchanted by thee, and by the poetry of thy presence. clad all in white, upon a violet bank i saw thee half reclining; while the moon fell on the upturn’d faces of the roses, and on thine own, upturn’d--alas, in sorrow! was it not fate, that, on this july midnight- was it not fate, (whose name is also sorrow,) that bade me pause before that garden-gate, to breathe the incense of those slumbering roses? no footstep stirred: the hated world an slept, save only thee and me. (oh, heaven!--oh, god! how my heart beats in coupling those two words!) save only thee and me. i paused--i looked- and in an instant all things disappeared. (ah, bear in mind this garden was enchanted!) the pearly lustre of the moon went out: the mossy banks and the meandering paths, the happy flowers and the repining trees, were seen no more: the very roses’ odors died in the arms of the adoring airs. all--all expired save thee--save less than thou: save only the divine light in thine eyes- save but the soul in thine uplifted eyes. i saw but them--they were the world to me! i saw but them--saw only them for hours, saw only them until the moon went down. what wild heart-histories seemed to he enwritten upon those crystalline, celestial spheres! how dark a woe, yet how sublime a hope! how silently serene a sea of pride! how daring an ambition; yet how deep- how fathomless a capacity for love! but now, at length, dear dian sank from sight, into a western couch of thunder-cloud; and thou, a ghost, amid the entombing trees didst glide away. only thine eyes remained; they would not go--they never yet have gone; lighting my lonely pathway home that night, they have not left me (as my hopes have) since; they follow me--they lead me through the years. they are my ministers--yet i their slave. their office is to illumine and enkindle-- my duty, to be saved by their bright light, and purified in their electric fire, and sanctified in their elysian fire. they fill my soul with beauty (which is hope), and are far up in heaven--the stars i kneel to in the sad, silent watches of my night; while even in the meridian glare of day i see them still--two sweetly scintillant venuses, unextinguished by the sun! annabel lee. it was many and many a year ago, in a kingdom by the sea, that a maiden lived whom you may know by the name of annabel lee;-- and this maiden she lived with no other thought than to love and be loved by me. _i_ was a child and _she_ was a child, in this kingdom by the sea, but we loved with a love that was more than love-- i and my annabel lee-- with a love that the wingéd seraphs of heaven coveted her and me. and this was the reason that, long ago, in this kingdom by the sea, a wind blew out of a cloud by night chilling my annabel lee; so that her high-born kinsmen came and bore her away from me, to shut her up, in a sepulchre in this kingdom by the sea. the angels, not half so happy in heaven, went envying her and me; yes! that was the reason (as all men know, in this kingdom by the sea) that the wind came out of the cloud, chilling and killing my annabel lee. but our love it was stronger by far than the love of those who were older than we-- of many far wiser than we-- and neither the angels in heaven above nor the demons down under the sea can ever dissever my soul from the soul of the beautiful annabel lee:-- for the moon never beams without bringing me dreams of the beautiful annabel lee; and the stars never rise but i see the bright eyes of the beautiful annabel lee; and so, all the night-tide, i lie down by the side of my darling, my darling, my life and my bride in her sepulchre there by the sea-- in her tomb by the side of the sea. <UNK> a valentine. for her this rhyme is penned, whose luminous eyes, brightly expressive as the twins of loeda, shall find her own sweet name, that, nestling lies upon the page, enwrapped from every reader. search narrowly the lines!--they hold a treasure divine--a talisman--an amulet that must be worn _at heart_. search well the measure-- the words--the syllables! do not forget the trivialest point, or you may lose your labor! and yet there is in this no gordian knot which one might not undo without a sabre, if one could merely comprehend the plot. enwritten upon the leaf where now are peering eyes scintillating soul, there lie _perdus_ three eloquent words oft uttered in the hearing of poets, by poets--as the name is a poet’s, too. its letters, although naturally lying like the knight pinto--mendez ferdinando-- still form a synonym for truth--cease trying! you will not read the riddle, though you do the best _you_ can do. <UNK> [to discover the names in this and the following poem read the first letter of the first line in connection with the second letter of the second line, the third letter of the third line, the fourth of the fourth and so on to the end.] an enigma “seldom we find,” says solomon don dunce, “half an idea in the profoundest sonnet. through all the flimsy things we see at once as easily as through a naples bonnet-- trash of all trash!--how _can_ a lady don it? yet heavier far than your petrarchan stuff- owl-downy nonsense that the faintest puff twirls into trunk-paper the while you con it.” and, veritably, sol is right enough. the general tuckermanities are arrant bubbles--ephemeral and _so_ transparent-- but _this_ is, now,--you may depend upon it-- stable, opaque, immortal--all by dint of the dear names that lie concealed within ‘t. <UNK> to my mother because i feel that, in the heavens above, the angels, whispering to one another, can find, among their burning terms of love, none so devotional as that of “mother,” therefore by that dear name i long have called you-- you who are more than mother unto me, and fill my heart of hearts, where death installed you in setting my virginia’s spirit free. my mother--my own mother, who died early, was but the mother of myself; but you are mother to the one i loved so dearly, and thus are dearer than the mother i knew by that infinity with which my wife was dearer to my soul than its soul-life. <UNK> [the above was addressed to the poet’s mother-in-law, mrs. clemm--ed.] for annie thank heaven! the crisis-- the danger is past, and the lingering illness is over at last-- and the fever called “living” is conquered at last. sadly, i know i am shorn of my strength, and no muscle i move as i lie at full length-- but no matter!--i feel i am better at length. and i rest so composedly, now, in my bed, that any beholder might fancy me dead-- might start at beholding me, thinking me dead. the moaning and groaning, the sighing and sobbing, are quieted now, with that horrible throbbing at heart:--ah, that horrible, horrible throbbing! the sickness--the nausea-- the pitiless pain-- have ceased, with the fever that maddened my brain-- with the fever called “living” that burned in my brain. and oh! of all tortures _that_ torture the worst has abated--the terrible torture of thirst for the naphthaline river of passion accurst:-- i have drank of a water that quenches all thirst:-- of a water that flows, with a lullaby sound, from a spring but a very few feet under ground-- from a cavern not very far down under ground. and ah! let it never be foolishly said that my room it is gloomy and narrow my bed; for man never slept in a different bed-- and, to _sleep_, you must slumber in just such a bed. my tantalized spirit here blandly reposes, forgetting, or never regretting its roses-- its old agitations of myrtles and roses: for now, while so quietly lying, it fancies a holier odor about it, of pansies-- a rosemary odor, commingled with pansies-- with rue and the beautiful puritan pansies. and so it lies happily, bathing in many a dream of the truth and the beauty of annie-- drowned in a bath of the tresses of annie. she tenderly kissed me, she fondly caressed, and then i fell gently to sleep on her breast-- deeply to sleep from the heaven of her breast. when the light was extinguished, she covered me warm, and she prayed to the angels to keep me from harm-- to the queen of the angels to shield me from harm. and i lie so composedly, now in my bed, (knowing her love) that you fancy me dead-- and i rest so contentedly, now in my bed, (with her love at my breast) that you fancy me dead-- that you shudder to look at me, thinking me dead:-- but my heart it is brighter than all of the many stars in the sky, for it sparkles with annie-- it glows with the light of the love of my annie-- with the thought of the light of the eyes of my annie. <UNK> to f----. beloved! amid the earnest woes that crowd around my earthly path-- (drear path, alas! where grows not even one lonely rose)-- my soul at least a solace hath in dreams of thee, and therein knows an eden of bland repose. and thus thy memory is to me like some enchanted far-off isle in some tumultuos sea-- some ocean throbbing far and free with storms--but where meanwhile serenest skies continually just o’re that one bright island smile. <UNK> to frances s. osgood thou wouldst be loved?--then let thy heart from its present pathway part not! being everything which now thou art, be nothing which thou art not. so with the world thy gentle ways, thy grace, thy more than beauty, shall be an endless theme of praise, and love--a simple duty. <UNK> eldorado. gaily bedight, a gallant knight, in sunshine and in shadow, had journeyed long, singing a song, in search of eldorado. but he grew old-- this knight so bold-- and o’er his heart a shadow fell, as he found no spot of ground that looked like eldorado. and, as his strength failed him at length, he met a pilgrim shadow-- ‘shadow,’ said he, ‘where can it be-- this land of eldorado?’ ‘over the mountains of the moon, down the valley of the shadow, ride, boldly ride,’ the shade replied,-- ‘if you seek for eldorado!’ <UNK> eulalie i dwelt alone in a world of moan, and my soul was a stagnant tide, till the fair and gentle eulalie became my blushing bride-- till the yellow-haired young eulalie became my smiling bride. ah, less--less bright the stars of the night than the eyes of the radiant girl! and never a flake that the vapour can make with the moon-tints of purple and pearl, can vie with the modest eulalie’s most unregarded curl-- can compare with the bright-eyed eulalie’s most humble and careless curl. now doubt--now pain come never again, for her soul gives me sigh for sigh, and all day long shines, bright and strong, astarté within the sky, while ever to her dear eulalie upturns her matron eye-- while ever to her young eulalie upturns her violet eye. <UNK> a dream within a dream take this kiss upon the brow! and, in parting from you now, thus much let me avow-- you are not wrong, who deem that my days have been a dream; yet if hope has flown away in a night, or in a day, in a vision, or in none, is it therefore the less _gone_? _all_ that we see or seem is but a dream within a dream. i stand amid the roar of a surf-tormented shore, and i hold within my hand grains of the golden sand-- how few! yet how they creep through my fingers to the deep, while i weep--while i weep! o god! can i not grasp them with a tighter clasp? o god! can i not save _one_ from the pitiless wave? is _all_ that we see or seem but a dream within a dream?. <UNK> to marie louise (shew) of all who hail thy presence as the morning-- of all to whom thine absence is the night-- the blotting utterly from out high heaven the sacred sun--of all who, weeping, bless thee hourly for hope--for life--ah! above all, for the resurrection of deep-buried faith in truth--in virtue--in humanity-- of all who, on despair’s unhallowed bed lying down to die, have suddenly arisen at thy soft-murmured words, “let there be light!” at the soft-murmured words that were fulfilled in the seraphic glancing of thine eyes-- of all who owe thee most--whose gratitude nearest resembles worship--oh, remember the truest--the most fervently devoted, and think that these weak lines are written by him-- by him who, as he pens them, thrills to think his spirit is communing with an angel’s. <UNK> to marie louise (shew) not long ago, the writer of these lines, in the mad pride of intellectuality, maintained “the power of words”--denied that ever a thought arose within the human brain beyond the utterance of the human tongue: and now, as if in mockery of that boast, two words-two foreign soft dissyllables-- italian tones, made only to be murmured by angels dreaming in the moonlit “dew that hangs like chains of pearl on hermon hill,”-- have stirred from out the abysses of his heart, unthought-like thoughts that are the souls of thought, richer, far wider, far diviner visions than even the seraph harper, israfel, (who has “the sweetest voice of all god’s creatures”) could hope to utter. and i! my spells are broken. the pen falls powerless from my shivering hand. with thy dear name as text, though bidden by thee, i can not write-i can not speak or think-- alas, i can not feel; for ‘tis not feeling, this standing motionless upon the golden threshold of the wide-open gate of dreams, gazing, entranced, adown the gorgeous vista, and thrilling as i see, upon the right, upon the left, and all the way along, amid empurpled vapors, far away to where the prospect terminates-_thee only!_ <UNK> the city in the sea. lo! death has reared himself a throne in a strange city lying alone far down within the dim west, wherethe good and the bad and the worst and the best have gone to their eternal rest. there shrines and palaces and towers (time-eaten towers that tremble not!) resemble nothing that is ours. around, by lifting winds forgot, resignedly beneath the sky the melancholy waters lie. no rays from the holy heaven come down on the long night-time of that town; but light from out the lurid sea streams up the turrets silently-- gleams up the pinnacles far and free-- up domes--up spires--up kingly halls-- up fanes--up babylon-like walls-- up shadowy long-forgotten bowers of scultured ivy and stone flowers-- up many and many a marvellous shrine whose wreathed friezes intertwine the viol, the violet, and the vine. resignedly beneath the sky the melancholy waters lie. so blend the turrets and shadows there that all seem pendulous in air, while from a proud tower in the town death looks gigantically down. there open fanes and gaping graves yawn level with the luminous waves; but not the riches there that lie in each idol’s diamond eye-- not the gaily-jewelled dead tempt the waters from their bed; for no ripples curl, alas! along that wilderness of glass-- no swellings tell that winds may be upon some far-off happier sea-- no heavings hint that winds have been on seas less hideously serene. but lo, a stir is in the air! the wave--there is a movement there! as if the towers had thrown aside, in slightly sinking, the dull tide-- as if their tops had feebly given a void within the filmy heaven. the waves have now a redder glow-- the hours are breathing faint and low-- and when, amid no earthly moans, down, down that town shall settle hence, hell, rising from a thousand thrones, shall do it reverence. <UNK> the sleeper. at midnight in the month of june, i stand beneath the mystic moon. an opiate vapour, dewy, dim, exhales from out her golden rim, and, softly dripping, drop by drop, upon the quiet mountain top. steals drowsily and musically into the univeral valley. the rosemary nods upon the grave; the lily lolls upon the wave; wrapping the fog about its breast, the ruin moulders into rest; looking like lethe, see! the lake a conscious slumber seems to take, and would not, for the world, awake. all beauty sleeps!--and lo! where lies (her easement open to the skies) irene, with her destinies! oh, lady bright! can it be right-- this window open to the night? the wanton airs, from the tree-top, laughingly through the lattice drop-- the bodiless airs, a wizard rout, flit through thy chamber in and out, and wave the curtain canopy so fitfully--so fearfully-- above the closed and fringed lid ‘neath which thy slumb’ring sould lies hid, that o’er the floor and down the wall, like ghosts the shadows rise and fall! oh, lady dear, hast thous no fear? why and what art thou dreaming here? sure thou art come p’er far-off seas, a wonder to these garden trees! strange is thy pallor! strange thy dress! strange, above all, thy length of tress, and this all solemn silentness! the lady sleeps! oh, may her sleep, which is enduring, so be deep! heaven have her in its sacred keep! this chamber changed for one more holy, this bed for one more melancholy, i pray to god that she may lie forever with unopened eye, while the dim sheeted ghosts go by! my love, she sleeps! oh, may her sleep, as it is lasting, so be deep! soft may the worms about her creep! far in the forest, dim and old, for her may some tall vault unfold-- some vault that oft hath flung its black and winged pannels fluttering back, triumphant, o’er the crested palls, of her grand family funerals-- some sepulchre, remote, alone, against whose portal she hath thrown, in childhood, many an idle stone-- some tomb fromout whose sounding door she ne’er shall force an echo more, thrilling to think, poor child of sin! it was the dead who groaned within. <UNK> bridal ballad. the ring is on my hand, and the wreath is on my brow; satins and jewels grand are all at my command, and i am happy now. and my lord he loves me well; but, when first he breathed his vow, i felt my bosom swell-- for the words rang as a knell, and the voice seemed _his_ who fell in the battle down the dell, and who is happy now. but he spoke to re-asure me, and he kissed my pallid brow, while a reverie came o’re me, and to the church-yard bore me, and i sighed to him before me, thinking him dead d’elormie, “oh, i am happy now!” and thus the words were spoken, and this the plighted vow, and, though my faith be broken, and, though my heart be broken, behold the golden token that _proves_ me happy now! would god i could awaken! for i dream i know not how, and my soul is sorely shaken lest an evil step be taken,-- lest the dead who is forsaken may not be happy now. <UNK> notes <UNK> “the raven” was first published on the <UNK> january, <UNK> in the new york “evening mirror”--a paper its author was then assistant editor of. it was prefaced by the following words, understood to have been written by n. p. willis: “we are permitted to copy (in advance of publication) from the second number of the “american review,” the following remarkable poem by edgar poe. in our opinion, it is the most effective single example of ‘fugitive poetry’ ever published in this country, and unsurpassed in english poetry for subtle conception, masterly ingenuity of versification, and consistent sustaining of imaginative lift and ‘pokerishness.’ it is one of those ‘dainties bred in a book’ which we feed on. it will stick to the memory of everybody who reads it.” in the february number of the “american review” the poem was published as by “quarles,” and it was introduced by the following note, evidently suggested if not written by poe himself. [“the following lines from a correspondent-besides the deep, quaint strain of the sentiment, and the curious introduction of some ludicrous touches amidst the serious and impressive, as was doubtless intended by the author-appears to us one of the most felicitous specimens of unique rhyming which has for some time met our eye. the resources of english rhythm for varieties of melody, measure, and sound, producing corresponding diversities of effect, having been thoroughly studied, much more perceived, by very few poets in the language. while the classic tongues, especially the greek, possess, by power of accent, several advantages for versification over our own, chiefly through greater abundance of spondaic: feet, we have other and very great advantages of sound by the modern usage of rhyme. alliteration is nearly the only effect of that kind which the ancients had in common with us. it will be seen that much of the melody of ‘the raven’ arises from alliteration, and the studious use of similar sounds in unusual places. in regard to its measure, it may be noted that if all the verses were like the second, they might properly be placed merely in short lines, producing a not uncommon form; but the presence in all the others of one line-mostly the second in the verse” (stanza?)--“which flows continuously, with only an aspirate pause in the middle, like that before the short line in the sapphic adonic, while the fifth has at the middle pause no similarity of sound with any part besides, gives the versification an entirely different effect. we could wish the capacities of our noble language in prosody were better understood.”--ed. “am. rev.”] <UNK> the bibliographical history of “the bells” is curious. the subject, and some lines of the original version, having been suggested by the poet’s friend, mrs. shew, poe, when he wrote out the first draft of the poem, headed it, “the bells, by mrs. m. a. shew.” this draft, now the editor’s property, consists of only seventeen lines, and read thus: i. the bells!-ah, the bells! the little silver bells! how fairy-like a melody there floats from their throats-- from their merry little throats-- from the silver, tinkling throats of the bells, bells, bells-- of the bells! ii. the bells!-ah, the bells! the heavy iron bells! how horrible a monody there floats from their throats-- from their deep-toned throats-- from their melancholy throats! how i shudder at the notes of the bells, bells, bells-- of the bells! in the autumn of <UNK> poe added another line to this poem, and sent it to the editor of the “union magazine.” it was not published. so, in the following february, the poet forwarded to the same periodical a much enlarged and altered transcript. three months having elapsed without publication, another revision of the poem, similar to the current version, was sent, and in the following october was published in the “union magazine.” <UNK> this poem was first published in colton’s “american review” for december, <UNK> as “to--ulalume: a ballad.” being reprinted immediately in the “home journal,” it was copied into various publications with the name of the editor, n. p. willis, appended, and was ascribed to him. when first published, it contained the following additional stanza which poe subsequently, at the suggestion of mrs. whitman, wisely suppressed: said we then--we two, then--“ah, can it have been that the woodlandish ghouls-- the pitiful, the merciful ghouls-- to bar up our path and to ban it from the secret that lies in these wolds-- had drawn up the spectre of a planet from the limbo of lunary souls-- this sinfully scintillant planet from the hell of the planetary souls?” <UNK> “to helen!” (mrs. s. helen whitman) was not published until november, <UNK> although written several months earlier. it first appeared in the “union magazine,” and with the omission, contrary to the knowledge or desire of poe, of the line, “oh, god! oh, heaven--how my heart beats in coupling those two words.” <UNK> “annabel lee” was written early in <UNK> and is evidently an expression of the poet’s undying love for his deceased bride, although at least one of his lady admirers deemed it a response to her admiration. poe sent a copy of the ballad to the “union magazine,” in which publication it appeared in january, <UNK> three months after the author’s death. while suffering from “hope deferred” as to its fate, poe presented a copy of “annabel lee” to the editor of the “southern literary messenger,” who published it in the november number of his periodical, a month after poe’s death. in the meantime the poet’s own copy, left among his papers, passed into the hands of the person engaged to edit his works, and he quoted the poem in an obituary of poe, in the new york “tribune,” before any one else had an opportunity of publishing it. <UNK> “a valentine,” one of three poems addressed to mrs. osgood, appears to have been written early in <UNK> <UNK> “an enigma,” addressed to mrs. sarah anna lewis (“stella”), was sent to that lady in a letter, in november, <UNK> and the following march appeared in sartain’s “union magazine.” <UNK> the sonnet, “to my mother” (maria clemm), was sent for publication to the short-lived “flag of our union,” early in <UNK> but does not appear to have been issued until after its author’s death, when it appeared in the “leaflets of memory” for <UNK> <UNK> “for annie” was first published in the “flag of our union,” in the spring of <UNK> poe, annoyed at some misprints in this issue, shortly afterwards caused a corrected copy to be inserted in the “home journal.” <UNK> “to f----” (frances sargeant osgood) appeared in the “broadway journal” for april, <UNK> these lines are but slightly varied from those inscribed “to mary,” in the “southern literary messenger” for july, <UNK> and subsequently republished, with the two stanzas transposed, in “graham’s magazine” for march, <UNK> as “to one departed.” <UNK> “to f----s s. o--d,” a portion of the poet’s triune tribute to mrs. osgood, was published in the “broadway journal” for september, <UNK> the earliest version of these lines appeared in the “southern literary messenger” for september, <UNK> as “lines written in an album,” and was addressed to eliza white, the proprietor’s daughter. slightly revised, the poem reappeared in burton’s “gentleman’s magazine” for august, <UNK> as “to--.” <UNK> although “eldorado” was published during poe’s lifetime, in <UNK> in the “flag of our union,” it does not appear to have ever received the author’s finishing touches. poems of manhood lenore ah broken is the golden bowl! the spirit flown forever! let the bell toll!--a saintly soul floats on the stygian river; and, guy de vere, hast _thou_ no tear?--weep now or never more! see! on yon drear and rigid bier low lies thy love, lenore! come! let the burial rite be read--the funeral song be sung!-- an anthem for the queenliest dead that ever died so young-- a dirge for her the doubly dead in that she died so young. “wretches! ye loved her for her wealth and hated her for her pride, “and when she fell in feeble health, ye blessed her--that she died! “how shall the ritual, then, be read?--the requiem how be sung “by you--by yours, the evil eye,--by yours, the slanderous tongue “that did to death the innocent that died, and died so young?” _peccavimus_; but rave not thus! and let a sabbath song go up to god so solemnly the dead may feel so wrong! the sweet lenore hath “gone before,” with hope, that flew beside leaving thee wild for the dear child that should have been thy bride-- for her, the fair and _debonair_, that now so lowly lies, the life upon her yellow hair but not within her eyes-- the life still there, upon her hair--the death upon her eyes. “avaunt! to-night my heart is light. no dirge will i upraise, “but waft the angel on her flight with a paean of old days! “let no bell toll!--lest her sweet soul, amid its hallowed mirth, “should catch the note, as it doth float--up from the damned earth. “to friends above, from fiends below, the indignant ghost is riven-- “from hell unto a high estate far up within the heaven-- “from grief and groan, to a golden throne, beside the king of heaven.” to one in paradise. thou wast all that to me, love, for which my soul did pine-- a green isle in the sea, love, a fountain and a shrine, all wreathed with fairy fruits and flowers, and all the flowers were mine. ah, dream too bright to last! ah, starry hope! that didst arise but to be overcast! a voice from out the future cries, “on! on!”--but o’er the past (dim gulf!) my spirit hovering lies mute, motionless, aghast! for, alas! alas! with me the light of life is o’er! no more--no more--no more-- (such language holds the solemn sea to the sands upon the shore) shall bloom the thunder-blasted tree, or the stricken eagle soar! and all my days are trances, and all my nightly dreams are where thy dark eye glances, and where thy footstep gleams-- in what ethereal dances, by what eternal streams. <UNK> the coliseum. type of the antique rome! rich reliquary of lofty contemplation left to time by buried centuries of pomp and power! at length--at length--after so many days of weary pilgrimage and burning thirst, (thirst for the springs of lore that in thee lie,) i kneel, an altered and an humble man, amid thy shadows, and so drink within my very soul thy grandeur, gloom, and glory! vastness! and age! and memories of eld! silence! and desolation! and dim night! i feel ye now--i feel ye in your strength-- o spells more sure than e’er judæan king taught in the gardens of gethsemane! o charms more potent than the rapt chaldee ever drew down from out the quiet stars! here, where a hero fell, a column falls! here, where the mimic eagle glared in gold, a midnight vigil holds the swarthy bat! here, where the dames of rome their gilded hair waved to the wind, now wave the reed and thistle! here, where on golden throne the monarch lolled, glides, spectre-like, unto his marble home, lit by the wanlight--wan light of the horned moon, the swift and silent lizard of the stones! but stay! these walls--these ivy-clad arcades-- these mouldering plinths--these sad and blackened shafts-- these vague entablatures--this crumbling frieze-- these shattered cornices--this wreck--this ruin-- these stones--alas! these gray stones--are they all-- all of the famed, and the colossal left by the corrosive hours to fate and me? “not all”--the echoes answer me--“not all! “prophetic sounds and loud, arise forever “from us, and from all ruin, unto the wise, “as melody from memnon to the sun. “we rule the hearts of mightiest men--we rule “with a despotic sway all giant minds. “we are not impotent--we pallid stones. “not all our power is gone--not all our fame-- “not all the magic of our high renown-- “not all the wonder that encircles us-- “not all the mysteries that in us lie-- “not all the memories that hang upon “and cling around about us as a garment, “clothing us in a robe of more than glory.” <UNK> the haunted palace. in the greenest of our valleys by good angels tenanted, once a fair and stately palace-- radiant palace--reared its head. in the monarch thought’s dominion-- it stood there! never seraph spread a pinion over fabric half so fair. banners yellow, glorious, golden, on its roof did float and flow, (this--all this--was in the olden time long ago,) and every gentle air that dallied, in that sweet day, along the ramparts plumed and pallid, a winged odour went away. wanderers in that happy valley, through two luminous windows, saw spirits moving musically, to a lute’s well-tuned law, round about a throne where, sitting (porphyrogene) in state his glory well befitting, the ruler of the realm was seen. and all with pearl and ruby glowing was the fair palace door, through which came flowing, flowing, flowing, and sparkling evermore, a troop of echoes, whose sweet duty was but to sing, in voices of surpassing beauty, the wit and wisdom of their king. but evil things, in robes of sorrow, assailed the monarch’s high estate. (ah, let us mourn!--for never sorrow shall dawn upon him desolate!) and round about his home the glory that blushed and bloomed, is but a dim-remembered story of the old time entombed. and travellers, now, within that valley, through the red-litten windows see vast forms, that move fantastically to a discordant melody, while, lie a ghastly rapid river, through the pale door a hideous throng rush out forever and laugh--but smile no more. <UNK> the conqueror worm. lo! ‘tis a gala night within the lonesome latter years! an angel throng, bewinged, bedight in veils, and drowned in tears, sit in a theatre, to see a play of hopes and fears, while the orchestra breathes fitfully the music of the spheres. mimes, in the form of god on high, mutter and mumble low, and hither and thither fly-- mere puppets they, who come and go at bidding of vast formless things that shift the scenery to and fro, flapping from out their condor wings invisible wo! that motley drama--oh, be sure it shall not be forgot! with its phantom chased for evermore, by a crowd that seize it not, through a circle that ever returneth in to the self-same spot, and much of madness, and more of sin, and horror the soul of the plot. but see, amid the mimic rout a crawling shape intrude! a blood-red thing that writhes from out the scenic solitude! it writhes!--it writhes!--with mortal pangs the mimes become its food, and the angels sob at vermin fangs in human gore imbued. out--out are the lights--out all! and, over each quivering form, the curtain, a funeral pall, comes down with the rush of a storm, and the angels, all pallid and wan, uprising, unveiling, affirm that the play is the tragedy, “man,” and its hero the conqueror worm. <UNK> silence there are some qualities--some incorporate things, that have a double life, which thus is made a type of that twin entity which springs from matter and light, evinced in solid and shade. there is a two-fold _silence_--sea and shore-- body and soul. one dwells in lonely places, newly with grass o’ergrown; some solemn graces, some human memories and tearful lore, render him terrorless: his name’s “no more.” he is the corporate silence: dread him not! no power hath he of evil in himself; but should some urgent fate (untimely lot!) bring thee to meet his shadow (nameless elf, that haunteth the lone regions where hath trod no foot of man,) commend thyself to god! <UNK> dream-land by a route obscure and lonely, haunted by ill angels only, where an eidolon, named night, on a black throne reigns upright, i have reached these lands but newly from an ultimate dim thule-- from a wild weird clime that lieth, sublime, out of space--out of time. bottomless vales and boundless floods, and chasms, and caves, and titian woods, with forms that no man can discover for the dews that drip all over; mountains toppling evermore into seas without a shore; seas that restlessly aspire, surging, unto skies of fire; lakes that endlessly outspread their lone waters--lone and dead,-- their still waters--still and chilly with the snows of the lolling lily. by the lakes that thus outspread their lone waters, lone and dead,-- their sad waters, sad and chilly with the snows of the lolling lily,-- by the mountains--near the river murmuring lowly, murmuring ever,-- by the grey woods,--by the swamp where the toad and the newt encamp,-- by the dismal tarns and pools where dwell the ghouls,-- by each spot the most unholy-- in each nook most melancholy,-- there the traveller meets aghast sheeted memories of the past-- shrouded forms that start and sigh as they pass the wanderer by-- white-robed forms of friends long given, in agony, to the earth--and heaven. for the heart whose woes are legion ‘tis a peaceful, soothing region-- for the spirit that walks in shadow ‘tis--oh ‘tis an eldorado! but the traveller, travelling through it, may not--dare not openly view it; never its mysteries are exposed to the weak human eye unclosed; so wills its king, who hath forbid the uplifting of the fringed lid; and thus the sad soul that here passes beholds it but through darkened glasses. by a route obscure and lonely, haunted by ill angels only, where an eidolon, named night, on a black throne reigns upright, i have wandered home but newly from this ultimate dim thule. <UNK> hymn at morn--at noon--at twilight dim-- maria! thou hast heard my hymn! in joy and wo--in good and ill-- mother of god, be with me still! when the hours flew brightly by and not a cloud obscured the sky, my soul, lest it should truant be, thy grace did guide to thine and thee; now, when storms of fate o’ercast darkly my present and my past, let my future radiant shine with sweet hopes of thee and thine! <UNK> to zante fair isle, that from the fairest of all flowers, thy gentlest of all gentle names dost take how many memories of what radiant hours at sight of thee and thine at once awake! how many scenes of what departed bliss! how many thoughts of what entombed hopes! how many visions of a maiden that is no more--no more upon thy verdant slopes! no _more!_ alas, that magical sad sound transfomring all! thy charms shall please _no more_-- thy memory _no more!

(exeunt.) poems of youth introduction to <UNK> _letter to mr. b--._ “west point, <UNK> “dear b......... believing only a portion of my former volume to be worthy a second edition-that small portion i thought it as well to include in the present book as to republish by itself. i have therefore herein combined ‘al aaraaf’ and ‘tamerlane’ with other poems hitherto unprinted. nor have i hesitated to insert from the ‘minor poems,’ now omitted, whole lines, and even passages, to the end that being placed in a fairer light, and the trash shaken from them in which they were imbedded, they may have some chance of being seen by posterity. “it has been said that a good critique on a poem may be written by one who is no poet himself. this, according to your idea and _mine _of poetry, i feel to be false-the less poetical the critic, the less just the critique, and the converse. on this account, and because there are but few b-’s in the world, i would be as much ashamed of the world’s good opinion as proud of your own. another than yourself might here observe, ‘shakespeare is in possession of the world’s good opinion, and yet shakespeare is the greatest of poets. it appears then that the world judge correctly, why should you be ashamed of their favorable judgment?’ the difficulty lies in the interpretation of the word ‘judgment’ or ‘opinion.’ the opinion is the world’s, truly, but it may be called theirs as a man would call a book his, having bought it; he did not write the book, but it is his; they did not originate the opinion, but it is theirs. a fool, for example, thinks shakespeare a great poet-yet the fool has never read shakespeare. but the fool’s neighbor, who is a step higher on the andes of the mind, whose head (that is to say, his more exalted thought) is too far above the fool to be seen or understood, but whose feet (by which i mean his everyday actions) are sufficiently near to be discerned, and by means of which that superiority is ascertained, which but for them would never have been discovered-this neighbor asserts that shakespeare is a great poet--the fool believes him, and it is henceforward his _opinion. _this neighbor’s own opinion has, in like manner, been adopted from one above him, and so, ascendingly, to a few gifted individuals who kneel around the summit, beholding, face to face, the master spirit who stands upon the pinnacle. “you are aware of the great barrier in the path of an american writer. he is read, if at all, in preference to the combined and established wit of the world. i say established; for it is with literature as with law or empire-an established name is an estate in tenure, or a throne in possession. besides, one might suppose that books, like their authors, improve by travel-their having crossed the sea is, with us, so great a distinction. our antiquaries abandon time for distance; our very fops glance from the binding to the bottom of the title-page, where the mystic characters which spell london, paris, or genoa, are precisely so many letters of recommendation. “i mentioned just now a vulgar error as regards criticism. i think the notion that no poet can form a correct estimate of his own writings is another. i remarked before that in proportion to the poetical talent would be the justice of a critique upon poetry. therefore a bad poet would, i grant, make a false critique, and his self-love would infallibly bias his little judgment in his favor; but a poet, who is indeed a poet, could not, i think, fail of making-a just critique; whatever should be deducted on the score of self-love might be replaced on account of his intimate acquaintance with the subject; in short, we have more instances of false criticism than of just where one’s own writings are the test, simply because we have more bad poets than good. there are, of course, many objections to what i say: milton is a great example of the contrary; but his opinion with respect to the ‘paradise regained’ is by no means fairly ascertained. by what trivial circumstances men are often led to assert what they do not really believe! perhaps an inadvertent word has descended to posterity. but, in fact, the ‘paradise regained’ is little, if at all, inferior to the ‘paradise lost,’ and is only supposed so to be because men do not like epics, whatever they may say to the contrary, and, reading those of milton in their natural order, are too much wearied with the first to derive any pleasure from the second. “i dare say milton preferred ‘comus’ to either-. if so-justly. “as i am speaking of poetry, it will not be amiss to touch slightly upon the most singular heresy in its modern history-the heresy of what is called, very foolishly, the lake school. some years ago i might have been induced, by an occasion like the present, to attempt a formal refutation of their doctrine; at present it would be a work of supererogation. the wise must bow to the wisdom of such men as coleridge and southey, but, being wise, have laughed at poetical theories so prosaically exemplifled. “aristotle, with singular assurance, has declared poetry the most philosophical of all writings*-but it required a wordsworth to pronounce it the most metaphysical. he seems to think that the end of poetry is, or should be, instruction; yet it is a truism that the end of our existence is happiness; if so, the end of every separate part of our existence, everything connected with our existence, should be still happiness. therefore the end of instruction should be happiness; and happiness is another name for pleasure;-therefore the end of instruction should be pleasure: yet we see the above-mentioned opinion implies precisely the reverse. “to proceed: _ceteris paribus,_ he who pleases is of more importance to his fellow-men than he who instructs, since utility is happiness, and pleasure is the end already obtained which instruction is merely the means of obtaining. “i see no reason, then, why our metaphysical poets should plume themselves so much on the utility of their works, unless indeed they refer to instruction with eternity in view; in which case, sincere respect for their piety would not allow me to express my contempt for their judgment; contempt which it would be difficult to conceal, since their writings are professedly to be understood by the few, and it is the many who stand in need of salvation. in such case i should no doubt be tempted to think of the devil in ‘melmoth.’ who labors indefatigably, through three octavo volumes, to accomplish the destruction of one or two souls, while any common devil would have demolished one or two thousand. “against the subtleties which would make poetry a study-not a passion-it becomes the metaphysician to reason-but the poet to protest. yet wordsworth and coleridge are men in years; the one imbued in contemplation from his childhood; the other a giant in intellect and learning. the diffidence, then, with which i venture to dispute their authority would be overwhelming did i not feel, from the bottom of my heart, that learning has little to do with the imagination-intellect with the passions-or age with poetry. “‘trifles, like straws, upon the surface flow; he who would search for pearls must dive below,’ are lines which have done much mischief. as regards the greater truths, men oftener err by seeking them at the bottom than at the top; truth lies in the huge abysses where wisdom is sought-not in the palpable palaces where she is found. the ancients were not always right in hiding--the goddess in a well; witness the light which bacon has thrown upon philosophy; witness the principles of our divine faith--that moral mechanism by which the simplicity of a child may overbalance the wisdom of a man. “we see an instance of coleridge’s liability to err, in his ‘biographia literaria’--professedly his literary life and opinions, but, in fact, a treatise _de omni scibili et quibusdam aliis. _he goes wrong by reason of his very profundity, and of his error we have a natural type in the contemplation of a star. he who regards it directly and intensely sees, it is true, the star, but it is the star without a ray-while he who surveys it less inquisitively is conscious of all for which the star is useful to us below-its brilliancy and its beauty. “as to wordsworth, i have no faith in him. that he had in youth the feelings of a poet i believe-for there are glimpses of extreme delicacy in his writings-(and delicacy is the poet’s own kingdom-his _el dorado)-but they _have the appearance of a better day recollected; and glimpses, at best, are little evidence of present poetic fire; we know that a few straggling flowers spring up daily in the crevices of the glacier. “he was to blame in wearing away his youth in contemplation with the end of poetizing in his manhood. with the increase of his judgment the light which should make it apparent has faded away. his judgment consequently is too correct. this may not be understood-but the old goths of germany would have understood it, who used to debate matters of importance to their state twice, once when drunk, and once when sober-sober that they might not be deficient in formality--drunk lest they should be destitute of vigor. “the long wordy discussions by which he tries to reason us into admiration of his poetry, speak very little in his favor: they are full of such assertions as this (i have opened one of his volumes at random)--‘of genius the only proof is the act of doing well what is worthy to be done, and what was never done before;’-indeed? then it follows that in doing what is unworthy to be done, or what _has _been done before, no genius can be evinced; yet the picking of pockets is an unworthy act, pockets have been picked time immemorial, and barrington, the pickpocket, in point of genius, would have thought hard of a comparison with william wordsworth, the poet. “again, in estimating the merit of certain poems, whether they be ossian’s or macpherson’s can surely be of little consequence, yet, in order to prove their worthlessness, mr. w. has expended many pages in the controversy. _tantaene animis? _can great minds descend to such absurdity? but worse still: that he may bear down every argument in favor of these poems, he triumphantly drags forward a passage, in his abomination with which he expects the reader to sympathize. it is the beginning of the epic poem ‘temora.’ ‘the blue waves of ullin roll in light; the green hills are covered with day; trees shake their dusty heads in the breeze.’ and this this gorgeous, yet simple imagery, where all is alive and panting with immortality-this, william wordsworth, the author of ‘peter bell,’ has _selected _for his contempt. we shall see what better he, in his own person, has to offer. imprimis: “‘and now she’s at the pony’s tail, and now she’s at the pony’s head, on that side now, and now on this; and, almost stifled with her bliss, a few sad tears does betty shed.... she pats the pony, where or when she knows not.... happy betty foy! oh, johnny, never mind the doctor!’ secondly: “‘the dew was falling fast, the-stars began to blink; i heard a voice: it said-“drink, pretty creature, drink!” and, looking o’er the hedge, be-fore me i espied a snow-white mountain lamb, with a-maiden at its side. no other sheep was near,--the lamb was all alone, and by a slender cord was-tether’d to a stone.’ “now, we have no doubt this is all true: we will believe it, indeed we will, mr. w. is it sympathy for the sheep you wish to excite? i love a sheep from the bottom of my heart. “but there are occasions, dear b-, there are occasions when even wordsworth is reasonable. even stamboul, it is said, shall have an end, and the most unlucky blunders must come to a conclusion. here is an extract from his preface:- “‘those who have been accustomed to the phraseology of modem writers, if they persist in reading this book to a conclusion _(impossible!) will, _no doubt, have to struggle with feelings of awkwardness; (ha! ha! ha!) they will look round for poetry (ha! ha! ha! ha!), and will be induced to inquire by what species of courtesy these attempts have been permitted to assume that title.’ ha! ha! ha! ha! ha! “yet, let not mr. w. despair; he has given immortality to a wagon, and the bee sophocles has transmitted to eternity a sore toe, and dignified a tragedy with a chorus of turkeys. “of coleridge, i can not speak but with reverence. his towering intellect! his gigantic power! to use an author quoted by himself, _‘tai trouvé souvent que la plupart des sectes ont raison dans une bonne partie de ce qu’elles avancent, mais non pas en ce qu’elles nient,’ and _to employ his own language, he has

that twined each starry form around, and all the opal’d air in color bound. all hurriedly she knelt upon a bed of flowers: of lilies such as rear’d the head *on the fair capo deucato, and sprang so eagerly around about to hang upon the flying footsteps of--deep pride-- †of her who lov’d a mortal--and so died. the sephalica, budding with young bees, uprear’d its purple stem around her knees: * on

with madness, and unwonted reverie: in heaven, and all its environs, the leaf and blossom of the fairy plant, in grief disconsolate linger--grief that hangs her head, repenting follies that full long

notes on milton’s christian doctrine_. this opinion, in spite of many testimonies to the contrary, could never have been very general. andeus, a syrian of mesopotamia, was condemned for the opinion, as heretical. he lived in the beginning of the fourth century. his disciples were called anthropmorphites.--_vide du pin_. among milton’s poems are these lines:-- dicite sacrorum præsides nemorum deæ,

of silence on the startled ear which dreamy poets name “the music of the sphere.” ours is a world of words: quiet we call “silence”--which is the merest word of all. all nature speaks, and ev’n ideal

fall.--_milton._ and rays from god shot down that meteor chain and hallow’d all the beauty twice again, save when, between th’ empyrean and that ring, some eager spirit flapp’d his dusky wing. but on

“dead sea.” in the valley of siddim were five--adrah, zeboin, zoar, sodom and gomorrah. stephen of byzantium mentions eight, and strabo thirteeen, (engulphed) --but the last is out of all reason. it is said, (tacitus, strabo, josephus, daniel of st. saba, nau, maundrell, troilo, d’arvieux) that after an excessive drought, the vestiges of columns, walls, &c. are seen above the surface. at _any_ season, such remains may be discovered by looking down into the transparent lake, and at such distances as would argue the existence of many settlements in the space now usurped by the ‘asphaltites.’

could angels be blest?) those kisses of true love that lull’d ye to rest! up!--shake from your wing each hindering thing: the dew of the night-- it would weigh down your flight; and true love caresses-- o! leave them apart! * in scripture is this passage--“the sun shall not harm thee by day, nor the moon by night.” it is perhaps not generally known that the moon, in egypt, has the effect of producing blindness to those who sleep with the face exposed to its rays, to which circumstance the passage evidently alludes. they are light on the tresses, but lead on the heart. ligeia!

whatever thy image may be, no magic shall sever thy music from thee. thou hast bound many eyes in a dreamy sleep-- but the strains still arise which _thy_ vigilance keep-- the sound of the rain which leaps down to the flower, and dances again in the rhythm of the shower-- †the murmur that springs from the growing of grass * the albatross is said to sleep on the wing. ** i met with this idea in an old english tale, which i am now unable to obtain and quote from memory:--“the verie essence and, as it were, springe-heade, and origine of all musiche is the verie pleasaunte sounde which the trees of the forest do make when they growe.” are the music of things-- but are modell’d, alas!-- away, then my dearest, o! hie thee away to springs that lie clearest beneath the moon-ray-- to lone lake that smiles, in its dream of deep rest, at the many star-isles that enjewel its breast-- where wild flowers, creeping, have mingled their shade, on its margin is sleeping full many a maid-- some have left the cool glade, and * have slept with the bee-- arouse them my maiden, on moorland and lea-- go! breathe on their slumber, all softly in ear, the musical number they slumber’d to hear-- for what can awaken an angel so soon * the wild bee will not sleep in the shade if there be moonlight. the rhyme in this verse, as in one about sixty lines before, has an appearance of affectation. it is, however, imitated from sir w. scott, or rather from claud halcro--in whose mouth i admired its effect: o! were there an island, tho’ ever so wild where woman might smile, and no man be beguil’d, &c. whose sleep hath been taken beneath the cold moon, as the spell which no slumber of witchery may test, the rythmical number which lull’d him to rest?” spirits in wing, and angels to the view, a thousand seraphs burst th’ empyrean thro’, young dreams still hovering on their drowsy flight-- seraphs in all but “knowledge,” the keen light that fell, refracted, thro’ thy bounds, afar o death! from eye of god upon that star: sweet was that error--sweeter still that death-- sweet was that error--ev’n with _us_ the breath of science dims the mirror of our joy-- to them ‘twere the simoom, and would destroy-- for what (to them) availeth it to know that truth is falsehood--or that bliss is woe? sweet was their death--with them to die was rife with the last ecstacy of satiate life-- beyond that death no immortality-- but sleep that pondereth and is not “to be”-- and there--oh! may my weary spirit dwell-- *apart from heaven’s eternity--and yet how far from hell! * with the arabians there is a medium between heaven and hell, where men suffer no punishment, but yet do not attain that tranquil and even happiness which they suppose to be characteristic of heavenly enjoyment. un no rompido sueno-- un dia puro--allegre--libre quiera-- libre de amor--de zelo-- de odio--de esperanza--de rezelo.---_luis ponce de leon_. sorrow is not excluded from “al aaraaf,” but it is that sorrow which the living love to cherish for the dead, and which, in some minds, resembles the delirium of opium. the passionate excitement of love and the buoyancy of spirit attendant upon intoxication are its less holy pleasures-- the price of which, to those souls who make choice of “al aaraaf” as their residence after life, is final death and annihilation. what guilty spirit, in what shrubbery dim, heard not the stirring summons of that hymn? but two: they fell: for heaven no grace imparts to those who hear not for their beating hearts. a maiden-angel and her seraph-lover-- o! where (and ye may seek the wide skies over) was love, the blind, near sober duty known? *unguided love hath fallen--‘mid “tears of perfect moan.” he was a goodly spirit--he who fell: a wanderer by moss-y-mantled well-- a gazer on the lights that shine above-- a dreamer in the moonbeam by his love: what wonder? for each star is eye-like there, and looks so sweetly down on beauty’s hair-- and they, and ev’ry mossy spring were holy to his love-haunted heart and melancholy. the night had found (to him a night of wo) upon a mountain crag, young angelo-- beetling it bends athwart the solemn sky, and scowls on starry worlds that down beneath it lie. here sate he with his love--his dark eye bent with eagle gaze along the firmament: now turn’d it upon her--but ever then it trembled to the orb of earth again. “iante, dearest, see! how dim that ray! how lovely ‘tis to look so far away! * there be tears of perfect moan wept for thee in helicon.--_milton._ she seem’d not thus upon that autumn eve i left her gorgeous halls--nor mourn’d to leave. that eve--that eve--i should remember well-- the sun-ray dropp’d, in lemnos, with a spell on th’arabesque carving of a gilded hall wherein i sate, and on the draperied wall-- and on my eye-lids--o the heavy light! how drowsily it weigh’d them into night! on flowers, before, and mist, and love they ran with persian saadi in his gulistan: but o that light!--i slumber’d--death, the while, stole o’er my senses in that lovely isle so softly that no single silken hair awoke that slept--or knew that it was there. the last spot of earth’s orb i trod upon *was a proud temple call’d the parthenon-- more beauty clung around her column’d wall **than ev’n thy glowing bosom beats withal, and when old time my wing did disenthral thence sprang i--as the eagle from his tower, and years i left behind me in an hour. what time upon her airy bounds i hung one half the garden of her globe was flung unrolling as a chart unto my view-- tenantless cities of the desert too! ianthe, beauty crowded on me then, and half i wish’d to be again of men.” “my angelo! and why of them to be? a brighter dwelling-place is here for thee-- * it was entire in <UNK> most elevated spot in athens. ** shadowing more beauty in their airy brows than have the white breasts of the queen of love.--_marlowe._ and greener fields than in yon world above, and women’s loveliness--and passionate love.” “but, list, ianthe! when the air so soft *fail’d, as my pennon’d spirit leapt aloft, perhaps my brain grew dizzy--but the world i left so late was into chaos hurl’d-- sprang from her station, on the winds apart, and roll’d, a flame, the fiery heaven athwart. methought, my sweet one, then i ceased to soar and fell--not swiftly as i rose before, but with a downward, tremulous motion thro’ light, brazen rays, this golden star unto! nor long the measure of my falling hours, for nearest of all stars was thine to ours-- dread star! that came, amid a night of mirth, a red dædalion on the timid earth. “we came--and to thy earth--but not to us be given our lady’s bidding to discuss: we came, my love; around, above, below, gay fire-fly of the night we come and go, nor ask a reason save the angel-nod she grants to us, as granted by her god-- but, angelo, than thine grey time unfurl’d never his fairy wing o’er fairier world! dim was its little disk, and angel eyes alone could see the phantom in the skies, when first al aaraaf knew her course to be headlong thitherward o’er the starry sea-- but when its glory swell’d upon the sky, as glowing beauty’s bust beneath man’s eye, * pennon--for pinion.--_milton_. we paus’d before the heritage of men, and thy star trembled--as doth beauty then!” thus, in discourse, the lovers whiled away the night that waned and waned and brought no day. they fell: for heaven to them no hope imparts who hear not for the beating of their hearts. tamerlane kind solace in a dying hour! such, father, is not (now) my theme-- i will not madly deem that power of earth may shrive me of the sin unearthly pride hath revell’d in-- i have no time to dote or dream: you call it hope--that fire of fire! it is but agony of desire: if i _can_ hope--oh god! i can-- its fount is holier--more divine-- i would not call thee fool, old man, but such is not a gift of thine. know thou the secret of a spirit bow’d from its wild pride into shame. o! yearning heart! i did inherit thy withering portion with the fame, the searing glory which hath shone amid the jewels of my throne, halo of hell! and with a pain not hell shall make me fear again-- o! craving heart, for the lost flowers and sunshine of my summer hours! th’ undying voice of that dead time, with its interminable chime, rings, in the spirit of a spell, upon thy emptiness--a knell. i have not always been as now: the fever’d diadem on my brow i claim’d and won usurpingly-- hath not the same fierce heirdom given rome to the caesar--this to me? the heritage of a kingly mind, and a proud spirit which hath striven triumphantly with human kind. on mountain soil i first drew life: the mists of the taglay have shed nightly their dews upon my head, and, i believe, the winged strife and tumult of the headlong air have nestled in my very hair. so late from heaven--that dew--it fell (mid dreams of an unholy night) upon me--with the touch of hell, while the red flashing of the light from clouds that hung, like banners, o’er, appeared to my half-closing eye the pageantry of monarchy, and the deep trumpet-thunder’s roar came hurriedly upon me, telling of human battle, where my voice, my own voice, silly child!--was swelling (o! how my spirit would rejoice, and leap within me at the cry) the battle-cry of victory! the rain came down upon my head unshelter’d--and the heavy wind was giantlike--so thou, my mind!-- it was but man, i thought, who shed laurels upon me: and the rush-- the torrent of the chilly air gurgled within my ear the crush of empires--with the captive’s prayer-- the hum of suiters--and the tone of flattery ‘round a sovereign’s throne. my passions, from that hapless hour, usurp’d a tyranny which men have deem’d, since i have reach’d to power; my innate nature--be it so: but, father, there liv’d one who, then, then--in my boyhood--when their fire burn’d with a still intenser glow, (for passion must, with youth, expire) e’en _then_ who knew this iron heart in woman’s weakness had a part. i have no words--alas!--to tell the loveliness of loving well! nor would i now attempt to trace the more than beauty of a face whose lineaments, upon my mind, are--shadows on th’ unstable wind: thus i remember having dwelt some page of early lore upon, with loitering eye, till i have felt the letters--with their meaning--melt to fantasies--with none. o, she was worthy of all love! love--as in infancy was mine-- ‘twas such as angel minds above might envy; her young heart the shrine on which my ev’ry hope and thought were incense--then a goodly gift, for they were childish--and upright-- pure--as her young example taught: why did i leave it, and, adrift, trust to the fire within, for light? we grew in age--and love--together, roaming the forest, and the wild; my breast her shield in wintry weather-- and, when the friendly sunshine smil’d, and she would mark the opening skies, _i_ saw no heaven--but in her eyes. young love’s first lesson is--the heart: for ‘mid that sunshine, and those smiles, when, from our little cares apart, and laughing at her girlish wiles, i’d throw me on her throbbing breast, and pour my spirit out in tears-- there was no need to speak the rest-- no need to quiet any fears of her--who ask’d no reason why, but turn’d on me her quiet eye! yet _more_ than worthy of the love my spirit struggled with, and strove, when, on the mountain peak, alone, ambition lent it a new tone-- i had no being--but in thee: the world, and all it did contain in the earth--the air--the sea-- its joy--its little lot of pain that was new pleasure--the ideal, dim, vanities of dreams by night-- and dimmer nothings which were real-- (shadows--and a more shadowy light!) parted upon their misty wings, and, so, confusedly, became thine image, and--a name--a name! two separate--yet most intimate things. i was ambitious--have you known the passion, father? you have not: a cottager, i mark’d a throne of half the world as all my own, and murmur’d at such lowly lot-- but, just like any other dream, upon the vapour of the dew my own had past, did not the beam of beauty which did while it thro’ the minute--the hour--the day--oppress my mind with double loveliness. we walk’d together on the crown of a high mountain which look’d down afar from its proud natural towers of rock and forest, on the hills-- the dwindled hills! begirt with bowers and shouting with a thousand rills. i spoke to her of power and pride, but mystically--in such guise that she might deem it nought beside the moment’s converse; in her eyes i read, perhaps too carelessly-- a mingled feeling with my own-- the flush on her bright cheek, to me seem’d to become a queenly throne too well that i should let it be light in the wilderness alone. i wrapp’d myself in grandeur then, and donn’d a visionary crown-- yet it was not that fantasy had thrown her mantle over me-- but that, among the rabble--men, lion ambition is chain’d down-- and crouches to a keeper’s hand-- not so in deserts where the grand the wild--the terrible conspire with their own breath to fan his fire. look ‘round thee now on samarcand!-- is not she queen of earth? her pride above all cities? in her hand their destinies? in all beside of glory which the world hath known stands she not nobly and alone? falling--her veriest stepping-stone shall form the pedestal of a throne-- and who her sovereign? timour--he whom the astonished people saw striding o’er empires haughtily a diadem’d outlaw-- o! human love! thou spirit given, on earth, of all we hope in heaven! which fall’st into the soul like rain upon the siroc wither’d plain, and failing in thy power to bless but leav’st the heart a wilderness! idea! which bindest life around with music of so strange a sound and beauty of so wild a birth-- farewell! for i have won the earth! when hope, the eagle that tower’d, could see no cliff beyond him in the sky, his pinions were bent droopingly-- and homeward turn’d his soften’d eye. ‘twas sunset: when the sun will part there comes a sullenness of heart to him who still would look upon the glory of the summer sun. that soul will hate the ev’ning mist, so often lovely, and will list to the sound of the coming darkness (known to those whose spirits hearken) as one who, in a dream of night, _would_ fly but _cannot_ from a danger nigh. what tho’ the moon--the white moon shed all the splendour of her noon, her smile is chilly--and her beam, in that time of dreariness, will seem (so like you gather in your breath) a portrait taken after death. and boyhood is a summer sun whose waning is the dreariest one-- for all we live to know is known, and all we seek to keep hath flown-- let life, then, as the day-flower, fall with the noon-day beauty--which is all. i reach’d my home--my home no more-- for all had flown who made it so-- i pass’d from out its mossy door, and, tho’ my tread was soft and low, a voice came from the threshold stone of one whom i had earlier known-- o! i defy thee, hell, to show on beds of fire that burn below, a humbler heart--a deeper wo-- father, i firmly do believe-- i _know_--for death, who comes for me from regions of the blest afar, where there is nothing to deceive, hath left his iron gate ajar, and rays of truth you cannot see are flashing thro’ eternity-- i do believe that eblis hath a snare in ev’ry human path-- else how, when in the holy grove i wandered of the idol, love, who daily scents his snowy wings with incense of burnt offerings from the most unpolluted things, whose pleasant bowers are yet so riven above with trelliced rays from heaven no mote may shun--no tiniest fly the light’ning of his eagle eye-- how was it that ambition crept, unseen, amid the revels there, till growing bold, he laughed and leapt in the tangles of love’s very hair? <UNK> to helen helen, thy beauty is to me like those nicean barks of yore, that gently, o’er a perfumed sea, the weary way-worn wanderer bore to his own native shore. on desperate seas long wont to roam, thy hyacinth hair, thy classic face, thy naiad airs have brought me home to the glory that was greece, and the grandeur that was rome. lo! in yon brilliant window-niche how statue-like i me thee stand, the agate lamp within thy hand! ah, psyche, from the regions which are holy-land! <UNK> the valley of unrest _once_ it smiled a silent dell where the people did not dwell; they had gone unto the wars, trusting to the mild-eyed stars, nightly, from their azure towers, to keep watch above the flowers, in the midst of which all day the red sun-light lazily lay. _now_ each visiter shall confess the sad valley’s restlessness. nothing there is motionless-- nothing save the airs that brood over the magic solitude. ah, by no wind are stirred those trees that palpitate like the chill seas around the misty hebrides! ah, by no wind those clouds are driven that rustle through the unquiet heaven uneasily, from morn till even, over the violets there that lie in myriad types of the human eye-- over the lilies there that wave and weep above a nameless grave! they wave:--from out their fragrant tops eternal dews come down in drops. they weep:--from off their delicate stems perennial tears descend in gems. <UNK> israfel* in heaven a spirit doth dwell “whose heart-strings are a lute;” none sing so wildly well as the angel israfel, and the giddy stars (so legends tell) ceasing their hymns, attend the spell of his voice, all mute. tottering above in her highest noon the enamoured moon blushes with love, while, to listen, the red levin (with the rapid pleiads, even, which were seven,) pauses in heaven and they say (the starry choir and all the listening things) that israfeli’s fire is owing to that lyre by which he sits and sings-- the trembling living wire of those unusual strings. * and the angel israfel, whose heart-strings are a lut, and who has the sweetest voice of all god’s creatures.--koran. but the skies that angel trod, where deep thoughts are a duty-- where love’s a grown up god-- where the houri glances are imbued with all the beauty which we worship in a star. therefore, thou art not wrong, israfeli, who despisest an unimpassion’d song: to thee the laurels belong best bard, because the wisest! merrily live, and long! the extacies above with thy burning measures suit-- thy grief, thy joy, thy hate, thy love, with the fervor of thy lute-- well may the stars be mute! yes, heaven is thine; but this is a world of sweets and sours; our flowers are merely--flowers, and the shadow of thy perfect bliss is the sunshine of ours. if i could dwell where israfel hath dwelt, and he where i, he might not sing so wildly well a mortal melody, while a bolder note than this might swell from my lyre within the sky. <UNK> to ---- <UNK> the bowers whereat, in dreams, i see the wantonest singing birds are lips--and all thy melody of lip-begotten words-- <UNK> thine eyes, in heaven of heart enshrin’d then desolately fall, o! god! on my funereal mind like starlight on a pall-- <UNK> thy heart--_thy_ heart!--i wake and sigh, and sleep to dream till day of truth that gold can never buy-- of the trifles that it may. <UNK> to ---- i heed not that my earthly lot hath-little of earth in it-- that years of love have been forgot in the hatred of a minute:-- i mourn not that the desolate are happier, sweet, than i, but that you sorrow for my fate who am a passer-by. <UNK> to the river---- fair river! in thy bright, clear flow of crystal, wandering water, thou art an emblem of the glow of beauty--the unhidden heart-- the playful maziness of art in old alberto’s daughter; but when within thy wave she looks-- which glistens then, and trembles-- why, then, the prettiest of brooks her worshipper resembles; for in my heart, as in thy stream, her image deeply lies-- his heart which trembles at the beam of her soul-searching eyes. <UNK> song i saw thee on thy bridal day-- when a burning blush came o’er thee, though happiness around thee lay, the world all love before thee: and in thine eye a kindling light (whatever it might be) was all on earth my aching sight of loveliness could see. that blush, perhaps, was maiden shame-- as such it well may pass-- though its glow hath raised a fiercer flame in the breast of him, alas! who saw thee on that bridal day, when that deep blush _would_ come o’er thee, though happiness around thee lay, the world all love before thee. <UNK> spirits of the dead <UNK> thy soul shall find itself alone ‘mid dark thoughts of the grey tomb-stone-- not one, of all the crowd, to pry into thine hour of secrecy: <UNK> be silent in that solitude which is not loneliness--for then the spirits of the dead who stood in life before thee are again in death around thee--and their will shall then overshadow thee: be still. <UNK> for the night--tho’ clear--shall frown-- and the stars shall look not down, from their high thrones in the heaven, with light like hope to mortals given-- but their red orbs, without beam, to thy weariness shall seem as a burning and a fever which would cling to thee for ever: <UNK> now are thoughts thou shalt not banish-- now are visions ne’er to vanish-- from thy spirit shall they pass no more--like dew-drop from the grass: <UNK> the breeze--the breath of god--is still-- and the mist upon the hill shadowy--shadowy--yet unbroken, is a symbol and a token-- how it hangs upon the trees, a mystery of mysteries!-- <UNK> a dream in visions of the dark night i have dreamed of joy departed-- but a waking dreams of life and light hath left me broken-hearted. ah! what is not a dream by day to him whose eyes are cast on things around him with a ray turned back upon the past? that holy dream--that holy dream, while all the world were chiding, hath cheered me as a lovely beam a lonely spirit guiding. what though that light, thro’ storm and night, so trembled from afar- what could there be more purely bright in truths day-star? <UNK> romance romance, who loves to nod and sing, with drowsy head and folded wing, among the green leaves as they shake far down within some shadowy lake, to me a painted paroquet hath been--a most familiar bird-- taught me my alphabet to say-- to lisp my very earliest word while in the wild wood i did lie, a child--with a most knowing eye. of late, eternal condor years so shake the very heaven on high with tumult as they thunder by, i have no time for idle cares through gazing on the unquiet sky. and when an hour with calmer wings its down upon thy spirit flings-- that little time with lyre and rhyme to while away--forbidden things! my heart would feel to be a crime unless it trembled with the strings. <UNK> fairy-land dim vales--and shadowy floods-- and cloudy-looking woods, whose forms we can’t discover for the tears that drip all over huge moons there wax and wane-- again--again--again-- every moment of the night-- forever changing places-- and they put out the star-light with the breath from their pale faces. about twelve by the moon-dial one, more filmy than the rest (a kind which, upon trial, they have found to be the best) comes down--still down--and down with its centre on the crown of a mountain’s eminence, while its wide circumference in easy drapery falls over hamlets, over halls, wherever they may be-- o’er the strange woods--o’er the sea-- over spirits on the wing-- over every drowsy thing-- and buries them up quite in a labyrinth of light-- and then, how deep!--o, deep! is the passion of their sleep. in the morning they arise, and their moony covering is soaring in the skies, with the tempests as they toss, like--almost any thing-- or a yellow albatross. they use that moon no more for the same end as before-- videlicet a tent-- which i think extravagant: its atomies, however, into a shower dissever, of which those butterflies, of earth, who seek the skies, and so come down again (never-contented things!) have brought a specimen upon their quivering wings. <UNK> the lake ---- to---- in spring of youth it was my lot to haunt of the wide earth a spot the which i could not love the less-- so lovely was the loneliness of a wild lake, with black rock bound, and the tall pines that tower’d around. but when the night had thrown her pall upon that spot, as upon all, and the mystic wind went by murmuring in melody-- then--ah then i would awake to the terror of the lone lake. yet that terror was not fright, but a tremulous delight-- a feeling not the jewelled mine could teach or bribe me to define-- nor love--although the love were thine. death was in that poisonous wave, and in its gulf a fitting grave for him who thence could solace bring to his lone imagining-- whose solitary soul could make an eden of that dim lake. <UNK> evening star ‘twas noontide of summer, and midtime of night, and stars, in their orbits, shone pale, through the light of the brighter, cold moon. ‘mid planets her slaves, herself in the heavens, her beam on the waves. i gazed awhile on her cold smile; too cold-too cold for me-- there passed, as a shroud, a fleecy cloud, and i turned away to thee, proud evening star, in thy glory afar and dearer thy beam shall be; for joy to my heart is the proud part thou bearest in heaven at night., and more i admire thy distant fire, than that colder, lowly light. <UNK> “the happiest day.” i the happiest day-the happiest hour my seared and blighted heart hath known, the highest hope of pride and power, i feel hath flown. of power! said i? yes! such i ween but they have vanished long, alas! the visions of my youth have been but let them pass. iii and pride, what have i now with thee? another brow may ev’n inherit the venom thou hast poured on me be still my spirit! iv the happiest day-the happiest hour mine eyes shall see-have ever seen the brightest glance of pride and power i feet have been: v but were that hope of pride and power now offered with the pain ev’n _then i _felt-that brightest hour i would not live again: vi for on its wing was dark alloy and as it fluttered-fell an essence-powerful to destroy a soul that knew it well. <UNK> imitation a dark unfathom’d tide of interminable pride-- a mystery, and a dream, should my early life seem; i say that dream was fraught with a wild, and waking thought of beings that have been, which my spirit hath not seen, had i let them pass me by, with a dreaming eye! let none of earth inherit that vision on my spirit; those thoughts i would control as a spell upon his soul: for that bright hope at last and that light time have past, and my worldly rest hath gone with a sigh as it pass’d on i care not tho’ it perish with a thought i then did cherish. <UNK> hymn to aristogeiton and harmodius translation from the greek i wreathed in myrtle, my sword i’ll conceal like those champions devoted and brave, when they plunged in the tyrant their steel, and to athens deliverance gave. ii beloved heroes!

ye avengers of liberty’s wrongs! endless ages shall cherish your fame, embalmed in their echoing songs! <UNK> dreams oh! that my young life were a lasting dream! my spirit not awak’ning, till the beam of an eternity should bring the morrow: yes! tho’ that long dream were of hopeless sorrow, ‘twere better than the dull reality of waking life to him whose heart shall be, and hath been ever, on the chilly earth, a chaos of deep passion from his birth! but should it be--that dream eternally continuing--as dreams have been to me in my young boyhood--should it thus be given, ‘twere folly still to hope for higher heaven! for i have revell’d, when the sun was bright in the summer sky; in dreamy fields of light, and left unheedingly my very heart in climes of mine imagining--apart from mine own home, with beings that have been of mine own thought--what more could i have seen? ‘twas once & _only_ once & the wild hour from my rememberance shall not pass--some power or spell had bound me--‘twas the chilly wind came o’er me in the night & left behind its image on my spirit, or the moon shone on my slumbers in her lofty noon too coldly--or the stars--howe’er it was that dream was as that night wind--let it pass. i have been happy--tho’ but in a dream i have been happy--& i love the theme-- dreams! in their vivid colouring of life-- as in that fleeting, shadowy, misty strife of semblance with reality which brings to the delirious eye more lovely things of paradise & love--& all our own! than young hope in his sunniest hour hath known. {from an earlier ms. than in the book--ed.} “in youth i have known one” _how often we forget all time, when lone admiring nature’s universal throne; her woods--her wilds--her mountains-the intense reply of hers to our intelligence!_ i in youth i have known one with whom the earth in secret communing held-as he with it, in daylight, and in beauty, from his birth: whose fervid, flickering torch of life was lit from the sun and stars, whence he had drawn forth a passionate light such for his spirit was fit and yet that spirit knew-not in the hour of its own fervor-what had o’er it power. ii perhaps it may be that my mind is wrought to a fever* by the moonbeam that hangs o’er, but i will half believe that wild light fraught with more of sovereignty than ancient lore hath ever told-or is it of a thought the unembodied essence, and no more that with a quickening spell doth o’er us pass as dew of the night-time, o’er the summer grass? iii doth o’er us pass, when, as th’ expanding eye to the loved object-so the tear to the lid will start, which lately slept in apathy? and yet it need not be--(that object) hid from us in life-but common-which doth lie each hour before us--but then only bid with a strange sound, as of a harp-string broken t’ awake us--‘tis a symbol and a token iv of what in other worlds shall be--and given in beauty by our god, to those alone who otherwise would fall from life and heaven drawn by their heart’s passion, and that tone, that high tone of the spirit which hath striven though not with faith-with godliness--whose throne with desperate energy ‘t hath beaten down; wearing its own deep feeling as a crown. * query “fervor”?--ed. a pæan. i. how shall the burial rite be read? the solemn song be sung? the requiem for the loveliest dead, that ever died so young? ii. her friends are gazing on her, and on her gaudy bier, and weep!--oh! to dishonor dead beauty with a tear! iii. they loved her for her wealth-- and they hated her for her pride-- but she grew in feeble health, and they _love_ her--that she died. iv. they tell me (while they speak of her “costly broider’d pall”) that my voice is growing weak-- that i should not sing at all-- v. or that my tone should be tun’d to such solemn song so mournfully--so mournfully, that the dead may feel no wrong. vi. but she is gone above, with young hope at her side, and i am drunk with love of the dead, who is my bride.-- vii. of the dead--dead who lies all perfum’d there, with the death upon her eyes, and the life upon her hair. viii. thus on the coffin loud and long i strike--the murmur sent through the grey chambers to my song, shall be the accompaniment. ix. thou died’st in thy life’s june-- but thou did’st not die too fair: thou did’st not die too soon, nor with too calm an air. x. from more than fiends on earth, thy life and love are riven, to join the untainted mirth of more than thrones in heaven-- xii. therefore, to thee this night i will no requiem raise, but waft thee on thy flight, with a pæan of old days. notes <UNK> on the “poems written in youth” little comment is needed. this section includes the pieces printed for first volume of <UNK> (which was subsequently suppressed), such poems from the first and second published volumes of <UNK> and <UNK> as have not already been given in their revised versions, and a few others collected from various sources. “al aaraaf” first appeared, with the sonnet “to silence” prefixed to it, in <UNK> and is, substantially, as originally issued. in the edition for <UNK> however, this poem, its author’s longest, was introduced by the following twenty-nine lines, which have been omitted in--all subsequent collections: al aaraaf mysterious star! thou wert my dream all a long summer night-- be now my theme! by this clear stream, of thee will i write; meantime from afar bathe me in light i thy world has not the dross of ours, yet all the beauty-all the flowers that list our love or deck our bowers in dreamy gardens, where do lie dreamy maidens all the day; while the silver winds of circassy on violet couches faint away. little--oh “little dwells in thee” like unto what on earth we see: beauty’s eye is here the bluest in the falsest and untruest--on the sweetest air doth float the most sad and solemn note-- if with thee be broken hearts, joy so peacefully departs, that its echo still doth dwell, like the murmur in the shell. thou! thy truest type of grief is the gently falling leaf! thy framing is so holy sorrow is not melancholy. <UNK> the earliest version of “tamerlane” was included in the suppressed volume of <UNK> but differs very considerably from the poem as now published. the present draft, besides innumerable verbal alterations and improvements upon the original, is more carefully punctuated, and, the lines being indented, presents a more pleasing appearance, to the eye at least. <UNK> “to helen” first appeared in the <UNK> volume, as did also “the valley of unrest” (as “the valley nis”), “israfel,” and one or two others of the youthful pieces. the poem styled “romance,” constituted the preface of the <UNK> volume, but with the addition of the following lines: succeeding years, too wild for song, then rolled like tropic storms along, where, through the garish lights that fly dying along the troubled sky, lay bare, through vistas thunder-riven, the blackness of the general heaven, that very blackness yet doth ring light on the lightning’s silver wing. for being an idle boy lang syne; who read anacreon and drank wine, i early found anacreon rhymes were almost passionate sometimes-- and by strange alchemy of brain his pleasures always turned to pain-- his naiveté to wild desire-- his wit to love-his wine to fire-- and so, being young and dipt in folly, i fell in love with melancholy, and used to throw my earthly rest and quiet all away in jest-- i could not love except where death was mingling his with beauty’s breath-- or hymen, time, and destiny, were stalking between her and me. ***** but now my soul hath too much room-- gone are the glory and the gloom-- the black hath mellow’d into gray, and all the fires are fading away. my draught of passion hath been deep-- i revell’d, and i now would sleep and after drunkenness of soul succeeds the glories of the bowl an idle longing night and day to dream my very life away. but dreams--of those who dream as i, aspiringly, are damned, and die: yet should i swear i mean alone, by notes so very shrilly blown, to break upon time’s monotone, while yet my vapid joy and grief are tintless of the yellow leaf-- why not an imp the graybeard hath, will shake his shadow in my path-- and e’en the graybeard will o’erlook connivingly my dreaming-book. doubtful poems alone from childhood’s hour i have not been as others were--i have not seen as others saw--i could not bring my passions from a common spring-- from the same source i have not taken my sorrow--i could not awaken my heart to joy at the same tone-- and all i lov’d--_i_ lov’d alone-- _then_--in my childhood--in the dawn of a most stormy life--was drawn from ev’ry depth of good and ill the mystery which binds me still-- from the torrent, or the fountain-- from the red cliff of the mountain-- from the sun that ‘round me roll’d in its autumn tint of gold-- from the lightning in the sky as it pass’d me flying by-- from the thunder, and the storm-- and the cloud that took the form (when the rest of heaven was blue) of a demon in my view-- {this poem is no longer considered doubtful as it was in <UNK> liberty has been taken to replace the book version with an earlier, perhaps more original manuscript version--ed} to isadore i beneath the vine-clad eaves, whose shadows fall before thy lowly cottage door under the lilac’s tremulous leaves-- within thy snowy claspeèd hand the purple flowers it bore.. last eve in dreams, i saw thee stand, like queenly nymphs from fairy-land-- enchantress of the flowery wand, most beauteous isadore! ii and when i bade the dream upon thy spirit flee, thy violet eyes to me upturned, did overflowing seem with the deep, untold delight of love’s serenity; thy classic brow, like lilies white and pale as the imperial night upon her throne, with stars bedight, enthralled my soul to thee! iii ah i ever i behold thy dreamy, passionate eyes, blue as the languid skies hung with the sunset’s fringe of gold; now strangely clear thine image grows, and olden memories are startled from their long repose like shadows on the silent snows when suddenly the night-wind blows where quiet moonlight ties. iv like music heard in dreams, like strains of harps unknown, of birds forever flown audible as the voice of streams that murmur in some leafy dell, i hear thy gentlest tone, and silence cometh with her spell like that which on my tongue doth dwell, when tremulous in dreams i tell my love to thee alone! v in every valley heard, floating from tree to tree, less beautiful to, me, the music of the radiant bird, than artless accents such as thine whose echoes never flee! ah! how for thy sweet voice i pine:-- for uttered in thy tones benign (enchantress!) this rude name of mine doth seem a melody! the village street in these rapid, restless shadows, once i walked at eventide, when a gentle, silent maiden, wal ked in beauty at my side she alone there walked beside me all in beauty, like a bride. pallidly the moon was shining on the dewy meadows nigh; on the silvery, silent rivers, on the mountains far and high on the ocean’s star-lit waters, where the winds a-weary die. slowly, silently we wandered from the open cottage door, underneath the elm’s long branches to the pavement bending o’er; underneath the mossy willow and the dying sycamore. with the myriad stars in beauty all bedight, the heavens were seen, radiant hopes were bright around me, like the light of stars serene; like the mellow midnight splendor of the night’s irradiate queen. audibly the elm-leaves whispered peaceful, pleasant melodies, like the distant murmured music of unquiet, lovely seas: while the winds were hushed in slumber in the fragrant flowers and trees. wondrous and unwonted beauty still adorning all did seem, while i told my love in fables ‘neath the willows by the stream; would the heart have kept unspoken love that was its rarest dream! instantly away we wandered in the shadowy twilight tide, she, the silent, scornful maiden, walking calmly at my side, with a step serene and stately, all in beauty, all in pride. vacantly i walked beside her. on the earth mine eyes were cast; swift and keen there came unto me ritter memories of the past on me, like the rain in autumn on the dead leaves, cold and fast. underneath the elms we parted, by the lowly cottage door; one brief word alone was uttered never on our lips before; and away i walked forlornly, broken-hearted evermore. slowly, silently i loitered, homeward, in the night, alone; sudden anguish bound my spirit, that my youth had never known; wild unrest, like that which cometh when the night’s first dream hath flown. now, to me the elm-leaves whisper mad, discordant melodies, and keen melodies like shadows haunt the moaning willow trees, and the sycamores with laughter mock me in the nightly breeze. sad and pale the autumn moonlight through the sighing foliage streams; and each morning, midnight shadow, shadow of my sorrow seems; strive, <UNK> heart, forget thine idol! and, <UNK> soul, forget thy dreams! the forest reverie ‘tis said that when the hands of men tamed this primeval wood, and hoary trees with groans of woe, like warriors by an unknown foe, were in their strength subdued, the virgin earth gave instant birth to springs that ne’er did flow that in the sun did rivulets run, and all around rare flowers did blow the wild rose pale perfumed the gale and the queenly lily adown the dale (whom the sun and the dew and the winds did woo), with the gourd and the grape luxuriant grew. so when in tears the love of years is wasted like the snow, and the fine fibrils of its life by the rude wrong of instant strife are broken at a blow within the heart do springs upstart of which it doth now know, and strange, sweet dreams, like silent streams that from new fountains overflow, with the earlier tide of rivers glide deep in the heart whose hope has died-- quenching the fires its ashes hide,-- its ashes, whence will spring and grow sweet flowers, ere long, the rare and radiant flowers of song! notes of the many verses from time to time ascribed to the pen of edgar poe, and not included among his known writings, the lines entitled “alone” have the chief claim to our notice. _fac-simile _copies of this piece had been in possession of the present editor some time previous to its publication in “scribner’s magazine” for september, <UNK> but as proofs of the authorship claimed for it were not forthcoming, he refrained from publishing it as requested. the desired proofs have not yet been adduced, and there is, at present, nothing but internal evidence to guide us. “alone” is stated to have been written by poe in the album of a baltimore lady (mrs. balderstone?), on march <UNK> <UNK> and the facsimile given in “scribner’s” is alleged to be of his handwriting. if the caligraphy be poe’s, it is different in all essential respects from all the many specimens known to us, and strongly resembles that of the writer of the heading and dating of the manuscript, both of which the contributor of the poem acknowledges to have been recently added. the lines, however, if not by poe, are the most successful imitation of his early mannerisms yet made public, and, in the opinion of one well qualified to speak, “are not unworthy on the whole of the parentage claimed for them.” while edgar poe was editor of the “broadway journal,” some lines “to isadore” appeared therein, and, like several of his known pieces, bore no signature. they were at once ascribed to poe, and in order to satisfy questioners, an editorial paragraph subsequently appeared saying they were by “a. ide, junior.” two previous poems had appeared in the “broadway journal” over the signature of “a. m. ide,” and whoever wrote them was also the author of the lines “to isadore.” in order, doubtless, to give a show of variety, poe was then publishing some of his known works in his journal over _noms de plume, _and as no other writings whatever can be traced to any person bearing the name of “a. m. ide,” it is not impossible that the poems now republished in this collection may be by the author of “the raven.” having been published without his usual elaborate revision, poe may have wished to _hide _his hasty work under an assumed name. the three pieces are included in the present collection, so the reader can judge for himself what pretensions they possess to be by the author of “the raven.”

eureka: an essay on the material and spiritual universe. it is with humility really unassumed—it is with a sentiment even of awe—that i pen the opening sentence of this work: for of all conceivable subjects i approach the reader with the most solemn—the most comprehensive—the most difficult—the most august. what terms shall i find sufficiently simple in their sublimity—sufficiently sublime in their simplicity—for the mere enunciation of my theme? i design to speak of the _physical, metaphysical and mathematical—of the material and spiritual universe:—of its essence, its origin, its creation, its present condition and its destiny_. i shall be so rash, moreover, as to challenge the conclusions, and thus, in effect, to question the sagacity, of many of the greatest and most justly reverenced of men. in the beginning, let me as distinctly as possible announce—not the theorem which i hope to demonstrate—for, whatever the mathematicians may assert, there is, in this world at least, _no such thing_ as demonstration—but the ruling idea which, throughout this volume, i shall be continually endeavoring to suggest. my general proposition, then, is this:—_in the original unity of the first thing lies the secondary cause of all things, with the germ of their inevitable annihilation_. in illustration of this idea, i propose to take such a survey of the universe that the mind may be able really to receive and to perceive an individual impression. he who from the top of ætna casts his eyes leisurely around, is affected chiefly by the _extent_ and _diversity_ of the scene. only by a rapid whirling on his heel could he hope to comprehend the panorama in the sublimity of its _oneness_. but as, on the summit of ætna, _no_ man has thought of whirling on his heel, so no man has ever taken into his brain the full uniqueness of the prospect; and so, again, whatever considerations lie involved in this uniqueness, have as yet no practical existence for mankind. i do not know a treatise in which a survey of the _universe_—using the word in its most comprehensive and only legitimate acceptation—is taken at all:—and it may be as well here to mention that by the term “universe,” wherever employed without qualification in this essay, i mean to designate _the utmost conceivable expanse of space, with all things, spiritual and material, that can be imagined to exist within the compass of that expanse_. in speaking of what is ordinarily implied by the expression, “universe,” i shall take a phrase of limitation—“the universe of stars.” why this distinction is considered necessary, will be seen in the sequel. but even of treatises on the really limited, although always assumed as the _un_limited, universe of _stars_, i know none in which a survey, even of this limited universe, is so taken as to warrant deductions from its _individuality_. the nearest approach to such a work is made in the “cosmos” of alexander von humboldt. he presents the subject, however, _not_ in its individuality but in its generality. his theme, in its last result, is the law of _each_ portion of the merely physical universe, as this law is related to the laws of _every other_ portion of this merely physical universe. his design is simply synœretical. in a word, he discusses the universality of material relation, and discloses to the eye of philosophy whatever inferences have hitherto lain hidden _behind_ this universality. but however admirable be the succinctness with which he has treated each particular point of his topic, the mere multiplicity of these points occasions, necessarily, an amount of detail, and thus an involution of idea, which precludes all _individuality_ of impression. it seems to me that, in aiming at this latter effect, and, through it, at the consequences—the conclusions—the suggestions—the speculations—or, if nothing better offer itself the mere guesses which may result from it—we require something like a mental gyration on the heel. we need so rapid a revolution of all things about the central point of sight that, while the minutiæ vanish altogether, even the more conspicuous objects become blended into one. among the vanishing minutiæ, in a survey of this kind, would be all exclusively terrestrial matters. the earth would be considered in its planetary relations alone. a man, in this view, becomes mankind; mankind a member of the cosmical family of intelligences. and now, before proceeding to our subject proper, let me beg the reader’s attention to an extract or two from a somewhat remarkable letter, which appears to have been found corked in a bottle and floating on the _mare tenebrarum_—an ocean well described by the nubian geographer, ptolemy hephestion, but little frequented in modern days unless by the transcendentalists and some other divers for crotchets. the date of this letter, i confess, surprises me even more particularly than its contents; for it seems to have been written in the year _two_ thousand eight hundred and forty-eight. as for the passages i am about to transcribe, they, i fancy, will speak for themselves. “do you know, my dear friend,” says the writer, addressing, no doubt, a contemporary—“do you know that it is scarcely more than eight or nine hundred years ago since the metaphysicians first consented to relieve the people of the singular fancy that there exist _but two practicable roads to truth_? believe it if you can! it appears, however, that long, long ago, in the night of time, there lived a turkish philosopher called aries and surnamed tottle.” [here, possibly, the letter-writer means aristotle; the best names are wretchedly corrupted in two or three thousand years.] “the fame of this great man depended mainly upon his demonstration that sneezing is a natural provision, by means of which over-profound thinkers are enabled to expel superfluous ideas through the nose; but he obtained a scarcely less valuable celebrity as the founder, or at all events as the principal propagator, of what was termed the _de_ductive or _à priori_ philosophy. he started with what he maintained to be axioms, or self-evident truths:—and the now well understood fact that _no_ truths are _self_-evident, really does not make in the slightest degree against his speculations:—it was sufficient for his purpose that the truths in question were evident at all. from axioms he proceeded, logically, to results. his most illustrious disciples were one tuclid, a geometrician,” [meaning euclid] “and one kant, a dutchman, the originator of that species of transcendentalism which, with the change merely of a c for a k, now bears his peculiar name. “well, aries tottle flourished supreme, until the advent of one hog, surnamed ‘the ettrick shepherd,’ who preached an entirely different system, which he called the _à posteriori_ or _in_ductive. his plan referred altogether to sensation. he proceeded by observing, analyzing, and classifying facts—_instantiæ naturæ_, as they were somewhat affectedly called—and arranging them into general laws. in a word, while the mode of aries rested on _noumena_, that of hog depended on _phenomena_; and so great was the admiration excited by this latter system that, at its first introduction, aries fell into general disrepute. finally, however, he recovered ground, and was permitted to divide the empire of philosophy with his more modern rival:—the savans contenting themselves with proscribing all _other_ competitors, past, present, and to come; putting an end to all controversy on the topic by the promulgation of a median law, to the effect that the aristotelian and baconian roads are, and of right ought to be, the solo possible avenues to knowledge:—‘baconian,’ you must know, my dear friend,” adds the letter-writer at this point, “was an adjective invented as equivalent to hog-ian, and at the same time more dignified and euphonious. “now i do assure you most positively”—proceeds the epistle—“that i represent these matters fairly; and you can easily understand how restrictions so absurd on their very face must have operated, in those days, to retard the progress of true science, which makes its most important advances—as all history will show—by seemingly intuitive _leaps_. these ancient ideas confined investigation to crawling; and i need not suggest to you that crawling, among varieties of locomotion, is a very capital thing of its kind;—but because the tortoise is sure of foot, for this reason must we clip the wings of the eagles? for many centuries, so great was the infatuation, about hog especially, that a virtual stop was put to all thinking, properly so called. no man dared utter a truth for which he felt himself indebted to his soul alone. it mattered not whether the truth was even demonstrably such; for the dogmatizing philosophers of that epoch regarded only _the road_ by which it professed to have been attained. the end, with them, was a point of no moment, whatever:—‘the means!’ they vociferated—‘let us look at the means!’—and if, on scrutiny of the means, it was found to come neither under the category hog, nor under the category aries (which means ram), why then the savans went no farther, but, calling the thinker a fool and branding him a ‘theorist,’ would never, thenceforward, have any thing to do either with _him_ or with his truths. “now, my dear friend,” continues the letter-writer, “it cannot be maintained that by the crawling system, exclusively adopted, men would arrive at the maximum amount of truth, even in any long series of ages; for the repression of imagination was an evil not to be counterbalanced even by _absolute_ certainty in the snail processes. but their certainty was very far from absolute. the error of our progenitors was quite analogous with that of the wiseacre who fancies he must necessarily see an object the more distinctly, the more closely he holds it to his eyes. they blinded themselves, too, with the impalpable, titillating scotch snuff of _detail_; and thus the boasted facts of the hog-ites were by no means always facts—a point of little importance but for the assumption that they always _were_. the vital taint, however, in baconianism—its most lamentable fount of error—lay in its tendency to throw power and consideration into the hands of merely perceptive men—of those inter-tritonic minnows, the microscopical savans—the diggers and pedlers of minute _facts_, for the most part in physical science—facts all of which they retailed at the same price upon the highway; their value depending, it was supposed, simply upon the _fact of their fact_, without reference to their applicability or inapplicability in the development of those ultimate and only legitimate facts, called law. “than the persons”—the letter goes on to say—“than the persons thus suddenly elevated by the hog-ian philosophy into a station for which they were unfitted—thus transferred from the sculleries into the parlors of science—from its pantries into its pulpits—than these individuals a more intolerant—a more intolerable set of bigots and tyrants never existed on the face of the earth. their creed, their text and their sermon were, alike, the one word ‘_fact_’—but, for the most part, even of this one word, they knew not even the meaning. on those who ventured to _disturb_ their facts with the view of putting them in order and to use, the disciples of hog had no mercy whatever. all attempts at generalization were met at once by the words ‘theoretical,’ ‘theory,’ ‘theorist’—all _thought_, to be brief, was very properly resented as a personal affront to themselves. cultivating the natural sciences to the exclusion of metaphysics, the mathematics, and logic, many of these bacon-engendered philosophers—one-idead, one-sided and lame of a leg—were more wretchedly helpless—more miserably ignorant, in view of all the comprehensible objects of knowledge, than the veriest unlettered hind who proves that he knows something at least, in admitting that he knows absolutely nothing. “nor had our forefathers any better right to talk about _certainty_, when pursuing, in blind confidence, the _à priori_ path of axioms, or of the ram. at innumerable points this path was scarcely as straight as a ram’s-horn. the simple truth is, that the aristotelians erected their castles upon a basis far less reliable than air; _for no such things as axioms ever existed or can possibly exist at all_. this they must have been very blind, indeed, not to see, or at least to suspect; for, even in their own day, many of their long-admitted ‘axioms’ had been abandoned:—‘_ex nihilo nihil fit_,’ for example, and a ‘thing cannot act where it is not,’ and ‘there cannot be antipodes,’ and ‘darkness cannot proceed from light.’ these and numerous similar propositions formerly accepted, without hesitation, as axioms, or undeniable truths, were, even at the period of which i speak, seen to be altogether untenable:—how absurd in these people, then, to persist in relying upon a basis, as immutable, whose mutability had become so repeatedly manifest! “but, even through evidence afforded by themselves against themselves, it is easy to convict these _à priori_ reasoners of the grossest unreason—it is easy to show the futility—the impalpability of their axioms in general. i have now lying before me”—it will be observed that we still proceed with the letter—“i have now lying before me a book printed about a thousand years ago. pundit assures me that it is decidedly the cleverest ancient work on its topic, which is ‘logic.’ the author, who was much esteemed in his day, was one miller, or mill; and we find it recorded of him, as a point of some importance, that he rode a mill-horse whom he called jeremy bentham:—but let us glance at the volume itself! “ah!—‘ability or inability to conceive,’ says mr. mill very properly, ‘is _in no case_ to be received as a criterion of axiomatic truth.’ now, that this is a palpable truism no one in his senses will deny. _not_ to admit the proposition, is to insinuate a charge of variability in truth itself, whose very title is a synonym of the steadfast. if ability to conceive be taken as a criterion of truth, then a truth to _david_ hume would very seldom be a truth to _joe_; and ninety-nine hundredths of what is undeniable in heaven would be demonstrable falsity upon earth. the proposition of mr. mill, then, is sustained. i will not grant it to be an _axiom_; and this merely because i am showing that _no_ axioms exist; but, with a distinction which could not have been cavilled at even by mr. mill himself, i am ready to grant that, _if_ an axiom _there be_, then the proposition of which we speak has the fullest right to be considered an axiom—that no _more_ absolute axiom _is_—and, consequently, that any subsequent proposition which shall conflict with this one primarily advanced, must be either a falsity in itself—that is to say no axiom—or, if admitted axiomatic, must at once neutralize both itself and its predecessor. “and now, by the logic of their own propounder, let us proceed to test any one of the axioms propounded. let us give mr. mill the fairest of play. we will bring the point to no ordinary issue. we will select for investigation no common-place axiom—no axiom of what, not the less preposterously because only impliedly, he terms his secondary class—as if a positive truth by definition could be either more or less positively a truth:—we will select, i say, no axiom of an unquestionability so questionable as is to be found in euclid. we will not talk, for example, about such propositions as that two straight lines cannot enclose a space, or that the whole is greater than any one of its parts. we will afford the logician _every_ advantage. we will come at once to a proposition which he regards as the acme of the unquestionable—as the quintessence of axiomatic undeniability. here it is:—‘contradictions cannot _both_ be true—that is, cannot cöexist in nature.’ here mr. mill means, for instance,—and i give the most forcible instance conceivable—that a tree must be either a tree or _not_ a tree—that it cannot be at the same time a tree _and_ not a tree:—all which is quite reasonable of itself and will answer remarkably well as an axiom, until we bring it into collation with an axiom insisted upon a few pages before—in other words—words which i have previously employed—until we test it by the logic of its own propounder. ‘a tree,’ mr. mill asserts, ‘must be either a tree or _not_ a tree.’ very well:—and now let me ask him, _why_. to this little query there is but one response:—i defy any man living to invent a second. the sole answer is this:—‘because we find it _impossible to conceive_ that a tree can be any thing else than a tree or not a tree.’ this, i repeat, is mr. mill’s sole answer:—he will not _pretend_ to suggest another:—and yet, by his own showing, his answer is clearly no answer at all; for has he not already required us to admit, _as an axiom_, that ability or inability to conceive is _in no case_ to be taken as a criterion of axiomatic truth? thus all—absolutely _all_ his argumentation is at sea without a rudder. let it not be urged that an exception from the general rule is to be made, in cases where the ‘impossibility to conceive’ is so peculiarly great as when we are called upon to conceive a tree _both_ a tree and _not_ a tree. let no attempt, i say, be made at urging this sotticism; for, in the first place, there are no _degrees_ of ‘impossibility,’ and thus no one impossible conception can be _more_ peculiarly impossible than another impossible conception:—in the second place, mr. mill himself, no doubt after thorough deliberation, has most distinctly, and most rationally, excluded all opportunity for exception, by the emphasis of his proposition, that, _in no case_, is ability or inability to conceive, to be taken as a criterion of axiomatic truth:—in the third place, even were exceptions admissible at all, it remains to be shown how any exception is admissible _here_. that a tree can be both a tree and not a tree, is an idea which the angels, or the devils, _may_ entertain, and which no doubt many an earthly bedlamite, or transcendentalist, _does_. “now i do not quarrel with these ancients,” continues the letter-writer, “_so much_ on account of the transparent frivolity of their logic—which, to be plain, was baseless, worthless and fantastic altogether—as on account of their pompous and infatuate proscription of all _other_ roads to truth than the two narrow and crooked paths—the one of creeping and the other of crawling—to which, in their ignorant perversity, they have dared to confine the soul—the soul which loves nothing so well as to soar in those regions of illimitable intuition which are utterly incognizant of ‘_path_.’ “by the bye, my dear friend, is it not an evidence of the mental slavery entailed upon those bigoted people by their hogs and rams, that in spite of the eternal prating of their savans about _roads_ to truth, none of them fell, even by accident, into what we now so distinctly perceive to be the broadest, the straightest and most available of all mere roads—the great thoroughfare—the majestic highway of the _consistent_? is it not wonderful that they should have failed to deduce from the works of god the vitally momentous consideration that _a perfect consistency can be nothing but an absolute truth_? how plain—how rapid our progress since the late announcement of this proposition! by its means, investigation has been taken out of the hands of the ground-moles, and given as a duty, rather than as a task, to the true—to the _only_ true thinkers—to the generally-educated men of ardent imagination. these latter—our keplers—our laplaces—‘speculate’—‘theorize’—these are the terms—can you not fancy the shout of scorn with which they would be received by our progenitors, were it possible for them to be looking over my shoulders as i write? the keplers, i repeat, speculate—theorize—and their theories are merely corrected—reduced—sifted—cleared, little by little, of their chaff of inconsistency—until at length there stands apparent an unencumbered _consistency_—a consistency which the most stolid admit—because it _is_ a consistency—to be an absolute and an unquestionable _truth_. “i have often thought, my friend, that it must have puzzled these dogmaticians of a thousand years ago, to determine, even, by which of their two boasted roads it is that the cryptographist attains the solution of the more complicate cyphers—or by which of them champollion guided mankind to those important and innumerable truths which, for so many centuries, have lain entombed amid the phonetical hieroglyphics of egypt. in especial, would it not have given these bigots some trouble to determine by which of their two roads was reached the most momentous and sublime of _all_ their truths—the truth—the fact of _gravitation_? newton deduced it from the laws of kepler. kepler admitted that these laws he _guessed_—these laws whose investigation disclosed to the greatest of british astronomers that principle, the basis of all (existing) physical principle, in going behind which we enter at once the nebulous kingdom of metaphysics. yes!—these vital laws kepler _guessed_—that is to say, he _imagined_ them. had he been asked to point out either the _de_ductive or _in_ductive route by which he attained them, his reply might have been—‘i know nothing about _routes_—but i _do_ know the machinery of the universe. here it is. i grasped it with _my soul_—i reached it through mere dint of _intuition_.’ alas, poor ignorant old man! could not any metaphysician have told him that what he called ‘intuition’ was but the conviction resulting from _de_ductions or _in_ductions of which the processes were so shadowy as to have escaped his consciousness, eluded his reason, or bidden defiance to his capacity of expression? how great a pity it is that some ‘moral philosopher’ had not enlightened him about all this! how it would have comforted him on his death-bed to know that, instead of having gone intuitively and thus unbecomingly, he had, in fact, proceeded decorously and legitimately—that is to say hog-ishly, or at least ram-ishly—into the vast halls where lay gleaming, untended, and hitherto untouched by mortal hand—unseen by mortal eye—the imperishable and priceless secrets of the universe! “yes, kepler was essentially a _theorist_; but this title, _now_ of so much sanctity, was, in those ancient days, a designation of supreme contempt. it is only _now_ that men begin to appreciate that divine old man—to sympathize with the prophetical and poetical rhapsody of his ever-memorable words. for _my_ part,” continues the unknown correspondent, “i glow with a sacred fire when i even think of them, and feel that i shall never grow weary of their repetition:—in concluding this letter, let me have the real pleasure of transcribing them once again:—‘_i care not whether my work be read now or by posterity. i can afford to wait a century for readers when god himself has waited six thousand years for an observer. i triumph. i have stolen the golden secret of the egyptians. i will indulge my sacred fury._’” here end my quotations from this very unaccountable and, perhaps, somewhat impertinent epistle; and perhaps it would be folly to comment, in any respect, upon the chimerical, not to say revolutionary, fancies of the writer—whoever he is—fancies so radically at war with the well-considered and well-settled opinions of this age. let us proceed, then, to our legitimate thesis, _the universe_. this thesis admits a choice between two modes of discussion:—we may _as_cend or _de_scend. beginning at our own point of view—at the earth on which we stand—we may pass to the other planets of our system—thence to the sun—thence to our system considered collectively—and thence, through other systems, indefinitely outwards; or, commencing on high at some point as definite as we can make it or conceive it, we may come down to the habitation of man. usually—that is to say, in ordinary essays on astronomy—the first of these two modes is, with certain reservation, adopted:—this for the obvious reason that astronomical _facts_, merely, and principles, being the object, that object is best fulfilled in stepping from the known because proximate, gradually onward to the point where all certitude becomes lost in the remote. for my present purpose, however,—that of enabling the mind to take in, as if from afar and at one glance, a distinct conception of the _individual_ universe—it is clear that a descent to small from great—to the outskirts from the centre (if we could establish a centre)—to the end from the beginning (if we could fancy a beginning) would be the preferable course, but for the difficulty, if not impossibility, of presenting, in this course, to the unastronomical, a picture at all comprehensible in regard to such considerations as are involved in _quantity_—that is to say, in number, magnitude and distance. now, distinctness—intelligibility, at all points, is a primary feature in my general design. on important topics it is better to be a good deal prolix than even a very little obscure. but abstruseness is a quality appertaining to no subject _per se_. all are alike, in facility of comprehension, to him who approaches them by properly graduated steps. it is merely because a stepping-stone, here and there, is heedlessly left unsupplied in our road to the differential calculus, that this latter is not altogether as simple a thing as a sonnet by mr. solomon seesaw. by way of admitting, then, no _chance_ for misapprehension, i think it advisable to proceed as if even the more obvious facts of astronomy were unknown to the reader. in combining the two modes of discussion to which i have referred, i propose to avail myself of the advantages peculiar to each—and very especially of the _iteration in detail_ which will be unavoidable as a consequence of the plan. commencing with a descent, i shall reserve for the return upwards those indispensable considerations of _quantity_ to which allusion has already been made. let us begin, then, at once, with that merest of words, “infinity.” this, like “god,” “spirit,” and some other expressions of which the equivalents exist in all languages, is by no means the expression of an idea—but of an effort at one. it stands for the possible attempt at an impossible conception. man needed a term by which to point out the _direction_ of this effort—the cloud behind which lay, forever invisible, the _object_ of this attempt. a word, in fine, was demanded, by means of which one human being might put himself in relation at once with another human being and with a certain _tendency_ of the human intellect. out of this demand arose the word, “infinity;” which is thus the representative but of the _thought of a thought_. as regards _that_ infinity now considered—the infinity of space—we often hear it said that “its idea is admitted by the mind—is acquiesced in—is entertained—on account of the greater difficulty which attends the conception of a limit.” but this is merely one of those _phrases_ by which even profound thinkers, time out of mind, have occasionally taken pleasure in deceiving _themselves_. the quibble lies concealed in the word “difficulty.” “the mind,” we are told, “entertains the idea of _limitless_, through the greater _difficulty_ which it finds in entertaining that of _limited_, space.” now, were the proposition but fairly _put_, its absurdity would become transparent at once. clearly, there is no mere _difficulty_ in the case. the assertion intended, if presented _according_ to its intention and without sophistry, would run thus:—“the mind admits the idea of limitless, through the greater _impossibility_ of entertaining that of limited, space.” it must be immediately seen that this is not a question of two statements between whose respective credibilities—or of two arguments between whose respective validities—the _reason_ is called upon to decide:—it is a matter of two conceptions, directly conflicting, and each avowedly impossible, one of which the _intellect_ is supposed to be capable of entertaining, on account of the greater _impossibility_ of entertaining the other. the choice is _not_ made between two difficulties;—it is merely _fancied_ to be made between two impossibilities. now of the former, there _are_ degrees—but of the latter, none:—just as our impertinent letter-writer has already suggested. a task _may_ be more or less difficult; but it is either possible or not possible:—there are no gradations. it _might_ be more _difficult_ to overthrow the andes than an ant-hill; but it _can_ be no more _impossible_ to annihilate the matter of the one than the matter of the other. a man may jump ten feet with less _difficulty_ than he can jump twenty, but the _impossibility_ of his leaping to the moon is not a whit less than that of his leaping to the dog-star. since all this is undeniable: since the choice of the mind is to be made between _impossibilities_ of conception: since one impossibility cannot be greater than another: and since, thus, one cannot be preferred to another: the philosophers who not only maintain, on the grounds mentioned, man’s _idea_ of infinity but, on account of such supposititious idea, _infinity itself_—are plainly engaged in demonstrating one impossible thing to be possible by showing how it is that some one other thing—is impossible too. this, it will be said, is nonsense; and perhaps it is:—indeed i think it very capital nonsense—but forego all claim to it as nonsense of mine. the readiest mode, however, of displaying the fallacy of the philosophical argument on this question, is by simply adverting to a _fact_ respecting it which has been hitherto quite overlooked—the fact that the argument alluded to both proves and disproves its own proposition. “the mind is impelled,” say the theologians and others, “to admit a _first cause_, by the superior difficulty it experiences in conceiving cause beyond cause without end.” the quibble, as before, lies in the word “difficulty”—but _here_ what is it employed to sustain? a first cause. and what is a first cause? an ultimate termination of causes. and what is an ultimate termination of causes? finity—the finite. thus the one quibble, in two processes, by god knows how many philosophers, is made to support now finity and now infinity—could it not be brought to support something besides? as for the quibblers—_they_, at least, are insupportable. but—to dismiss them:—what they prove in the one case is the identical nothing which they demonstrate in the other. of course, no one will suppose that i here contend for the absolute impossibility of _that_ which we attempt to convey in the word “infinity.” my purpose is but to show the folly of endeavoring to prove infinity itself or even our conception of it, by any such blundering ratiocination as that which is ordinarily employed. nevertheless, as an individual, i may be permitted to say that _i cannot_ conceive infinity, and am convinced that no human being can. a mind not thoroughly self-conscious—not accustomed to the introspective analysis of its own operations—will, it is true, often deceive itself by supposing that it _has_ entertained the conception of which we speak. in the effort to entertain it, we proceed step beyond step—we fancy point still beyond point; and so long as we _continue_ the effort, it may be said, in fact, that we are _tending_ to the formation of the idea designed; while the strength of the impression that we actually form or have formed it, is in the ratio of the period during which we keep up the mental endeavor. but it is in the act of discontinuing the endeavor—of fulfilling (as we think) the idea—of putting the finishing stroke (as we suppose) to the conception—that we overthrow at once the whole fabric of our fancy by resting upon some one ultimate and therefore definite point. this fact, however, we fail to perceive, on account of the absolute coincidence, in time, between the settling down upon the ultimate point and the act of cessation in thinking.—in attempting, on the other hand, to frame the idea of a _limited_ space, we merely converse the processes which involve the impossibility. we _believe_ in a god. we may or may not _believe_ in finite or in infinite space; but our belief, in such cases, is more properly designated as _faith_, and is a matter quite distinct from that belief proper—from that _intellectual_ belief—which presupposes the mental conception. the fact is, that, upon the enunciation of any one of that class of terms to which “infinity” belongs—the class representing _thoughts of thought_—he who has a right to say that he thinks _at all_, feels himself called upon, _not_ to entertain a conception, but simply to direct his mental vision toward some given point, in the intellectual firmament, where lies a nebula never to be resolved. to solve it, indeed, he makes no effort; for with a rapid instinct he comprehends, not only the impossibility, but, as regards all human purposes, the _inessentiality_, of its solution. he perceives that the deity has not _designed_ it to be solved. he sees, at once, that it lies _out_ of the brain of man, and even _how_, if not exactly _why_, it lies out of it. there _are_ people, i am aware, who, busying themselves in attempts at the unattainable, acquire very easily, by dint of the jargon they emit, among those thinkers-that-they-think with whom darkness and depth are synonymous, a kind of cuttle-fish reputation for profundity; but the finest quality of thought is its self-cognizance; and, with some little equivocation, it may be said that no fog of the mind can well be greater than that which, extending to the very boundaries of the mental domain, shuts out even these boundaries themselves from comprehension. it will now be understood that, in using the phrase, “infinity of space,” i make no call upon the reader to entertain the impossible conception of an _absolute_ infinity. i refer simply to the “_utmost conceivable expanse_” of space—a shadowy and fluctuating domain, now shrinking, now swelling, in accordance with the vacillating energies of the imagination. _hitherto_, the universe of stars has always been considered as coincident with the universe proper, as i have defined it in the commencement of this discourse. it has been always either directly or indirectly assumed—at least since the dawn of intelligible astronomy—that, were it possible for us to attain any given point in space, we should still find, on all sides of us, an interminable succession of stars. this was the untenable idea of pascal when making perhaps the most successful attempt ever made, at periphrasing the conception for which we struggle in the word “universe.” “it is a sphere,” he says, “of which the centre is everywhere, the circumference, nowhere.” but although this intended definition is, in fact, _no_ definition of the universe of _stars_, we may accept it, with some mental reservation, as a definition (rigorous enough for all practical purposes) of the universe _proper_—that is to say, of the universe of _space_. this latter, then, let us regard as “_a sphere of which the centre is everywhere, the circumference nowhere_.” in fact, while we find it impossible to fancy an _end_ to space, we have no difficulty in picturing to ourselves any one of an infinity of _beginnings_. as our starting-point, then, let us adopt the _godhead_. of this godhead, _in itself_, he alone is not imbecile—he alone is not impious who propounds—nothing. “_nous ne connaissons rien_,” says the baron de bielfeld—“_nous ne connaissons rien de la nature ou de l’essence de dieu:—pour savoir ce qu’il est, il faut être dieu même._”—“we know absolutely _nothing_ of the nature or essence of god:—in order to comprehend what he is, we should have to be god ourselves.” “_we should have to be god ourselves!_”—with a phrase so startling as this yet ringing in my ears, i nevertheless venture to demand if this our present ignorance of the deity is an ignorance to which the soul is _everlastingly_ condemned. by _him_, however—_now_, at least, the incomprehensible—by him—assuming him as _spirit_—that is to say, as _not matter_—a distinction which, for all intelligible purposes, will stand well instead of a definition—by him, then, existing as spirit, let us content ourselves, to-night, with supposing to have been _created_, or made out of nothing, by dint of his volition—at some point of space which we will take as a centre—at some period into which we do not pretend to inquire, but at all events immensely remote—by him, then again, let us suppose to have been created——_what_? this is a vitally momentous epoch in our considerations. _what_ is it that we are justified—that alone we are justified in supposing to have been, primarily and solely, _created_? we have attained a point where only _intuition_ can aid us:—but now let me recur to the idea which i have already suggested as that alone which we can properly entertain of intuition. it is but _the conviction arising from those inductions or deductions of which the processes are so shadowy as to escape our consciousness, elude our reason, or defy our capacity of expression_. with this understanding, i now assert—that an intuition altogether irresistible, although inexpressible, forces me to the conclusion that what god originally created—that that matter which, by dint of his volition, he first made from his spirit, or from nihility, _could_ have been nothing but matter in its utmost conceivable state of——what?—of _simplicity_? this will be found the sole absolute _assumption_ of my discourse. i use the word “assumption” in its ordinary sense; yet i maintain that even this my primary proposition, is very, very far indeed, from being really a mere assumption. nothing was ever more certainly—no human conclusion was ever, in fact, more regularly—more rigorously _de_duced:—but, alas! the processes lie out of the human analysis—at all events are beyond the utterance of the human tongue. let us now endeavor to conceive what matter must be, when, or if, in its absolute extreme of _simplicity_. here the reason flies at once to imparticularity—to a particle—to _one_ particle—a particle of _one_ kind—of _one_ character—of _one_ nature—of _one size_—of one form—a particle, therefore, “_without_ form and void”—a particle positively a particle at all points—a particle absolutely unique, individual, undivided, and not indivisible only because he who _created_ it, by dint of his will, can by an infinitely less energetic exercise of the same will, as a matter of course, divide it. _oneness_, then, is all that i predicate of the originally created matter; but i propose to show that this _oneness is a principle abundantly sufficient to account for the constitution, the existing phænomena and the plainly inevitable annihilation of at least the material universe_. the willing into being the primordial particle, has completed the act, or more properly the _conception_, of creation. we now proceed to the ultimate purpose for which we are to suppose the particle created—that is to say, the ultimate purpose so far as our considerations _yet_ enable us to see it—the constitution of the universe from it, the particle. this constitution has been effected by _forcing_ the originally and therefore normally _one_ into the abnormal condition of _many_. an action of this character implies rëaction. a diffusion from unity, under the conditions, involves a tendency to return into unity—a tendency ineradicable until satisfied. but on these points i will speak more fully hereafter. the assumption of absolute unity in the primordial particle includes that of infinite divisibility. let us conceive the particle, then, to be only not totally exhausted by diffusion into space. from the one particle, as a centre, let us suppose to be irradiated spherically—in all directions—to immeasurable but still to definite distances in the previously vacant space—a certain inexpressibly great yet limited number of unimaginably yet not infinitely minute atoms. now, of these atoms, thus diffused, or upon diffusion, what conditions are we permitted—not to assume, but to infer, from consideration as well of their source as of the character of the design apparent in their diffusion? _unity_ being their source, and _difference from unity_ the character of the design manifested in their diffusion, we are warranted in supposing this character to be at least _generally_ preserved throughout the design, and to form a portion of the design itself:—that is to say, we shall be warranted in conceiving continual differences at all points from the uniquity and simplicity of the origin. but, for these reasons, shall we be justified in imagining the atoms heterogeneous, dissimilar, unequal, and inequidistant? more explicitly—are we to consider no two atoms as, at their diffusion, of the same nature, or of the same form, or of the same size?—and, after fulfilment of their diffusion into space, is absolute inequidistance, each from each, to be understood of all of them? in such arrangement, under such conditions, we most easily and immediately comprehend the subsequent most feasible carrying out to completion of any such design as that which i have suggested—the design of variety out of unity—diversity out of sameness—heterogeneity out of homogeneity—complexity out of simplicity—in a word, the utmost possible multiplicity of _relation_ out of the emphatically irrelative _one_. undoubtedly, therefore, we _should_ be warranted in assuming all that has been mentioned, but for the reflection, first, that supererogation is not presumable of any divine act; and, secondly, that the object supposed in view, appears as feasible when some of the conditions in question are dispensed with, in the beginning, as when all are understood immediately to exist. i mean to say that some are involved in the rest, or so instantaneous a consequence of them as to make the distinction inappreciable. difference of _size_, for example, will at once be brought about through the tendency of one atom to a second, in preference to a third, on account of particular inequidistance; which is to be comprehended as _particular inequidistances between centres of quantity, in neighboring atoms of different form_—a matter not at all interfering with the generally-equable distribution of the atoms. difference of _kind_, too, is easily conceived to be merely a result of differences in size and form, taken more or less conjointly:—in fact, since the _unity_ of the particle proper implies absolute homogeneity, we cannot imagine the atoms, at their diffusion, differing in kind, without imagining, at the same time, a special exercise of the divine will, at the emission of each atom, for the purpose of effecting, in each, a change of its essential nature:—so fantastic an idea is the less to be indulged, as the object proposed is seen to be thoroughly attainable without such minute and elaborate interposition. we perceive, therefore, upon the whole, that it would be supererogatory, and consequently unphilosophical, to predicate of the atoms, in view of their purposes, any thing more than _difference of form_ at their dispersion, with particular inequidistance after it—all other differences arising at once out of these, in the very first processes of mass-constitution:—we thus establish the universe on a purely _geometrical_ basis. of course, it is by no means necessary to assume absolute difference, even of form, among _all_ the atoms irradiated—any more than absolute particular inequidistance of each from each. we are required to conceive merely that no _neighboring_ atoms are of similar form—no atoms which can ever approximate, until their inevitable rëunition at the end. although the immediate and perpetual _tendency_ of the disunited atoms to return into their normal unity, is implied, as i have said, in their abnormal diffusion; still it is clear that this tendency will be without consequence—a tendency and no more—until the diffusive energy, in ceasing to be exerted, shall leave _it_, the tendency, free to seek its satisfaction. the divine act, however, being considered as determinate, and discontinued on fulfilment of the diffusion, we understand, at once, a _rëaction_—in other words, a _satisfiable_ tendency of the disunited atoms to return into _one_. but the diffusive energy being withdrawn, and the rëaction having commenced in furtherance of the ultimate design—_that of the utmost possible relation_—this design is now in danger of being frustrated, in detail, by reason of that very tendency to return which is to effect its accomplishment in general. _multiplicity_ is the object; but there is nothing to prevent proximate atoms, from lapsing _at once_, through the now satisfiable tendency—_before_ the fulfilment of any ends proposed in multiplicity—into absolute oneness among themselves:—there is nothing to impede the aggregation of various _unique_ masses, at various points of space:—in other words, nothing to interfere with the accumulation of various masses, each absolutely one. for the effectual and thorough completion of the general design, we thus see the necessity for a repulsion of limited capacity—a separative _something_ which, on withdrawal of the diffusive volition, shall at the same time allow the approach, and forbid the junction, of the atoms; suffering them infinitely to approximate, while denying them positive contact; in a word, having the power—_up to a certain epoch_—of preventing their _coalition_, but no ability to interfere with their _coalescence_ in any respect _or degree_. the repulsion, already considered as so peculiarly limited in other regards, must be understood, let me repeat, as having power to prevent absolute coalition, _only up to a certain epoch_. unless we are to conceive that the appetite for unity among the atoms is doomed to be satisfied _never_;—unless we are to conceive that what had a beginning is to have no end—a conception which cannot _really_ be entertained, however much we may talk or dream of entertaining it—we are forced to conclude that the repulsive influence imagined, will, finally—under pressure of the _unitendency collectively_ applied, but never and in no degree _until_, on fulfilment of the divine purposes, such collective application shall be naturally made—yield to a force which, at that ultimate epoch, shall be the superior force precisely to the extent required, and thus permit the universal subsidence into the inevitable, because original and therefore normal, _one_.—the conditions here to be reconciled are difficult indeed:—we cannot even comprehend the possibility of their conciliation;—nevertheless, the apparent impossibility is brilliantly suggestive. that the repulsive something actually exists, _we see_. man neither employs, nor knows, a force sufficient to bring two atoms into contact. this is but the well-established proposition of the impenetrability of matter. all experiment proves—all philosophy admits it. the _design_ of the repulsion—the necessity for its existence—i have endeavored to show; but from all attempt at investigating its nature have religiously abstained; this on account of an intuitive conviction that the principle at issue is strictly spiritual—lies in a recess impervious to our present understanding—lies involved in a consideration of what now—in our human state—is _not_ to be considered—in a consideration of _spirit in itself_. i feel, in a word, that here the god has interposed, and here only, because here and here only the knot demanded the interposition of the god. in fact, while the tendency of the diffused atoms to return into unity, will be recognized, at once, as the principle of the newtonian gravity, what i have spoken of as a repulsive influence prescribing limits to the (immediate) satisfaction of the tendency, will be understood as _that_ which we have been in the practice of designating now as heat, now as magnetism, now as _electricity_; displaying our ignorance of its awful character in the vacillation of the phraseology with which we endeavor to circumscribe it. calling it, merely for the moment, electricity, we know that all experimental analysis of electricity has given, as an ultimate result, the principle, or seeming principle, _heterogeneity_. _only_ where things differ is electricity apparent; and it is presumable that they _never_ differ where it is not developed at least, if not apparent. now, this result is in the fullest keeping with that which i have reached unempirically. the design of the repulsive influence i have maintained to be that of preventing immediate unity among the diffused atoms; and these atoms are represented as different each from each. _difference_ is their character—their essentiality—just as _no-difference_ was the essentiality of their source. when we say, then, that an attempt to bring any two of these atoms together would induce an effort, on the part of the repulsive influence, to prevent the contact, we may as well use the strictly convertible sentence that an attempt to bring together any two differences will result in a development of electricity. all existing bodies, of course, are composed of these atoms in proximate contact, and are therefore to be considered as mere assemblages of more or fewer differences; and the resistance made by the repulsive spirit, on bringing together any two such assemblages, would be in the ratio of the two sums of the differences in each:—an expression which, when reduced, is equivalent to this:—_the amount of electricity developed on the approximation of two bodies, is proportional to the difference between the respective sums of the atoms of which the bodies are composed._ that _no_ two bodies are absolutely alike, is a simple corollary from all that has been here said. electricity, therefore, existing always, is _developed_ whenever _any_ bodies, but _manifested_ only when bodies of appreciable difference, are brought into approximation. to electricity—so, for the present, continuing to call it—we _may_ not be wrong in referring the various physical appearances of light, heat and magnetism; but far less shall we be liable to err in attributing to this strictly spiritual principle the more important phænomena of vitality, consciousness and _thought_. on this topic, however, i need pause _here_ merely to suggest that these phænomena, whether observed generally or in detail, seem to proceed _at least in the ratio of the heterogeneous_. discarding now the two equivocal terms, “gravitation” and “electricity,” let us adopt the more definite expressions, “_attraction_” and “_repulsion_.” the former is the body; the latter the soul: the one is the material; the other the spiritual, principle of the universe. _no other principles exist._ _all_ phænomena are referable to one, or to the other, or to both combined. so rigorously is this the case—so thoroughly demonstrable is it that attraction and repulsion are the _sole_ properties through which we perceive the universe—in other words, by which matter is manifested to mind—that, for all merely argumentative purposes, we are fully justified in assuming that matter _exists_ only as attraction and repulsion—that attraction and repulsion _are_ matter:—there being no conceivable case in which we may not employ the term “matter” and the terms “attraction” and “repulsion,” taken together, as equivalent, and therefore convertible, expressions in logic. i said, just now, that what i have described as the tendency of the diffused atoms to return into their original unity, would be understood as the principle of the newtonian law of gravity: and, in fact, there can be little difficulty in such an understanding, if we look at the newtonian gravity in a merely general view, as a force impelling matter to seek matter; that is to say, when we pay no attention to the known _modus operandi_ of the newtonian force. the general coincidence satisfies us; but, upon looking closely, we see, in detail, much that appears _in_coincident, and much in regard to which no coincidence, at least, is established. for example; the newtonian gravity, when we think of it in certain moods, does _not_ seem to be a tendency to _oneness_ at all, but rather a tendency of all bodies in all directions—a phrase apparently expressive of a tendency to diffusion. here, then, is an _in_coincidence. again; when we reflect on the mathematical _law_ governing the newtonian tendency, we see clearly that no coincidence has been made good, in respect of the _modus operandi_, at least, between gravitation as known to exist and that seemingly simple and direct tendency which i have assumed. in fact, i have attained a point at which it will be advisable to strengthen my position by reversing my processes. so far, we have gone on _à priori_, from an abstract consideration of _simplicity_, as that quality most likely to have characterized the original action of god. let us now see whether the established facts of the newtonian gravitation may not afford us, _à posteriori_, some legitimate inductions. what does the newtonian law declare?—that all bodies attract each other with forces proportional to their quantities of matter and inversely proportional to the squares of their distances. purposely, i have here given, in the first place, the vulgar version of the law; and i confess that in this, as in most other vulgar versions of great truths, we find little of a suggestive character. let us now adopt a more philosophical phraseology:—_every atom, of every body, attracts every other atom, both of its own and of every other body, with a force which varies inversely as the squares of the distances between the attracting and attracted atom._—here, indeed, a flood of suggestion bursts upon the mind. but let us see distinctly what it was that newton _proved_—according to the grossly irrational definitions of _proof_ prescribed by the metaphysical schools. he was forced to content himself with showing how thoroughly the motions of an imaginary universe, composed of attracting and attracted atoms obedient to the law he announced, coincide with those of the actually existing universe so far as it comes under our observation. this was the amount of his _demonstration_—that is to say, this was the amount of it, according to the conventional cant of the “philosophies.” his successes added proof multiplied by proof—such proof as a sound intellect admits—but the _demonstration_ of the law itself, persist the metaphysicians, had not been strengthened in any degree. “_ocular_, _physical_ proof,” however, of attraction, here upon earth, in accordance with the newtonian theory, was, at length, much to the satisfaction of some intellectual grovellers, afforded. this proof arose collaterally and incidentally (as nearly all important truths have arisen) out of an attempt to ascertain the mean density of the earth. in the famous maskelyne, cavendish and bailly experiments for this purpose, the attraction of the mass of a mountain was seen, felt, measured, and found to be mathematically consistent with the immortal theory of the british astronomer. but in spite of this confirmation of that which needed none—in spite of the so-called corroboration of the “theory” by the so-called “ocular and physical proof”—in spite of the _character_ of this corroboration—the ideas which even really philosophical men cannot help imbibing of gravity—and, especially, the ideas of it which ordinary men get and contentedly maintain, are _seen_ to have been derived, for the most part, from a consideration of the principle as they find it developed—_merely in the planet upon which they stand_. now, to what does so partial a consideration tend—to what species of error does it give rise? on the earth we _see_ and _feel_, only that gravity impels all bodies towards the _centre_ of the earth. no man in the common walks of life could be _made_ to see or to feel anything else—could be made to perceive that anything, anywhere, has a perpetual, gravitating tendency in any _other_ direction than to the centre of the earth; yet (with an exception hereafter to be specified) it is a fact that every earthly thing (not to speak now of every heavenly thing) has a tendency not _only_ to the earth’s centre but in every conceivable direction besides. now, although the philosophic cannot be said to _err with_ the vulgar in this matter, they nevertheless permit themselves to be influenced, without knowing it, by the _sentiment_ of the vulgar idea. “although the pagan fables are not believed,” says bryant, in his very erudite “mythology,” “yet we forget ourselves continually and make inferences from them as from existing realities.” i mean to assert that the merely _sensitive perception_ of gravity as we experience it on earth, beguiles mankind into the fancy of _concentralization_ or _especiality_ respecting it—has been continually biasing towards this fancy even the mightiest intellects—perpetually, although imperceptibly, leading them away from the real characteristics of the principle; thus preventing them, up to this date, from ever getting a glimpse of that vital truth which lies in a diametrically opposite direction—behind the principle’s _essential_ characteristics—those, _not_ of concentralization or especiality—but of _universality_ and _diffusion_. this “vital truth” is _unity_ as the _source_ of the phænomenon. let me now repeat the definition of gravity:—_every atom, of every body, attracts every other atom, both of its own and of every other body_, with a force which varies inversely as the squares of the distances of the attracting and attracted atom. here let the reader pause with me, for a moment, in contemplation of the miraculous—of the ineffable—of the altogether unimaginable complexity of relation involved in the fact that _each atom attracts every other atom_—involved merely in this fact of the attraction, without reference to the law or mode in which the attraction is manifested—involved _merely_ in the fact that each atom attracts every other atom _at all_, in a wilderness of atoms so numerous that those which go to the composition of a cannon-ball, exceed, probably, in mere point of number, all the stars which go to the constitution of the universe. had we discovered, simply, that each atom tended to some one favorite point—to some especially attractive atom—we should still have fallen upon a discovery which, in itself, would have sufficed to overwhelm the mind:—but what is it that we are actually called upon to comprehend? that each atom attracts—sympathizes with the most delicate movements of every other atom, and with each and with all at the same time, and forever, and according to a determinate law of which the complexity, even considered by itself solely, is utterly beyond the grasp of the imagination of man. if i propose to ascertain the influence of one mote in a sunbeam upon its neighboring mote, i cannot accomplish my purpose without first counting and weighing all the atoms in the universe and defining the precise positions of all at one particular moment. if i venture to displace, by even the billionth part of an inch, the microscopical speck of dust which lies now upon the point of my finger, what is the character of that act upon which i have adventured? i have done a deed which shakes the moon in her path, which causes the sun to be no longer the sun, and which alters forever the destiny of the multitudinous myriads of stars that roll and glow in the majestic presence of their creator. _these_ ideas—conceptions such as _these_—unthoughtlike thoughts—soul-reveries rather than conclusions or even considerations of the intellect:—ideas, i repeat, such as these, are such as we can alone hope profitably to entertain in any effort at grasping the great principle, _attraction_. but now,—_with_ such ideas—with such a _vision_ of the marvellous complexity of attraction fairly in his mind—let any person competent of thought on such topics as these, set himself to the task of imagining a _principle_ for the phænomena observed—a condition from which they sprang. does not so evident a brotherhood among the atoms point to a common parentage? does not a sympathy so omniprevalent, so ineradicable, and so thoroughly irrespective, suggest a common paternity as its source? does not one extreme impel the reason to the other? does not the infinitude of division refer to the utterness of individuality? does not the entireness of the complex hint at the perfection of the simple? it is _not_ that the atoms, as we see them, are divided or that they are complex in their relations—but that they are inconceivably divided and unutterably complex:—it is the extremeness of the conditions to which i now allude, rather than to the conditions themselves. in a word, is it not because the atoms were, at some remote epoch of time, even _more than together_—is it not because originally, and therefore normally, they were _one_—that now, in all circumstances—at all points—in all directions—by all modes of approach—in all relations and through all conditions—they struggle _back_ to this absolutely, this irrelatively, this unconditionally _one_? some person may here demand:—“why—since it is to the _one_ that the atoms struggle back—do we not find and define attraction ‘a merely general tendency to a centre?’—why, in especial, do not _your_ atoms—the atoms which you describe as having been irradiated from a centre—proceed at once, rectilinearly, back to the central point of their origin?” i reply that _they do_; as will be distinctly shown; but that the cause of their so doing is quite irrespective of the centre _as such_. they all tend rectilinearly towards a centre, because of the sphereicity with which they have been irradiated into space. each atom, forming one of a generally uniform globe of atoms, finds more atoms in the direction of the centre, of course, than in any other, and in that direction, therefore, is impelled—but is _not_ thus impelled because the centre is _the point of its origin_. it is not to any _point_ that the atoms are allied. it is not any _locality_, either in the concrete or in the abstract, to which i suppose them bound. nothing like _location_ was conceived as their origin. their source lies in the principle, _unity_. _this_ is their lost parent. _this_ they seek always—immediately—in all directions—wherever it is even partially to be found; thus appeasing, in some measure, the ineradicable tendency, while on the way to its absolute satisfaction in the end. it follows from all this, that any principle which shall be adequate to account for the _law_, or _modus operandi_, of the attractive force in general, will account for this law in particular:—that is to say, any principle which will show why the atoms should tend to their _general centre of irradiation_ with forces inversely proportional to the squares of the distances, will be admitted as satisfactorily accounting, at the same time, for the tendency, according to the same law, of these atoms each to each:—_for_ the tendency to the centre _is_ merely the tendency each to each, and not any tendency to a centre as such.—thus it will be seen, also, that the establishment of my propositions would involve no _necessity_ of modification in the terms of the newtonian definition of gravity, which declares that each atom attracts each other atom and so forth, and declares this merely; but (always under the supposition that what i propose be, in the end, admitted) it seems clear that some error might occasionally be avoided, in the future processes of science, were a more ample phraseology adopted:—for instance:—“each atom tends to every other atom &c. with a force &c.: _the general result being a tendency of all, with a similar force, to a general centre_.” the reversal of our processes has thus brought us to an identical result; but, while in the one process _intuition_ was the starting-point, in the other it was the goal. in commencing the former journey i could only say that, with an irresistible intuition, i _felt_ simplicity to have been the characteristic of the original action of god:—in ending the latter i can only declare that, with an irresistible intuition, i perceive unity to have been the source of the observed phænomena of the newtonian gravitation. thus, according to the schools, i _prove_ nothing. so be it:—i design but to suggest—and to _convince_ through the suggestion. i am proudly aware that there exist many of the most profound and cautiously discriminative human intellects which cannot _help_ being abundantly content with my—suggestions. to these intellects—as to my own—there is no mathematical demonstration which _could_ bring the least additional _true proof_ of the great _truth_ which i have advanced—_the truth of original unity as the source—as the principle of the universal phænomena_. for my part, i am not so sure that i speak and see—i am not so sure that my heart beats and that my soul lives:—of the rising of to-morrow’s sun—a probability that as yet lies in the future—i do not pretend to be one thousandth part as sure—as i am of the irretrievably by-gone _fact_ that all things and all thoughts of things, with all their ineffable multiplicity of relation, sprang at once into being from the primordial and irrelative _one_. referring to the newtonian gravity, dr. nichol, the eloquent author of “the architecture of the heavens,” says:—“in truth we have no reason to suppose this great law, as now revealed, to be the ultimate or simplest, and therefore the universal and all-comprehensive, form of a great ordinance. the mode in which its intensity diminishes with the element of distance, has not the aspect of an ultimate _principle_; which always assumes the simplicity and self-evidence of those axioms which constitute the basis of geometry.” now, it is quite true that “ultimate principles,” in the common understanding of the words, always assume the simplicity of geometrical axioms—(as for “self-evidence,” there is no such thing)—but these principles are clearly _not_ “ultimate;” in other terms what we are in the habit of calling principles are no principles, properly speaking—since there can be but one _principle_, the volition of god. we have no right to assume, then, from what we observe in rules that we choose foolishly to name “principles,” anything at all in respect to the characteristics of a principle proper. the “ultimate principles” of which dr. nichol speaks as having geometrical simplicity, may and do have this geometrical turn, as being part and parcel of a vast geometrical system, and thus a system of simplicity itself—in which, nevertheless, the _truly_ ultimate principle is, _as we know_, the consummation of the complex—that is to say, of the unintelligible—for is it not the spiritual capacity of god? i quoted dr. nichol’s remark, however, not so much to question its philosophy, as by way of calling attention to the fact that, while all men have admitted _some_ principle as existing behind the law of gravity, no attempt has been yet made to point out what this principle in particular _is_:—if we except, perhaps, occasional fantastic efforts at referring it to magnetism, or mesmerism, or swedenborgianism, or transcendentalism, or some other equally delicious _ism_ of the same species, and invariably patronized by one and the same species of people. the great mind of newton, while boldly grasping the law itself, shrank from the principle of the law. the more fluent and comprehensive at least, if not the more patient and profound, sagacity of laplace, had not the courage to attack it. but hesitation on the part of these two astronomers it is, perhaps, not so very difficult to understand. they, as well as all the first class of mathematicians, were mathematicians _solely_:—their intellect, at least, had a firmly-pronounced mathematico-physical tone. what lay not distinctly within the domain of physics, or of mathematics, seemed to them either non-entity or shadow. nevertheless, we may well wonder that leibnitz, who was a marked exception to the general rule in these respects, and whose mental temperament was a singular admixture of the mathematical with the physico-metaphysical, did not at once investigate and establish the point at issue. either newton or laplace, seeking a principle and discovering none _physical_, would have rested contentedly in the conclusion that there was absolutely none; but it is almost impossible to fancy, of leibnitz, that, having exhausted in his search the physical dominions, he would not have stepped at once, boldly and hopefully, amid his old familiar haunts in the kingdom of metaphysics. here, indeed, it is clear that he _must_ have adventured in search of the treasure:—that he did not find it after all, was, perhaps, because his fairy guide, imagination, was not sufficiently well-grown, or well-educated, to direct him aright. i observed, just now, that, in fact, there had been certain vague attempts at referring gravity to some very uncertain _isms_. these attempts, however, although considered bold and justly so considered, looked no farther than to the generality—the merest generality—of the newtonian law. its _modus operandi_ has never, to my knowledge, been approached in the way of an effort at explanation. it is, therefore, with no unwarranted fear of being taken for a madman at the outset, and before i can bring my propositions fairly to the eye of those who alone are competent to decide upon them, that i here declare the _modus operandi_ of the law of gravity to be an exceedingly simple and perfectly explicable thing—that is to say, when we make our advances towards it in just gradations and in the true direction—when we regard it from the proper point of view. whether we reach the idea of absolute _unity_ as the source of all things, from a consideration of simplicity as the most probable characteristic of the original action of god;—whether we arrive at it from an inspection of the universality of relation in the gravitating phænomena;—or whether we attain it as a result of the mutual corroboration afforded by both processes;—still, the idea itself, if entertained at all, is entertained in inseparable connection with another idea—that of the condition of the universe of stars as we _now_ perceive it—that is to say, a condition of immeasurable _diffusion_ through space. now a connection between these two ideas—unity and diffusion—cannot be established unless through the entertainment of a third idea—that of _irradiation_. absolute unity being taken as a centre, then the existing universe of stars is the result of _irradiation_ from that centre. now, the laws of irradiation are _known_. they are part and parcel of the _sphere_. they belong to the class of _indisputable geometrical properties_. we say of them, “they are true—they are evident.” to demand _why_ they are true, would be to demand why the axioms are true upon which their demonstration is based. _nothing_ is demonstrable, strictly speaking; but _if_ anything _be_, then the properties—the laws in question are demonstrated. but these laws—what do they declare? irradiation—how—by what steps does it proceed outwardly from a centre? from a _luminous_ centre, _light_ issues by irradiation; and the quantities of light received upon any given plane, supposed to be shifting its position so as to be now nearer the centre and now farther from it, will be diminished in the same proportion as the squares of the distances of the plane from the luminous body, are increased; and will be increased in the same proportion as these squares are diminished. the expression of the law may be thus generalized:—the number of light-particles (or, if the phrase be preferred, the number of light-impressions) received upon the shifting plane, will be _inversely_ proportional with the squares of the distances of the plane. generalizing yet again, we may say that the diffusion—the scattering—the irradiation, in a word—is _directly_ proportional with the squares of the distances. [illustration] for example: at the distance b, from the luminous centre a, a certain number of particles are so diffused as to occupy the surface b. then at double the distance—that is to say at c—they will be so much farther diffused as to occupy four such surfaces:—at treble the distance, or at d, they will be so much farther separated as to occupy nine such surfaces:—while, at quadruple the distance, or at e, they will have become so scattered as to spread themselves over sixteen such surfaces—and so on forever. in saying, generally, that the irradiation proceeds in direct proportion with the squares of the distances, we use the term irradiation to express _the degree of the diffusion_ as we proceed outwardly from the centre. conversing the idea, and employing the word “concentralization” to express _the degree of the drawing together_ as we come back toward the centre from an outward position, we may say that concentralization proceeds _inversely_ as the squares of the distances. in other words, we have reached the conclusion that, on the hypothesis that matter was originally irradiated from a centre and is now returning to it, the concentralization, in the return, proceeds _exactly as we know the force of gravitation to proceed_. now here, if we could be permitted to assume that concentralization exactly represented the _force of the tendency to the centre_—that the one was exactly proportional to the other, and that the two proceeded together—we should have shown all that is required. the sole difficulty existing, then, is to establish a direct proportion between “concentralization” and the _force_ of concentralization; and this is done, of course, if we establish such proportion between “irradiation” and the _force_ of irradiation. a very slight inspection of the heavens assures us that the stars have a certain general uniformity, equability, or equidistance, of distribution through that region of space in which, collectively, and in a roughly globular form, they are situated:—this species of very general, rather than absolute, equability, being in full keeping with my deduction of inequidistance, within certain limits, among the originally diffused atoms, as a corollary from the evident design of infinite complexity of relation out of irrelation. i started, it will be remembered, with the idea of a generally uniform but particularly _un_uniform distribution of the atoms;—an idea, i repeat, which an inspection of the stars, as they exist, confirms. but even in the merely general equability of distribution, as regards the atoms, there appears a difficulty which, no doubt, has already suggested itself to those among my readers who have borne in mind that i suppose this equability of distribution effected through _irradiation from a centre_. the very first glance at the idea, irradiation, forces us to the entertainment of the hitherto unseparated and seemingly inseparable idea of agglomeration about a centre, with dispersion as we recede from it—the idea, in a word, of _in_equability of distribution in respect to the matter irradiated. now, i have <UNK> observed that it is by just such difficulties as the one now in question—such roughnesses—such peculiarities—such protuberances above the plane of the ordinary—that reason feels her way, if at all, in her search for the true. by the difficulty—the “peculiarity”—now presented, i leap at once to _the_ secret—a secret which i might never have attained _but_ for the peculiarity and the inferences which, _in its mere character of peculiarity_, it affords me. <UNK> “_murders in the rue morgue_”—p. <UNK> the process of thought, at this point, may be thus roughly sketched:—i say to myself—“unity, as i have explained it, is a truth—i feel it. diffusion is a truth—i see it. irradiation, by which alone these two truths are reconciled, is a consequent truth—i perceive it. _equability_ of diffusion, first deduced _à priori_ and then corroborated by the inspection of phænomena, is also a truth—i fully admit it. so far all is clear around me:—there are no clouds behind which _the_ secret—the great secret of the gravitating _modus operandi_—can possibly lie hidden;—but this secret lies _hereabouts_, most assuredly; and _were_ there but a cloud in view, i should be driven to suspicion of that cloud.” and now, just as i say this, there actually comes a cloud into view. this cloud is the seeming impossibility of reconciling my truth, _irradiation_, with my truth, _equability of diffusion_. i say now:—“behind this _seeming_ impossibility is to be found what i desire.” i do not say “_real_ impossibility;” for invincible faith in my truths assures me that it is a mere difficulty after all—but i go on to say, with unflinching confidence, that, _when_ this _difficulty_ shall be solved, we shall find, _wrapped up in the process of solution_, the key to the secret at which we aim. moreover—i _feel_ that we shall discover _but one_ possible solution of the difficulty; this for the reason that, were there two, one would be supererogatory—would be fruitless—would be empty—would contain no key—since no duplicate key can be needed to any secret of nature. and now, let us see:—our usual notions of irradiation—in fact _all_ our distinct notions of it—are caught merely from the process as we see it exemplified in _light_. here there is a _continuous_ outpouring of _ray-streams_, and _with a force which we have at least no right to suppose varies at all_. now, in any such irradiation _as this_—continuous and of unvarying force—the regions nearer the centre must _inevitably_ be always more crowded with the irradiated matter than the regions more remote. but i have assumed _no_ such irradiation _as this_. i assumed no _continuous_ irradiation; and for the simple reason that such an assumption would have involved, first, the necessity of entertaining a conception which i have shown no man _can_ entertain, and which (as i will more fully explain hereafter) all observation of the firmament refutes—the conception of the absolute infinity of the universe of stars—and would have involved, secondly, the impossibility of understanding a rëaction—that is, gravitation—as existing now—since, while an act is continued, no rëaction, of course, can take place. my assumption, then, or rather my inevitable deduction from just premises—was that of a _determinate_ irradiation—one finally _dis_continued. let me now describe the sole possible mode in which it is conceivable that matter could have been diffused through space, so as to fulfil the conditions at once of irradiation and of generally equable distribution. for convenience of illustration, let us imagine, in the first place, a hollow sphere of glass, or of anything else, occupying the space throughout which the universal matter is to be thus equally diffused, by means of irradiation, from the absolute, irrelative, unconditional particle, placed in the centre of the sphere. now, a certain exertion of the diffusive power (presumed to be the divine volition)—in other words, a certain _force_—whose measure is the quantity of matter—that is to say, the number of atoms—emitted; emits, by irradiation, this certain number of atoms; forcing them in all directions outwardly from the centre—their proximity to each other diminishing as they proceed—until, finally, they are distributed, loosely, over the interior surface of the sphere. when these atoms have attained this position, or while proceeding to attain it, a second and inferior exercise of the same force—or a second and inferior force of the same character—emits, in the same manner—that is to say, by irradiation as before—a second stratum of atoms which proceeds to deposit itself upon the first; the number of atoms, in this case as in the former, being of course the measure of the force which emitted them; in other words the force being precisely adapted to the purpose it effects—the force and the number of atoms sent out by the force, being _directly proportional_. when this second stratum has reached its destined position—or while approaching it—a third still inferior exertion of the force, or a third inferior force of a similar character—the number of atoms emitted being in _all_ cases the measure of the force—proceeds to deposit a third stratum upon the second:—and so on, until these concentric strata, growing gradually less and less, come down at length to the central point; and the diffusive matter, simultaneously with the diffusive force, is exhausted. we have now the sphere filled, through means of irradiation, with atoms equably diffused. the two necessary conditions—those of irradiation and of equable diffusion—are satisfied; and by the _sole_ process in which the possibility of their simultaneous satisfaction is conceivable. for this reason, i confidently expect to find, lurking in the present condition of the atoms as distributed throughout the sphere, the secret of which i am in search—the all-important principle of the _modus operandi_ of the newtonian law. let us examine, then, the actual condition of the atoms. they lie in a series of concentric strata. they are equably diffused throughout the sphere. they have been irradiated into these states. the atoms being _equably_ distributed, the greater the superficial extent of any of these concentric strata, or spheres, the more atoms will lie upon it. in other words, the number of atoms lying upon the surface of any one of the concentric spheres, is directly proportional with the extent of that surface. _but, in any series of concentric spheres, the surfaces are directly proportional with the squares of the distances from the <UNK> <UNK> succinctly—the surfaces of spheres are as the squares of their radii. therefore the number of atoms in any stratum is directly proportional with the square of that stratum’s distance from the centre. but the number of atoms in any stratum is the measure of the force which emitted that stratum—that is to say, is _directly proportional_ with the force. therefore the force which irradiated any stratum is directly proportional with the square of that stratum’s distance from the centre:—or, generally, _the force of the irradiation has been directly proportional with the squares of the distances._ now, rëaction, as far as we know anything of it, is action conversed. the _general_ principle of gravity being, in the first place, understood as the rëaction of an act—as the expression of a desire on the part of matter, while existing in a state of diffusion, to return into the unity whence it was diffused; and, in the second place, the mind being called upon to determine the _character_ of the desire—the manner in which it would, naturally, be manifested; in other words, being called upon to conceive a probable law, or _modus operandi_, for the return; could not well help arriving at the conclusion that this law of return would be precisely the converse of the law of departure. that such would be the case, any one, at least, would be abundantly justified in taking for granted, until such time as some person should suggest something like a plausible reason why it should _not_ be the case—until such period as a law of return shall be imagined which the intellect can consider as preferable. matter, then, irradiated into space with a force varying as the squares of the distances, might, _à priori_, be supposed to return towards its centre of irradiation with a force varying _inversely_ as the squares of the distances: and i have already <UNK> that any principle which will explain why the atoms should tend, according to any law, to the general centre, must be admitted as satisfactorily explaining, at the same time, why, according to the same law, they should tend each to each. for, in fact, the tendency to the general centre is not to a centre as such, but because of its being a point in tending towards which each atom tends most directly to its real and essential centre, _unity_—the absolute and final union of all. <UNK> page <UNK> the consideration here involved presents to my own mind no embarrassment whatever—but this fact does not blind me to the possibility of its being obscure to those who may have been less in the habit of dealing with abstractions:—and, upon the whole, it may be as well to look at the matter from one or two other points of view. the absolute, irrelative particle primarily created by the volition of god, must have been in a condition of positive _normality_, or rightfulness—for wrongfulness implies _relation_. right is positive; wrong is negative—is merely the negation of right; as cold is the negation of heat—darkness of light. that a thing may be wrong, it is necessary that there be some other thing in _relation_ to which it _is_ wrong—some condition which it fails to satisfy; some law which it violates; some being whom it aggrieves. if there be no such being, law, or condition, in respect to which the thing is wrong—and, still more especially, if no beings, laws, or conditions exist at all—then the thing can_not_ be wrong and consequently must be _right_. any deviation from normality involves a tendency to return into it. a difference from the normal—from the right—from the just—can be understood as effected only by the overcoming a difficulty; and if the force which overcomes the difficulty be not infinitely continued, the ineradicable tendency to return will at length be permitted to act for its own satisfaction. upon withdrawal of the force, the tendency acts. this is the principle of rëaction as the inevitable consequence of finite action. employing a phraseology of which the seeming affectation will be pardoned for its expressiveness, we may say that rëaction is the return from the condition of _as it is and ought not to be_ into the condition of _as it was, originally, and therefore ought to be_:—and let me add here that the _absolute_ force of rëaction would no doubt be always found in direct proportion with the reality—the truth—the absoluteness—of the _originality_—if ever it were possible to measure this latter:—and, consequently, the greatest of all conceivable reactions must be that produced by the tendency which we now discuss—the tendency to return into the _absolutely original_—into the _supremely_ primitive. gravity, then, _must be the strongest of forces_—an idea reached _à priori_ and abundantly confirmed by induction. what use i make of the idea, will be seen in the sequel. the atoms, now, having been diffused from their normal condition of unity, seek to return to——what? not to any particular _point_, certainly; for it is clear that if, upon the diffusion, the whole universe of matter had been projected, collectively, to a distance from the point of irradiation, the atomic tendency to the general centre of the sphere would not have been disturbed in the least:—the atoms would not have sought the point _in absolute space_ from which they were originally impelled. it is merely the _condition_, and not the point or locality at which this condition took its rise, that these atoms seek to re-establish;—it is merely _that condition which is their normality_, that they desire. “but they seek a centre,” it will be said, “and a centre is a point.” true; but they seek this point not in its character of point—(for, were the whole sphere moved from its position, they would seek, equally, the centre; and the centre _then_ would be a _new_ point)—but because it so happens, on account of the form in which they collectively exist—(that of the sphere)—that only _through_ the point in question—the sphere’s centre—they can attain their true object, unity. in the direction of the centre each atom perceives more atoms than in any other direction. each atom is impelled towards the centre because along the straight line joining it and the centre and passing on to the circumference beyond, there lie a greater number of atoms than along any other straight line—a greater number of objects that seek it, the individual atom—a greater number of tendencies to unity—a greater number of satisfactions for its own tendency to unity—in a word, because in the direction of the centre lies the utmost possibility of satisfaction, generally, for its own individual appetite. to be brief, the _condition_, unity, is all that is really sought; and if the atoms _seem_ to seek the centre of the sphere, it is only impliedly, through implication—because such centre happens to imply, to include, or to involve, the only essential centre, unity. but _on account of_ this implication or involution, there is no possibility of practically separating the tendency to unity in the abstract, from the tendency to the concrete centre. thus the tendency of the atoms to the general centre _is_, to all practical intents and for all logical purposes, the tendency each to each; and the tendency each to each _is_ the tendency to the centre; and the one tendency may be assumed _as_ the other; whatever will apply to the one must be thoroughly applicable to the other; and, in conclusion, whatever principle will satisfactorily explain the one, cannot be questioned as an explanation of the other. in looking carefully around me for rational objection to what i have advanced, i am able to discover _nothing_;—but of that class of objections usually urged by the doubters for doubt’s sake, i very readily perceive _three_; and proceed to dispose of them in order. it may be said, first: “the proof that the force of irradiation (in the case described) is directly proportional to the squares of the distances, depends upon an unwarranted assumption—that of the number of atoms in each stratum being the measure of the force with which they are emitted.” i reply, not only that i am warranted in such assumption, but that i should be utterly _un_warranted in any other. what i assume is, simply, that an effect is the measure of its cause—that every exercise of the divine will will be proportional to that which demands the exertion—that the means of omnipotence, or of omniscience, will be exactly adapted to its purposes. neither can a deficiency nor an excess of cause bring to pass any effect. had the force which irradiated any stratum to its position, been either more or less than was needed for the purpose—that is to say, not _directly proportional_ to the purpose—then to its position that stratum could not have been irradiated. had the force which, with a view to general equability of distribution, emitted the proper number of atoms for each stratum, been not _directly proportional_ to the number, then the number would _not_ have been the number demanded for the equable distribution. the second supposable objection is somewhat better entitled to an answer. it is an admitted principle in dynamics that every body, on receiving an impulse, or disposition to move, will move onward in a straight line, in the direction imparted by the impelling force, until deflected, or stopped, by some other force. how then, it may be asked, is my first or external stratum of atoms to be understood as discontinuing their movement at the circumference of the imaginary glass sphere, when no second force, of more than an imaginary character, appears, to account for the discontinuance? i reply that the objection, in this case, actually does arise out of “an unwarranted assumption”—on the part of the objector—the assumption of a principle, in dynamics, at an epoch when _no_ “principles,” in _anything_, exist:—i use the word “principle,” of course, in the objector’s understanding of the word. “in the beginning” we can admit—indeed we can comprehend—but one _first cause_—the truly ultimate _principle_—the volition of god. the primary _act_—that of irradiation from unity—must have been independent of all that which the world now calls “principle”—because all that we so designate is but a consequence of the rëaction of that primary act:—i say “_primary_” act; for the creation of the absolute material particle is more properly to be regarded as a _conception_ than as an “_act_” in the ordinary meaning of the term. thus, we must regard the primary act as an act for the establishment of what we now call “principles.” but this primary act itself is to be considered as _continuous volition_. the thought of god is to be understood as originating the diffusion—as proceeding with it—as regulating it—and, finally, as being withdrawn from it upon its completion. _then_ commences rëaction, and through rëaction, “principle,” as we employ the word. it will be advisable, however, to limit the application of this word to the two _immediate_ results of the discontinuance of the divine volition—that is, to the two agents, _attraction_ and _repulsion_. every other natural agent depends, either more or less immediately, upon these two, and therefore would be more conveniently designated as _sub_-principle. it may be objected, thirdly, that, in general, the peculiar mode of distribution which i have suggested for the atoms, is “an hypothesis and nothing more.” now, i am aware that the word hypothesis is a ponderous sledge-hammer, grasped immediately, if not lifted, by all very diminutive thinkers, upon the first appearance of any proposition wearing, in any particular, the garb of _a theory_. but “hypothesis” cannot be wielded _here_ to any good purpose, even by those who succeed in lifting it—little men or great. i maintain, first, that _only_ in the mode described is it conceivable that matter could have been diffused so as to fulfil at once the conditions of irradiation and of generally equable distribution. i maintain, secondly, that these conditions themselves have been imposed upon me, as necessities, in a train of ratiocination _as rigorously logical as that which establishes any demonstration in euclid_; and i maintain, thirdly, that even if the charge of “hypothesis” were as fully sustained as it is, in fact, unsustained and untenable, still the validity and indisputability of my result would not, even in the slightest particular, be disturbed. to explain:—the newtonian gravity—a law of nature—a law whose existence as such no one out of bedlam questions—a law whose admission as such enables us to account for nine-tenths of the universal phænomena—a law which, merely because it does so enable us to account for these phænomena, we are perfectly willing, without reference to any other considerations, to admit, and cannot help admitting, as a law—a law, nevertheless, of which neither the principle nor the _modus operandi_ of the principle, has ever yet been traced by the human analysis—a law, in short, which, neither in its detail nor in its generality, has been found susceptible of explanation _at all_—is at length seen to be at every point thoroughly explicable, provided only we yield our assent to——what? to an hypothesis? why _if_ an hypothesis—if the merest hypothesis—if an hypothesis for whose assumption—as in the case of that _pure_ hypothesis the newtonian law itself—no shadow of _à priori_ reason could be assigned—if an hypothesis, even so absolute as all this implies, would enable us to perceive a principle for the newtonian law—would enable us to understand as satisfied, conditions so miraculously—so ineffably complex and seemingly irreconcileable as those involved in the relations of which gravity tells us,—what rational being _could_ so expose his fatuity as to call even this absolute hypothesis an hypothesis any longer—unless, indeed, he were to persist in so calling it, with the understanding that he did so, simply for the sake of consistency _in words_? but what is the true state of our present case? what is _the fact_? not only that it is _not_ an hypothesis which we are required _to adopt_, in order to admit the principle at issue explained, but that it _is_ a logical conclusion which we are requested _not_ to adopt if we can avoid it—which we are simply invited to _deny if we can_:—a conclusion of so accurate a logicality that to dispute it would be the effort—to doubt its validity beyond our power:—a conclusion from which we see no mode of escape, turn as we will; a result which confronts us either at the end of an _in_ductive journey from the phænomena of the very law discussed, or at the close of a _de_ductive career from the most rigorously simple of all conceivable assumptions—_the assumption, in a word, of simplicity itself_. and if here, for the mere sake of cavilling, it be urged, that although my starting-point is, as i assert, the assumption of absolute simplicity, yet simplicity, considered merely in itself, is no axiom; and that only deductions from axioms are indisputable—it is thus that i reply:— every other science than logic is the science of certain concrete relations. arithmetic, for example, is the science of the relations of number—geometry, of the relations of form—mathematics in general, of the relations of quantity in general—of whatever can be increased or diminished. logic, however, is the science of relation in the abstract—of absolute relation—of relation considered solely in itself. an axiom in any particular science other than logic is, thus, merely a proposition announcing certain concrete relations which seem to be too obvious for dispute—as when we say, for instance, that the whole is greater than its part:—and, thus again, the principle of the _logical_ axiom—in other words, of an axiom in the abstract—is, simply, _obviousness of relation_. now, it is clear, not only that what is obvious to one mind may not be obvious to another, but that what is obvious to one mind at one epoch, may be anything but obvious, at another epoch, to the same mind. it is clear, moreover, that what, to-day, is obvious even to the majority of mankind, or to the majority of the best intellects of mankind, may to-morrow be, to either majority, more or less obvious, or in no respect obvious at all. it is seen, then, that the _axiomatic principle_ itself is susceptible of variation, and of course that axioms are susceptible of similar change. being mutable, the “truths” which grow out of them are necessarily mutable too; or, in other words, are never to be positively depended upon as truths at all—since truth and immutability are one. it will now be readily understood that no axiomatic idea—no idea founded in the fluctuating principle, obviousness of relation—can possibly be so secure—so reliable a basis for any structure erected by the reason, as _that_ idea—(whatever it is, wherever we can find it, or _if_ it be practicable to find it anywhere)—which is _ir_relative altogether—which not only presents to the understanding _no obviousness_ of relation, either greater or less, to be considered, but subjects the intellect, not in the slightest degree, to the necessity of even looking at _any relation at all_. if such an idea be not what we too heedlessly term “an axiom,” it is at least preferable, as a logical basis, to any axiom ever propounded, or to all imaginable axioms combined:—and such, precisely, is the idea with which my deductive process, so thoroughly corroborated by induction, commences. my _particle proper_ is but _absolute irrelation_. to sum up what has been here advanced:—as a starting point i have taken it for granted, simply, that the beginning had nothing behind it or before it—that it was a beginning in fact—that it was a beginning and nothing different from a beginning—in short that this beginning was——_that which it was_. if this be a “mere assumption” then a “mere assumption” let it be. to conclude this branch of the subject:—i am fully warranted in announcing that _the law which we have been in the habit of calling gravity exists on account of matter’s having been irradiated, at its origin, atomically, into a <UNK> sphere of space, from one, individual, unconditional, irrelative, and absolute particle proper, by the sole process in which it was possible to satisfy, at the same time, the two conditions, irradiation, and generally-equable distribution throughout the sphere—that is to say, by a force varying in direct proportion with the squares of the distances between the irradiated atoms, respectively, and the particular centre of irradiation_. <UNK> limited sphere—a sphere is _necessarily_ limited. i prefer tautology to a chance of misconception. i have already given my reasons for presuming matter to have been diffused by a determinate rather than by a continuous or infinitely continued force. supposing a continuous force, we should be unable, in the first place, to comprehend a rëaction at all; and we should be required, in the second place, to entertain the impossible conception of an infinite extension of matter. not to dwell upon the impossibility of the conception, the infinite extension of matter is an idea which, if not positively disproved, is at least not in any respect warranted by telescopic observation of the stars—a point to be explained more fully hereafter; and this empirical reason for believing in the original finity of matter is unempirically confirmed. for example:—admitting, for the moment, the possibility of understanding space _filled_ with the irradiated atoms—that is to say, admitting, as well as we can, for argument’s sake, that the succession of the irradiated atoms had absolutely _no end_—then it is abundantly clear that, even when the volition of god had been withdrawn from them, and thus the tendency to return into unity permitted (abstractly) to be satisfied, this permission would have been nugatory and invalid—practically valueless and of no effect whatever. no rëaction could have taken place; no movement toward unity could have been made; no law of gravity could have obtained. to explain:—grant the _abstract_ tendency of any one atom to any one other as the inevitable result of diffusion from the normal unity:—or, what is the same thing, admit any given atom as _proposing_ to move in any given direction—it is clear that, since there is an _infinity_ of atoms on all sides of the atom proposing to move, it never can actually move toward the satisfaction of its tendency in the direction given, on account of a precisely equal and counterbalancing tendency in the direction diametrically opposite. in other words, exactly as many tendencies to unity are behind the hesitating atom as before it; for it is a mere sotticism to say that one infinite line is longer or shorter than another infinite line, or that one infinite number is greater or less than another number that is infinite. thus the atom in question must remain stationary forever. under the impossible circumstances which we have been merely endeavoring to conceive for argument’s sake, there could have been no aggregation of matter—no stars—no worlds—nothing but a perpetually atomic and inconsequential universe. in fact, view it as we will, the whole idea of unlimited matter is not only untenable, but impossible and preposterous. with the understanding of a _sphere_ of atoms, however, we perceive, at once, a _satisfiable_ tendency to union. the general result of the tendency each to each, being a tendency of all to the centre, the _general_ process of condensation, or approximation, commences immediately, by a common and simultaneous movement, on withdrawal of the divine volition; the _individual_ approximations, or coalescences—_not_ cöalitions—of atom with atom, being subject to almost infinite variations of time, degree, and condition, on account of the excessive multiplicity of relation, arising from the differences of form assumed as characterizing the atoms at the moment of their quitting the particle proper; as well as from the subsequent particular inequidistance, each from each. what i wish to impress upon the reader is the certainty of there arising, at once, (on withdrawal of the diffusive force, or divine volition,) out of the condition of the atoms as described, at innumerable points throughout the universal sphere, innumerable agglomerations, characterized by innumerable specific differences of form, size, essential nature, and distance each from each. the development of repulsion (electricity) must have commenced, of course, with the very earliest particular efforts at unity, and must have proceeded constantly in the ratio of coalescence—that is to say, _in that of condensation_, or, again, of heterogeneity. thus the two principles proper, _attraction_ and _repulsion_—the material and the spiritual—accompany each other, in the strictest fellowship, forever. thus _the body and the soul walk hand in hand_. if now, in fancy, we select _any one_ of the agglomerations considered as in their primary stages throughout the universal sphere, and suppose this incipient agglomeration to be taking place at that point where the centre of our sun exists—or rather where it _did_ exist originally; for the sun is perpetually shifting his position—we shall find ourselves met, and borne onward for a time at least, by the most magnificent of theories—by the nebular cosmogony of laplace:—although “cosmogony” is far too comprehensive a term for what he really discusses—which is the constitution of our solar system alone—of one among the myriad of similar systems which make up the universe proper—that universal sphere—that all-inclusive and absolute _kosmos_ which forms the subject of my present discourse. confining himself to an _obviously limited_ region—that of our solar system with its comparatively immediate vicinity—and _merely_ assuming—that is to say, assuming without any basis whatever, either deductive or inductive—_much_ of what i have been just endeavoring to place upon a more stable basis than assumption; assuming, for example, matter as diffused (without pretending to account for the diffusion) throughout, and somewhat beyond, the space occupied by our system—diffused in a state of heterogeneous nebulosity and obedient to that omniprevalent law of gravity at whose principle he ventured to make no guess;—assuming all this (which is quite true, although he had no logical right to its assumption) laplace has shown, dynamically and mathematically, that the results in such case necessarily ensuing, are those and those alone which we find manifested in the actually existing condition of the system itself. to explain:—let us conceive _that_ particular agglomeration of which we have just spoken—the one at the point designated by our sun’s centre—to have so far proceeded that a vast quantity of nebulous matter has here assumed a roughly globular form; its centre being, of course, coincident with what is now, or rather was originally, the centre of our sun; and its periphery extending out beyond the orbit of neptune, the most remote of our planets:—in other words, let us suppose the diameter of this rough sphere to be some <UNK> millions of miles. for ages, this mass of matter has been undergoing condensation, until at length it has become reduced into the bulk we imagine; having proceeded gradually, of course, from its atomic and imperceptible state, into what we understand of visible, palpable, or otherwise appreciable nebulosity. now, the condition of this mass implies a rotation about an imaginary axis—a rotation which, commencing with the absolute incipiency of the aggregation, has been ever since acquiring velocity. the very first two atoms which met, approaching each other from points not diametrically opposite, would, in rushing partially past each other, form a nucleus for the rotary movement described. how this would increase in velocity, is readily seen. the two atoms are joined by others:—an aggregation is formed. the mass continues to rotate while condensing. but any atom at the circumference has, of course, a more rapid motion than one nearer the centre. the outer atom, however, with its superior velocity, approaches the centre; carrying this superior velocity with it as it goes. thus every atom, proceeding inwardly, and finally attaching itself to the condensed centre, adds something to the original velocity of that centre—that is to say, increases the rotary movement of the mass. let us now suppose this mass so far condensed that it occupies _precisely_ the space circumscribed by the orbit of neptune, and that the velocity with which the surface of the mass moves, in the general rotation, is precisely that velocity with which neptune now revolves about the sun. at this epoch, then, we are to understand that the constantly increasing centrifugal force, having gotten the better of the non-increasing centripetal, loosened and separated the exterior and least condensed stratum, or a few of the exterior and least condensed strata, at the equator of the sphere, where the tangential velocity predominated; so that these strata formed about the main body an independent ring encircling the equatorial regions:—just as the exterior portion thrown off, by excessive velocity of rotation, from a grindstone, would form a ring about the grindstone, but for the solidity of the superficial material: were this caoutchouc, or anything similar in consistency, precisely the phænomenon i describe would be presented. the ring thus whirled from the nebulous mass, _revolved_, of course, _as_ a separate ring, with just that velocity with which, while the surface of the mass, it _rotated_. in the meantime, condensation still proceeding, the interval between the discharged ring and the main body continued to increase, until the former was left at a vast distance from the latter. now, admitting the ring to have possessed, by some seemingly accidental arrangement of its heterogeneous materials, a constitution nearly uniform, then this ring, _as_ such, would never have ceased revolving about its primary; but, as might have been anticipated, there appears to have been enough irregularity in the disposition of the materials, to make them cluster about centres of superior solidity; and thus the annular form was <UNK> no doubt, the band was soon broken up into several portions, and one of these portions, predominating in mass, absorbed the others into itself; the whole settling, spherically, into a planet. that this latter, _as_ a planet, continued the revolutionary movement which characterized it while a ring, is sufficiently clear; and that it took upon itself also, an additional movement in its new condition of sphere, is readily explained. the ring being understood as yet unbroken, we see that its exterior, while the whole revolves about the parent body, moves more rapidly than its interior. when the rupture occurred, then, some portion in each fragment must have been moving with greater velocity than the others. the superior movement prevailing, must have whirled each fragment round—that is to say, have caused it to rotate; and the direction of the rotation must, of course, have been the direction of the revolution whence it arose. _all_ the fragments having become subject to the rotation described, must, in coalescing, have imparted it to the one planet constituted by their coalescence.—this planet was neptune. its material continuing to undergo condensation, and the centrifugal force generated in its rotation getting, at length, the better of the centripetal, as before in the case of the parent orb, a ring was whirled also from the equatorial surface of this planet: this ring, having been ununiform in its constitution, was broken up, and its several fragments, being absorbed by the most massive, were collectively spherified into a moon. subsequently, the operation was repeated, and a second moon was the result. we thus account for the planet neptune, with the two satellites which accompany him. <UNK> laplace assumed his nebulosity heterogeneous, merely that he might be thus enabled to account for the breaking up of the rings; for had the nebulosity been homogeneous, they would not have broken. i reach the same result—heterogeneity of the secondary masses immediately resulting from the atoms—purely from an _à priori_ consideration of their general design—_relation_. in throwing off a ring from its equator, the sun re-established that equilibrium between its centripetal and centrifugal forces which had been disturbed in the process of condensation; but, as this condensation still proceeded, the equilibrium was again immediately disturbed, through the increase of rotation. by the time the mass had so far shrunk that it occupied a spherical space just that circumscribed by the orbit of uranus, we are to understand that the centrifugal force had so far obtained the ascendency that new relief was needed: a second equatorial band was, consequently, thrown off, which, proving ununiform, was broken up, as before in the case of neptune; the fragments settling into the planet uranus; the velocity of whose actual revolution about the sun indicates, of course, the rotary speed of that sun’s equatorial surface at the moment of the separation. uranus, adopting a rotation from the collective rotations of the fragments composing it, as previously explained, now threw off ring after ring; each of which, becoming broken up, settled into a moon:—three moons, at different epochs, having been formed, in this manner, by the rupture and general spherification of as many distinct ununiform rings. by the time the sun had shrunk until it occupied a space just that circumscribed by the orbit of saturn, the balance, we are to suppose, between its centripetal and centrifugal forces had again become so far disturbed, through increase of rotary velocity, the result of condensation, that a third effort at equilibrium became necessary; and an annular band was therefore whirled off as twice before; which, on rupture through ununiformity, became consolidated into the planet saturn. this latter threw off, in the first place, seven uniform bands, which, on rupture, were spherified respectively into as many moons; but, subsequently, it appears to have discharged, at three distinct but not very distant epochs, three rings whose equability of constitution was, by apparent accident, so considerable as to present no occasion for their rupture; thus they continue to revolve as rings. i use the phrase “_apparent_ accident;” for of accident in the ordinary sense there was, of course, nothing:—the term is properly applied only to the result of indistinguishable or not immediately traceable _law_. shrinking still farther, until it occupied just the space circumscribed by the orbit of jupiter, the sun now found need of farther effort to restore the counterbalance of its two forces, continually disarranged in the still continued increase of rotation. jupiter, accordingly, was now thrown off; passing from the annular to the planetary condition; and, on attaining this latter, threw off in its turn, at four different epochs, four rings, which finally resolved themselves into so many moons. still shrinking, until its sphere occupied just the space defined by the orbit of the asteroids, the sun now discarded a ring which appears to have had _eight_ centres of superior solidity, and, on breaking up, to have separated into eight fragments no one of which so far predominated in mass as to absorb the others. all therefore, as distinct although comparatively small planets, proceeded to revolve in orbits whose distances, each from each, may be considered as in some degree the measure of the force which drove them asunder:—all the orbits, nevertheless, being so closely coincident as to admit of our calling them _one_, in view of the other planetary orbits. continuing to shrink, the sun, on becoming so small as just to fill the orbit of mars, now discharged this planet—of course by the process repeatedly described. having no moon, however, mars could have thrown off no ring. in fact, an epoch had now arrived in the career of the parent body, the centre of the system. the _de_crease of its nebulosity, which is the _in_crease of its density, and which again is the _de_crease of its condensation, out of which latter arose the constant disturbance of equilibrium—must, by this period, have attained a point at which the efforts for restoration would have been more and more ineffectual just in proportion as they were less frequently needed. thus the processes of which we have been speaking would everywhere show signs of exhaustion—in the planets, first, and secondly, in the original mass. we must not fall into the error of supposing the decrease of interval observed among the planets as we approach the sun, to be in any respect indicative of an increase of frequency in the periods at which they were discarded. exactly the converse is to be understood. the longest interval of time must have occurred between the discharges of the two interior; the shortest, between those of the two exterior, planets. the decrease of the interval of space is, nevertheless, the measure of the density, and thus inversely of the condensation, of the sun, throughout the processes detailed. having shrunk, however, so far as to fill only the orbit of our earth, the parent sphere whirled from itself still one other body—the earth—in a condition so nebulous as to admit of this body’s discarding, in its turn, yet another, which is our moon;—but here terminated the lunar formations. finally, subsiding to the orbits first of venus and then of mercury, the sun discarded these two interior planets; neither of which has given birth to any moon. thus from his original bulk—or, to speak more accurately, from the condition in which we first considered him—from a partially spherified nebular mass, _certainly_ much more than <UNK> millions of miles in diameter—the great central orb and origin of our solar-planetary-lunar system, has gradually descended, by condensation, in obedience to the law of gravity, to a globe only <UNK> miles in diameter; but it by no means follows, either that its condensation is yet complete, or that it may not still possess the capacity of whirling from itself another planet. i have here given—in outline of course, but still with all the detail necessary for distinctness—a view of the nebular theory as its author himself conceived it. from whatever point we regard it, we shall find it _beautifully true_. it is by far too beautiful, indeed, _not_ to possess truth as its essentiality—and here i am very profoundly serious in what i say. in the revolution of the satellites of uranus, there does appear something seemingly inconsistent with the assumptions of laplace; but that _one_ inconsistency can invalidate a theory constructed from a million of intricate consistencies, is a fancy fit only for the fantastic. in prophecying, confidently, that the apparent anomaly to which i refer, will, sooner or later, be found one of the strongest possible corroborations of the general hypothesis, i pretend to no especial spirit of divination. it is a matter which the only difficulty seems _not_ to <UNK> <UNK> i am prepared to show that the anomalous revolution of the satellites of uranus is a simply perspective anomaly arising from the inclination of the axis of the planet. the bodies whirled off in the processes described, would exchange, it has been seen, the superficial _rotation_ of the orbs whence they originated, for a _revolution_ of equal velocity about these orbs as distant centres; and the revolution thus engendered must proceed, so long as the centripetal force, or that with which the discarded body gravitates toward its parent, is neither greater nor less than that by which it was discarded; that is, than the centrifugal, or, far more properly, than the tangential, velocity. from the unity, however, of the origin of these two forces, we might have expected to find them as they are found—the one accurately counterbalancing the other. it has been shown, indeed, that the act of whirling-off is, in every case, merely an act for the preservation of the counterbalance. after referring, however, the centripetal force to the omniprevalent law of gravity, it has been the fashion with astronomical treatises, to seek beyond the limits of mere nature—that is to say, of _secondary_ cause—a solution of the phænomenon of tangential velocity. this latter they attribute directly to a _first_ cause—to god. the force which carries a stellar body around its primary they assert to have originated in an impulse given immediately by the finger—this is the childish phraseology employed—by the finger of deity itself. in this view, the planets, fully formed, are conceived to have been hurled from the divine hand, to a position in the vicinity of the suns, with an impetus mathematically adapted to the masses, or attractive capacities, of the suns themselves. an idea so grossly unphilosophical, although so supinely adopted, could have arisen only from the difficulty of otherwise accounting for the absolutely accurate adaptation, each to each, of two forces so seemingly independent, one of the other, as are the gravitating and tangential. but it should be remembered that, for a long time, the coincidence between the moon’s rotation and her sidereal revolution—two matters seemingly far more independent than those now considered—was looked upon as positively miraculous; and there was a strong disposition, even among astronomers, to attribute the marvel to the direct and continual agency of god—who, in this case, it was said, had found it necessary to interpose, specially, among his general laws, a set of subsidiary regulations, for the purpose of forever concealing from mortal eyes the glories, or perhaps the horrors, of the other side of the moon—of that mysterious hemisphere which has always avoided, and must perpetually avoid, the telescopic scrutiny of mankind. the advance of science, however, soon demonstrated—what to the philosophical instinct needed _no_ demonstration—that the one movement is but a portion—something more, even, than a consequence—of the other. for my part, i have no patience with fantasies at once so timorous, so idle, and so awkward. they belong to the veriest _cowardice_ of thought. that nature and the god of nature are distinct, no thinking being can long doubt. by the former we imply merely the laws of the latter. but with the very idea of god, omnipotent, omniscient, we entertain, also, the idea of _the infallibility_ of his laws. with him there being neither past nor future—with him all being _now_—do we not insult him in supposing his laws so contrived as not to provide for every possible contingency?—or, rather, what idea _can_ we have of _any_ possible contingency, except that it is at once a result and a manifestation of his laws? he who, divesting himself of prejudice, shall have the rare courage to think absolutely for himself, cannot fail to arrive, in the end, at the condensation of _laws_ into _law_—cannot fail of reaching the conclusion that _each law of nature is dependent at all points upon all other laws_, and that all are but consequences of one primary exercise of the divine volition. such is the principle of the cosmogony which, with all necessary deference, i here venture to suggest and to maintain. in this view, it will be seen that, dismissing as frivolous, and even impious, the fancy of the tangential force having been imparted to the planets immediately by “the finger of god,” i consider this force as originating in the rotation of the stars:—this rotation as brought about by the in-rushing of the primary atoms, towards their respective centres of aggregation:—this in-rushing as the consequence of the law of gravity:—this law as but the mode in which is necessarily manifested the tendency of the atoms to return into imparticularity:—this tendency to return as but the inevitable rëaction of the first and most sublime of acts—that act by which a god, self-existing and alone existing, became all things at once, through dint of his volition, while all things were thus constituted a portion of god. the radical assumptions of this discourse suggest to me, and in fact imply, certain important _modifications_ of the nebular theory as given by laplace. the efforts of the repulsive power i have considered as made for the purpose of preventing contact among the atoms, and thus as made in the ratio of the approach to contact—that is to say, in the ratio of <UNK> in other words, _electricity_, with its involute phænomena, heat, light and magnetism, is to be understood as proceeding as condensation proceeds, and, of course, inversely as density proceeds, or the _cessation to condense_. thus the sun, in the process of its aggregation, must soon, in developing repulsion, have become excessively heated—perhaps incandescent: and we can perceive how the operation of discarding its rings must have been materially assisted by the slight incrustation of its surface consequent on cooling. any common experiment shows us how readily a crust of the character suggested, is separated, through heterogeneity, from the interior mass. but, on every successive rejection of the crust, the new surface would appear incandescent as before; and the period at which it would again become so far encrusted as to be readily loosened and discharged, may well be imagined as exactly coincident with that at which a new effort would be needed, by the whole mass, to restore the equilibrium of its two forces, disarranged through condensation. in other words:—by the time the electric influence (repulsion) has prepared the surface for rejection, we are to understand that the gravitating influence (attraction) is precisely ready to reject it. here, then, as everywhere, _the body and the soul walk hand in hand_. <UNK> see page <UNK> these ideas are empirically confirmed at all points. since condensation can never, in any body, be considered as absolutely at an end, we are warranted in anticipating that, whenever we have an opportunity of testing the matter, we shall find indications of resident luminosity in _all_ the stellar bodies—moons and planets as well as suns. that our moon is strongly self-luminous, we see at her every total eclipse, when, if not so, she would disappear. on the dark part of the satellite, too, during her phases, we often observe flashes like our own auroras; and that these latter, with our various other so-called electrical phænomena, without reference to any more steady radiance, must give our earth a certain appearance of luminosity to an inhabitant of the moon, is quite evident. in fact, we should regard all the phænomena referred to, as mere manifestations, in different moods and degrees, of the earth’s feebly-continued condensation. if my views are tenable, we should be prepared to find the newer planets—that is to say, those nearer the sun—more luminous than those older and more remote:—and the extreme brilliancy of venus (on whose dark portions, during her phases, the auroras are frequently visible) does not seem to be altogether accounted for by her mere proximity to the central orb. she is no doubt vividly self-luminous, although less so than mercury: while the luminosity of neptune may be comparatively nothing. admitting what i have urged, it is clear that, from the moment of the sun’s discarding a ring, there must be a continuous diminution both of his heat and light, on account of the continuous encrustation of his surface; and that a period would arrive—the period immediately previous to a new discharge—when a _very material_ decrease of both light and heat, must become apparent. now, we know that tokens of such changes are distinctly recognizable. on the melville islands—to adduce merely one out of a hundred examples—we find traces of _ultra-tropical_ vegetation—of plants that never could have flourished without immensely more light and heat than are at present afforded by our sun to any portion of the surface of the earth. is such vegetation referable to an epoch immediately subsequent to the whirling-off of venus? at this epoch must have occurred to us our greatest access of solar influence; and, in fact, this influence must then have attained its maximum:—leaving out of view, of course, the period when the earth itself was discarded—the period of its mere organization. again:—we know that there exist _non-luminous suns_—that is to say, suns whose existence we determine through the movements of others, but whose luminosity is not sufficient to impress us. are these suns invisible merely on account of the length of time elapsed since their discharge of a planet? and yet again:—may we not—at least in certain cases—account for the sudden appearances of suns where none had been previously suspected, by the hypothesis that, having rolled with encrusted surfaces throughout the few thousand years of our astronomical history, each of these suns, in whirling off a new secondary, has at length been enabled to display the glories of its still incandescent interior?—to the well-ascertained fact of the proportional increase of heat as we descend into the earth, i need of course, do nothing more than refer:—it comes in the strongest possible corroboration of all that i have said on the topic now at issue. in speaking, not long ago, of the repulsive or electrical influence, i remarked that “the important phænomena of vitality, consciousness, and thought, whether we observe them generally or in detail, seem to proceed _at least in the ratio of the <UNK> i mentioned, too, that i would recur to the suggestion:—and this is the proper point at which to do so. looking at the matter, first, in detail, we perceive that not merely the _manifestation_ of vitality, but its importance, consequence, and elevation of character, keep pace, very closely, with the heterogeneity, or complexity, of the animal structure. looking at the question, now, in its generality, and referring to the first movements of the atoms towards mass-constitution, we find that heterogeneousness, brought about directly through condensation, is proportional with it forever. we thus reach the proposition that _the importance of the development of the terrestrial vitality proceeds equably with the terrestrial condensation_. <UNK> page <UNK> now this is in precise accordance with what we know of the succession of animals on the earth. as it has proceeded in its condensation, superior and still superior races have appeared. is it impossible that the successive geological revolutions which have attended, at least, if not immediately caused, these successive elevations of vitalic character—is it improbable that these revolutions have themselves been produced by the successive planetary discharges from the sun—in other words, by the successive variations in the solar influence on the earth? were this idea tenable, we should not be unwarranted in the fancy that the discharge of yet a new planet, interior to mercury, may give rise to yet a new modification of the terrestrial surface—a modification from which may spring a race both materially and spiritually superior to man. these thoughts impress me with all the force of truth—but i throw them out, of course, merely in their obvious character of suggestion. the nebular theory of laplace has lately received far more confirmation than it needed, at the hands of the philosopher, compte. these two have thus together shown—_not_, to be sure, that matter at any period actually existed as described, in a state of nebular diffusion, but that, admitting it so to have existed throughout the space and much beyond the space now occupied by our solar system, _and to have commenced a movement towards a centre_—it must gradually have assumed the various forms and motions which are now seen, in that system, to obtain. a demonstration such as this—a dynamical and mathematical demonstration, as far as demonstration can be—unquestionable and unquestioned—unless, indeed, by that unprofitable and disreputable tribe, the professional questioners—the mere madmen who deny the newtonian law of gravity on which the results of the french mathematicians are based—a demonstration, i say, such as this, would to most intellects be conclusive—and i confess that it is so to mine—of the validity of the nebular hypothesis upon which the demonstration depends. that the demonstration does not _prove_ the hypothesis, according to the common understanding of the word “proof,” i admit, of course. to show that certain existing results—that certain established facts—may be, even mathematically, accounted for by the assumption of a certain hypothesis, is by no means to establish the hypothesis itself. in other words:—to show that, certain data being given, a certain existing result might, or even _must_, have ensued, will fail to prove that this result _did_ ensue, _from the data_, until such time as it shall be also shown that there are, _and can be_, no other data from which the result in question might _equally_ have ensued. but, in the case now discussed, although all must admit the deficiency of what we are in the habit of terming “proof,” still there are many intellects, and those of the loftiest order, to which _no_ proof could bring one iota of additional _conviction_. without going into details which might impinge upon the cloud-land of metaphysics, i may as well here observe that the force of conviction, in cases such as this, will always, with the right-thinking, be proportional to the amount of _complexity_ intervening between the hypothesis and the result. to be less abstract:—the greatness of the complexity found existing among cosmical conditions, by rendering great in the same proportion the difficulty of accounting for all these conditions _at once_, strengthens, also in the same proportion, our faith in that hypothesis which does, in such manner, satisfactorily account for them:—and as _no_ complexity can well be conceived greater than that of the astronomical conditions, so no conviction can be stronger—to _my_ mind at least—than that with which i am impressed by an hypothesis that not only reconciles these conditions, with mathematical accuracy, and reduces them into a consistent and intelligible whole, but is, at the same time, the _sole_ hypothesis by means of which the human intellect has been ever enabled to account for them _at all_. a most unfounded opinion has become latterly current in gossiping and even in scientific circles—the opinion that the so-called nebular cosmogony has been overthrown. this fancy has arisen from the report of late observations made, among what hitherto have been termed the “nebulæ,” through the large telescope of cincinnati, and the world-renowned instrument of lord rosse. certain spots in the firmament which presented, even to the most powerful of the old telescopes, the appearance of nebulosity, or haze, had been regarded for a long time as confirming the theory of laplace. they were looked upon as stars in that very process of condensation which i have been attempting to describe. thus it was supposed that we “had ocular evidence”—an evidence, by the way, which has always been found very questionable—of the truth of the hypothesis; and, although certain telescopic improvements, every now and then, enabled us to perceive that a spot, here and there, which we had been classing among the nebulæ, was, in fact, but a cluster of stars deriving its nebular character only from its immensity of distance—still it was thought that no doubt could exist as to the actual nebulosity of numerous other masses, the strong-holds of the nebulists, bidding defiance to every effort at segregation. of these latter the most interesting was the great “nebulæ” in the constellation orion:—but this, with innumerable other mis-called “nebulæ,” when viewed through the magnificent modern telescopes, has become resolved into a simple collection of stars. now this fact has been very generally understood as conclusive against the nebular hypothesis of laplace; and, on announcement of the discoveries in question, the most enthusiastic defender and most eloquent popularizer of the theory, dr. nichol, went so far as to “admit the necessity of abandoning” an idea which had formed the material of his most praiseworthy <UNK> <UNK> “_views of the architecture of the heavens._” a letter, purporting to be from dr. nichol to a friend in america, went the rounds of our newspapers, about two years ago, i think, admitting “the necessity” to which i refer. in a subsequent lecture, however, dr. n. appears in some manner to have gotten the better of the necessity, and does not quite _renounce_ the theory, although he seems to wish that he could sneer at it as “a purely hypothetical one.” what else was the law of gravity before the maskelyne experiments? and who questioned the law of gravity, even then? many of my readers will no doubt be inclined to say that the result of these new investigations _has_ at least a strong _tendency_ to overthrow the hypothesis; while some of them, more thoughtful, will suggest that, although the theory is by no means disproved through the segregation of the particular “nebulæ,” alluded to, still a _failure_ to segregate them, with such telescopes, might well have been understood as a triumphant _corroboration_ of the theory:—and this latter class will be surprised, perhaps, to hear me say that even with _them_ i disagree. if the propositions of this discourse have been comprehended, it will be seen that, in my view, a failure to segregate the “nebulæ” would have tended to the refutation, rather than to the confirmation, of the nebular hypothesis. let me explain:—the newtonian law of gravity we may, of course, assume as demonstrated. this law, it will be remembered, i have referred to the rëaction of the first divine act—to the rëaction of an exercise of the divine volition temporarily overcoming a difficulty. this difficulty is that of forcing the normal into the abnormal—of impelling that whose originality, and therefore whose rightful condition, was _one_, to take upon itself the wrongful condition of _many_. it is only by conceiving this difficulty as _temporarily_ overcome, that we can comprehend a rëaction. there could have been no rëaction had the act been infinitely continued. so long as the act _lasted_, no rëaction, of course, could commence; in other words, no _gravitation_ could take place—for we have considered the one as but the manifestation of the other. but gravitation _has_ taken place; therefore the act of creation has ceased: and gravitation has long ago taken place; therefore the act of creation has long ago ceased. we can no more expect, then, to observe _the primary processes_ of creation; and to these primary processes the condition of nebulosity has already been explained to belong. through what we know of the propagation of light, we have direct proof that the more remote of the stars have existed, under the forms in which we now see them, for an inconceivable number of years. so far back _at least_, then, as the period when these stars underwent condensation, must have been the epoch at which the mass-constitutive processes began. that we may conceive these processes, then, as still going on in the case of certain “nebulæ,” while in all other cases we find them thoroughly at an end, we are forced into assumptions for which we have really _no_ basis whatever—we have to thrust in, again, upon the revolting reason, the blasphemous idea of special interposition—we have to suppose that, in the particular instances of these “nebulæ,” an unerring god found it necessary to introduce certain supplementary regulations—certain improvements of the general law—certain retouchings and emendations, in a word, which had the effect of deferring the completion of these individual stars for centuries of centuries beyond the æra during which all the other stellar bodies had time, not only to be fully constituted, but to grow hoary with an unspeakable old age. of course, it will be immediately objected that since the light by which we recognize the nebulæ now, must be merely that which left their surfaces a vast number of years ago, the processes at present observed, or supposed to be observed, are, in fact, _not_ processes now actually going on, but the phantoms of processes completed long in the past—just as i maintain all these mass-constitutive processes _must_ have been. to this i reply that neither is the now-observed condition of the condensed stars their actual condition, but a condition completed long in the past; so that my argument drawn from the _relative_ condition of the stars and the “nebulæ,” is in no manner disturbed. moreover, those who maintain the existence of nebulæ, do _not_ refer the nebulosity to extreme distance; they declare it a real and not merely a perspective nebulosity. that we may conceive, indeed, a nebular mass as visible at all, we must conceive it as _very near us_ in comparison with the condensed stars brought into view by the modern telescopes. in maintaining the appearances in question, then, to be really nebulous, we maintain their comparative vicinity to our point of view. thus, their condition, as we see them now, must be referred to an epoch _far less remote_ than that to which we may refer the now-observed condition of at least the majority of the stars.—in a word, should astronomy ever demonstrate a “nebula,” in the sense at present intended, i should consider the nebular cosmogony—_not_, indeed, as corroborated by the demonstration—but as thereby irretrievably overthrown. by way, however, of rendering unto cæsar _no more_ than the things that are cæsar’s, let me here remark that the assumption of the hypothesis which led him to so glorious a result, seems to have been suggested to laplace in great measure by a misconception—by the very misconception of which we have just been speaking—by the generally prevalent misunderstanding of the character of the nebulæ, so mis-named. these he supposed to be, in reality, what their designation implies. the fact is, this great man had, very properly, an inferior faith in his own merely _perceptive_ powers. in respect, therefore, to the actual existence of nebulæ—an existence so confidently maintained by his telescopic contemporaries—he depended less upon what he saw than upon what he heard. it will be seen that the only valid objections to his theory, are those made to its hypothesis _as_ such—to what suggested it—not to what it suggests; to its propositions rather than to its results. his most unwarranted assumption was that of giving the atoms a movement towards a centre, in the very face of his evident understanding that these atoms, in unlimited succession, extended throughout the universal space. i have already shown that, under such circumstances, there could have occurred no movement at all; and laplace, consequently, assumed one on no more philosophical ground than that something of the kind was necessary for the establishment of what he intended to establish. his original idea seems to have been a compound of the true epicurean atoms with the false nebulæ of his contemporaries; and thus his theory presents us with the singular anomaly of absolute truth deduced, as a mathematical result, from a hybrid datum of ancient imagination intertangled with modern inacumen. laplace’s real strength lay, in fact, in an almost miraculous mathematical instinct:—on this he relied; and in no instance did it fail or deceive him:—in the case of the nebular cosmogony, it led him, blindfolded, through a labyrinth of error, into one of the most luminous and stupendous temples of truth. let us now fancy, for the moment, that the ring first thrown off by the sun—that is to say, the ring whose breaking-up constituted neptune—did not, in fact, break up until the throwing-off of the ring out of which uranus arose; that this latter ring, again, remained perfect until the discharge of that out of which sprang saturn; that this latter, again, remained entire until the discharge of that from which originated jupiter—and so on. let us imagine, in a word, that no dissolution occurred among the rings until the final rejection of that which gave birth to mercury. we thus paint to the eye of the mind a series of cöexistent concentric circles; and looking as well at _them_ as at the processes by which, according to laplace’s hypothesis, they were constructed, we perceive at once a very singular analogy with the atomic strata and the process of the original irradiation as i have described it. is it impossible that, on measuring the _forces_, respectively, by which each successive planetary circle was thrown off—that is to say, on measuring the successive excesses of rotation over gravitation which occasioned the successive discharges—we should find the analogy in question more decidedly confirmed? _is it improbable that we should discover these forces to have varied—as in the original radiation—proportionally to the squares of the distances?_ our solar system, consisting, in chief, of one sun, with sixteen planets certainly, and possibly a few more, revolving about it at various distances, and attended by seventeen moons assuredly, but _very_ probably by several others—is now to be considered as _an example_ of the innumerable agglomerations which proceeded to take place throughout the universal sphere of atoms on withdrawal of the divine volition. i mean to say that our solar system is to be understood as affording a _generic instance_ of these agglomerations, or, more correctly, of the ulterior conditions at which they arrived. if we keep our attention fixed on the idea of _the utmost possible relation_ as the omnipotent design, and on the precautions taken to accomplish it through difference of form, among the original atoms, and particular inequidistance, we shall find it impossible to suppose for a moment that even any two of the incipient agglomerations reached precisely the same result in the end. we shall rather be inclined to think that _no two_ stellar bodies in the universe—whether suns, planets or moons—are particularly, while _all_ are generally, similar. still less, then, can we imagine any two _assemblages_ of such bodies—any two “systems”—as having more than a general <UNK> our telescopes, at this point, thoroughly confirm our deductions. taking our own solar system, then, as merely a loose or general type of all, we have so far proceeded in our subject as to survey the universe under the aspect of a spherical space, throughout which, dispersed with merely general equability, exist a number of but generally similar _systems_. <UNK> it is not _impossible_ that some unlooked-for optical improvement may disclose to us, among innumerable varieties of systems, a luminous sun, encircled by luminous and non-luminous rings, within and without and between which, revolve luminous and non-luminous planets, attended by moons having moons—and even these latter again having moons. let us now, expanding our conceptions, look upon each of these systems as in itself an atom; which in fact it is, when we consider it as but one of the countless myriads of systems which constitute the universe. regarding all, then, as but colossal atoms, each with the same ineradicable tendency to unity which characterizes the actual atoms of which it consists—we enter at once upon a new order of aggregations. the smaller systems, in the vicinity of a larger one, would, inevitably, be drawn into still closer vicinity. a thousand would assemble here; a million there—perhaps here, again, even a billion—leaving, thus, immeasurable vacancies in space. and if now, it be demanded why, in the case of these systems—of these merely titanic atoms—i speak, simply, of an “assemblage,” and not, as in the case of the actual atoms, of a more or less consolidated agglomeration:—if it be asked, for instance, why i do not carry what i suggest to its legitimate conclusion, and describe, at once, these assemblages of system-atoms as rushing to consolidation in spheres—as each becoming condensed into one magnificent sun—my reply is that μελλοντα ταυτα—i am but pausing, for a moment, on the awful threshold of _the future_. for the present, calling these assemblages “clusters,” we see them in the incipient stages of their consolidation. their _absolute_ consolidation is _to come_. we have now reached a point from which we behold the universe as a spherical space, interspersed, _unequably_, with _clusters_. it will be noticed that i here prefer the adverb “unequably” to the phrase “with a merely general equability,” employed before. it is evident, in fact, that the equability of distribution will diminish in the ratio of the agglomerative processes—that is to say, as the things distributed diminish in number. thus the increase of _in_-equability—an increase which must continue until, sooner or later, an epoch will arrive at which the largest agglomeration will absorb all the others—should be viewed as, simply, a corroborative indication of the _tendency to one_. and here, at length, it seems proper to inquire whether the ascertained _facts_ of astronomy confirm the general arrangement which i have thus, deductively, assigned to the heavens. thoroughly, they _do_. telescopic observation, guided by the laws of perspective, enables us to understand that the perceptible universe exists as _a cluster of clusters, irregularly disposed_. the “clusters” of which this universal “_cluster of clusters_” consists, are merely what we have been in the practice of designating “nebulæ”—and, of these “nebulæ,” _one_ is of paramount interest to mankind. i allude to the galaxy, or milky way. this interests us, first and most obviously, on account of its great superiority in apparent size, not only to any one other cluster in the firmament, but to all the other clusters taken together. the largest of these latter occupies a mere point, comparatively, and is distinctly seen only with the aid of a telescope. the galaxy sweeps throughout the heaven and is brilliantly visible to the naked eye. but it interests man chiefly, although less immediately, on account of its being his home; the home of the earth on which he exists; the home of the sun about which this earth revolves; the home of that “system” of orbs of which the sun is the centre and primary—the earth one of sixteen secondaries, or planets—the moon one of seventeen tertiaries, or satellites. the galaxy, let me repeat, is but one of the _clusters_ which i have been describing—but one of the mis-called “nebulæ” revealed to us—by the telescope alone, sometimes—as faint hazy spots in various quarters of the sky. we have no reason to suppose the milky way _really_ more extensive than the least of these “nebulæ.” its vast superiority in size is but an apparent superiority arising from our position in regard to it—that is to say, from our position in its midst. however strange the assertion may at first appear to those unversed in astronomy, still the astronomer himself has no hesitation in asserting that we are _in the midst_ of that inconceivable host of stars—of suns—of systems—which constitute the galaxy. moreover, not only have _we_—not only has _our_ sun a right to claim the galaxy as its own especial cluster, but, with slight reservation, it may be said that all the distinctly visible stars of the firmament—all the stars visible to the naked eye—have equally a right to claim it as _their_ own. there has been a great deal of misconception in respect to the _shape_ of the galaxy; which, in nearly all our astronomical treatises, is said to resemble that of a capital y. the cluster in question has, in reality, a certain general—_very_ general resemblance to the planet saturn, with its encompassing triple ring. instead of the solid orb of that planet, however, we must picture to ourselves a lenticular star-island, or collection of stars; our sun lying excentrically—near the shore of the island—on that side of it which is nearest the constellation of the cross and farthest from that of cassiopeia. the surrounding ring, where it approaches our position, has in it a longitudinal _gash_, which does, in fact, cause _the ring, in our vicinity_, to assume, loosely, the appearance of a capital y. we must not fall into the error, however, of conceiving the somewhat indefinite girdle as at all _remote_, comparatively speaking, from the also indefinite lenticular cluster which it surrounds; and thus, for mere purpose of explanation, we may speak of our sun as actually situated at that point of the y where its three component lines unite; and, conceiving this letter to be of a certain solidity—of a certain thickness, very trivial in comparison with its length—we may even speak of our position as _in the middle_ of this thickness. fancying ourselves thus placed, we shall no longer find difficulty in accounting for the phænomena presented—which are perspective altogether. when we look upward or downward—that is to say, when we cast our eyes in the direction of the letter’s _thickness_—we look through fewer stars than when we cast them in the direction of its _length_, or _along_ either of the three component lines. of course, in the former case, the stars appear scattered—in the latter, crowded.—to reverse this explanation:—an inhabitant of the earth, when looking, as we commonly express ourselves, _at_ the galaxy, is then beholding it in some of the directions of its length—is looking _along_ the lines of the y—but when, looking out into the general heaven, he turns his eyes _from_ the galaxy, he is then surveying it in the direction of the letter’s thickness; and on this account the stars seem to him scattered; while, in fact, they are as close together, on an average, as in the mass of the cluster. _no_ consideration could be better adapted to convey an idea of this cluster’s stupendous extent. if, with a telescope of high space-penetrating power, we carefully inspect the firmament, we shall become aware of _a belt of clusters_—of what we have hitherto called “nebulæ”—a _band_, of varying breadth, stretching from horizon to horizon, at right angles to the general course of the milky way. this band is the ultimate _cluster of clusters_. this belt is _the universe_. our galaxy is but one, and perhaps one of the most inconsiderable, of the clusters which go to the constitution of this ultimate, universal _belt_ or _band_. the appearance of this cluster of clusters, to our eyes, _as_ a belt or band, is altogether a perspective phænomenon of the same character as that which causes us to behold our own individual and roughly-spherical cluster, the galaxy, under guise also of a belt, traversing the heavens at right angles to the universal one. the shape of the all-inclusive cluster is, of course _generally_, that of each individual cluster which it includes. just as the scattered stars which, on looking _from_ the galaxy, we see in the general sky, are, in fact, but a portion of that galaxy itself, and as closely intermingled with it as any of the telescopic points in what seems the densest portion of its mass—so are the scattered “nebulæ” which, on casting our eyes _from_ the universal _belt_, we perceive at all points of the firmament—so, i say, are these scattered “nebulæ” to be understood as only perspectively scattered, and as part and parcel of the one supreme and universal _sphere_. no astronomical fallacy is more untenable, and none has been more pertinaciously adhered to, than that of the absolute _illimitation_ of the universe of stars. the reasons for limitation, as i have already assigned them, _à priori_, seem to me unanswerable; but, not to speak of these, _observation_ assures us that there is, in numerous directions around us, certainly, if not in all, a positive limit—or, at the very least, affords us no basis whatever for thinking otherwise. were the succession of stars endless, then the background of the sky would present us an uniform luminosity, like that displayed by the galaxy—_since there could be absolutely no point, in all that background, at which would not exist a star._ the only mode, therefore, in which, under such a state of affairs, we could comprehend the _voids_ which our telescopes find in innumerable directions, would be by supposing the distance of the invisible background so immense that no ray from it has yet been able to reach us at all. that this _may_ be so, who shall venture to deny? i maintain, simply, that we have not even the shadow of a reason for believing that it _is_ so. when speaking of the vulgar propensity to regard all bodies on the earth as tending merely to the earth’s centre, i observed that, “with certain exceptions to be specified hereafter, every body on the earth tended not only to the earth’s centre, but in every conceivable direction <UNK> the “exceptions” refer to those frequent gaps in the heavens, where our utmost scrutiny can detect not only no stellar bodies, but no indications of their existence:—where yawning chasms, blacker than erebus, seem to afford us glimpses, through the boundary walls of the universe of stars, into the illimitable universe of vacancy, beyond. now as any body, existing on the earth, chances to pass, either through its own movement or the earth’s, into a line with any one of these voids, or cosmical abysses, it clearly is no longer attracted _in the direction of that void_, and for the moment, consequently, is “heavier” than at any period, either after or before. independently of the consideration of these voids, however, and looking only at the generally unequable distribution of the stars, we see that the absolute tendency of bodies on the earth to the earth’s centre, is in a state of perpetual variation. <UNK> page <UNK> we comprehend, then, the insulation of our universe. we perceive the isolation of _that_—of _all_ that which we grasp with the senses. we know that there exists one _cluster of clusters_—a collection around which, on all sides, extend the immeasurable wildernesses of a space _to all human perception_ untenanted. but _because_ upon the confines of this universe of stars we are compelled to pause, through want of farther evidence from the senses, is it right to conclude that, in fact, there _is_ no material point beyond that which we have thus been permitted to attain? have we, or have we not, an analogical right to the inference that this perceptible universe—that this cluster of clusters—is but one of _a series_ of clusters of clusters, the rest of which are invisible through distance—through the diffusion of their light being so excessive, ere it reaches us, as not to produce upon our retinas a light-impression—or from there being no such emanation as light at all, in these unspeakably distant worlds—or, lastly, from the mere interval being so vast, that the electric tidings of their presence in space, have not yet—through the lapsing myriads of years—been enabled to traverse that interval? have we any right to inferences—have we any ground whatever for visions such as these? if we have a right to them in _any_ degree, we have a right to their infinite extension. the human brain has obviously a leaning to the “_infinite_,” and fondles the phantom of the idea. it seems to long with a passionate fervor for this impossible conception, with the hope of intellectually believing it when conceived. what is general among the whole race of man, of course no individual of that race can be warranted in considering abnormal; nevertheless, there _may_ be a class of superior intelligences, to whom the human bias alluded to may wear all the character of monomania. my question, however, remains unanswered:—have we any right to infer—let us say, rather, to imagine—an interminable succession of the “clusters of clusters,” or of “universes” more or less similar? i reply that the “right,” in a case such as this, depends absolutely upon the hardihood of that imagination which ventures to claim the right. let me declare, only, that, as an individual, i myself feel impelled to the _fancy_—without daring to call it more—that there _does_ exist a _limitless_ succession of universes, more or less similar to that of which we have cognizance—to that of which _alone_ we shall ever have cognizance—at the very least until the return of our own particular universe into unity. _if_ such clusters of clusters exist, however—_and they do_—it is abundantly clear that, having had no part in our origin, they have no portion in our laws. they neither attract us, nor we them. their material—their spirit is not ours—is not that which obtains in any part of our universe. they could not impress our senses or our souls. among them and us—considering all, for the moment, collectively—there are no influences in common. each exists, apart and independently, _in the bosom of its proper and particular god_. in the conduct of this discourse, i am aiming less at physical than at metaphysical order. the clearness with which even material phænomena are presented to the understanding, depends very little, i have long since learned to perceive, upon a merely natural, and almost altogether upon a moral, arrangement. if then i seem to step somewhat too discursively from point to point of my topic, let me suggest that i do so in the hope of thus the better keeping unbroken that chain of _graduated impression_ by which alone the intellect of man can expect to encompass the grandeurs of which i speak, and, in their majestic totality, to comprehend them. so far, our attention has been directed, almost exclusively, to a general and relative grouping of the stellar bodies in space. of specification there has been little; and whatever ideas of _quantity_ have been conveyed—that is to say, of number, magnitude, and distance—have been conveyed incidentally and by way of preparation for more definitive conceptions. these latter let us now attempt to entertain. our solar system, as has been already mentioned, consists, in chief, of one sun and sixteen planets certainly, but in all probability a few others, revolving around it as a centre, and attended by seventeen moons of which we know, with possibly several more of which as yet we know nothing. these various bodies are not true spheres, but oblate spheroids—spheres flattened at the poles of the imaginary axes about which they rotate:—the flattening being a consequence of the rotation. neither is the sun absolutely the centre of the system; for this sun itself, with all the planets, revolves about a perpetually shifting point of space, which is the system’s general centre of gravity. neither are we to consider the paths through which these different spheroids move—the moons about the planets, the planets about the sun, or the sun about the common centre—as circles in an accurate sense. they are, in fact, _ellipses—one of the foci being the point about which the revolution is made_. an ellipse is a curve, returning into itself, one of whose diameters is longer than the other. in the longer diameter are two points, equidistant from the middle of the line, and so situated otherwise that if, from each of them a straight line be drawn to any one point of the curve, the two lines, taken together, will be equal to the longer diameter itself. now let us conceive such an ellipse. at one of the points mentioned, which are the _foci_, let us fasten an orange. by an elastic thread let us connect this orange with a pea; and let us place this latter on the circumference of the ellipse. let us now move the pea continuously around the orange—keeping always on the circumference of the ellipse. the elastic thread, which, of course, varies in length as we move the pea, will form what in geometry is called a _radius vector_. now, if the orange be understood as the sun, and the pea as a planet revolving about it, then the revolution should be made at such a rate—with a velocity so varying—that the _radius vector_ may pass over _equal areas of space in equal times_. the progress of the pea _should be_—in other words, the progress of the planet _is_, of course,—slow in proportion to its distance from the sun—swift in proportion to its proximity. those planets, moreover, move the more slowly which are the farther from the sun; _the squares of their periods of revolution having the same proportion to each other, as have to each other the cubes of their mean distances from the sun_. the wonderfully complex laws of revolution here described, however, are not to be understood as obtaining in our system alone. they _everywhere_ prevail where attraction prevails. they control _the universe_. every shining speck in the firmament is, no doubt, a luminous sun, resembling our own, at least in its general features, and having in attendance upon it a greater or less number of planets, greater or less, whose still lingering luminosity is not sufficient to render them visible to us at so vast a distance, but which, nevertheless, revolve, moon-attended, about their starry centres, in obedience to the principles just detailed—in obedience to the three omniprevalent laws of revolution—the three immortal laws _guessed_ by the imaginative kepler, and but subsequently demonstrated and accounted for by the patient and mathematical newton. among a tribe of philosophers who pride themselves excessively upon matter-of-fact, it is far too fashionable to sneer at all speculation under the comprehensive _sobriquet_, “guess-work.” the point to be considered is, _who_ guesses. in guessing with plato, we spend our time to better purpose, now and then, than in hearkening to a demonstration by alcmæon. in many works on astronomy i find it distinctly stated that the laws of kepler are _the basis_ of the great principle, gravitation. this idea must have arisen from the fact that the suggestion of these laws by kepler, and his proving them _à posteriori_ to have an actual existence, led newton to account for them by the hypothesis of gravitation, and, finally, to demonstrate them _à priori_, as necessary consequences of the hypothetical principle. thus so far from the laws of kepler being the basis of gravity, gravity is the basis of these laws—as it is, indeed, of all the laws of the material universe which are not referable to repulsion alone. the mean distance of the earth from the moon—that is to say, from the heavenly body in our closest vicinity—is <UNK> miles. mercury, the planet nearest the sun, is distant from him <UNK> millions of miles. venus, the next, revolves at a distance of <UNK> millions:—the earth, which comes next, at a distance of <UNK> millions:—mars, then, at a distance of <UNK> millions. now come the eight asteroids (ceres, juno, vesta, pallas, astræa, flora, iris, and hebe) at an average distance of about <UNK> millions. then we have jupiter, distant <UNK> millions; then saturn, <UNK> millions; then uranus, <UNK> hundred millions; finally neptune, lately discovered, and revolving at a distance, say of <UNK> hundred millions. leaving neptune out of the account—of which as yet we know little accurately and which is, possibly, one of a system of asteroids—it will be seen that, within certain limits, there exists an _order of interval_ among the planets. speaking loosely, we may say that each outer planet is twice as far from the sun as is the next inner one. may not the _order_ here mentioned—_may not the law of bode—be deduced from consideration of the analogy suggested by me as having place between the solar discharge of rings and the mode of the atomic irradiation_? the numbers hurriedly mentioned in this summary of distance, it is folly to attempt comprehending, unless in the light of abstract arithmetical facts. they are not practically tangible ones. they convey no precise ideas. i have stated that neptune, the planet farthest from the sun, revolves about him at a distance of <UNK> hundred millions of miles. so far good:—i have stated a mathematical fact; and, without comprehending it in the least, we may put it to use—mathematically. but in mentioning, even, that the moon revolves about the earth at the comparatively trifling distance of <UNK> miles, i entertained no expectation of giving any one to understand—to know—to feel—how far from the earth the moon actually _is_. <UNK> _miles_! there are, perhaps, few of my readers who have not crossed the atlantic ocean; yet how many of them have a distinct idea of even the <UNK> miles intervening between shore and shore? i doubt, indeed, whether the man lives who can force into his brain the most remote conception of the interval between one milestone and its next neighbor upon the turnpike. we are in some measure aided, however, in our consideration of distance, by combining this consideration with the kindred one of velocity. sound passes through <UNK> feet of space in a second of time. now were it possible for an inhabitant of the earth to see the flash of a cannon discharged in the moon, and to hear the report, he would have to wait, after perceiving the former, more than <UNK> entire days and nights before getting any intimation of the latter. however feeble be the impression, even thus conveyed, of the moon’s real distance from the earth, it will, nevertheless, effect a good object in enabling us more clearly to see the futility of attempting to grasp such intervals as that of the <UNK> hundred millions of miles between our sun and neptune; or even that of the <UNK> millions between the sun and the earth we inhabit. a cannon-ball, flying at the greatest velocity with which such a ball has ever been known to fly, could not traverse the latter interval in less than <UNK> years; while for the former it would require <UNK> our moon’s real diameter is <UNK> miles; yet she is comparatively so trifling an object that it would take nearly <UNK> such orbs to compose one as great as the earth. the diameter of our own globe is <UNK> miles—but from the enunciation of these numbers what positive idea do we derive? if we ascend an ordinary mountain and look around us from its summit, we behold a landscape stretching, say <UNK> miles, in every direction; forming a circle <UNK> miles in circumference; and including an area of <UNK> square miles. the extent of such a prospect, on account of the _successiveness_ with which its portions necessarily present themselves to view, can be only very feebly and very partially appreciated:—yet the entire panorama would comprehend no more than one <UNK> part of the mere _surface_ of our globe. were this panorama, then, to be succeeded, after the lapse of an hour, by another of equal extent; this again by a third, after the lapse of another hour; this again by a fourth after lapse of another hour—and so on, until the scenery of the whole earth were exhausted; and were we to be engaged in examining these various panoramas for twelve hours of every day; we should nevertheless, be <UNK> years and <UNK> days in completing the general survey. but if the mere surface of the earth eludes the grasp of the imagination, what are we to think of its cubical contents? it embraces a mass of matter equal in weight to at least <UNK> sextillions, <UNK> quintillions of tons. let us suppose it in a state of quiescence; and now let us endeavor to conceive a mechanical force sufficient to set it in motion! not the strength of all the myriads of beings whom we may conclude to inhabit the planetary worlds of our system—not the combined physical strength of _all_ these beings—even admitting all to be more powerful than man—would avail to stir the ponderous mass _a single inch_ from its position. what are we to understand, then, of the force, which under similar circumstances, would be required to move the _largest_ of our planets, jupiter? this is <UNK> miles in diameter, and would include within its periphery more than a thousand orbs of the magnitude of our own. yet this stupendous body is actually flying around the sun at the rate of <UNK> miles an hour—that is to say, with a velocity <UNK> times greater than that of a cannon-ball! the thought of such a phænomenon cannot well be said to _startle_ the mind:—it palsies and appals it. not unfrequently we task our imagination in picturing the capacities of an angel. let us fancy such a being at a distance of some hundred miles from jupiter—a close eye-witness of this planet as it speeds on its annual revolution. now _can_ we, i demand, fashion for ourselves any conception so distinct of this ideal being’s spiritual exaltation, as _that_ involved in the supposition that, even by this immeasurable mass of matter, whirled immediately before his eyes, with a velocity so unutterable, he—an angel—angelic though he be—is not at once struck into nothingness and overwhelmed? at this point, however, it seems proper to suggest that, in fact, we have been speaking of comparative trifles. our sun, the central and controlling orb of the system to which jupiter belongs, is not only greater than jupiter, but greater by far than all the planets of the system taken together. this fact is an essential condition, indeed, of the stability of the system itself. the diameter of jupiter has been mentioned:—it is <UNK> miles:—that of the sun is <UNK> miles. an inhabitant of the latter, travelling <UNK> miles a day, would be more than <UNK> years in going round a great circle of its circumference. it occupies a cubical space of <UNK> quadrillions, <UNK> trillions of miles. the moon, as has been stated, revolves about the earth at a distance of <UNK> miles—in an orbit, consequently, of nearly a million and a half. now, were the sun placed upon the earth, centre over centre, the body of the former would extend, in every direction, not only to the line of the moon’s orbit, but beyond it, a distance of <UNK> miles. and here, once again, let me suggest that, in fact, we have _still_ been speaking of comparative trifles. the distance of the planet neptune from the sun has been stated:—it is <UNK> hundred millions of miles; the circumference of its orbit, therefore, is about <UNK> billions. let this be borne in mind while we glance at some one of the brightest stars. between this and the star of _our_ system, (the sun,) there is a gulf of space, to convey any idea of which we should need the tongue of an archangel. from _our_ system, then, and from _our_ sun, or star, the star at which we suppose ourselves glancing is a thing altogether apart:—still, for the moment, let us imagine it placed upon our sun, centre over centre, as we just now imagined this sun itself placed upon the earth. let us now conceive the particular star we have in mind, extending, in every direction, beyond the orbit of mercury—of venus—of the earth:—still _on_, beyond the orbit of mars—of jupiter—of uranus—until, finally, we fancy it filling the <UNK> _billions of miles in circumference_—which is described by the revolution of leverrier’s planet. when we have conceived all this, we shall have entertained no extravagant conception. there is the very best reason for believing that many of the stars are even far larger than the one we have imagined. i mean to say that we have the very best _empirical_ basis for such belief:—and, in looking back at the original, atomic arrangements for _diversity_, which have been assumed as a part of the divine plan in the constitution of the universe, we shall be enabled easily to understand, and to credit, the existence of even far vaster disproportions in stellar size than any to which i have hitherto alluded. the largest orbs, of course, we must expect to find rolling through the widest vacancies of space. i remarked, just now, that to convey an idea of the interval between our sun and any one of the other stars, we should require the eloquence of an archangel. in so saying, i should not be accused of exaggeration; for, in simple truth, these are topics on which it is scarcely possible to exaggerate. but let us bring the matter more distinctly before the eye of the mind. in the first place, we may get a general, _relative_ conception of the interval referred to, by comparing it with the inter-planetary spaces. if, for example, we suppose the earth, which is, in reality, <UNK> millions of miles from the sun, to be only _one foot_ from that luminary; then neptune would be <UNK> feet distant; _and the star alpha lyræ, at the very least_, <UNK> now i presume that, in the termination of my last sentence, few of my readers have noticed anything especially objectionable—particularly wrong. i said that the distance of the earth from the sun being taken at _one foot_, the distance of neptune would be <UNK> feet, and that of alpha lyræ, <UNK> the proportion between one foot and <UNK> has appeared, perhaps, to convey a sufficiently definite impression of the proportion between the two intervals—that of the earth from the sun and that of alpha lyræ from the same luminary. but my account of the matter should, in reality, have run thus:—the distance of the earth from the sun being taken at one foot, the distance of neptune would be <UNK> feet, and that of alpha lyræ, <UNK> is to say, i had assigned to alpha lyræ, in my first statement of the case, only the <UNK> _part_ of that distance which is the _least distance possible_ at which it can actually lie. to proceed:—however distant a mere _planet_ is, yet when we look at it through a telescope, we see it under a certain form—of a certain appreciable size. now i have already hinted at the probable bulk of many of the stars; nevertheless, when we view any one of them, even through the most powerful telescope, it is found to present us with _no form_, and consequently with _no magnitude_ whatever. we see it as a point and nothing more. again;—let us suppose ourselves walking, at night, on a highway. in a field on one side of the road, is a line of tall objects, say trees, the figures of which are distinctly defined against the background of the sky. this line of objects extends at right angles to the road, and from the road to the horizon. now, as we proceed along the road, we see these objects changing their positions, respectively, in relation to a certain fixed point in that portion of the firmament which forms the background of the view. let us suppose this fixed point—sufficiently fixed for our purpose—to be the rising moon. we become aware, at once, that while the tree nearest us so far alters its position in respect to the moon, as to seem flying behind us, the tree in the extreme distance has scarcely changed at all its relative position with the satellite. we then go on to perceive that the farther the objects are from us, the less they alter their positions; and the converse. then we begin, unwittingly, to estimate the distances of individual trees by the degrees in which they evince the relative alteration. finally, we come to understand how it might be possible to ascertain the actual distance of any given tree in the line, by using the amount of relative alteration as a basis in a simple geometrical problem. now this relative alteration is what we call “parallax;” and by parallax we calculate the distances of the heavenly bodies. applying the principle to the trees in question, we should, of course, be very much at a loss to comprehend the distance of _that_ tree, which, however far we proceeded along the road, should evince _no_ parallax at all. this, in the case described, is a thing impossible; but impossible only because all distances on our earth are trivial indeed:—in comparison with the vast cosmical quantities, we may speak of them as absolutely nothing. now, let us suppose the star alpha lyræ directly overhead; and let us imagine that, instead of standing on the earth, we stand at one end of a straight road stretching through space to a distance equalling the diameter of the earth’s orbit—that is to say, to a distance of <UNK> _millions of miles_. having observed, by means of the most delicate micrometrical instruments, the exact position of the star, let us now pass along this inconceivable road, until we reach its other extremity. now, once again, let us look at the star. it is _precisely_ where we left it. our instruments, however delicate, assure us that its relative position is absolutely—is identically the same as at the commencement of our unutterable journey. _no_ parallax—none whatever—has been found. the fact is, that, in regard to the distance of the fixed stars—of any one of the myriads of suns glistening on the farther side of that awful chasm which separates our system from its brothers in the cluster to which it belongs—astronomical science, until very lately, could speak only with a negative certainty. assuming the brightest as the nearest, we could say, even of _them_, only that there is a certain incomprehensible distance on the _hither_ side of which they cannot be:—how far they are beyond it we had in no case been able to ascertain. we perceived, for example, that alpha lyræ cannot be nearer to us than <UNK> trillions, <UNK> billions of miles; but, for all we knew, and indeed for all we now know, it may be distant from us the square, or the cube, or any other power of the number mentioned. by dint, however, of wonderfully minute and cautious observations, continued, with novel instruments, for many laborious years, _bessel_, not long ago deceased, has lately succeeded in determining the distance of six or seven stars; among others, that of the star numbered <UNK> in the constellation of the swan. the distance in this latter instance ascertained, is <UNK> times that of the sun; which last it will be remembered, is <UNK> millions of miles. the star <UNK> cygni, then, is nearly <UNK> trillions of miles from us—or more than three times the distance assigned, _as the least possible_, for alpha lyræ. in attempting to appreciate this interval by the aid of any considerations of _velocity_, as we did in endeavoring to estimate the distance of the moon, we must leave out of sight, altogether, such nothings as the speed of a cannon-ball, or of sound. light, however, according to the latest calculations of struve, proceeds at the rate of <UNK> miles in a second. thought itself cannot pass through this interval more speedily—if, indeed, thought can traverse it at all. yet, in coming from <UNK> cygni to us, even at this inconceivable rate, light occupies more than _ten years_; and, consequently, were the star this moment blotted out from the universe, still, _for ten years_, would it continue to sparkle on, undimmed in its paradoxical glory. keeping now in mind whatever feeble conception we may have attained of the interval between our sun and <UNK> cygni, let us remember that this interval, however unutterably vast, we are permitted to consider as but the _average_ interval among the countless host of stars composing that cluster, or “nebula,” to which our system, as well as that of <UNK> cygni, belongs. i have, in fact, stated the case with great moderation:—we have excellent reason for believing <UNK> cygni to be one of the _nearest_ stars, and thus for concluding, at least for the present, that its distance from us is _less_ than the average distance between star and star in the magnificent cluster of the milky way. and here, once again and finally, it seems proper to suggest that even as yet we have been speaking of trifles. ceasing to wonder at the space between star and star in our own or in any particular cluster, let us rather turn our thoughts to the intervals between cluster and cluster, in the all comprehensive cluster of the universe. i have already said that light proceeds at the rate of <UNK> miles in a second—that is, about <UNK> millions of miles in a minute, or about <UNK> millions of miles in an hour:—yet so far removed from us are some of the “nebulæ” that even light, speeding with this velocity, could not and does not reach us, from those mysterious regions, in less than <UNK> _millions of years_. this calculation, moreover, is made by the elder herschell, and in reference merely to those comparatively proximate clusters within the scope of his own telescope. there _are_ “nebulæ,” however, which, through the magical tube of lord rosse, are this instant whispering in our ears the secrets of _a million of ages_ by-gone. in a word, the events which we behold now—at this moment—in those worlds—are the identical events which interested their inhabitants _ten hundred thousand centuries ago_. in intervals—in distances such as this suggestion forces upon the _soul_—rather than upon the mind—we find, at length, a fitting climax to all hitherto frivolous considerations of _quantity_. our fancies thus occupied with the cosmical distances, let us take the opportunity of referring to the difficulty which we have so often experienced, while pursuing _the beaten path_ of astronomical reflection, _in accounting_ for the immeasurable voids alluded to—in comprehending why chasms so totally unoccupied and therefore apparently so needless, have been made to intervene between star and star—between cluster and cluster—in understanding, to be brief, a sufficient reason for the titanic scale, in respect of mere _space_, on which the universe is seen to be constructed. a rational cause for the phænomenon, i maintain that astronomy has palpably failed to assign:—but the considerations through which, in this essay, we have proceeded step by step, enable us clearly and immediately to perceive that _space and duration are one_. that the universe might _endure_ throughout an æra at all commensurate with the grandeur of its component material portions and with the high majesty of its spiritual purposes, it was necessary that the original atomic diffusion be made to so inconceivable an extent as to be only not infinite. it was required, in a word, that the stars should be gathered into visibility from invisible nebulosity—proceed from nebulosity to consolidation—and so grow grey in giving birth and death to unspeakably numerous and complex variations of vitalic development:—it was required that the stars should do all this—should have time thoroughly to accomplish all these divine purposes—_during the period_ in which all things were effecting their return into unity with a velocity accumulating in the inverse proportion of the squares of the distances at which lay the inevitable end. throughout all this we have no difficulty in understanding the absolute accuracy of the divine _adaptation_. the density of the stars, respectively, proceeds, of course, as their condensation diminishes; condensation and heterogeneity keep pace with each other; through the latter, which is the index of the former, we estimate the vitalic and spiritual development. thus, in the density of the globes, we have the measure in which their purposes are fulfilled. _as_ density proceeds—_as_ the divine intentions _are_ accomplished—_as_ less and still less remains _to be_ accomplished—so—in the same ratio—should we expect to find an acceleration of _the end_:—and thus the philosophical mind will easily comprehend that the divine designs in constituting the stars, advance _mathematically_ to their fulfilment:—and more; it will readily give the advance a mathematical expression; it will decide that this advance is inversely proportional with the squares of the distances of all created things from the starting-point and goal of their creation. not only is this divine adaptation, however, mathematically accurate, but there is that about it which stamps it _as divine_, in distinction from that which is merely the work of human constructiveness. i allude to the complete _mutuality_ of adaptation. for example; in human constructions a particular cause has a particular effect; a particular intention brings to pass a particular object; but this is all; we see no reciprocity. the effect does not re-act upon the cause; the intention does not change relations with the object. in divine constructions the object is either design or object as we choose to regard it—and we may take at any time a cause for an effect, or the converse—so that we can never absolutely decide which is which. to give an instance:—in polar climates the human frame, to maintain its animal heat, requires, for combustion in the capillary system, an abundant supply of highly azotized food, such as train-oil. but again:—in polar climates nearly the sole food afforded man is the oil of abundant seals and whales. now, whether is oil at hand because imperatively demanded, or the only thing demanded because the only thing to be obtained? it is impossible to decide. there is an absolute _reciprocity of adaptation_. the pleasure which we derive from any display of human ingenuity is in the ratio of _the approach_ to this species of reciprocity. in the construction of _plot_, for example, in fictitious literature, we should aim at so arranging the incidents that we shall not be able to determine, of any one of them, whether it depends from any one other or upholds it. in this sense, of course, _perfection_ of _plot_ is really, or practically, unattainable—but only because it is a finite intelligence that constructs. the plots of god are perfect. the universe is a plot of god. and now we have reached a point at which the intellect is forced, again, to struggle against its propensity for analogical inference—against its monomaniac grasping at the infinite. moons have been seen _revolving_ about planets; planets about stars; and the poetical instinct of humanity—its instinct of the symmetrical, if the symmetry be but a symmetry of surface:—this _instinct_, which the soul, not only of man but of all created beings, took up, in the beginning, from the _geometrical_ basis of the universal irradiation—impels us to the fancy of an endless extension of this system of _cycles_. closing our eyes equally to _de_duction and _in_duction, we insist upon imagining a _revolution_ of all the orbs of the galaxy about some gigantic globe which we take to be the central pivot of the whole. each cluster in the great cluster of clusters is imagined, of course, to be similarly supplied and constructed; while, that the “analogy” may be wanting at no point, we go on to conceive these clusters themselves, again, as _revolving_ about some still more august sphere;—this latter, still again, _with_ its encircling clusters, as but one of a yet more magnificent series of agglomerations, _gyrating_ about yet another orb central _to them_—some orb still more unspeakably sublime—some orb, let us rather say, of infinite sublimity endlessly multiplied by the infinitely sublime. such are the conditions, continued in perpetuity, which the voice of what some people term “analogy” calls upon the fancy to depict and the reason to contemplate, if possible, without becoming dissatisfied with the picture. such, _in general_, are the interminable gyrations beyond gyration which we have been instructed by philosophy to comprehend and to account for, at least in the best manner we can. now and then, however, a philosopher proper—one whose phrenzy takes a very determinate turn—whose genius, to speak more reverentially, has a strongly-pronounced washerwomanish bias, doing every thing up by the dozen—enables us to see _precisely_ that point out of sight, at which the revolutionary processes in question do, and of right ought to, come to an end. it is hardly worth while, perhaps, even to sneer at the reveries of fourrier:—but much has been said, latterly, of the hypothesis of mädler—that there exists, in the centre of the galaxy, a stupendous globe about which all the systems of the cluster revolve. the _period_ of our own, indeed, has been <UNK> millions of years. that our sun has a motion in space, independently of its rotation, and revolution about the system’s centre of gravity, has long been suspected. this motion, granting it to exist, would be manifested perspectively. the stars in that firmamental region which we were leaving behind us, would, in a very long series of years, become crowded; those in the opposite quarter, scattered. now, by means of astronomical history, we ascertain, cloudily, that some such phænomena have occurred. on this ground it has been declared that our system is moving to a point in the heavens diametrically opposite the star zeta herculis:—but this inference is, perhaps, the maximum to which we have any logical right. mädler, however, has gone so far as to designate a particular star, alcyone in the pleiades, as being at or about the very spot around which a general _revolution_ is performed. now, since by “analogy” we are led, in the first instance, to these dreams, it is no more than proper that we should abide by analogy, at least in some measure, during their development; and that analogy which suggests the revolution, suggests at the same time a central orb about which it should be performed:—so far the astronomer was consistent. this central orb, however, should, dynamically, be greater than all the orbs, taken together, which surround it. of these there are about <UNK> millions. “why, then,” it was of course demanded, “do we not _see_ this vast central sun—_at least equal_ in mass to <UNK> millions of such suns as ours—why do we not _see_ it—_we_, especially, who occupy the mid region of the cluster—the very locality _near_ which, at all events, must be situated this incomparable star?” the reply was ready—“it must be non-luminous, as are our planets.” here, then, to suit a purpose, analogy is suddenly let fall. “not so,” it may be said—“we know that non-luminous suns actually exist.” it is true that we have reason at least for supposing so; but we have certainly no reason whatever for supposing that the non-luminous suns in question are encircled by _luminous_ suns, while these again are surrounded by non-luminous planets:—and it is precisely all this with which mädler is called upon to find any thing analogous in the heavens—for it is precisely all this which he imagines in the case of the galaxy. admitting the thing to be so, we cannot help here picturing to ourselves how sad a puzzle the _why it is so_ must prove to all _à priori_ philosophers. but granting, in the very teeth of analogy and of every thing else, the non-luminosity of the vast central orb, we may still inquire how this orb, so enormous, could fail of being rendered visible by the flood of light thrown upon it from the <UNK> millions of glorious suns glaring in all directions about it. upon the urging of this question, the idea of an actually solid central sun appears, in some measure, to have been abandoned; and speculation proceeded to assert that the systems of the cluster perform their revolutions merely about an immaterial centre of gravity common to all. here again then, to suit a purpose, analogy is let fall. the planets of our system revolve, it is true, about a common centre of gravity; but they do this in connexion with, and in consequence of, a material sun whose mass more than counterbalances the rest of the system. the mathematical circle is a curve composed of an infinity of straight lines. but this idea of the circle—an idea which, in view of all ordinary geometry, is merely the mathematical, as contradistinguished from the practical, idea—is, in sober fact, the _practical_ conception which alone we have any right to entertain in regard to the majestic circle with which we have to deal, at least in fancy, when we suppose our system revolving about a point in the centre of the galaxy. let the most vigorous of human imaginations attempt but to take a single step towards the comprehension of a sweep so ineffable! it would scarcely be paradoxical to say that a flash of lightning itself, travelling _forever_ upon the circumference of this unutterable circle, would still, _forever_, be travelling in a straight line. that the path of our sun in such an orbit would, to any human perception, deviate in the slightest degree from a straight line, even in a million of years, is a proposition not to be entertained:—yet we are required to believe that a curvature has become apparent during the brief period of our astronomical history—during a mere point—during the utter nothingness of two or three thousand years. it may be said that mädler _has_ really ascertained a curvature in the direction of our system’s now well-established progress through space. admitting, if necessary, this fact to be in reality such, i maintain that nothing is thereby shown except the reality of this fact—the fact of a curvature. for its _thorough_ determination, ages will be required; and, when determined, it will be found indicative of some binary or other multiple relation between our sun and some one or more of the proximate stars. i hazard nothing however, in predicting, that, after the lapse of many centuries, all efforts at determining the path of our sun through space, will be abandoned as fruitless. this is easily conceivable when we look at the infinity of perturbation it must experience, from its perpetually-shifting relations with other orbs, in the common approach of all to the nucleus of the galaxy. but in examining other “nebulæ” than that of the milky way—in surveying, generally, the clusters which overspread the heavens—do we or do we not find confirmation of mädler’s hypothesis? we do _not_. the forms of the clusters are exceedingly diverse when casually viewed; but on close inspection, through powerful telescopes, we recognize the sphere, very distinctly, as at least the proximate form of all:—their constitution, in general, being at variance with the idea of revolution about a common centre. “it is difficult,” says sir john herschell, “to form any conception of the dynamical state of such systems. on one hand, without a rotary motion and a centrifugal force, it is hardly possible not to regard them as in a state of _progressive collapse_. on the other, granting such a motion and such a force, we find it no less difficult to reconcile their forms with the rotation of the whole system [meaning cluster] around any single axis, without which internal collision would appear to be inevitable.” some remarks lately made about the “nebulæ” by dr. nichol, in taking quite a different view of the cosmical conditions from any taken in this discourse—have a very peculiar applicability to the point now at issue. he says: “when our greatest telescopes are brought to bear upon them, we find that those which were thought to be irregular, are not so; they approach nearer to a globe. here is one that looked oval; but lord rosse’s telescope brought it into a circle.... now there occurs a very remarkable circumstance in reference to these comparatively sweeping circular masses of nebulæ. we find they are not entirely circular, but the reverse; and that all around them, on every side, there are volumes of stars, _stretching out apparently as if they were rushing towards a great central mass in consequence of the action of some great <UNK> <UNK> i must be understood as denying, _especially_, only the _revolutionary_ portion of mädler’s hypothesis. of course, if no great central orb exists _now_ in our cluster, such will exist hereafter. whenever existing, it will be merely the _nucleus_ of the consolidation. were i to describe, in my own words, what must necessarily be the existing condition of each nebula on the hypothesis that all matter is, as i suggest, now returning to its original unity, i should simply be going over, nearly verbatim, the language here employed by dr. nichol, without the faintest suspicion of that stupendous truth which is the key to these nebular phænomena. and here let me fortify my position still farther, by the voice of a greater than mädler—of one, moreover, to whom all the data of mädler have long been familiar things, carefully and thoroughly considered. referring to the elaborate calculations of argelander—the very researches which form mädler’s basis—_humboldt_, whose generalizing powers have never, perhaps been equalled, has the following observation: “when we regard the real, proper, or non-perspective motions of the stars, we find _many groups of them moving in opposite directions_; and the data as yet in hand render it not necessary, at least, to conceive that the systems composing the milky way, or the clusters, generally, composing the universe, are revolving about any particular centre unknown, whether luminous or non-luminous. it is but man’s longing for a fundamental first cause, that impels both his intellect and his fancy to the adoption of such an <UNK> <UNK> betrachtet man die nicht perspectivischen eigenen bewegungen der sterne, so scheinen viele gruppenweise in ihrer richtung entgegengesetzt; und die bisher gesammelten thatsachen machen es auf’s wenigste nicht nothwendig, anzunehmen, dass alle theile unserer sternenschicht oder gar der gesammten sterneninseln, welche den weltraum füllen, sich um einen grossen, unbekannten, leuchtenden oder dunkeln centralkörper bewegen. das streben nach den letzten und höchsten grundursachen macht freilich die reflectirende thätigkeit des menschen, wie seine phantasie, zu einer solchen annahme geneigt. the phænomenon here alluded to—that of “many groups moving in opposite directions”—is quite inexplicable by mädler’s idea; but arises, as a necessary consequence, from that which forms the basis of this discourse. while the _merely general direction_ of each atom—of each moon, planet, star, or cluster—would, on my hypothesis, be, of course, absolutely rectilinear; while the _general_ path of all bodies would be a right line leading to the centre of all; it is clear, nevertheless, that this general rectilinearity would be compounded of what, with scarcely any exaggeration, we may term an infinity of particular curves—an infinity of local deviations from rectilinearity—the result of continuous differences of relative position among the multitudinous masses, as each proceeded on its own proper journey to the end. i quoted, just now, from sir john herschell, the following words, used in reference to the clusters:—“on one hand, without a rotary motion and a centrifugal force, it is hardly possible not to regard them as in a state of _progressive collapse_.” the fact is, that, in surveying the “nebulæ” with a telescope of high power, we shall find it quite impossible, having once conceived this idea of “collapse,” not to gather, at all points, corroboration of the idea. a nucleus is always apparent, in the direction of which the stars seem to be precipitating themselves; nor can these nuclei be mistaken for merely perspective phænomena:—the clusters are _really_ denser near the centre—sparser in the regions more remote from it. in a word, we see every thing as we _should_ see it were a collapse taking place; but, in general, it may be said of these clusters, that we can fairly entertain, while looking at them, the idea of _orbitual movement about a centre_, only by admitting the _possible_ existence, in the distant domains of space, of dynamical laws with which _we_ are unacquainted. on the part of herschell, however, there is evidently _a reluctance_ to regard the nebulæ as in “a state of progressive collapse.” but if facts—if even appearances justify the supposition of their being in this state, _why_, it may well be demanded, is he disinclined to admit it? simply on account of a prejudice;—merely because the supposition is at war with a preconceived and utterly baseless notion—that of the endlessness—that of the eternal stability of the universe. if the propositions of this discourse are tenable, the “state of progressive collapse” is _precisely_ that state in which alone we are warranted in considering all things; and, with due humility, let me here confess that, for my part, i am at a loss to conceive how any _other_ understanding of the existing condition of affairs, could ever have made its way into the human brain. “the tendency to collapse” and “the attraction of gravitation” are convertible phrases. in using either, we speak of the rëaction of the first act. never was necessity less obvious than that of supposing matter imbued with an ineradicable _quality_ forming part of its material nature—a quality, or instinct, _forever_ inseparable from it, and by dint of which inalienable principle every atom is _perpetually_ impelled to seek its fellow-atom. never was necessity less obvious than that of entertaining this unphilosophical idea. going boldly behind the vulgar thought, we have to conceive, metaphysically, that the gravitating principle appertains to matter _temporarily_—only while diffused—only while existing as many instead of as one—appertains to it by virtue of its state of irradiation alone—appertains, in a word, altogether to its _condition_, and not in the slightest degree to _itself_. in this view, when the irradiation shall have returned into its source—when the rëaction shall be completed—the gravitating principle will no longer exist. and, in fact, astronomers, without at any time reaching the idea here suggested, seem to have been approximating it, in the assertion that “if there were but one body in the universe, it would be impossible to understand how the principle, gravity, could obtain:”—that is to say, from a consideration of matter as they find it, they reach a conclusion at which i deductively arrive. that so pregnant a suggestion as the one just quoted should have been permitted to remain so long unfruitful, is, nevertheless, a mystery which i find it difficult to fathom. it is, perhaps, in no little degree, however, our propensity for the continuous—for the analogical—in the present case more particularly for the symmetrical—which has been leading us astray. and, in fact, the sense of the symmetrical is an instinct which may be depended upon with an almost blindfold reliance. it is the poetical essence of the universe—_of the universe_ which, in the supremeness of its symmetry, is but the most sublime of poems. now symmetry and consistency are convertible terms:—thus poetry and truth are one. a thing is consistent in the ratio of its truth—true in the ratio of its consistency. _a perfect consistency, i repeat, can be nothing but an absolute truth._ we may take it for granted, then, that man cannot long or widely err, if he suffer himself to be guided by his poetical, which i have maintained to be his truthful, in being his symmetrical, instinct. he must have a care, however, lest, in pursuing too heedlessly the superficial symmetry of forms and motions, he leave out of sight the really essential symmetry of the principles which determine and control them. that the stellar bodies would finally be merged in one—that, at last, all would be drawn into the substance of _one stupendous central orb already existing_—is an idea which, for some time past, seems, vaguely and indeterminately, to have held possession of the fancy of mankind. it is an idea, in fact, which belongs to the class of the _excessively obvious_. it springs, instantly, from a superficial observation of the cyclic and seemingly _gyrating_, or _vorticial_ movements of those individual portions of the universe which come most immediately and most closely under our observation. there is not, perhaps, a human being, of ordinary education and of average reflective capacity, to whom, at some period, the fancy in question has not occurred, as if spontaneously, or intuitively, and wearing all the character of a very profound and very original conception. this conception, however, so commonly entertained, has never, within my knowledge, arisen out of any abstract considerations. being, on the contrary, always suggested, as i say, by the vorticial movements about centres, a reason for it, also,—a _cause_ for the ingathering of all the orbs into one, _imagined to be already existing_, was naturally sought in the same direction—among these cyclic movements themselves. thus it happened that, on announcement of the gradual and perfectly regular decrease observed in the orbit of enck’s comet, at every successive revolution about our sun, astronomers were nearly unanimous in the opinion that the cause in question was found—that a principle was discovered sufficient to account, physically, for that final, universal agglomeration which, i repeat, the analogical, symmetrical or poetical instinct of man had predetermined to understand as something more than a simple hypothesis. this cause—this sufficient reason for the final ingathering—was declared to exist in an exceedingly rare but still material medium pervading space; which medium, by retarding, in some degree, the progress of the comet, perpetually weakened its tangential force; thus giving a predominance to the centripetal; which, of course, drew the comet nearer and nearer at each revolution, and would eventually precipitate it upon the sun. all this was strictly logical—admitting the medium or ether; but this ether was assumed, most illogically, on the ground that no _other_ mode than the one spoken of could be discovered, of accounting for the observed decrease in the orbit of the comet:—as if from the fact that we could _discover_ no other mode of accounting for it, it followed, in any respect, that no other mode of accounting for it existed. it is clear that innumerable causes might operate, in combination, to diminish the orbit, without even a possibility of our ever becoming acquainted with one of them. in the meantime, it has never been fairly shown, perhaps, why the retardation occasioned by the skirts of the sun’s atmosphere, through which the comet passes at perihelion, is not enough to account for the phænomenon. that enck’s comet will be absorbed into the sun, is probable; that all the comets of the system will be absorbed, is more than merely possible; but, in such case, the principle of absorption must be referred to eccentricity of orbit—to the close approximation to the sun, of the comets at their perihelia; and is a principle not affecting, in any degree, the ponderous _spheres_, which are to be regarded as the true material constituents of the universe.—touching comets, in general, let me here suggest, in passing, that we cannot be far wrong in looking upon them as the _lightning-flashes of the cosmical heaven_. the idea of a retarding ether and, through it, of a final agglomeration of all things, seemed at one time, however, to be confirmed by the observation of a positive decrease in the orbit of the solid moon. by reference to eclipses recorded <UNK> years ago, it was found that the velocity of the satellite’s revolution _then_ was considerably less than it is _now_; that on the hypothesis that its motions in its orbit is uniformly in accordance with kepler’s law, and was accurately determined <UNK> years ago—it is now in advance of the position it _should_ occupy, by nearly <UNK> miles. the increase of velocity proved, of course, a diminution of orbit; and astronomers were fast yielding to a belief in an ether, as the sole mode of accounting for the phænomenon, when lagrange came to the rescue. he showed that, owing to the configurations of the spheroids, the shorter axes of their ellipses are subject to variation in length; the longer axes being permanent; and that this variation is continuous and vibratory—so that every orbit is in a state of transition, either from circle to ellipse, or from ellipse to circle. in the case of the moon, where the shorter axis is _de_creasing, the orbit is passing from circle to ellipse and, consequently, is _de_creasing too; but, after a long series of ages, the ultimate eccentricity will be attained; then the shorter axis will proceed to _in_crease, until the orbit becomes a circle; when the process of shortening will again take place;—and so on forever. in the case of the earth, the orbit is passing from ellipse to circle. the facts thus demonstrated do away, of course, with all necessity for supposing an ether, and with all apprehension of the system’s instability—on the ether’s account. it will be remembered that i have myself assumed what we may term _an ether_. i have spoken of a subtle _influence_ which we know to be ever in attendance upon matter, although becoming manifest only through matter’s heterogeneity. to this _influence_—without daring to touch it at all in any effort at explaining its awful _nature_—i have referred the various phænomena of electricity, heat, light, magnetism; and more—of vitality, consciousness, and thought—in a word, of spirituality. it will be seen, at once, then, that the ether thus conceived is radically distinct from the ether of the astronomers; inasmuch as theirs is _matter_ and mine _not_. with the idea of a material ether, seems, thus, to have departed altogether the thought of that universal agglomeration so long predetermined by the poetical fancy of mankind:—an agglomeration in which a sound philosophy might have been warranted in putting faith, at least to a certain extent, if for no other reason than that by this poetical fancy it _had_ been so predetermined. but so far as astronomy—so far as mere physics have yet spoken, the cycles of the universe are perpetual—the universe has no conceivable end. had an end been demonstrated, however, from so purely collateral a cause as an ether, man’s instinct of the divine _capacity to adapt_, would have rebelled against the demonstration. we should have been forced to regard the universe with some such sense of dissatisfaction as we experience in contemplating an unnecessarily complex work of human art. creation would have affected us as an imperfect _plot_ in a romance, where the _dénoûment_ is awkwardly brought about by interposed incidents external and foreign to the main subject; instead of springing out of the bosom of the thesis—out of the heart of the ruling idea—instead of arising as a result of the primary proposition—as inseparable and inevitable part and parcel of the fundamental conception of the book. what i mean by the symmetry of mere surface will now be more clearly understood. it is simply by the blandishment of this symmetry that we have been beguiled into the general idea of which mädler’s hypothesis is but a part—the idea of the vorticial indrawing of the orbs. dismissing this nakedly physical conception, the symmetry of principle sees the end of all things metaphysically involved in the thought of a beginning; seeks and finds in this origin of all things the _rudiment_ of this end; and perceives the impiety of supposing this end likely to be brought about less simply—less directly—less obviously—less artistically—than through _the rëaction of the originating act_. recurring, then, to a previous suggestion, let us understand the systems—let us understand each star, with its attendant planets—as but a titanic atom existing in space with precisely the same inclination for unity which characterized, in the beginning, the actual atoms after their irradiation throughout the universal sphere. as these original atoms rushed towards each other in generally straight lines, so let us conceive as at least generally rectilinear, the paths of the system-atoms towards their respective centres of aggregation:—and in this direct drawing together of the systems into clusters, with a similar and simultaneous drawing together of the clusters themselves while undergoing consolidation, we have at length attained the great _now_—the awful present—the existing condition of the universe. of the still more awful future a not irrational analogy may guide us in framing an hypothesis. the equilibrium between the centripetal and centrifugal forces of each system, being necessarily destroyed upon attainment of a certain proximity to the nucleus of the cluster to which it belongs, there must occur, at once, a chaotic or seemingly chaotic precipitation, of the moons upon the planets, of the planets upon the suns, and of the suns upon the nuclei; and the general result of this precipitation must be the gathering of the myriad now-existing stars of the firmament into an almost infinitely less number of almost infinitely superior spheres. in being immeasurably fewer, the worlds of that day will be immeasurably greater than our own. then, indeed, amid unfathomable abysses, will be glaring unimaginable suns. but all this will be merely a climacic magnificence foreboding the great end. of this end the new genesis described, can be but a very partial postponement. while undergoing consolidation, the clusters themselves, with a speed prodigiously accumulative, have been rushing towards their own general centre—and now, with a thousand-fold electric velocity, commensurate only with their material grandeur and with the spiritual passion of their appetite for oneness, the majestic remnants of the tribe of stars flash, at length, into a common embrace. the inevitable catastrophe is at hand. but this catastrophe—what is it? we have seen accomplished the ingathering of the orbs. henceforward, are we not to understand _one material globe of globes_ as constituting and comprehending the universe? such a fancy would be altogether at war with every assumption and consideration of this discourse. i have already alluded to that absolute _reciprocity of adaptation_ which is the idiosyncrasy of the divine art—stamping it divine. up to this point of our reflections, we have been regarding the electrical influence as a something by dint of whose repulsion alone matter is enabled to exist in that state of diffusion demanded for the fulfilment of its purposes:—so far, in a word, we have been considering the influence in question as ordained for matter’s sake—to subserve the objects of matter. with a perfectly legitimate reciprocity, we are now permitted to look at matter, as created _solely for the sake of this influence_—solely to serve the objects of this spiritual ether. through the aid—by the means—through the agency of matter, and by dint of its heterogeneity—is this ether manifested—is _spirit individualized_. it is merely in the development of this ether, through heterogeneity, that particular masses of matter become animate—sensitive—and in the ratio of their heterogeneity;—some reaching a degree of sensitiveness involving what we call _thought_ and thus attaining conscious intelligence. in this view, we are enabled to perceive matter as a means—not as an end. its purposes are thus seen to have been comprehended in its diffusion; and with the return into unity these purposes cease. the absolutely consolidated globe of globes would be _objectless_:—therefore not for a moment could it continue to exist. matter, created for an end, would unquestionably, on fulfilment of that end, be matter no longer. let us endeavor to understand that it would disappear, and that god would remain all in all. that every work of divine conception must cöexist and cöexpire with its particular design, seems to me especially obvious; and i make no doubt that, on perceiving the final globe of globes to be _objectless_, the majority of my readers will be satisfied with my “_therefore_ it cannot continue to exist.” nevertheless, as the startling thought of its instantaneous disappearance is one which the most powerful intellect cannot be expected readily to entertain on grounds so decidedly abstract, let us endeavor to look at the idea from some other and more ordinary point of view:—let us see how thoroughly and beautifully it is corroborated in an _à posteriori_ consideration of matter as we actually find it. i have before said that “attraction and repulsion being undeniably the sole properties by which matter is manifested to mind, we are justified in assuming that matter _exists_ only as attraction and repulsion—in other words that attraction and repulsion _are_ matter; there being no conceivable case in which we may not employ the term matter and the terms ‘attraction’ and ‘repulsion’ taken together, as equivalent, and therefore convertible, expressions in <UNK> <UNK> page <UNK> now the very definition of attraction implies particularity—the existence of parts, particles, or atoms; for we define it as the tendency of “each atom &c. to every other atom” &c. according to a certain law. of course where there are _no_ parts—where there is absolute unity—where the tendency to oneness is satisfied—there can be no attraction:—this has been fully shown, and all philosophy admits it. when, on fulfilment of its purposes, then, matter shall have returned into its original condition of _one_—a condition which presupposes the expulsion of the separative ether, whose province and whose capacity are limited to keeping the atoms apart until that great day when, this ether being no longer needed, the overwhelming pressure of the finally collective attraction shall at length just sufficiently <UNK> and expel it:—when, i say, matter, finally, expelling the ether, shall have returned into absolute unity,—it will then (to speak paradoxically for the moment) be matter without attraction and without repulsion—in other words, matter without matter—in other words, again, _matter no more_. in sinking into unity, it will sink at once into that nothingness which, to all finite perception, unity must be—into that material nihility from which alone we can conceive it to have been evoked—to have been _created_ by the volition of god. <UNK> “gravity, therefore, must be the strongest of forces.”—see page <UNK> i repeat then—let us endeavor to comprehend that the final globe of globes will instantaneously disappear, and that god will remain all in all. but are we here to pause? not so. on the universal agglomeration and dissolution, we can readily conceive that a new and perhaps totally different series of conditions may ensue—another creation and irradiation, returning into itself—another action and rëaction of the divine will. guiding our imaginations by that omniprevalent law of laws, the law of periodicity, are we not, indeed, more than justified in entertaining a belief—let us say, rather, in indulging a hope—that the processes we have here ventured to contemplate will be renewed forever, and forever, and forever; a novel universe swelling into existence, and then subsiding into nothingness, at every throb of the heart divine? and now—this heart divine—what is it? _it is our own._ let not the merely seeming irreverence of this idea frighten our souls from that cool exercise of consciousness—from that deep tranquillity of self-inspection—through which alone we can hope to attain the presence of this, the most sublime of truths, and look it leisurely in the face. the _phænomena_ on which our conclusions must at this point depend, are merely spiritual shadows, but not the less thoroughly substantial. we walk about, amid the destinies of our world-existence, encompassed by dim but ever present _memories_ of a destiny more vast—very distant in the by-gone time, and infinitely awful. we live out a youth peculiarly haunted by such dreams; yet never mistaking them for dreams. as memories we _know_ them. _during our youth_ the distinction is too clear to deceive us even for a moment. so long as this youth endures, the feeling _that we exist_, is the most natural of all feelings. we understand it _thoroughly_. that there was a period at which we did _not_ exist—or, that it might so have happened that we never had existed at all—are the considerations, indeed, which _during this youth_, we find difficulty in understanding. why we should _not_ exist, is, _up to the epoch of our manhood_, of all queries the most unanswerable. existence—self-existence—existence from all time and to all eternity—seems, up to the epoch of manhood, a normal and unquestionable condition:—_seems, because it is_. but now comes the period at which a conventional world-reason awakens us from the truth of our dream. doubt, surprise and incomprehensibility arrive at the same moment. they say:—“you live and the time was when you lived not. you have been created. an intelligence exists greater than your own; and it is only through this intelligence you live at all.” these things we struggle to comprehend and cannot:—_cannot_, because these things, being untrue, are thus, of necessity, incomprehensible. no thinking being lives who, at some luminous point of his life of thought, has not felt himself lost amid the surges of futile efforts at understanding, or believing, that anything exists _greater than his own soul_. the utter impossibility of any one’s soul feeling itself inferior to another; the intense, overwhelming dissatisfaction and rebellion at the thought;—these, with the omniprevalent aspirations at perfection, are but the spiritual, coincident with the material, struggles towards the original unity—are, to my mind at least, a species of proof far surpassing what man terms demonstration, that no one soul _is_ inferior to another—that nothing is, or can be, superior to any one soul—that each soul is, in part, its own god—its own creator:—in a word, that god—the material _and_ spiritual god—_now_ exists solely in the diffused matter and spirit of the universe; and that the regathering of this diffused matter and spirit will be but the re-constitution of the _purely_ spiritual and individual god. in this view, and in this view alone, we comprehend the riddles of divine injustice—of inexorable fate. in this view alone the existence of evil becomes intelligible; but in this view it becomes more—it becomes endurable. our souls no longer rebel at a _sorrow_ which we ourselves have imposed upon ourselves, in furtherance of our own purposes—with a view—if even with a futile view—to the extension of our own _joy_. i have spoken of _memories_ that haunt us during our youth. they sometimes pursue us even in our manhood:—assume gradually less and less indefinite shapes:—now and then speak to us with low voices, saying: “there was an epoch in the night of time, when a still-existent being existed—one of an absolutely infinite number of similar beings that people the absolutely infinite domains of the absolutely infinite <UNK> it was not and is not in the power of this being—any more than it is in your own—to extend, by actual increase, the joy of his existence; but just as it _is_ in your power to expand or to concentrate your pleasures (the absolute amount of happiness remaining always the same) so did and does a similar capability appertain to this divine being, who thus passes his eternity in perpetual variation of concentrated self and almost infinite self-diffusion. what you call the universe is but his present expansive existence. he now feels his life through an infinity of imperfect pleasures—the partial and pain-intertangled pleasures of those inconceivably numerous things which you designate as his creatures, but which are really but infinite individualizations of himself. all these creatures—_all_—those which you term animate, as well as those to whom you deny life for no better reason than that you do not behold it in operation—_all_ these creatures have, in a greater or less degree, a capacity for pleasure and for pain:—_but the general sum of their sensations is precisely that amount of happiness which appertains by right to the divine being when concentrated within himself_. these creatures are all, too, more or less conscious intelligences; conscious, first, of a proper identity; conscious, secondly and by faint indeterminate glimpses, of an identity with the divine being of whom we speak—of an identity with god. of the two classes of consciousness, fancy that the former will grow weaker, the latter stronger, during the long succession of ages which must elapse before these myriads of individual intelligences become blended—when the bright stars become blended—into one. think that the sense of individual identity will be gradually merged in the general consciousness—that man, for example, ceasing imperceptibly to feel himself man, will at length attain that awfully triumphant epoch when he shall recognize his existence as that of jehovah. in the meantime bear in mind that all is life—life—life within life—the less within the greater, and all within the _spirit divine_.” <UNK> see pages <UNK> commencing “i reply that the right,” and ending “proper and particular god.” the end. <UNK> broadway, new york. <UNK> strand, london. of late firm of wiley & putnam. new works in press, or recently published, by george p. putnam, <UNK> broadway, new york. g. p. putnam has the pleasure of announcing that, agreeably to his contract with the distinguished author, he has now in the course of publication _a new, uniform, and complete edition_ of the works of washington irving, revised and enlarged by the author, _in twelve elegant duodecimo volumes_, beautifully printed with new type, and on superior paper, made expressly for the purpose. the first volume of the series will be the sketch-book, complete in one volume, which will be ready on the first day of september. knickerbocker’s history of new york, with revisions and copious additions, will be published on the <UNK> of october. the life and voyages of columbus, vol. i. on the <UNK> of november, and the succeeding volumes will be issued on the first day of each month until completed;—as follows: _the sketch-book, in one volume. knickerbocker’s new york, in one volume. tales of a traveller, in one volume. bracebridge hall, in one volume. the conquest of grenada, in one volume. the alhambra, in one volume. the spanish legends, in one vol. the crayon miscellany, in one vol.—abbotsford, newstead, the prairies, &c. life and voyages of columbus, and the companions of columbus, <UNK> vols. adventures of captain bonneville, one vol. astoria, one volume._ the illustrated sketch-book. in october will be published, the sketch-book. by washington irving. one volume, square octavo. illustrated with a series of highly-finished engravings on wood, from designs by darley and others, engraved in the best style by childs, herrick, &c. this edition will be printed on paper of the finest quality, similar in size and style to the new edition of “halleck’s poems.” it is intended that the illustrations shall be superior to any engravings on wood yet produced in this country, and that the mechanical execution of the volume, altogether, shall be worthy of the author’s reputation. it will form an elegant and appropriate gift-book for all seasons. the illustrated knickerbocker, with a series of original designs, in one vol., octavo, is also in preparation. mr. putnam has also the honor to announce that he will publish at intervals (in connexion, and uniform with the other collected writings), _mr. irving’s new works_, now nearly ready for the press: including the life of mohammed; the life of washington; new volumes of miscellanies, biographies, &c. ⁂ this being the first uniform and complete edition of mr. irving’s works, either in this country or in europe, the publisher confidently believes that the undertaking will meet with a prompt and cordial response. to say this, is perhaps superfluous and impertinent; for it is a truism that no _american_ book-case (not to say _library_) can be well filled without the works of washington irving; while the english language itself comprises no purer models of composition. g. p. putnam has also made arrangements for the early commencement of new works or new editions of the works of _miss c. m. sedgwick, prof. a. gray, leigh hunt, chas. fenno hoffman, mrs. e. oakes smith, thomas carlyle, george h. calvert, mrs. c. m. kirkland, r. monckton milnes, j. bayard taylor, mary howitt, mrs. jameson, s. wells williams, w. m. thackeray, charles lamb, a. j. downing, thos. hood, elliot warburton_. the following new works are now ready, or will be published this season: i. sophisms of the protective policy. translated from the french of f. bastiat. with an introduction by francis lieber, ll.d. professor in south carolina college, editor of the encyclopedia americana, &c. <UNK> <UNK> cents. “it is a book not for the million but for millions, and we believe if a copy could be put into the hands of every school-boy in the union, the next generation would be inconceivably wiser, richer, and happier than the present.”—_mirror._ ii. grecian and roman mythology: with original illustrations. adapted for the use of universities and high schools, and for popular reading. by m. a. dwight. with an introduction by tayler lewis, professor of greek, university of new york. <UNK> (on <UNK> september.) also a fine edition in octavo, with illustrations. ⁂ this work has been prepared with great care, illustrated with <UNK> effective outline drawings, and is designed to treat the subject in an original, comprehensive, and unexceptionable manner, so as to fill the place as a text book which is yet unsupplied; while it will also be an attractive and readable table book for general use. it will be at once introduced as a text book in the university of new york and other colleges and schools. iii. eureka: a prose poem. or the physical and metaphysical universe. by edgar a. poe, esq. handsomely printed, <UNK> cloth, <UNK> cents. “a most extraordinary essay. we shall be greatly surprised if this work does not create a most profound sensation among the literary and scientific classes.”—_new york express._ iv. oriental life illustrated. being a new edition of eöthen, or traces of travel in the east. with fine illustrations on steel. <UNK> elegantly bound, <UNK> <UNK> ⁂ this new and unique volume, superbly illuminated by mapleson, and comprising original articles by distinguished writers, will be the most elegant and recherché book of the kind ever produced in this country. it will be ready in october. a new and superior edition of the pearls of american poetry will also be published this season. v. the book of dainty devices. in an elegant small folio volume. lays of the western world. vi. dr. klipstein’s anglo-saxon course of study. in uniform <UNK> volumes. i. a grammar of the anglo-saxon language. by louis f. klipstein, aa.ll.m. and ph.d., of the university of giessen. ⁂ this work recommends itself particularly to the attention of every american student who “glories in his anglo-saxon descent” or teutonic lineage, as well as of all who desire an acquaintance with a language which lies as the foundation of the english, and throws a light upon its elements and structure, derivable from no other source. of the importance and interesting nature of the study there can be no doubt, and we agree with those who think that the time is coming when it will be considered “utterly disgraceful for any well-bred englishman or american” to have neglected it. with regard to the merits of dr. klipstein’s grammar, we will only say, that it has been already adopted as a text-book in some of the leading institutions of our country. [the following are also in press.] ii. analecta anglo-saxonica, with an introductory ethnographical essay, copious notes, critical and explanatory, and a glossary in which are shown the indo-germanic and other affinities of the language. _by the same._ in this work appear the fruits of considerable research, and, we may add, learning. the ethnology of europe is succinctly, but clearly illustrated, the anglo-saxon language completely analysed, revealing the utmost harmony of combination from its elements, its forms and roots compared with those in kindred dialects and cognate tongues, its position in the teutonic family and indo-germanic range established, and the genuine relation of the english to its great parent properly set forth. to those who are fond of the comparative study of language, the glossary will prove an invaluable aid, apart from its particular object. iii. natale sancti gregorii papæ.—ælfric’s homily on the birth-day of st. gregory, and collateral extracts from king alfred’s version of bede’s ecclesiastical history and the saxon chronicle, with a full rendering into english, notes critical and explanatory, and an index of words. _by the same._ iv. extracts from the anglo-saxon-gospels, a portion of the anglo-saxon paraphrase of the book of psalms, and other selections of a sacred order in the same language, with a translation into english, and notes critical and explanatory. _by the same._ these two works are prepared in such a way as in themselves, with the aid of the grammar, to afford every facility to the anglo-saxon student. ælfric’s homily is remarkable for beauty of composition, and interesting as setting forth augustine’s mission to the “land of the angles.” v. tha halgan godspel on englisc—the anglo-saxon version of the holy gospels. edited by benjamin thorpe, f.s.a. _reprinted by the same. now ready._ this, the earliest “english” version of the four gospels, will be found interesting to the antiquarian and theologian, as well as serviceable to the student in his investigations of the language. the text, besides the usual but unbroken division, appears, with the rubrics, as read in the early anglican church. _nearly ready._ dr. bosworth’s compendious anglo-saxon dictionary. small <UNK> vii. study of modern languages. part first; french, italian, spanish, portuguese, german, and english. by l. f. klipstein, aa.ll.m. and ph.d. one vol. imperial <UNK> <UNK> cents paper; <UNK> <UNK> cloth. this work, which is intended equally for the simultaneous and the separate study of the languages that it sets forth, and which is adapted as well for the native of germany, france, italy, spain, or portugal, as for him to whom english is vernacular, in the acquirement of any one of the other tongues besides his own, will be found an acceptable manual not only to the tyro, but to the more advanced scholar. the reading portion of the matter is interesting, and the text in every case remarkably correct, while the elementary phrases, forms of cards, letters, bills of exchange, promissory notes, receipts, &c., in the six languages, constitute what has long been a desideratum from the american press. for the comparative study of the _romanic_ tongues the work affords unusual facilities. viii. pedestrian tour in europe. views a-foot; or europe seen with knapsack and staff. by j. bayard taylor. a new edition with an additional chapter, and a sketch of the author in pedestrian costume, from a drawing by t. buchanan read. <UNK> cloth. ix. a new edition of clarke’s shakspeare concordance. a complete concordance to shakspeare: being a verbal index to all the passages in the dramatic works of the poet. by mrs. cowden clarke. “order gave each thing view.” one large vol. comprising <UNK> closely printed columns,—(indicating _every word and passage_ in shakspeare’s works). price <UNK> cloth. “the result of sixteen years of untiring labor. the different editions of shakspeare have been carefully collated by the compiler, and every possible means taken to insure the correctness of the work. as it now stands, a person can find a particular passage in shakspeare by simply remembering one word of it, and is also referred to the act and scene of the play in which it occurs. as a mere dictionary of shakspearian language and phrases, it is of great value; but it is also a dictionary of his thoughts and imaginations. it altogether supersedes the volumes of twiss and ayscough, and should be on every student’s shelves”—_boston courier._ ⁂ this extraordinary work is printed in london and the price there _at present_ is <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> or about <UNK> a large part of the edition having been purchased for this market, it is furnished here for the very low price of <UNK> bound in cloth. _also—by same author._ the book of shakspeare proverbs. <UNK> <UNK> cts. _dr. lieber’s poetical address to the american republic._ <UNK> <UNK> cents. the west: a metrical epistle. by francis lieber. ⁂ dr. lieber, the distinguished professor of political economy in south carolina college, author of “political ethics,” &c., has just sailed for his native country—germany—with the view of aiding in the great cause of constitutional and rational freedom. this little volume proves that he has well studied that subject during his long residence in this his adopted country—and his able and valuable opinions on american society and progress, carry with them a peculiar interest at this time. recent publications. alexander.—commentary on the earlier prophecies of isaiah. by prof. j. a. alexander. royal <UNK> cloth, <UNK> alexander.—commentary on the later prophecies of isaiah. by prof. j. a. alexander. royal <UNK> cloth, <UNK> <UNK> ancient moral tales, from the gesta romanorum, &c. <UNK> vol. <UNK> green cloth. “a quiet humor, a quaintness and terseness of style, will strongly recommend them.”—_english churchman._ architecture.—hints on public architecture;

its typographical errors, though sufficiently numerous, are so comparatively few, as to show that it has the advantage of the best american proof-reading; while for thoroughness of execution in the departments of history and criticism, it aims to be pre-eminent.”—_n. y. churchman._ burton.—the anatomy of melancholy. by burton. new and beautiful edition, with engravings. <UNK> vol. royal <UNK> cloth, <UNK> <UNK> ⁂ this is one of those sterling old works which were written for “all time,” full of learning, humor, and quaint conceits. no library can be complete without it. calvert.—scenes and thoughts in europe. by an american. <UNK> vol. <UNK> green cloth, <UNK> cents. “his descriptions of scenery, his remarks on art, his accounts of the different people among whom he sojourned, are all good.”—_cincinnati gazette._ carlyle.—the french revolution: a history. by thomas carlyle. <UNK> vols. <UNK> green cloth, <UNK> “his french revolution is considered one of the most remarkable works of the age—as at once the poetry and philosophy of history.”—_hunt’s merchants’ mag._ carlyle.—letters and speeches of oliver cromwell. by thos. carlyle. <UNK> vols. <UNK> green cloth, <UNK> <UNK> “a work more valuable as a guide to the study of the singular and complex character of our pious revolutionist, our religious demagogue, our preaching and praying warrior, has not been produced.”—_blackwood’s magazine._ carlyle.—past and present: chartism. by thomas carlyle. <UNK> vol. <UNK> green cloth, <UNK> “to say that the book is replete with instruction, thought, and quaint fancy, is unnecessary: but we may mention it as one, _par excellence_, which should be read at the present juncture.”-_tribune._ chaucer and spenser.—selections from the poetical works of geoffrey chaucer. by charles d. deshler. spenser, and the faery queen. by mrs. c. m. kirkland. <UNK> vol. <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> —— the same, extra gilt, <UNK> <UNK> “a portion of their writings are presented in a beautiful and convenient form, and with the requisite notes and modifications.”—_home journal._ coe.—studies in drawing, in a progressive series of lessons on cards;

all i know is this: six weeks ago i and my wife were in search of a furnished apartment. passing a quiet street, we saw on the window of one of the houses a bill, ‘apartments furnished.’ the situation suited us; we entered the house, liked the rooms, engaged them by the week, and left them the third day. no power on earth could have reconciled my wife to stay longer; and i don’t wonder at it.” “what did you see?” “excuse me; i have no desire to be ridiculed as a superstitious dreamer, nor, on the other hand, could i ask you to accept on my affirmation what you would hold to be incredible, without the evidence of your own senses. let me only say this: it was not so much what we saw or heard (in which you might fairly suppose that we were the dupes of our own excited fancy, or the victims of imposture in others) that drove us away, as it was an undefinable terror which seized both of us whenever we passed by the door of a certain unfurnished room, in which we neither saw nor heard anything; and the strangest marvel of all was, that for once in my life i agreed with my wife, silly woman though she be, and allowed after the third night that it was impossible to stay a fourth in that house. accordingly, on the fourth morning i summoned the woman who kept the house and attended on us, and told her that the rooms did not quite suit us, and we would not stay out our week. she said dryly, ‘i know why; you have stayed longer than any other lodger. few ever stayed a second night; none before you a third. but i take it they have been very kind to you.’ “‘they,--who?’ i asked, affecting a smile. “‘why, they who haunt the house, whoever they are; i don’t mind them; i remember them many years ago, when i lived in this house not as a servant; but i know they will be the death of me some day. i don’t care,--i’m old and must die soon anyhow; and then i shall be with them, and in this house still.’ the woman spoke with so dreary a calmness, that really it was a sort of awe that prevented my conversing with her further. i paid for my week, and too happy were i and my wife to get off so cheaply.” “you excite my curiosity,” said i; “nothing i should like better than to sleep in a haunted house. pray give me the address of the one which you left so ignominiously.” my friend gave me the address; and when we parted i walked straight toward the house thus indicated. it is situated on the north side of oxford street, in a dull but respectable thoroughfare. i found the house shut up; no bill at the window, and no response to my knock. as i was turning away, a beer-boy, collecting pewter pots at the neighboring areas, said to me, “do you want any one at that house, sir?” “yes, i heard it was to be let.” “let! why, the woman who kept it is dead; has been dead these three weeks; and no one can be found to stay there, though mr. j---- offered ever so much. he offered mother, who chars for him, <UNK> a week just to open and shut the windows, and she would not.” “would not! and why?” “the house is haunted; and the old woman who kept it was found dead in her bed with her eyes wide open. they say the devil strangled her.” “pooh! you speak of mr. j----. is he the owner of the house?” “yes.” “where does he live?” “in g---- street, no.--.” “what is he?--in any business?” “no, sir; nothing particular; a single gentleman.” i gave the pot-boy the gratuity earned by his liberal information, and proceeded to mr. j---- in g---- street, which was close by the street that boasted the haunted house. i was lucky enough to find mr. j---- at home; an elderly man with intelligent countenance and prepossessing manners. i communicated my name and my business frankly. i said i heard the house was considered to be haunted; that i had a strong desire to examine a house with so equivocal a reputation; that i should be greatly obliged if he would allow me to hire it, though only for a night. i was willing to pay for that privilege whatever he might be inclined to ask. “sir,” said mr. j---- with great courtesy, “the house is at your service for as short or as long a time as you please. rent is out of the question; the obligation will be on my side, should you be able to discover the cause of the strange phenomena which at present deprive it of all value. i cannot let it, for i cannot even get a servant to keep it in order or answer the door. unluckily, the house is haunted, if i may use that expression, not only by night but by day; though at night the disturbances are of a more unpleasant and sometimes of a more alarming character. the poor old woman who died in it three weeks ago was a pauper whom i took out of a workhouse; for in her childhood she had been known to some of my family, and had once been in such good circumstances that she had rented that house of my uncle. she was a woman of superior education and strong mind, and was the only person i could ever induce to remain in the house. indeed, since her death, which was sudden, and the coroner’s inquest, which gave it a notoriety in the neighborhood, i have so despaired of finding any person to take charge of it, much more a tenant, that i would willingly let it rent free for a year to any one who would pay its rates and taxes.” “how long ago did the house acquire this character?” “that i can scarcely tell you, but many years since; the old woman i spoke of said it was haunted when she rented it, between thirty and forty years ago. the fact is, that my life has been spent in the east indies, and in the civil service of the company. i returned to england last year, on inheriting the fortune of an uncle, amongst whose possessions was the house in question. i found it shut up and uninhabited. i was told that it was haunted, and no one would inhabit it. i smiled at what seemed to me so idle a story. i spent some money in repainting and roofing it, added to its old-fashioned furniture a few modern articles, advertised it, and obtained a lodger for a year. he was a colonel retired on half pay. he came in with his family, a son and a daughter, and four or five servants; they all left the house the next day; and although they deponed that they had all seen something different, that something was equally terrible to all. i really could not in conscience sue, or even blame, the colonel for breach of agreement. then i put in the old woman i have spoken of, and she was empowered to let the house in apartments. i never had one lodger who stayed more than three days. i do not tell you their stories; to no two lodgers have exactly the same phenomena been repeated. it is better that you should judge for yourself, than enter the house with an imagination influenced by previous narratives; only be prepared to see and to hear something or other, and take whatever precautions you yourself please.” “have you never had a curiosity yourself to pass a night in that house?” “yes; i passed, not a night, but three hours in broad daylight alone in that house. my curiosity is not satisfied, but it is quenched. i have no desire to renew the experiment. you cannot complain, you see, sir, that i am not sufficiently candid; and unless your interest be exceedingly eager and your nerves unusually strong, i honestly add that i advise you _not_ to pass a night in that house.” “my interest _is_ exceedingly keen,” said i; “and though only a coward will boast of his nerves in situations wholly unfamiliar to him, yet my nerves have been seasoned in such variety of danger that i have the right to rely on them, even in a haunted house.” mr. j---- said very little more; he took the keys of the house out of his bureau, and gave them to me; and, thanking him cordially for his frankness and his urbane concession to my wish, i carried off my prize. impatient for the experiment, as soon as i reached home i summoned my confidential servant,--a young man of gay spirits, fearless temper, and as free from superstitious prejudice as any one i could think of. “f----,” said i, “you remember in germany how disappointed we were at not finding a ghost in that old castle, which was said to be haunted by a headless apparition? well, i have heard of a house in london which, i have reason to hope, is decidedly haunted. i mean to sleep there to-night. from what i hear, there is no doubt that something will allow itself to be seen or to be heard,--something perhaps excessively horrible. do you think, if i take you with me, i may rely on your presence of mind, whatever may happen?” “o sir! pray trust me!” said he, grinning with delight. “very well, then, here are the keys of the house; this is the address. go now, select for me any bedroom you please; and since the house has not been inhabited for weeks, make up a good fire, air the bed well, see, of course, that there are candles as well as fuel. take with you my revolver and my dagger,--so much for my weapons,--arm yourself equally well; and if we are not a match for a dozen ghosts, we shall be but a sorry couple of englishmen.” i was engaged for the rest of the day on business so urgent that i had not leisure to think much on the nocturnal adventure to which i had plighted my honor. i dined alone and very late, and while dining read, as is my habit. the volume i selected was one of macaulay’s essays. i thought to myself that i would take the book with me; there was so much of healthfulness in the style, and practical life in the subjects, that it would serve as an antidote against the influences of superstitious fancy. accordingly, about half past nine, i put the book into my pocket, and strolled leisurely towards the haunted house. i took with me a favorite dog; an exceedingly sharp, bold, and vigilant bull-terrier, a dog fond of prowling about strange ghostly corners and passages at night in search of rats, a dog of dogs for a ghost. it was a summer night, but chilly, the sky somewhat gloomy and overcast; still there was a moon,--faint and sickly, but still a moon; and if the clouds permitted, after midnight it would be brighter. i reached the house, knocked, and my servant opened with a cheerful smile. “all right, sir, and very comfortable.” “oh!” said i, rather disappointed; “have you not seen nor heard anything remarkable?” “well, sir, i must own i have heard something queer.” “what?--what?” “the sound of feet pattering behind me; and once or twice small noises like whispers close at my ear; nothing more.” “you are not at all frightened?” “i! not a bit of it, sir!” and the man’s bold look reassured me on one point, namely, that, happen what might, he would not desert me. we were in the hall, the street door closed, and my attention was now drawn to my dog. he had at first run in eagerly enough, but had sneaked back to the door, and was scratching and whining to get out. after i had patted him on the head and encouraged him gently, the dog seemed to reconcile himself to the situation, and followed me and f---- through the house, but keeping close at my heels, instead of hurrying inquisitively in advance, which was his usual and normal habit in all strange places. we first visited the subterranean apartments, the kitchen and other offices, and especially the cellars, in which last were two or three bottles of wine still left in a bin, covered with cobwebs, and evidently, by their appearance, undisturbed for many years. it was clear that the ghosts were not winebibbers. for the rest, we discovered nothing of interest. there was a gloomy little back yard, with very high walls. the stones of this yard were very damp; and what with the damp, and what with the dust and smoke-grime on the pavement, our feet left a slight impression where we passed. and now appeared the first strange phenomenon witnessed by myself in this strange abode. i saw, just before me, the print of a foot suddenly form itself, as it were. i stopped, caught hold of my servant, and pointed to it. in advance of that footprint as suddenly dropped another. we both saw it. i advanced quickly to the place; the footprint kept advancing before me; a small footprint,--the foot of a child; the impression was too faint thoroughly to distinguish the shape, but it seemed to us both that it was the print of a naked foot. this phenomenon ceased when we arrived at the opposite wall, nor did it repeat itself when we returned. we remounted the stairs, and entered the rooms on the ground-floor,--a dining-parlor, a small back parlor, and a still smaller third room, that had probably been appropriated to a footman,--all still as death. we then visited the drawing-rooms, which seemed fresh and new. in the front room i seated myself in an arm-chair. f---- placed on the table the candlestick with which he had lighted us. i told him to shut the door. as he turned to do so, a chair opposite to me moved from the wall quickly and noiselessly, and dropped itself about a yard from my own chair, immediately fronting it. “why, this is better than the turning tables,” said i, with a half-laugh; and as i laughed, my dog put back his head and howled. f----, coming back, had not observed the movement of the chair. he employed himself now in stilling the dog. i continued to gaze on the chair, and fancied i saw on it a pale, blue, misty outline of a human figure; but an outline so indistinct that i could only distrust my own vision. the dog was now quiet. “put back the chair opposite to me,” said i to f----, “put it back to the wall.” f---- obeyed. “was that you, sir?” said he, turning abruptly. “i,--what?” “why, something struck me. i felt it sharply on the shoulder, just here.” “no,” said i; “but we have jugglers present; and though we may not discover their tricks, we shall catch _them_ before they frighten us.” we did not stay long in the drawing-rooms; in fact, they felt so damp and so chilly that i was glad to get to the fire up stairs. we locked the doors of the drawing-rooms,--a precaution which, i should observe, we had taken with all the rooms we had searched below. the bedroom my servant had selected for me was the best on the floor; a large one, with two windows fronting the street. the four-posted bed, which took up no inconsiderable space, was opposite to the fire, which burned clear and bright; a door in the wall to the left, between the bed and the window, communicated with the room which my servant appropriated to himself. this last was a small room with a sofa-bed, and had no communication with the landing-place; no other door but that which conducted to the bedroom i was to occupy. on either side of my fireplace was a cupboard, without locks, flush with the wall, and covered with the same dull-brown paper. we examined these cupboards; only hooks to suspend female dresses,--nothing else. we sounded the walls; evidently solid,--the outer walls of the building. having finished the survey of these apartments, warmed myself a few moments, and lighted my cigar, i then, still accompanied by f----, went forth to complete my reconnoitre. in the landing-place there was another door; it was closed firmly. “sir,” said my servant in surprise, “i unlocked this door with all the others when i first came; it cannot have got locked from the inside, for it is a--” before he had finished his sentence, the door, which neither of us then was touching, opened quietly of itself. we looked at each other a single instant. the same thought seized both; some human agency might be detected here. i rushed in first, my servant followed. a small, blank, dreary room without furniture, a few empty boxes and hampers in a corner, a small window, the shutters closed,--not even a fireplace,--no other door but that by which we had entered, no carpet on the floor, and the floor seemed very old, uneven, worm-eaten, mended here and there, as was shown by the whiter patches on the wood; but no living being, and no visible place in which a living being could have hidden. as we stood gazing round, the door by which we had entered closed as quietly as it had before opened; we were imprisoned. for the first time i felt a creep of undefinable horror. not so my servant. “why, they don’t think to trap us, sir; i could break that trumpery door with a kick of my foot.” “try first if it will open to your hand,” said i, shaking off the vague apprehension that had seized me, “while i open the shutters and see what is without.” i unbarred the shutters: the window looked on the little back yard i have before described; there was no ledge without, nothing but sheer descent. no man getting out of that window would have found any footing till he had fallen on the stones below. f---- meanwhile was vainly attempting to open the door. he now turned round to me and asked my permission to use force. and i should here state, in justice to the servant, that, far from evincing any superstitious terror, his nerve, composure, and even gayety amidst circumstances so extraordinary, compelled my admiration, and made me congratulate myself on having secured a companion in every way fitted to the occasion. i willingly gave him the permission he required. but, though he was a remarkably strong man, his force was as idle as his milder efforts; the door did not even shake to his stoutest kick. breathless and panting, he desisted. i then tried the door myself, equally in vain. as i ceased from the effort, again that creep of horror came over me; but this time it was more cold and stubborn. i felt as if some strange and ghastly exhalation were rising from the chinks of that rugged floor and filling the atmosphere with a venomous influence hostile to human life. the door now very slowly and quietly opened as of its own accord. we precipitated ourselves into the landing-place. we both saw a large, pale light--as large as the human figure, but shapeless and unsubstantial--move before us and ascend the stairs that led from the landing into the attics. i followed the light, and my servant followed me. it entered, to the right of the landing, a small garret, of which the door stood open. i entered in the same instant. the light then collapsed into a small globule, exceedingly brilliant and vivid; rested a moment on a bed in the corner, quivered, and vanished. we approached the bed and examined it,--a half-tester, such as is commonly found in attics devoted to servants. on the drawers that stood near it we perceived an old faded silk kerchief, with the needle still left in the rent half repaired. the kerchief was covered with dust; probably it had belonged to the old woman who had last died in that house, and this might have been her sleeping-room. i had sufficient curiosity to open the drawers; there were a few odds and ends of female dress, and two letters tied round with a narrow ribbon of faded yellow. i took the liberty to possess myself of the letters. we found nothing else in the room worth noticing, nor did the light reappear; but we distinctly heard, as we turned to go, a pattering footfall on the floor just before us. we went through the other attics (in all four), the footfall still preceding us. nothing to be seen, nothing but the footfall heard. i had the letters in my hand; just as i was descending the stairs i distinctly felt my wrist seized, and a faint, soft effort made to draw the letters from my clasp. i only held them the more tightly, and the effort ceased. we regained the bedchamber appropriated to myself, and i then remarked that my dog had not followed us when we had left it. he was thrusting himself close to the fire and trembling. i was impatient to examine the letters; and while i read them my servant opened a little box in which he had deposited the weapons i had ordered him to bring, took them out, placed them on a table close at my bed-head, and then occupied himself in soothing the dog, who, however, seemed to heed him very little. the letters were short; they were dated,--the dates exactly thirty-five years ago. they were evidently from a lover to his mistress, or a husband to some young wife. not only the terms of expression, but a distinct reference to a former voyage indicated the writer to have been a seafarer. the spelling and handwriting were those of a man imperfectly educated; but still the language itself was forcible. in the expressions of endearment there was a kind of rough, wild love; but here and there were dark unintelligible hints at some secret not of love,--some secret that seemed of crime. “we ought to love each other,” was one of the sentences i remember, “for how every one else would execrate us if all was known.” again: “don’t let any one be in the same room with you at night,--you talk in your sleep.” and again: “what’s done can’t be undone: and i tell you there’s nothing against us, unless the dead could come to life.” here was interlined, in a better handwriting (a female’s), “they do!” at the end of the letter latest in date the same female hand had written these words: “lost at sea the <UNK> of june, the same day as--” i put down the letters, and began to muse over their contents. fearing, however, that the train of thought into which i fell might unsteady my nerves, i fully determined to keep my mind in a fit state to cope with whatever of marvellous the advancing night might bring forth. i roused myself, laid the letters on the table, stirred up the fire, which was still bright and cheering, and opened my volume of macaulay. i read quietly enough, till about half past eleven. i then threw myself dressed upon the bed, and told my servant he might retire to his own room, but must keep himself awake. i bade him leave open the doors between the two rooms. thus, alone, i kept two candles burning on the table by my bed-head. i placed my watch beside the weapons, and calmly resumed my macaulay. opposite to me the fire burned clear; and on the hearth-rug, seemingly asleep, lay the dog. in about twenty minutes i felt an exceedingly cold air pass by my cheek, like a sudden draught. i fancied the door to my right, communicating with the landing-place, must have got open; but no, it was closed. i then turned my glance to the left, and saw the flame of the candles violently swayed as by a wind. at the same moment the watch beside the revolver softly slid from the table,--softly, softly,--no visible hand,--it was gone. i sprang up, seizing the revolver with the one hand, the dagger with the other: i was not willing that my weapons should share the fate of the watch. thus armed, i looked round the floor: no sign of the watch. three slow, loud, distinct knocks were now heard at the bed-head; my servant called out, “is that you, sir?” “no; be on your guard.” the dog now roused himself and sat on his haunches, his ears moving quickly backward and forward. he kept his eye fixed on me with a look so strange that he concentred all my attention on himself. slowly he rose, all his hair bristling, and stood perfectly rigid, and with the same wild stare. i had no time, however, to examine the dog. presently my servant emerged from his room; and if i ever saw horror in the human face, it was then. i should not have recognized him had we met in the streets, so altered was every lineament. he passed by me quickly, saying in a whisper that seemed scarcely to come from his lips, “run! run! it is after me!” he gained the door to the landing, pulled it open, and rushed forth. i followed him into the landing involuntarily, calling him to stop; but, without heeding me, he bounded down the stairs, clinging to the balusters and taking several steps at a time. i heard, where i stood, the street door open, heard it again clap to. i was left alone in the haunted house. it was but for a moment that i remained undecided whether or not to follow my servant; pride and curiosity alike forbade so dastardly a flight. i re-entered my room, closing the door after me, and proceeded cautiously into the interior chamber. i encountered nothing to justify my servant’s terror. i again carefully examined the walls, to see if there were any concealed door. i could find no trace of one,--not even a seam in the dull-brown paper with which the room was hung. how then had the thing, whatever it was, which had so scared him, obtained ingress, except through my own chamber? i returned to my room, shut and locked the door that opened upon the interior one, and stood on the hearth, expectant and prepared. i now perceived that the dog had slunk into an angle of the wall, and was pressing close against it, as if literally striving to force his way into it. i approached the animal and spoke to it; the poor brute was evidently beside itself with terror. it showed all its teeth, the slaver dropping from its jaws, and would certainly have bitten me if i had touched it. it did not seem to recognize me. whoever has seen at the zoölogical gardens a rabbit fascinated by a serpent, cowering in a corner, may form some idea of the anguish which the dog exhibited. finding all efforts to soothe the animal in vain, and fearing that his bite might be as venomous in that state as if in the madness of hydrophobia, i left him alone, placed my weapons on the table beside the fire, seated myself, and recommenced my macaulay. perhaps, in order not to appear seeking credit for a courage, or rather a coolness, which the reader may conceive i exaggerate, i may be pardoned if i pause to indulge in one or two egotistical remarks. as i hold presence of mind, or what is called courage, to be precisely proportioned to familiarity with the circumstances that lead to it, so i should say that i had been long sufficiently familiar with all experiments that appertain to the marvellous. i had witnessed many very extraordinary phenomena in various parts of the world,--phenomena that would be either totally disbelieved if i stated them, or ascribed to supernatural agencies. now, my theory is, that the supernatural is the impossible, and that what is called supernatural is only a something in the laws of nature of which we have been hitherto ignorant. therefore, if a ghost rise before me, i have not the right to say, “so, then, the supernatural is possible,” but rather, “so, then, the apparition of a ghost is, contrary to received opinion, within the laws of nature, namely, not supernatural.” now, in all that i had hitherto witnessed, and indeed in all the wonders which the amateurs of mystery in our age record as facts, a material living agency is always required. on the continent you will find still magicians who assert that they can raise spirits. assume for the moment that they assert truly, still the living material form of the magician is present; and he is the material agency by which, from some constitutional peculiarities, certain strange phenomena are represented to your natural senses. accept, again, as truthful the tales of spirit manifestation in america,--musical or other sounds, writings on paper, produced by no discernible hand, articles of furniture moved without apparent human agency, or the actual sight and touch of hands, to which no bodies seem to belong,--still there must be found the medium, or living being, with constitutional peculiarities capable of obtaining these signs. in fine, in all such marvels, supposing even that there is no imposture, there must be a human being like ourselves, by whom or through whom the effects presented to human beings are produced. it is so with the now familiar phenomena of mesmerism or electro-biology; the mind of the person operated on is affected through a material living agent. nor, supposing it true that a mesmerized patient can respond to the will or passes of a mesmerizer a hundred miles distant, is the response less occasioned by a material being. it may be through a material fluid, call it electric, call it odic, call it what you will, which has the power of traversing space and passing obstacles, that the material effect is communicated from one to the other. hence, all that i had hitherto witnessed, or expected to witness, in this strange house, i believed to be occasioned through some agency or medium as mortal as myself; and this idea necessarily prevented the awe with which those who regard as supernatural things that are not within the ordinary operations of nature might have been impressed by the adventures of that memorable night. as, then, it was my conjecture that all that was presented, or would be presented, to my senses, must originate in some human being gifted by constitution with the power so to present them, and having some motive so to do, i felt an interest in my theory which, in its way, was rather philosophical than superstitious. and i can sincerely say that i was in as tranquil a temper for observation as any practical experimentalist could be in awaiting the effects of some rare, though perhaps perilous, chemical combination. of course, the more i kept my mind detached from fancy, the more the temper fitted for observation would be obtained; and i therefore riveted eye and thought on the strong daylight sense in the page of my macaulay. i now became aware that something interposed between the page and the light: the page was overshadowed. i looked up and i saw what i shall find it very difficult, perhaps impossible, to describe. it was a darkness shaping itself out of the air in very undefined outline. i cannot say it was of a human form, and yet it had more of a resemblance to a human form, or rather shadow, than anything else. as it stood, wholly apart and distinct from the air and the light around it, its dimensions seemed gigantic; the summit nearly touched the ceiling. while i gazed, a feeling of intense cold seized me. an iceberg before me could not more have chilled me; nor could the cold of an iceberg have been more purely physical. i feel convinced that it was not the cold caused by fear. as i continued to gaze, i thought--but this i cannot say with precision--that i distinguished two eyes looking down on me from the height. one moment i seemed to distinguish them clearly, the next they seemed gone; but two rays of a pale blue light frequently shot through the darkness, as from the height on which i half believed, half doubted, that i had encountered the eyes. i strove to speak; my voice utterly failed me. i could only think to myself, “is this fear? it is _not_ fear!” i strove to rise, in vain; i felt as if weighed down by an irresistible force. indeed, my impression was that of an immense and overwhelming power opposed to my volition; that sense of utter inadequacy to cope with a force beyond men’s, which one may feel _physically_ in a storm at sea, in a conflagration, or when confronting some terrible wild beast, or rather, perhaps, the shark of the ocean, i felt _morally_. opposed to my will was another will, as far superior to its strength as storm, fire, and shark are superior in material force to the force of men. and now, as this impression grew on me, now came, at last, horror,--horror to a degree that no words can convey. still i retained pride, if not courage; and in my own mind i said, “this is horror, but it is not fear; unless i fear, i cannot be harmed; my reason rejects this thing; it is an illusion, i do not fear.” with a violent effort i succeeded at last in stretching out my hand towards the weapon on the table; as i did so, on the arm and shoulder i received a strange shock, and my arm fell to my side powerless. and now, to add to my horror, the light began slowly to wane from the candles; they were not, as it were, extinguished, but their flame seemed very gradually withdrawn; it was the same with the fire, the light was extracted from the fuel; in a few minutes the room was in utter darkness. the dread that came over me to be thus in the dark with that dark thing, whose power was so intensely felt, brought a reaction of nerve. in fact, terror had reached that climax, that either my senses must have deserted me, or i must have burst through the spell. i did burst through it. i found voice, though the voice was a shriek. i remember that i broke forth with words like these, “i do not fear, my soul does not fear”; and at the same time i found strength to rise. still in that profound gloom i rushed to one of the windows, tore aside the curtain, flung open the shutters; my first thought was, light. and when i saw the moon, high, clear, and calm, i felt a joy that almost compensated for the previous terror. there was the moon, there was also the light from the gas-lamps in the deserted, slumberous street. i turned to look back into the room; the moon penetrated its shadow very palely and partially, but still there was light. the dark thing, whatever it might be, was gone; except that i could yet see a dim shadow, which seemed the shadow of that shade, against the opposite wall. my eye now rested on the table, and from under the table (which was without cloth or cover, an old mahogany round table) rose a hand, visible as far as the wrist. it was a hand, seemingly, as much of flesh and blood as my own, but the hand of an aged person, lean, wrinkled, small too, a woman’s hand. that hand very softly closed on the two letters that lay on the table; hand and letters both vanished. then came the same three loud measured knocks i had heard at the bed-head before this extraordinary drama had commenced. as these sounds slowly ceased, i felt the whole room vibrate sensibly; and at the far end rose, as from the floor, sparks or globules like bubbles of light, many-colored,--green, yellow, fire-red, azure,--up and down, to and fro, hither, thither, as tiny will-o’-the-wisps the sparks moved, slow or swift, each at its own caprice. a chair (as in the drawing-room below) was now advanced from the wall without apparent agency, and placed at the opposite side of the table. suddenly, as forth from the chair, grew a shape, a woman’s shape. it was distinct as a shape of life, ghastly as a shape of death. the face was that of youth, with a strange, mournful beauty; the throat and shoulders were bare, the rest of the form in a loose robe of cloudy white. it began sleeking its long yellow hair, which fell over its shoulders; its eyes were not turned toward me, but to the door; it seemed listening, watching, waiting. the shadow of the shade in the background grew darker; and again i thought i beheld the eyes gleaming out from the summit of the shadow, eyes fixed upon that shape. as if from the door, though it did not open, grew out another shape, equally distinct, equally ghastly,--a man’s shape, a young man’s. it was in the dress of the last century, or rather in a likeness of such dress; for both the male shape and the female, though defined, were evidently unsubstantial, impalpable,--simulacra, phantasms; and there was something incongruous, grotesque, yet fearful, in the contrast between the elaborate finery, the courtly precision of that old-fashioned garb, with its ruffles and lace and buckles, and the corpse-like aspect and ghost-like stillness of the flitting wearer. just as the male shape approached the female, the dark shadow darted from the wall, all three for a moment wrapped in darkness. when the pale light returned, the two phantoms were as if in the grasp of the shadow that towered between them, and there was a blood-stain on the breast of the female; and the phantom male was leaning on its phantom sword, and blood seemed trickling fast from the ruffles, from the lace; and the darkness of the intermediate shadow swallowed them up, they were gone. and again the bubbles of light shot, and sailed, and undulated, growing thicker and thicker and more wildly confused in their movements. the closet door to the right of the fireplace now opened, and from the aperture came the form of a woman, aged. in her hand she held letters,--the very letters over which i had seen _the_ hand close; and behind her i heard a footstep. she turned round as if to listen, and then she opened the letters and seemed to read: and over her shoulder i saw a livid face, the face as of a man long drowned,--bloated, bleached, seaweed tangled in its dripping hair; and at her feet lay a form as of a corpse, and beside the corpse cowered a child, a miserable, squalid child, with famine in its cheeks and fear in its eyes. and as i looked in the old woman’s face, the wrinkles and lines vanished, and it became a face of youth,--hard-eyed, stony, but still youth; and the shadow darted forth and darkened over these phantoms, as it had darkened over the last. nothing now was left but the shadow, and on that my eyes were intently fixed, till again eyes grew out of the shadow,--malignant, serpent eyes. and the bubbles of light again rose and fell, and in their disordered, irregular, turbulent maze mingled with the wan moonlight. and now from these globules themselves, as from the shell of an egg, monstrous things burst out; the air grew filled with them; larvæ so bloodless and so hideous that i can in no way describe them, except to remind the reader of the swarming life which the solar microscope brings before his eyes in a drop of water,--things transparent, supple, agile, chasing each other, devouring each other,--forms like naught ever beheld by the naked eye. as the shapes were without symmetry, so their movements were without order. in their very vagrancies there was no sport; they came round me and round, thicker and faster and swifter, swarming over my head, crawling over my right arm, which was outstretched in involuntary command against all evil beings. sometimes i felt myself touched, but not by them; invisible hands touched me. once i felt the clutch as of cold, soft fingers at my throat. i was still equally conscious that if i gave way to fear i should be in bodily peril, and i concentred all my faculties in the single focus of resisting, stubborn will. and i turned my sight from the shadow, above all from those strange serpent eyes,--eyes that had now become distinctly visible. for there, though in naught else around me, i was aware that there was a will, and a will of intense, creative, working evil, which might crush down my own. the pale atmosphere in the room began now to redden as if in the air of some near conflagration. the larvæ grew lurid as things that live in fire. again the room vibrated; again were heard the three measured knocks; and again all things were swallowed up in the darkness of the dark shadow, as if out of that darkness all had come, into that darkness all returned. as the gloom receded, the shadow was wholly gone. slowly as it had been withdrawn, the flame grew again into the candles on the table, again into the fuel in the grate. the whole room came once more calmly, healthfully into sight. the two doors were still closed, the door communicating with the servant’s room still locked. in the corner of the wall, into which he had convulsively niched himself, lay the dog. i called to him,--no movement; i approached,--the animal was dead; his eyes protruded, his tongue out of his mouth, the froth gathered round his jaws. i took him in my arms; i brought him to the fire; i felt acute grief for the loss of my poor favorite, acute self-reproach; i accused myself of his death; i imagined he had died of fright. but what was my surprise on finding that his neck was actually broken,--actually twisted out of the vertebræ. had this been done in the dark? must it not have been done by a hand human as mine? must there not have been a human agency all the while in that room? good cause to suspect it. i cannot tell. i cannot do more than state the fact fairly; the reader may draw his own inference. another surprising circumstance,--my watch was restored to the table from which it had been so mysteriously withdrawn; but it had stopped at the very moment it was so withdrawn; nor, despite all the skill of the watchmaker, has it ever gone since: that is, it will go in a strange, erratic way for a few hours, and then comes to a dead stop; it is worthless. nothing more chanced for the rest of the night; nor, indeed, had i long to wait before the dawn broke. not till it was broad daylight did i quit the haunted house. before i did so, i revisited the little blind room in which my servant and i had been for a time imprisoned. i had a strong impression, for which i could not account, that from that room had originated the mechanism of the phenomena, if i may use the term, which had been experienced in my chamber; and though i entered it now in the clear day, with the sun peering through the filmy window, i still felt, as i stood on its floor, the creep of the horror which i had first experienced there the night before, and which had been so aggravated by what had passed in my own chamber. i could not, indeed, bear to stay more than half a minute within those walls. i descended the stairs, and again i heard the footfall before me; and when i opened the street door i thought i could distinguish a very low laugh. i gained my own home, expecting to find my runaway servant there. but he had not presented himself; nor did i hear more of him for three days, when i received a letter from him, dated from liverpool, to this effect:-- “honored sir,--i humbly entreat your pardon, though i can scarcely hope that you will think i deserve it, unless--which heaven forbid!--you saw what i did. i feel that it will be years before i can recover myself; and as to being fit for service, it is out of the question. i am therefore going to my brother-in-law at melbourne. the ship sails to-morrow. perhaps the long voyage may set me up. i do nothing now but start and tremble, and fancy it is behind me. i humbly beg you, honored sir, to order my clothes, and whatever wages are due to me, to be sent to my mother’s at walworth: john knows her address.” the letter ended with additional apologies, somewhat incoherent, and explanatory details as to effects that had been under the writer’s charge. this flight may perhaps warrant a suspicion that the man wished to go to australia, and had been somehow or other fraudulently mixed up with the events of the night. i say nothing in refutation of that conjecture; rather, i suggest it as one that would seem to many persons the most probable solution of improbable occurrences. my own theory remained unshaken. i returned in the evening to the house, to bring away in a hack cab the things i had left there, with my poor dog’s body. in this task i was not disturbed, nor did any incident worth note befall me, except that still, on ascending and descending the stairs, i heard the same footfall in advance. on leaving the house, i went to mr. j----’s. he was at home. i returned him the keys, told him that my curiosity was sufficiently gratified, and was about to relate quickly what had passed, when he stopped me and said, though with much politeness, that he had no longer any interest in a mystery which none had ever solved. i determined at least to tell him of the two letters i had read, as well as of the extraordinary manner in which they had disappeared; and i then inquired if he thought they had been addressed to the woman who had died in the house, and if there were anything in her early history which could possibly confirm the dark suspicions to which the letters gave rise. mr. j---- seemed startled, and, after musing a few moments, answered: “i know but little of the woman’s earlier history, except, as i before told you, that her family were known to mine. but you revive some vague reminiscences to her prejudice. i will make inquiries, and inform you of their result. still, even if we could admit the popular superstition that a person who had been either the perpetrator or the victim of dark crimes in life could revisit, as a restless spirit, the scene in which those crimes had been committed, i should observe that the house was infested by strange sights and sounds before the old woman died. you smile; what would you say?” “i would say this: that i am convinced, if we could get to the bottom of these mysteries, we should find a living, human agency.” “what! you believe it is all an imposture? for what object?” “not an imposture, in the ordinary sense of the word. if suddenly i were to sink into a deep sleep, from which you could not awake me, but in that deep sleep could answer questions with an accuracy which i could not pretend to when awake,--tell you what money you had in your pocket, nay, describe your very thoughts,--it is not necessarily an imposture, any more than it is necessarily supernatural. i should be, unconsciously to myself, under a mesmeric influence, conveyed to me from a distance by a human being who had acquired power over me by previous _rapport_.” “granting mesmerism, so far carried, to be a fact, you are right. and you would infer from this that a mesmerizer might produce the extraordinary effects you and others have witnessed over inanimate objects,--fill the air with sights and sounds?” “or impress our senses with the belief in them, we never having been _en rapport_ with the person acting on us? no. what is commonly called mesmerism could not do this; but there may be a power akin to mesmerism, and superior to it,--the power that in the old days was called magic. that such a power may extend to all inanimate objects of matter, i do not say; but if so, it would not be against nature, only a rare power in nature, which might be given to constitutions with certain peculiarities, and cultivated by practice to an extraordinary degree. that such a power might extend over the dead,--that is, over certain thoughts and memories that the dead may still retain,--and compel, not that which ought properly to be called the soul, and which is far beyond human reach, but rather a phantom of what has been most earth-stained on earth, to make itself apparent to our senses,--is a very ancient though obsolete theory, upon which i will hazard no opinion. but i do not conceive the power would be supernatural. let me illustrate what i mean, from an experiment which paracelsus describes as not difficult, and which the author of the ‘curiosities of literature’ cites as credible: a flower perishes; you burn it. whatever were the elements of that flower while it lived are gone, dispersed, you know not whither; you can never discover nor re-collect them. but you can, by chemistry, out of the burnt dust of that flower, raise a spectrum of the flower, just as it seemed in life. it may be the same with a human being. the soul has as much escaped you as the essence or elements of the flower. still you may make a spectrum of it. and this phantom, though in the popular superstition it is held to be the soul of the departed, must not be confounded with the true soul; it is but the eidolon of the dead form. hence, like the best-attested stories of ghosts or spirits, the thing that most strikes us is the absence of what we hold to be soul,--that is, of superior, emancipated intelligence. they come for little or no object; they seldom speak, if they do come; they utter no ideas above those of an ordinary person on earth. these american spiritseers have published volumes of communications in prose and verse, which they assert to be given in the names of the most illustrious dead,--shakespeare, bacon, heaven knows whom. those communications, taking the best, are certainly of not a whit higher order than would be communications from living persons of fair talent and education; they are wondrously inferior to what bacon, shakespeare, and plato said and wrote when on earth. nor, what is more notable, do they ever contain an idea that was not on the earth before. wonderful, therefore, as such phenomena may be (granting them to be truthful), i see much that philosophy may question, nothing that it is incumbent on philosophy to deny, namely, nothing supernatural. they are but ideas conveyed somehow or other (we have not yet discovered the means) from one mortal brain to another. whether in so doing tables walk of their own accord, or fiend-like shapes appear in a magic circle, or bodiless hands rise and remove material objects, or a thing of darkness, such as presented itself to me, freeze our blood,--still am i persuaded that these are but agencies conveyed, as by electric wires, to my own brain from the brain of another. in some constitutions there is a natural chemistry, and those may produce chemic wonders; in others a natural fluid, call it electricity, and these produce electric wonders. but they differ in this from normal science: they are alike objectless, purposeless, puerile, frivolous. they lead on to no grand results, and therefore the world does not heed, and true sages have not cultivated them. but sure i am, that of all i saw or heard, a man, human as myself, was the remote originator; and, i believe, unconsciously to himself as to the exact effects produced, for this reason: no two persons, you say, have ever told you that they experienced exactly the same thing; well, observe, no two persons ever experience exactly the same dream. if this were an ordinary imposture, the machinery would be arranged for results that would but little vary; if it were a supernatural agency permitted by the almighty, it would surely be for some definite end. these phenomena belong to neither class. my persuasion is, that they originate in some brain now far distant; that that brain had no distinct volition in anything that occurred; that what does occur reflects but its devious, motley, ever-shifting, half-formed thoughts; in short, that it has been but the dreams of such a brain put into action and invested with a semi-substance. that this brain is of immense power, that it can set matter into movement, that it is malignant and destructive, i believe. some material force must have killed my dog; it might, for aught i know, have sufficed to kill myself, had i been as subjugated by terror as the dog,--had my intellect or my spirit given me no countervailing resistance in my will.” “it killed your dog! that is fearful! indeed, it is strange that no animal can be induced to stay in that house; not even a cat. rats and mice are never found in it.” “the instincts of the brute creation detect influences deadly to their existence. man’s reason has a sense less subtle, because it has a resisting power more supreme. but enough; do you comprehend my theory?” “yes, though imperfectly; and i accept any crotchet (pardon the word), however odd, rather than embrace at once the notion of ghosts and hobgoblins we imbibed in our nurseries. still, to my unfortunate house the evil is the same. what on earth can i do with the house?” “i will tell you what i would do. i am convinced from my own internal feelings that the small unfurnished room, at right angles to the door of the bedroom which i occupied, forms a starting-point or receptacle for the influences which haunt the house; and i strongly advise you to have the walls opened, the floor removed, nay, the whole room pulled down. i observe that it is detached from the body of the house, built over the small back yard, and could be removed without injury to the rest of the building.” “and you think if i did that--” “you would cut off the telegraph-wires. try it. i am so persuaded that i am right, that i will pay half the expense, if you will allow me to direct the operations.” “nay, i am well able to afford the cost; for the rest, allow me to write to you.” about ten days afterwards i received a letter from mr. j----, telling me that he had visited the house since i had seen him; that he had found the two letters i had described replaced in the drawer from which i had taken them; that he had read them with misgivings like my own; that he had instituted a cautious inquiry about the woman to whom i rightly conjectured they had been written. it seemed that thirty-six years ago (a year before the date of the letters) she had married, against the wish of her relatives, an american of very suspicious character; in fact, he was generally believed to have been a pirate. she herself was the daughter of very respectable tradespeople, and had served in the capacity of nursery governess before her marriage. she had a brother, a widower, who was considered wealthy, and who had one child about six years old. a month after the marriage, the body of this brother was found in the thames, near london bridge; there seemed some marks of violence about his throat, but they were not deemed sufficient to warrant the inquest in any other verdict than that of “found drowned.” the american and his wife took charge of the little boy, the deceased brother having by his will left his sister the guardian of his only child, and in event of the child’s death the sister inherited. the child died about six months afterward; it was supposed to have been neglected and ill-treated. the neighbors deposed to have heard it shriek at night. the surgeon who had examined it after death said that it was emaciated as if from want of nourishment, and the body was covered with livid bruises. it seemed that one winter night the child had sought to escape; had crept out into the back yard, tried to scale the wall, fallen back exhausted, and had been found at morning on the stones in a dying state. but though there was some evidence of cruelty, there was none of murder; and the aunt and her husband had sought to palliate cruelty by alleging the exceeding stubbornness and perversity of the child, who was declared to be half-witted. be that as it may, at the orphan’s death the aunt inherited her brother’s fortune. before the first wedded year was out, the american quitted england abruptly, and never returned to it. he obtained a cruising vessel, which was lost in the atlantic two years afterwards. the widow was left in affluence; but reverses of various kinds had befallen her; a bank broke, an investment failed, she went into a small business and became insolvent, then she entered into service, sinking lower and lower, from housekeeper down to maid-of-all-work, never long retaining a place, though nothing peculiar against her character was ever alleged. she was considered sober, honest, and peculiarly quiet in her ways; still nothing prospered with her. and so she had dropped into the workhouse, from which mr. j---- had taken her, to be placed in charge of the very house which she had rented as mistress in the first year of her wedded life. mr. j---- added, that he had passed an hour alone in the unfurnished room which i had urged him to destroy, and that his impressions of dread while there were so great, though he had neither heard nor seen anything, that he was eager to have the walls bared and the floors removed, as i had suggested. he had engaged persons for the work, and would commence any day i would name. the day was accordingly fixed. i repaired to the haunted house; we went into the blind, dreary room, took up the skirting, and then the floors. under the rafters, covered with rubbish, was found a trap-door, quite large enough to admit a man. it was closely nailed down with clamps and rivets of iron. on removing these we descended into a room below, the existence of which had never been suspected. in this room there had been a window and a flue, but they had been bricked over, evidently for many years. by the help of candles we examined this place; it still retained some mouldering furniture,--three chairs, an oak settee, a table,--all of the fashion of about eighty years ago. there was a chest of drawers against the wall, in which we found, half rotted away, old-fashioned articles of a man’s dress, such as might have been worn eighty or a hundred years ago, by a gentleman of some rank; costly steel buckles and buttons, like those yet worn in court-dresses, a handsome court-sword; in a waistcoat which had once been rich with gold-lace, but which was now blackened and foul with damp, we found five guineas, a few silver coins, and an ivory ticket, probably for some place of entertainment long since passed away. but our main discovery was in a kind of iron safe fixed to the wall, the lock of which it cost us much trouble to get picked. in this safe were three shelves and two small drawers. ranged on the shelves were several small bottles of crystal, hermetically stopped. they contained colorless volatile essences, of what nature i shall say no more than that they were not poisons; phosphor and ammonia entered into some of them. there were also some very curious glass tubes, and a small pointed rod of iron, with a large lump of rock-crystal, and another of amber, also a loadstone of great power. in one of the drawers we found a miniature portrait set in gold, and retaining the freshness of its colors most remarkably, considering the length of time it had probably been there. the portrait was that of a man who might be somewhat advanced in middle life, perhaps forty-seven or forty-eight. it was a most peculiar face, a most impressive face. if you could fancy some mighty serpent transformed into man, preserving in the human lineaments the old serpent type, you would have a better idea of that countenance than long descriptions can convey; the width and flatness of frontal, the tapering elegance of contour, disguising the strength of the deadly jaw; the long, large, terrible eye, glittering and green as the emerald, and withal a certain ruthless calm, as if from the consciousness of an immense power. the strange thing was this: the instant i saw the miniature i recognized a startling likeness to one of the rarest portraits in the world; the portrait of a man of rank only below that of royalty, who in his own day had made a considerable noise. history says little or nothing of him; but search the correspondence of his contemporaries, and you find reference to his wild daring, his bold profligacy, his restless spirit, his taste for the occult sciences. while still in the meridian of life he died and was buried, so say the chronicles, in a foreign land. he died in time to escape the grasp of the law; for he was accused of crimes which would have given him to the headsman. after his death, the portraits of him, which had been numerous, for he had been a munificent encourager of art, were bought up and destroyed, it was supposed by his heirs, who might have been glad could they have razed his very name from their splendid line. he had enjoyed vast wealth; a large portion of this was believed to have been embezzled by a favorite astrologer or soothsayer; at all events, it had unaccountably vanished at the time of his death. one portrait alone of him was supposed to have escaped the general destruction; i had seen it in the house of a collector some months before. it had made on me a wonderful impression, as it does on all who behold it; a face never to be forgotten; and there was that face in the miniature that lay within my hand. true, that in the miniature the man was a few years older than in the portrait i had seen, or than the original was even at the time of his death. but a few years!--why, between the date in which flourished that direful noble, and the date in which the miniature was evidently painted, there was an interval of more than two centuries. while i was thus gazing, silent and wondering, mr. j---- said,-- “but is it possible? i have known this man.” “how? where?” cried i. “in india. he was high in the confidence of the rajah of----, and wellnigh drew him into a revolt which would have lost the rajah his dominions. the man was a frenchman, his name de v----; clever, bold, lawless. we insisted on his dismissal and banishment; it must be the same man, no two faces like his, yet this miniature seems nearly a hundred years old.” mechanically i turned round the miniature to examine the back of it, and on the back was engraved a pentacle; in the middle of the pentacle a ladder, and the third step of the ladder was formed by the date <UNK> examining still more minutely, i detected a spring; this, on being pressed, opened the back of the miniature as a lid. within-side the lid were engraved, “mariana, to thee. be faithful in life and in death to----.” here follows a name that i will not mention, but it was not unfamiliar to me. i had heard it spoken of by old men in my childhood as the name borne by a dazzling charlatan, who had made a great sensation in london for a year or so, and had fled the country on the charge of a double murder within his own house,--that of his mistress and his rival. i said nothing of this to mr. j----, to whom reluctantly i resigned the miniature. we had found no difficulty in opening the first drawer within the iron safe; we found great difficulty in opening the second: it was not locked, but it resisted all efforts, till we inserted in the chinks the edge of a chisel. when we had thus drawn it forth, we found a very singular apparatus, in the nicest order. upon a small, thin book, or rather tablet, was placed a saucer of crystal; this saucer was filled with a clear liquid; on that liquid floated a kind of compass, with a needle shifting rapidly round; but instead of the usual points of a compass, were seven strange characters, not very unlike those used by astrologers to denote the planets. a very peculiar, but not strong nor displeasing odor came from this drawer, which was lined with a wood that we afterward discovered to be hazel. whatever the cause of this odor, it produced a material effect on the nerves. we all felt it, even the two workmen who were in the room; a creeping, tingling sensation, from the tips of the fingers to the roots of the hair. impatient to examine the tablet, i removed the saucer. as i did so, the needle of the compass went round and round with exceeding swiftness, and i felt a shock that ran through my whole frame, so that i dropped the saucer on the floor. the liquid was spilt, the saucer was broken, the compass rolled to the end of the room, and at that instant the walls shook to and fro as if a giant had swayed and rocked them. the two workmen were so frightened that they ran up the ladder by which we had descended from the trap-door; but, seeing that nothing more happened, they were easily induced to return. meanwhile, i had opened the tablet; it was bound in plain red leather, with a silver clasp; it contained but one sheet of thick vellum, and on that sheet were inscribed, within a double pentacle, words in old monkish latin, which are literally to be translated thus: “on all that it can reach within these walls, sentient or inanimate, living or dead, as moves the needle, so works my will! accursed be the house, and restless the dwellers therein.” we found no more. mr. j---- burnt the tablet and its anathema. he razed to the foundation the part of the building containing the secret room, with the chamber over it. he had then the courage to inhabit the house himself for a month, and a quieter, better conditioned house could not be found in all london. subsequently he let it to advantage, and his tenant has made no complaints. but my story is not yet done. a few days after mr. j---- had removed into the house, i paid him a visit. we were standing by the open window and conversing. a van containing some articles of furniture which he was moving from his former house was at the door. i had just urged on him my theory, that all those phenomena regarded as supermundane had emanated from a human brain; adducing the charm, or rather curse, we had found and destroyed, in support of my theory. mr. j---- was observing in reply, “that even if mesmerism, or whatever analogous power it might be called, could really thus work in the absence of the operator, and produce effects so extraordinary, still could those effects continue when the operator himself was dead? and if the spell had been wrought, and, indeed, the room walled up, more than seventy years ago, the probability was, that the operator had long since departed this life,”--mr. j----, i say, was thus answering, when i caught hold of his arm and pointed to the street below. a well-dressed man had crossed from the opposite side, and was accosting the carrier in charge of the van. his face, as he stood, was exactly fronting our window. it was the face of the miniature we had discovered; it was the face of the portrait of the noble three centuries ago. “good heavens!” cried mr. j----, “that is the face of de v----, and scarcely a day older than when i saw it in the rajah’s court in my youth!” seized by the same thought, we both hastened down stairs; i was first in the street, but the man had already gone. i caught sight of him, however, not many yards in advance, and in another moment i was by his side. i had resolved to speak to him; but when i looked into his face, i felt as if it were impossible to do so. that eye--the eye of the serpent--fixed and held me spellbound. and withal, about the man’s whole person there was a dignity, an air of pride and station and superiority, that would have made any one, habituated to the usages of the world, hesitate long before venturing upon a liberty or impertinence. and what could i say? what was it i could ask? thus ashamed of my first impulse, i fell a few paces back, still, however, following the stranger, undecided what else to do. meanwhile, he turned the corner of the street; a plain carriage was in waiting with a servant out of livery, dressed like a _valet de place_, at the carriage door. in another moment he had stepped into the carriage, and it drove off. i returned to the house. mr. j---- was still at the street door. he had asked the carrier what the stranger had said to him. “merely asked whom that house now belonged to.” the same evening i happened to go with a friend to a place in town called the cosmopolitan club, a place open to men of all countries, all opinions, all degrees. one orders one’s coffee, smokes one’s cigar. one is always sure to meet agreeable, sometimes remarkable persons. i had not been two minutes in the room before i beheld at table, conversing with an acquaintance of mine, whom i will designate by the initial g----, the man, the original of the miniature. he was now without his hat, and the likeness was yet more startling, only i observed that while he was conversing, there was less severity in the countenance; there was even a smile, though a very quiet and very cold one. the dignity of mien i had acknowledged in the street was also more striking; a dignity akin to that which invests some prince of the east, conveying the idea of supreme indifference and habitual, indisputable, indolent, but resistless power. g---- soon after left the stranger, who then took up a scientific journal, which seemed to absorb his attention. i drew g---- aside. “who and what is that gentleman?” “that? oh, a very remarkable man indeed! i met him last year amidst the caves of petra, the scriptural edom. he is the best oriental scholar i know. we joined company, had an adventure with robbers, in which he showed a coolness that saved our lives; afterward he invited me to spend a day with him in a house he had bought at damascus, a house buried amongst almond-blossoms and roses; the most beautiful thing! he had lived there for some years, quite as an oriental, in grand style. i half suspect he is a renegade, immensely rich, very odd; by the by, a great mesmerizer. i have seen him with my own eyes produce an effect on inanimate things. if you take a letter from your pocket and throw it to the other end of the room, he will order it to come to his feet, and you will see the letter wriggle itself along the floor till it has obeyed his command. ’pon my honor ’tis true; i have seen him affect even the weather; disperse or collect clouds, by means of a glass tube or wand. but he does not like talking of these matters to strangers. he has only just arrived in england; says he has not been here for a great many years; let me introduce him to you.” “certainly! he is english, then? what is his name?” “oh! a very homely one,--richards.” “and what is his birth,--his family?” “how do i know? what does it signify? no doubt some _parvenu_; but rich, so infernally rich!” g---- drew me up to the stranger, and the introduction was effected. the manners of mr. richards were not those of an adventurous traveller. travellers are in general gifted with high animal spirits; they are talkative, eager, imperious. mr. richards was calm and subdued in tone, with manners which were made distant by the loftiness of punctilious courtesy, the manners of a former age. i observed that the english he spoke was not exactly of our day. i should even have said that the accent was slightly foreign. but then mr. richards remarked that he had been little in the habit for many years of speaking in his native tongue. the conversation fell upon the changes in the aspect of london since he had last visited our metropolis. g---- then glanced off to the moral changes,--literary, social, political,--the great men who were removed from the stage within the last twenty years; the new great men who were coming on. in all this mr. richards evinced no interest. he had evidently read none of our living authors, and seemed scarcely acquainted by name with our younger statesmen. once, and only once, he laughed; it was when g---- asked him whether he had any thoughts of getting into parliament. and the laugh was inward, sarcastic, sinister; a sneer raised into a laugh. after a few minutes, g---- left us to talk to some other acquaintances who had just lounged into the room, and i then said, quietly,-- “i have seen a miniature of you, mr. richards, in the house you once inhabited, and perhaps built,--if not wholly, at least in part,--in oxford street. you passed by that house this morning.” not till i had finished did i raise my eyes to his, and then his fixed my gaze so steadfastly that i could not withdraw it,--those fascinating serpent-eyes. but involuntarily, and as if the words that translated my thought were dragged from me, i added in a low whisper, “i have been a student in the mysteries of life and nature; of those mysteries i have known the occult professors. i have the right to speak to you thus.” and i uttered a certain password. “well, i concede the right. what would you ask?” “to what extent human will in certain temperaments can extend?” “to what extent can thought extend? think, and before you draw breath you are in china!” “true; but my thought has no power in china!” “give it expression, and it may have. you may write down a thought which, sooner or later, may alter the whole condition of china. what is a law but a thought? therefore thought is infinite. therefore thought has power; not in proportion to its value,--a bad thought may make a bad law as potent as a good thought can make a good one.” “yes; what you say confirms my own theory. through invisible currents one human brain may transmit its ideas to other human brains, with the same rapidity as a thought promulgated by visible means. and as thought is imperishable, as it leaves its stamp behind it in the natural world, even when the thinker has passed out of this world, so the thought of the living may have power to rouse up and revive the thoughts of the dead, such as those thoughts _were in life_, though the thought of the living cannot reach the thoughts which the dead _now_ may entertain. is it not so?” “i decline to answer, if in my judgment thought has the limit you would fix to it. but proceed; you have a special question you wish to put.” “intense malignity in an intense will, engendered in a peculiar temperament, and aided by natural means within the reach of science, may produce effects like those ascribed of old to evil magic. it might thus haunt the walls of a human habitation with spectral revivals of all guilty thoughts and guilty deeds once conceived and done within those walls; all, in short, with which the evil will claims _rapport_ and affinity,--imperfect, incoherent, fragmentary snatches at the old dramas acted therein years ago. thoughts thus crossing each other haphazard, as in the nightmare of a vision, growing up into phantom sights and sounds, and all serving to create horror; not because those sights and sounds are really visitations from a world without, but that they are ghastly, monstrous renewals of what have been in this world itself, set into malignant play by a malignant mortal. and it is through the material agency of that human brain that these things would acquire even a human power; would strike as with the shock of electricity, and might kill, if the thought of the person assailed did not rise superior to the dignity of the original assailer; might kill the most powerful animal, if unnerved by fear, but not injure the feeblest man, if, while his flesh crept, his mind stood out fearless. thus when in old stories we read of a magician rent to pieces by the fiends he had invoked, or still more, in eastern legends, that one magician succeeds by arts in destroying another, there may be so far truth, that a material being has clothed, from his own evil propensities, certain elements and fluids, usually quiescent or harmless, with awful shapes and terrific force; just as the lightning, that had lain hidden and innocent in the cloud, becomes by natural law suddenly risible, takes a distinct shape to the eye, and can strike destruction on the object to which it is attracted.” “you are not without glimpses of a mighty secret,” said mr. richards, composedly. “according to your view, could a mortal obtain the power you speak of, he would necessarily be a malignant and evil being.” “if the power were exercised, as i have said, most malignant and most evil; though i believe in the ancient traditions, that he could not injure the good. his will could only injure those with whom it has established an affinity, or over whom it forces unresisted sway. i will now imagine an example that may be within the laws of nature, yet seem wild as the fables of a bewildered monk. “you will remember that albertus magnus, after describing minutely the process by which spirits may be invoked and commanded, adds emphatically, that the process will instruct and avail only to the few; that _a man must be born a magician!_ that is, born with a peculiar physical temperament, as a man is born a poet. rarely are men in whose constitution lurks this occult power of the highest order of intellect; usually in the intellect there is some twist, perversity, or disease. but, on the other hand, they must possess, to an astonishing degree, the faculty to concentrate thought on a single object,--the energic faculty that we call will. therefore, though their intellect be not sound, it is exceedingly forcible for the attainment of what it desires. i will imagine such a person, pre-eminently gifted with this constitution and its concomitant forces. i will place him in the loftier grades of society. i will suppose his desires emphatically those of the sensualist; he has, therefore, a strong love of life. he is an absolute egotist; his will is concentred in himself; he has fierce passions; he knows no enduring, no holy affections, but he can covet eagerly what for the moment he desires; he can hate implacably what opposes itself to his objects; he can commit fearful crimes, yet feel small remorse; he resorts rather to curses upon others, than to penitence for his misdeeds. circumstances, to which his constitution guides him, lead him to a rare knowledge of the natural secrets which may serve his egotism. he is a close observer where his passions encourage observation; he is a minute calculator, not from love of truth, but where love of self sharpens his faculties; therefore he can be a man of science. i suppose such a being, having by experience learned the power of his arts over others, trying what may be the power of will over his own frame, and studying all that in natural philosophy may increase that power. he loves life, he dreads death; _he wills to live on_. he cannot restore himself to youth, he cannot entirely stay the progress of death, he cannot make himself immortal in the flesh and blood; but he may arrest, for a time so long as to appear incredible if i said it, that hardening of the parts which constitutes old age. a year may age him no more than an hour ages another. his intense will, scientifically trained into system, operates, in short, over the wear and tear of his own frame. he lives on. that he may not seem a portent and a miracle, he _dies_, from time to time, seemingly, to certain persons. having schemed the transfer of a wealth that suffices to his wants, he disappears from one corner of the world, and contrives that his obsequies shall be celebrated. he reappears at another corner of the world, where he resides undetected, and does not visit the scenes of his former career till all who could remember his features are no more. he would be profoundly miserable if he had affections; he has none but for himself. no good man would accept his longevity; and to no man, good or bad, would he or could he communicate its true secret. such a man might exist; such a man as i have described i see now before me,--duke of----, in the court of----, dividing time between lust and brawl, alchemists and wizards; again, in the last century, charlatan and criminal, with name less noble, domiciled in the house at which you gazed to-day, and flying from the law you had outraged, none knew whither; traveller once more revisiting london, with the same earthly passions which filled your heart when races now no more walked through yonder streets; outlaw from the school of all the nobler and diviner mysteries. execrable image of life in death and death in life, i warn you back from the cities and homes of healthful men! back to the ruins of departed empires! back to the deserts of nature unredeemed!” there answered me a whisper so musical, so potently musical, that it seemed to enter into my whole being, and subdue me despite myself. thus it said:-- “i have sought one like you for the last hundred years. now i have found you, we part not till i know what i desire. the vision that sees through the past and cleaves through the veil of the future is in you at this hour,--never before, never to come again. the vision of no puling, fantastic girl, of no sick-bed somnambule, but of a strong man with a vigorous brain. soar, and look forth!” as he spoke, i felt as if i rose out of myself upon eagle wings. all the weight seemed gone from air, roofless the room, roofless the dome of space. i was not in the body,--where, i knew not; but aloft over time, over earth. again i heard the melodious whisper: “you say right. i have mastered great secrets by the power of will. true, by will and by science i can retard the process of years; but death comes not by age alone. can i frustrate the accidents which bring death upon the young?” “no; every accident is a providence. before a providence, snaps every human will.” “shall i die at last, ages and ages hence, by the slow, though inevitable, growth of time, or by the cause that i call accident?” “by a cause you call accident.” “is not the end still remote?” asked the whisper, with a slight tremor. “regarded as my life regards time, it is still remote.” “and shall i, before then, mix with the world of men as i did ere i learned these secrets; resume eager interest in their strife and their trouble; battle with ambition, and use the power of the sage to win the power that belongs to kings?” “you will yet play a part on the earth that will fill earth with commotion and amaze. for wondrous designs have you, a wonder yourself, been permitted to live on through the centuries. all the secrets you have stored will then have their uses; all that now makes you a stranger amidst the generations will contribute then to make you their lord. as the trees and the straws are drawn into a whirlpool, as they spin round, are sucked to the deep, and again tossed aloft by the eddies, so shall races and thrones be drawn into your vortex. awful destroyer! but in destroying, made, against your own will, a constructor.” “and that date, too, is far off?” “far off; when it comes, think your end in this world is at hand!” “how and what is the end? look east, west, south, and north.” “in the north, where you never yet trod, toward the point whence your instincts have warned you, there a spectre will seize you. ’tis death! i see a ship! it is haunted; ’tis chased! it sails on. baffled navies sail after that ship. it enters the region of ice. it passes a sky red with meteors. two moons stand on high, over ice-reefs. i see the ship locked between white defiles; they are ice-rocks. i see the dead strew the decks, stark and livid, green mould on their limbs. all are dead but one man,--it is you! but years, though so slowly they come, have then scathed you. there is the coming of age on your brow, and the will is relaxed in the cells of the brain. still that will, though enfeebled, exceeds all that man knew before you; through the will you live on, gnawed with famine. and nature no longer obeys you in that death-spreading region; the sky is a sky of iron, and the air has iron clamps, and the ice-rocks wedge in the ship. hark how it cracks and groans! ice will imbed it as amber imbeds a straw. and a man has gone forth, living yet, from the ship and its dead; and he has clambered up the spikes of an iceberg, and the two moons gaze down on his form. that man is yourself, and terror is on you,--terror; and terror has swallowed up your will. and i see, swarming up the steep ice-rock, gray, grizzly things. the bears of the north have scented their quarry; they come near you and nearer, shambling, and rolling their bulk. and in that day every moment shall seem to you longer than the centuries through which you have passed. and heed this: after life, moments continued make the bliss or the hell of eternity.” “hush,” said the whisper. “but the day, you assure me, is far off, very far! i go back to the almond and rose of damascus! sleep!” the room swam before my eyes. i became insensible. when i recovered, i found g---- holding my hand and smiling. he said, “you, who have always declared yourself proof against mesmerism, have succumbed at last to my friend richards.” “where is mr. richards?” “gone, when you passed into a trance, saying quietly to me, ‘your friend will not wake for an hour.’” i asked, as collectedly as i could, where mr. richards lodged. “at the trafalgar hotel.” “give me your arm,” said i to g----. “let us call on him; i have something to say.” when we arrived at the hotel, we were told that mr. richards had returned twenty minutes before, paid his bill, left directions with his servant (a greek) to pack his effects, and proceed to malta by the steamer that should leave southampton the next day. mr. richards had merely said of his own movements, that he had visits to pay in the neighborhood of london, and it was uncertain whether he should be able to reach southampton in time for that steamer; if not, he should follow in the next one. the waiter asked me my name. on my informing him, he gave me a note that mr. richards had left for me, in case i called. the note was as follows:-- “i wished you to utter what was in your mind. you obeyed. i have therefore established power over you. for three months from this day you can communicate to no living man what has passed between us. you cannot even show this note to the friend by your side. during three months, silence complete as to me and mine. do you doubt my power to lay on you this command? try to disobey me. at the end of the third month the spell is raised. for the rest, i spare you. i shall visit your grave a year and a day after it has received you.” so ends this strange story, which i ask no one to believe. i write it down exactly three months after i received the above note. i could not write it before, nor could i show to g----, in spite of his urgent request, the note which i read under the gas-lamp by his side. [illustration: text decoration] d’outre mort. by harriet prescott spofford. a mountain intervale all velveted in green, and half the verdure overlaid with gold by broad rays of sunset falling level through the pass,--the hills, behind, a gray and gloomy encampment softened with wreaths of vapor and dim recesses of deepest purple, and here and there above the gaps a pale star trembling on the paler blue. in spite of the approaching night, there was a gay glad strength about the scene, so that all who saw it might have felt light at heart, as if the rocky rampart shut out the sorrows of the world and made the charmed valley an enchanted place. they had been mowing in the intervale; half-formed haycocks, picturesquely piled along the meadows, loaded the air with heavy sweetness; in one, partly overthrown, a lounger lolled luxuriously, singing idly to himself that little venetian song of browning’s, to some tune delightful as the words:-- “o, which were best, to roam or rest? the land’s lap or the water’s breast? to sleep on yellow millet-sheaves, or swim in lucid shallows, just eluding water-lily leaves, an inch from death’s black fingers thrust to lock you, whom release he must; which life were best on summer eves?” the perfumed wind blew softly over the singer, like a placid breath; the sense of gathering evening hung above him; he lay upon the billowy hay as if it were a cloud; he was a voluptuary in his pleasures; well for him if they were always as innocent. a young girl approached the singer, swinging her hat as she came, and radiant in the low sunshine. she was named orient,--either because she seemed, with her golden locks, her fresh fair tints, like an impersonation of morning and the east, or because when she was born hope’s day-star rose again in her mother’s forlorn heart. such a lovely yet half-fantastic creature was she, that you hardly believed in her existence when away from her. “what are you looking for, orient?” said the lounger. “the fountain of youth,” answered her silvery tones. “it should be somewhere in this happy valley.” “you do not need it,” he replied after a lingering glance. she stooped and extricated a long sweetbrier bough from the hay with which it had been bent but not cut down, and twisted it, still blossoming, round and round her head till it made a fragrant diadem of rosy stars. “do not,” said reymund. “take it off; or i shall have to do as voltaire did: erect my long, thin body and stand before you like a point of admiration!” orient did not reply; and, fulfilling his threat, he went on by her side to the old farm-house that had been turned into a summer hostelry for guests. more stars were beginning to steal forth in the tender firmament; the breeze blew down more freshly from the hills and brought the big dews and scattered starbeams with it; music was hushed, and all the world was still. it was summer evening, yet an unreal kind of summer, as summer might be in a distant dream, blown over by cool, awakening winds. now and then orient stopped to pick up a great butterfly that had fallen benumbed from its perch and lay it gently to rest among the leaves, without brushing a speck of dust from its freckled wings; after that her fingers worked in a vine by the way, and she pulled aside a tendril that kept a sleepy flower from shutting up its petals. as she did so, a little mother-bird upon her eggs stirred and briefly twittered out her secret to orient’s ear. reymund, who loitered in waiting for her, thought she seemed, as much as any of them, like a flower, a moth, a bird herself, a beautiful and almost dumb existence of nature. he was not a man easily intimidated, or of unvaried experience; but the thin atmosphere of awe about this girl was something he had never penetrated; the ease with which he met another, toward her became impertinence; gay and careless with many, he felt that she was something apart, sacred as a passion-flower; he scarcely dared approach her lightly; when he spoke to her he crossed himself in his heart. they had never met until a month ago, yet their address had been familiar almost from the first; on her side, through a large-eyed, childlike fearlessness; on his--he could not have answered why. he watched her as one watches a clear planet glow steadily from the soft, golden sky, but he seemed nevertheless to know all her characteristics without studying them,--he imagined that to one weary of trifle and artifice and the hollow way of the world, here was the rest divine. yet beyond a point, he found this cool, remote being inaccessible,--as though there had been a gulf between them. he knew not how to call the blush to her cheek, the sparkle to her eye; if she had been some alien creature she might have been nearer,--to enrich her with human love was as fruitless an effort as scattering the pollen of a rose into the heart of a cold white lily. and yet, reymund knew--as if through the same natural operations as those by which his pulse was made to beat, his breath to draw--that orient’s soul needed his for its entireness; that his soul required hers, all as much as a star needed its atmosphere, a flower its fragrance, the earth itself its spheral roundness. it was not so much that he already loved her passionately, as that he felt himself lost without her; he had been in orient’s presence, it seemed, all the time that he had ever lived; how could he then depart from it? if that which was a clod suddenly found itself a bed of blossom, how could it ever return again to dreary earthiness? he watched her now approaching. had any one said that she trailed lustre behind her as she walked, he would have answered that he had seen it. but to speak to her of any grace or charm or perfection that she possessed,--why, these things were herself, her identity, sacred and secret; as easily to some skyey messenger of solemn heaven commend his airy flight! “in what wonderful ways these mountains change their expression!” said reymund, as she joined him again at last. “yes,” she replied, “they are different beings every hour.” “a little while ago,” he continued, “they seemed like an army of giants sitting down to besiege the valley; now they are a wall between us and mankind; death cannot break through it, sickness cannot cross it.” “they are more alive than that,” said orient. “this old sombre one moved aside just now to make room for the little alp laughing over his shoulder, with the rosy vapor streaming high on her face.” “perhaps you hear what they are saying to one another, then?” he asked, half jestingly. “i often do.” “and you will translate?” “no. in the first place you would laugh; in the last place disbelieve.” “on my soul--no!” “i am not certain that you have a soul.” “indeed? is it so?” half sadly. “they say what the torrents rushing down by chamouni say!” “ah! and at other times?” “they talk of the beginning of the earth, and conjecture concerning the end of things.” “and do they take any notice of you? nature always seems to me careless and indifferent.” “they invite me to come up and lie down on their great sides where the sun has lain all day before me. yes, they always smile upon me.” “do not go,--at least until the mamma and i go with you.” “i should not be afraid alone.” no,--fear had never found the depths of those liquid, lucent eyes, he thought. “the mountains might be civil enough,” he rejoined, “and give you their purple berries to eat, their wild white brooks to drink; but i could not answer for the black bears and snakes.” “i think i could.” “and this, of course, is only what you interpret the hills to mean, sitting there in their grim conclave and affording us such a narrow coronal of sky?” asked reymund, smiling. “i do not know,” she answered doubtfully. “i said things were real to me.” “there must have been those like you, who first saw and believed in fairies and all the goblin people,” he said, still smiling. “my father died before i was born,” said orient. “perhaps that gave me some lien upon the spiritual world.” “then you see bogles as well as other things,--as well as the personalities of bud and bird and granite pile? uncanny creature! what pleasure shall i take in meeting your glance when it rests also on a dead man behind me, and on the fetch of one about to join the innumerable caravan beside me? i must take my revenge normally and in kind,--if i die before you, you shall surely have a visitation from me. how should you like that?” “you would be just as welcome then as now,” she answered gravely. “an equivocal compliment. nevertheless, i accept it as a challenge. will you promise its counterpart?” “when i die,” said orient, “i shall have other things to do.” “but i would like to see a ghost, just to be assured that there are such things.” “as if there could be any doubt!” “you understand, then,” he said, as she went in under the low woodbine-curtained door, “that at some time--when time shall be no more--i will cast my shadow at your feet!” it was an hour later that, while he still strolled in the short, wet grass and enjoyed the rich, half-dusky atmosphere, he heard orient singing gently from her window, as she leaned out upon the cool, star-sown air, and the song seemed to belong to her, like a natural expression, as to the night the night-wind, or to the dark the dew:-- “in the evening over me leaning, often i fancy a waving wing, and with the warning of blushing morning softly glimmers the same fair thing. “o bright being, beyond the seeing of aught but the spirit that feels you near, your white star leaving, and earthward cleaving, you break the murk of this mortal sphere. “still, sweet stranger, in peace or danger, out of the air above me bloom, and heaven’s own sweetness in such completeness drop on my head from your shining plume!” even while he heard her singing, the sense of her remoteness gave reymund a slight shudder. if she had been one shade more human; if he had ever seen her moved by any sparkle of wit, any drollery of humor, into a frolicking outburst of laughter, by any mischievous vexation into a flash of anger, a season of pettishness,--but no, such little incidents affected her no more than thistle-down affects the wind; and, recognizing it, reymund knew that he loved her, yet felt somehow as he felt who had pledged a bridal ring upon the finger of a ghost; as that youth felt, perchance, whose beautiful mistress was after all a ghoul. he need not have concerned himself; orient had no especial care for him; he passed before her, busy in her world of dreams, like a shadow; if she smiled upon him, it was as she smiled on everything else about her, as she smiled on the pink-wreathed peach-bough, on the urchin tumbling in grass, on the sunbeam overlaying both, on blue sky or on rainy weather; though, indeed, for the latter, orient had superfluous smiles; she was always sunny herself upon a stormy day; she used to say that it seemed as if nature had grown so familiar with her that she could afford to receive her and show herself to her in undress. perhaps, had reymund been more free himself from the soil and stain of earth, orient would not have been so intangible. they were going one day up the mountain, orient, her mother, the guide, and reymund, the first two riding, reymund and the guide on foot. the air was so clear that it seemed like living in the inside of a crystal; everything stood with sharp outlines, as if drawn with a burin upon the deep substance of the blue: far away tender gauzes took up the distance, but that was merely on the outside edges of the world. after they had exhausted the view from the wide-reaching summit, where the eye seemed to wrest from the creator more than had ever been given to it, they went below into the shelter of the great rocks and lunched. it was late in the afternoon ere they remounted and sought their way down the long descent. the path which had been slight with difficulties in climbing was now full of downward terrors. orient bent far back in her seat, unable to see where her horse would plant his feet. it seemed to her that he was stepping over sheer abysses, and just as she herself went sliding and slipping forward over his head and down, a strong arm from an unseen form behind the cliff, round which she had just wound, would grasp her, and reymund would hold her firm till the beast stood four-square again. it was to her a thing like the arm of providence made visible to faith. suddenly the girth broke, and but for that strong arm on the instant outstretched, providence itself alone knows what would have become of her. reymund caught her then as she reeled from the saddle, and placed her on the ground. the horse, startled by the unexpectedness of the affair, fled forward; the guide left the bridle he had held behind and pursued him. catching the rein with a jerk and oath, he dealt such a blow with his boot that the animal lost his balance and fell, and would have rolled over the precipice but for a prostrate tree. in a moment what reymund had wanted to see was granted him. orient sprang forward, her face aflame, her eyes like balefires. the guide, amazed, as one might be at the sight of an avenger in his path, obeyed her single word, her vehement gesture, and plunged down the way and left them. “orient! what have you done?” cried her mother. “well, well, mamma,” answered the suddenly convicted and penitent one, “we can follow his red cap.” but the guide, twice too cunning, hid himself in underhung paths that he knew, and they had not a sign or signal for aid. nevertheless, reymund gladly accepted this fate because of the thing that brought it, and at which another man would have looked askance. this thing, this little temper, had proved to him that orient was human,--and, therefore, to be won. he raised the pony, remounted orient, and did his best in place of their faithless leader, trusting more to the instincts of the animals themselves than to any mountain-craft of his own. the sharp outlines of distant peaks began to burn and blacken, those of the nearer rock and stunted shrub to grow diffuse; the air was keen and chill, a reddening sunset smouldered in clouds below them and shut out the world, a cold, wet mist below threatened to come creeping up around them. the horses neighed to each other, grew jaded and uncertain, stopped. masses of impassable rock closed them in on every side, save the narrow defile through which they came and the precipice below; the atmosphere was purple with shade and clung to them in dew; already one star hung out its blue lamp. “we can go no farther,” said reymund. “this spot is more sheltered than any we are likely to find. let us do what we can for comfort, and wait for the morning.” the mother bewailed herself; but orient made cheer, and while reymund corralled the horses, she was busy collecting twigs and splinters and bits of wood and dry moss in a pile. “light them with your matches, reymund,” she said. “a cigar will keep you warm, but we need a bit of blaze, perhaps.” “when it is darker,” he replied; “you will need it more a little nearer to the witching time.” “do you imagine we shall see witches?” “take care, or you will see stars.” “he rode alone through the silent night, she swam like a star to his left and right,” sang orient. “after all, it is not the walpurgis night.” “if we could only have a cup of tea!” sighed the mamma, at a loss for her luxuries in the wilderness. “it will be so much more refreshing to-morrow,” said orient. “and seasoned with romance,--a dash of danger,--your first adventure, little mother!” but the little mother had no fancy for adventures; and while her daughter lost all her serenity and was crazy with delight at the wild beauty of the thing, she grew more and more lachrymose, and afforded at last a good background of shower for all orient’s rainbows. thereon orient, sitting down, put her arms round her and comforted her, till the mother became herself somewhat alive to the circumstance that one seldom saw such a scene twice in a lifetime. they had remained on the rocky platform where they paused, a shelf that after a few yards ended in an abrupt fall that led away by a course of stark precipices into the great valley beneath. this valley, filled with rolling vapor, whose volumes, smitten by sunset, were fused in splendid color, made a pavilion of cloud beneath them where billows of fleecy crimson and shining scarlet curdled together into creamy crests, here seeming to lash in feather-white foam against the base of some crag, and there letting a late sunbeam plough through spaces of a violet-dark drift till they were all inwrought with gold. above them the cold and mighty heaven was already faintly but thickly strewn with stars. “into what awful and glorious region are we translated!” cried orient. “we are above the world and the people of the world. are we flesh and blood?” “the free spirits of the air ‘have no such liberty’ as this of ours,” said reymund. “it is just as if we were dead!” shivered the mamma. “and i’m sure it’s cold enough for that!” orient wrapped the shawls about the doleful little woman, while reymund opened his knapsack for any remnants of lunch that might afford them consolation. he kindled the fire, too, for the colors were fading away beneath, and the sky was getting gloomy overhead; and, warmed and enlivened in the genial light of the briefly crackling blaze, they forgot that they were lost upon the mountain, and all the possible horrors of their fate. but to reymund there were few horrors in it, for if he died of exposure and starvation there on the bald, pitiless mountain, it would be with orient in his arms at last. while the fire crackled, reymund found in his breast-pocket a tiny flask of cordial which he divided into three portions. “drink it,” he said to them, “and make it take the place of the tea. it is chartreuse--oily sunshine--distilled from the cones of some old fir-tree. first cousin to the cedars of lebanon, for all i know. mark how you taste hemlock in it. socrates poisoned with hemlock? no, no; he drank himself to death on chartreuse.” orient heard him indignantly. “i do not like it,” said she, when her turn came, and left hers in the horn. reymund laughed; he hesitated a moment, then tossed it off himself. the fire did not last them long, for all the twigs they could collect were scanty; the blaze had heated the rock a little; they drew closer to it, and the mother, curling up against it in her shawls, composed herself as she could for slumber; the voices of orient and reymund, from where they still sat and talked together, lulled her as the murmur of the waterfall lulled sleep himself. orient was repeating jean ingelow’s dream of her lover fallen and dead among the hills, with its vague and awesome imagery. “i do not understand,” she said, as she ceased, “this solicitude that my mother and so many others feel concerning their burial-place. i love life, delicious life; but if we die and lie unburied here forever among the lonely precipices, it will not matter any more to us than it did to the youth.” and she repeated again:-- “the first hath no advantage,--it shall not soothe his slumber that a lock of his brown hair his father aye shall keep; for the last, he nothing grudgeth, it shall naught his quiet cumber that in a golden mesh of _his_, callow eaglets sleep.” reymund quaked at the moment, as he thought of any lustrous lock of orient’s curling out of the fierce beak that should tear it away from the white brow. then he said: “too philosophic by half. as for me, with the first peep of day in this high meridian, i shall be up and doing, and find a way to our level again or--perish in the attempt.” “resolved to perish, any way. give you liberty or give you death. _i_ do not feel in such a hurry to be gone. how silent and solemn it is,--what a clear darkness,--listen a moment and catch the sough of that pine forest far beneath, like the wings of some great spirit sifting the air. i have never been so near heaven. i understand now why in the bible they so often withdrew into a high mountain.” reymund did not answer her. “say your prayers, innocent one,” was what he thought. “wherever you are, there heaven is near.” by and by orient crept closer to her mother for mutual comfort, wound her own cloak round her like a chrysalis, and drowsed and dreamed. reymund sat beside her, his knees drawn up, his hands clasped round them. it was very cool; the air was so still that he wondered at the absence of a stinging frost, and he hugged himself thus for warmth. orient stirred in her half-recumbent sleep, and her head fell on his shoulder. after that the solid mountain was less immovable than he. he let the beautiful head remain, watching it with downcast, sidelong gaze; if he had longed with all his heart to smooth one tress, to put his arm over her in a sheltering embrace, he dared not touch her. something said to him that she was of a grade above, as the disembodied is beyond the clay; said, too, that whatever lovely or fine there might be in himself, the thickness of the outer wrapping rendered it invisible to her; that for orient to read him right he must wait for another life. in spite of all that, he hoped,--hoped madly and wildly, there in the chill night, with the beautiful head fallen on his shoulder and the sweet, warm breath stealing gently across his bending brow. he had a strange fancy now and then that out of the encircling shadow a great face came and looked,--whether that of some uncreated thing, some phantasm of his brain, or that of some celestial being, some resident of vast spaces, or only a wild beast, a big, brown bear, roving on their tracks and coming to peer about their unprotected bivouac. whatever it was, it retired as often as it came, awed in its turn, he thought, by the sweet innocence of that golden head. a late moon rose down over the low side of the earth as he still sat there; he knew it by the strange coppery light that began to glow through the vapors that yet filled the gulfs beneath, and boil them to a scum of dark, dun gold; then at last a broad beam parted the tumbling and sulphurous fogs, and the bright, thin crescent of the waning moon cut itself out on a clear air behind the horn of the hill, and, as if swinging from its sharp cusp, hung the watery diamond of the morning star. still reymund did not lift the head from his shoulder; he chose rather that the fair apparition of daybreak at this height above the earth might happen to him, as if through the imposition of that dear and tender touch. by and by she stirred restlessly,--the spell of her slumber was breaking; he moved away gently and left her the rock for a pillow. when the heavens were paling and retreating in a mist of star-breath, and when all the world was whitening about her and the great floor of cloud beneath was inwrought by dawn with sparks of fire, so that they seemed wrapped in an atmosphere of flame and snow, orient awoke. no hero in his self-restraint, in one wild, forgetful moment of that morning, reymund told orient that he loved her. she repulsed him so gently that it gave him reason to hope, yet so firmly that he could do nothing but despair. he urged that she was unconscious of herself, that she did not know her own heart, nor what it wanted; that he had approached her inner life more nearly than another might ever do; that, give him time and chance, he could not fail to win her. she only answered that she was not won. before, in their windings and wanderings, they had reached the foot of the mountain that day, they met their recusant and repentant guide coming up with others in search of them, and all their toil and trouble were over. reymund’s holiday was over too. he was to return next day to his home, to engagements previously formed and not to be disregarded. “at least,” he said to orient, not sadly, but with a certain vigor of intention in his tone, “you will allow me to visit you at your mother’s house?” “you could not do a kinder thing,” answered orient, feeling now the gap that he would leave, and which nothing could quite fill, and willing to grant him anything but what he most desired. “then you will see me on saturdays.” “every saturday!” she exclaimed, with a bright face that made his heart bound. “that is too much to ask.” “of you, perhaps; not of me. sunday is a spare day; if i use it for god’s worship, it shall be at what shrine i please,--st. orient’s or another’s.” “and it is such a long ride,” demurred she, remembering the miles on miles of low sea-coast country threaded with rivers and inlaid with marshes, that he must cross, all day flying along through their damp breath and salt winds. “nine hours; i am afraid i ought not to allow it. and yet,--and yet, nine or nineteen, it shall make no difference.” orient had hesitated in her last sentence, wondering how she could deny herself the sympathy in her little pursuits that through this time she had received from reymund. she had not encountered it before; it was delightful to her; perhaps it only had not taught her love because she did not know what love was. she had but little knowledge of human nature, almost none at all of her own nature: she preferred natural religion before theology, natural history, with its grandiose revolutions, before the petty struggles of warriors and diplomatists which her view was not broad enough to throw into epochs and revolutions more grandiose yet: it was reymund who had taught her to look with kindly curiosity upon the lives of those about her, in hopes, it may be, of teaching her at last to look in upon her own. of that she was unaware; but the interest in the flower never found before to-day, the discovery of the bird whose note had ravished the ear last sunset, the hunt up brookside and hill for a fragment of quartz that should have a mountain range and outlying spurs of amethyst crystals, or one full of imbedded beryls, the shining hexagons like drops of light filtered through seawater, or any heap of blooded garnets, a blaze of concrete color; the search into the age of the old pine-tree on the precipice; into the mountain strata, and the wonderment concerning that day of the earth’s date on which they were upheaved; the tracing out the path of some glacier with all its ancient and icy terrors overgrown by the verdant moss and turf of the moraine; the perpetual looking for the maker’s fingers in his work,--all this, and such as this, she would miss and must resign if she forbade those recurring saturdays. and then, on the other hand, a friend to meet with the results of work, the choice book, the week’s research, its thought, its fancy: she who had had no intimates, few friends-- reymund did not wait for her to balance her ideas. “the train arrives,” said he, “by five o’clock,--a little before. every saturday, therefore, at five o’clock, i shall be in your drawing-room.” the thing was settled, then, without her. she began all at once to fear that, after all, it would not happen so; he would let other things creep between; when he was fairly at a distance from her he would be angry with her for having quite failed to feel that entire satisfaction in him, to give him that love which, in a high ideal, she believed to be due from every woman to her husband; a thousand things would hinder. “i can hardly believe it,” she said. “i am too happy when you doubt it,” he replied, half reading her thoughts. “it gives me hope; for we can easily believe that to which we are indifferent. how can i be hindered when i will it,--and when you wish it?” the blush that streamed up her temples doubly pleased him. “do not doubt it!” he exclaimed, with more vivacity than so small a thing appeared to demand. “for, see, i swear it! i will be with you on each saturday at five o’clock, with your permission, until the day i die!” so, dropping her hand, he went down the lane to the coach. but, looking back, he saw her still standing in the doorway, hung with such drooping drapery of woodbine round her head, the sunlight lying in a glory on her golden hair, the downy bloom upon her cheek as though it were a peach, a smile upon her lip, and heaven’s own blue within her eye,--she seemed the incarnation of a summer sunrise. he saw the riotous wind lift one curl and twine it with the next, drop the petal of a rose upon her mouth, kiss and kiss again her ivory forehead, free and welcome where he dared not venture,--and the love in his heart made the blood boil hotly up his veins to cheek and brow,--and for all testimony to his thrilling passion, he only cried, “every saturday, at five o’clock!” and was away. but before reymund plunged afresh into the exterior world, which, for these weeks, had been shut from his sight, he turned aside for one last outlook upon pleasure. thus it happened that he left the train at an earlier station than the one near orient’s home, partly to avoid recognition in the future, partly for the sake of mounting and subduing a spirited horse which had been brought up to tear himself into a foam at sight of the engine. reymund meant to gratify himself that day with a stroll through orient’s garden and among the haunts of her bright youth. no one would have taken him for anything but an apparition, who saw him galloping down the long country roads in a cloud of dust. when he had conquered the angry temper of the beast he abated his gait and paced slowly along the margin of the twice-mown meadows, splendid in noon sunshine, over the shaven surfaces of rusty reds and browns, into which they shaded all their gilded verdure. now and then a bittern cried from the bank of a tiny thread of the tide, other notes were hushed, there was only to be heard through the wide midday air the unbroken treble of the crickets, across which the rich horns of the locusts shrilled like the elfin trumpets of a summer’s state. reymund hitched his horse, found a penetrable portion of the garden paling, and entered. it was a large, old garden, laid out, fifty years ago, perhaps, in a kind of pleasance; for in one place a slight hill rose above the rest, while paths wandered round it into new and unsuspected regions; in another a brook meandered and sang silverly over shining pebbles, and among arrow-heads and lily-pods, and, dallying, went its way at last to empty into some tide-streak and find the sounding sea that called to it all night. weeds, of course, had overgrown the beds, the untrained grapes hung heavily from wall and trellis, wasps and blackbirds made merry together with the nectar of ripening pears, plum and peach dropped ungathered from the bough; vine and tendril, leaf and spray, and branch and blossom, all wrought themselves to a delicious tangle of perfume and rustle and color. here, through the beautiful and envious weeds, a gladiolus reared his flames, a larkspur absorbed the very blue, a carnation scattered spice; here honeysuckles still blew out a perfect fragrance, while mourning-brides and gillyflowers and spiked lavender and pansies sowed the air with their old-fashioned sweetness. the soft, lonely sky stretched away over the garden and the meadows to haze itself round low and distant woods, and all the empty air seemed sad and desolate between,--the fulness and richness of life at its high noon touching close upon the anti-climax of desert solitude. through the place a light east-wind was blowing that had in it a tonic for the lungs like the sparkle of champagne. and, somehow, through all the spaces of the neglected garden the spell of orient seemed complete. there orient must have stood to twine that white rose upon the porch; there her fingers must have twinkled among the young vine-leaves; there, on that bank of turf, she must many an afternoon have sat at work; there, in the shallow crystal of the brook, she had waded with white feet to set the water-plants. these lichen-covered apple-trees had shed, how many a springtime, the rosy snow of their petals around her head; these gnarled old bergamots had dropped their pulpy globes into her hands; this nut-tree put out its leaves on the day when she was born; her little feet had worn these paths. the garden was the shadow of orient herself, reduced to dumb and to material things. he wondered what it would be by the magic of moonlight,--the whole place silvered over with tranquil sheen, and raised from every day’s dull sight into the dreamy and ideal,--full of cool dew, and silence, and holy hush, as if it waited on her white sleep. just under his feet, where the seed had been thrown in handfuls, he traced, written out with blue forget-me-nots, the name of orient. it would not do for him to stay much longer here; he should grow wild with hopes and fancies, for all he knew, tread out that lovely name with his heel. she must, she should be won! he clutched a cluster of the forget-me-nots, quickly escaped the labyrinth, galloped back to the station at a rate that streaked his chafing steed,--and so away from dreams to life and real work. thus reymund returned to his routine; bills and lawsuits and politics, routes and rides; they were not calculated to lift him to any higher level than the old one. and orient and her mother came home; the mother having made quite as close acquaintance with the mountains as she cared to do. saturdays, now, surely as they came, brought reymund under the same roof with orient. perhaps in their brief indulgence he found pardon for all the sins of the week,--for the week had its sins, its little trivial condoning of misdemeanors as unimportant, matters which lower one as steadily and certainly over the great pit, as block and tackle might do over another. on sunday nights, when he glided away in the outward train, he felt as if it were an easy thing to maintain the height which, by orient’s side, he gained; but after a monday morning on the exchange, after a tuesday night in the salon, after his evening gallop on the horse possessed with the spirit of satan, he said to himself, “it is of no use. nature is too crude in me, too gross a strain, too deep a dye. i should be like shelley’s rock in the black abyss, that ‘has from unimaginable years sustained itself with terror and with toil over a gulf, and, with the agony with which it clings, seems slowly coming down.’ the thing is to abandon.” yet saturday’s sunset shone for him again always over orient’s garden. he had come one evening and found orient among the grape-vines, playing with a parcel of little children, as pretty, bright, and fresh as a bunch of flowers. after the hubbub of business, the dust of travel, this garden, in a far outlying city suburb stretching towards the sea, seemed as pure and innocent as eden. on sunday morning, when the air soared illumined with a stiller lustre, when the azure deepened as if fresh-washed by sacred rains and dews, when the winds bore no murmur but that of ripening leaf and floating petal, when the birds themselves seemed to sing in the sabbath, and all the wide world to be gladly and tranquilly conscious of the day,--they went to church together. if orient was rapt in the worship, reymund was at an exaltation as high for him,--rapt in his worship of her. by times this very thing lifted him into the upper region, his soul rose buoyant on the prayer and praise, and floated forward like a waif on the full tide of the organ’s music. when, afterward, he found himself and his sentience again, he said the thing was in him,--could he but keep the pitch,--were orient forever by him to give him that key-note. but alone we come into this world, alone we go out of it. neither orient nor another could, for all eternity, give the tone to any soul; that discord or that harmony which one shall make must be the result of one’s own being. he sat with orient, in the afternoon, on the bank of turf that sloped down to the clear, brown brook, in whose bed many a diving and dipping sunbeam wrought mosaics of light and shade with the shining pebbles. the brook rustled and lilted on its way, a bird above it turned its burden into melody, now and then a waft of wind rippled all its course till the lily leaves shivered and turned up their crimson linings, soft clouds chased one another across the sky,--everything around wore the bloom of peace and pleasure. “i often fear,” said reymund, “that i must come here no more. the place grows too dear for one that must some day leave it.” orient turned and looked at him. he saw her tremble. “not come here any more!” she said. “ah, orient!” he cried, “once i declared to you the purpose of my life. sometimes--now--sometimes--it seems to me as if you were almost won.” he bent above her, glowing and passionate and daring. she trembled again, neither drew away, nor surrendered herself to the waiting grasp. “i do not know,” she answered him, the globy tears suffusing her eyes till each one shone like the great star that hung its blue lamp in the zenith that night when they were lost upon the mountain. “perhaps i cannot read my heart; but does a woman really love that which is less strong than herself? i must lean upon my husband, not he on me.” “am i so weak?” asked reymund, with some bitterness, and a quiver on his lip. “consider. if your own nature had been invested with a coarser flesh, left out thereby to coarser temptations,--since passions are things of the flesh,--what would have come of it? then, if thrown in the midst of the revel, loving the flash of merriment, the excitement of chance, and wine and dice were going round--but, no! such speech is profanity. yet, orient, under all habit, under all action, i think there is that in my soul akin to yours, made to rule it and absorb it, hidden by the body; but there,--made to be loved by you, as you, all of you, flaws and beauties, are loved by me!” “if i could only _see_ your soul,” said orient, half yielding, contrite, yet uncertain. “one day perhaps you will,” answered reymund, his repeater giving the hour to his finger-pressure. “now i must go.” he rose, stooped again and touched her smooth, cold forehead with his mouth. the touch sent the blood back to his heart. “with time,” he murmured. “o, with time! she shall yet--she shall! good by,--till saturday again at five o’clock!” and then was gone. all that week reymund walked through his work with an absent mind, as if his spirit had half left his body, disengaging itself from the automaton of bone and muscle, as one might say; abstracted and lost in his thoughts, his wishes, his absolute resolutions. old haunts had no attraction for him, old faces brought him no satisfaction, he sought no pleasure but such as was to be found on the back of that horse possessed by the spirit of satan. and so he existed till the sunrise of saturday, when, before it should be quite time for the train, he had the horse brought round for a gallop, as if he would ride the wind and tame the whirlwind. in the mean time orient pursued her way in what, for her, was perturbation. there seemed to be a riddle in these days beyond her reading. penitent over her pride in presuming herself to be stronger than her lover, conscious that she could not dispense with him, yet full as sure that she felt no perfect passion for him, there was nothing to do but marvel what it meant. “i am drawn to him,” she said to herself. “ah, i know that well enough! but have i any right to be? if there were something to confirm me! if i thought the good and beautiful part were any abiding principle, were anything but love of me! if i could only see his soul!” she was walking that saturday afternoon in the woods that could be seen from her garden across the meadows. it was a clear october afternoon, the red leaves were dropping round her and leaving the bright blue sky more bare with every gentle gust that brought them to her feet; a bracing day of early autumn, when the wind fainted with the sweet freight of balsam from the pines, and all things only prophesied hope and lightsomeness. in spite of this, orient could not tell why she had a constant sensation of gray and misty horizons, of marshy air and cold sea-wind all day; as she walked now, the fitful breeze in the tree-tops seemed the muffled murmur of waves on the distant beach, and once in a while she shivered as if a cold foam-wreath were flying by her face. she thought at first that all this damp and drear sensation was some sympathy with reymund, now travelling along the sea-coast on his way to her. “but what absurdity!” she said. “where the track lies, the sky is as blue as this one; the wind is scarcely more chilly there than here. reymund is rolling along, comfortable among his cushions and books; and not a naked spirit all abroad in the sea-scented air!” she went home on the causeway that was laid along the meadows,--hurrying a little, for she judged by the sinking sun that it must be nearly time for the arrival of the train. as she went, she heard her name called. she turned, for the voice seemed to come from the woods. but seeing no one, she fancied the note of some bird had followed her. again the sound. her name; and reymund’s voice. “he has come,” thought orient, with a thrill of unsuspected pleasure, “and he is calling me from the garden.” and she made all haste to answer the summons in person. going along, then, with her boughs of bright leaves, she wished she had not delayed so long in the woods,--her dress so soiled, and her hands, her hair so disordered; she resolved to steal in at the side door and freshen her toilet before greeting him. as the door was opened to her, “mr. reymund has come,” said the maid, gleefully. “i have just let him in. he is waiting in the drawing-room.” “very well,” answered orient. “tell him i will be there directly.” she hastened towards the staircase, boughs in hand. “you haven’t seen your friend?” asked her aunt, passing her on the landing as she sped up. “no,” replied orient again; “have you?” “i just met him in the hall as he was entering the drawing-room,” said the good woman, calling over the balusters and going her way. orient hurried at her bath, clad herself with all despatch, and put on a garment whose airy frills and ruffles made her look like a white rose. as she went by her mother’s room, the mother looked out and said, lightly, “reymund has come. did you know it?” “yes, mamma,” she answered. “why didn’t you go and make him welcome?” “o, my hair was all down!” said the other. “i just caught a glimpse of him, passing the foot of the stairs as he went into the drawing-room.” so orient stepped slowly down, adjusting her bracelets as she went. she saw reymund a second, as the winding way of the stairs for that space allowed her, standing in the bay-window and looking out. she did not know what made her so hesitate to enter. she paused a moment longer in the doorway, gazing in. the room was very gay with bunches of deep-blue and scarlet salvia, and drooping clusters of barberry boughs stringing their splendid pendants all along most graceful curves; but there was another brightness than that in the room. it was where reymund stood in the embrasure of the window, with the late sunlight falling all over him. she wondered that he did not advance to meet her; but, as she wondered, went up the room toward him. “something must have happened to make him very happy,” thought orient. “i never saw such a smile!” perhaps it was this smile that so transfigured him; a plain man commonly, the sunshine now seemed to bring out rich, dark tints on the countenance, the eyes overflowed with light, and whether it were grace of posture, overlying sunshine, or beaming smile, features and face and figure expressed a subtle harmony, and the man was beautiful,--beautiful as a strong angel pictured in some instant of stooping flight. “he does not mean to speak till i do,” thought orient again. but as she drew near, the smile changed to a look of utter melancholy, as a shining cloud melts into rain,--a melancholy gaze that pierced her through and through. she put out her hand, nevertheless, to take his extended grasp. and there was nothing there! in the same instant, with a loud and terrible voice, crying, “orient!”--a voice as if it were the voice of death, the tomb, and all corruption,--the thing had vanished; the place was empty! that cry rang through the house, that loud and terrible voice. maid and mother rushed into the room; and they found no one there but orient, fallen unconscious to the floor. it did not take long to revive the child. “something has happened to reymund,” she said, upon lifting her head. “we must go to him at once!” “my love!” cried her mother. “the idea of the thing. the--” but expostulations were wasted breath; while they were being made, orient was calmly getting on her travelling-gown, and, seeing herself powerless, the mother--with her heart palpitating in the ends of her fingers through awe and through alarm, and interweaving with the ejaculations that escaped her chattering teeth a thousand instructions to her quaking maid and sister--hastened to do likewise and be off with her. thus it happened that the telegram from reymund’s brother crossed the travellers on their way; and they reached his brother’s house in the gray of the shivering morning. it was just as orient’s heart had told her. reymund had been thrown from his horse on the previous morning, striking his head on a curbstone’s edge; he had been taken up senseless, and had lain since then in a stupor only broken by his twice calling her name in the afternoon. at a little after five o’clock he had risen on the pillow, and in a loud and terrible voice had called orient again, and then had fallen back; and whether he were dead or alive there was no one able to say. orient threw off her hat and shawl and stole into the apartment where reymund had been placed. the white face that fastened her eye was still as a mask of clay, and there was stamped upon it that look of unutterable melancholy into which she had seen the smile fade yesterday,--the linen where it lay was less white, a marble image had been less still. as orient bent there her breath stirred the dark lock of hair on the brow, and the slight and airy motion of itself brought into forceful being all the awful immobility and silence of death. “he does not breathe! his heart does not beat! will he never open his eyes again?” she said. “o reymund, reymund, i love you!” she bent nearer as she sighed the words, and her lips were sealed to his. a quiver ran through all the frozen frame reposing there beside her, a pulse of warmth, perhaps, played in the hand hers clasped; the eyelids shook and lifted and unveiled the dark and woful eyes. “you have seen my soul, orient,” said reymund. “good by.” the dark and woful eyes were veiled again. and this time reymund’s soul was gone beyond recall. [illustration: text decoration] [illustration: text decoration] the fall of the house of usher by edgar allan poe. son cœur est un luth suspendu; sitôt qu’on le touche il rèsonne. de beranger. during the whole of a dull, dark, and soundless day in the autumn of the year, when the clouds hung oppressively low in the heavens, i had been passing alone, on horseback, through a singularly dreary tract of country; and at length found myself, as the shades of the evening drew on, within view of the melancholy house of usher. i know not how it was, but, with the first glimpse of the building, a sense of insufferable gloom pervaded my spirit. i say insufferable; for the feeling was unrelieved by any of that half-pleasurable, because poetic, sentiment, with which the mind usually receives even the sternest natural images of the desolate or terrible. i looked upon the scene before me,--upon the mere house and the simple landscape features of the domain,--upon the bleak walls,--upon the vacant, eye-like windows,--upon a few rank sedges,--and upon a few white trunks of decayed trees,--with an utter depression of soul which i can compare to no earthly sensation more properly than to the after-dream of the reveller upon opium,--the bitter lapse into every-day life,--the hideous dropping off of the veil. there was an iciness, a sinking, a sickening of the heart,--an unredeemed dreariness of thought which no goading of the imagination could torture into aught of the sublime. what was it,--i paused to think,--what was it that so unnerved me in the contemplation of the house of usher? it was a mystery all insoluble; nor could i grapple with the shadowy fancies that crowded upon me as i pondered. i was forced to fall back upon the unsatisfactory conclusion that, while, beyond doubt, there _are_ combinations of very simple natural objects which have the power of thus affecting us, still the analysis of this power lies among considerations beyond our depth. it was possible, i reflected, that a mere different arrangement of the particulars of the scene, of the details of the picture, would be sufficient to modify, or perhaps to annihilate, its capacity for sorrowful impression; and, acting upon this idea, i reined my horse to the precipitous brink of a black and lurid tarn that lay in unruffled lustre by the dwelling, and gazed down--but with a shudder even more thrilling than before--upon the remodelled and inverted images of the gray sedge and the ghastly tree-stems and the vacant and eye-like windows. nevertheless, in this mansion of gloom i now proposed to myself a sojourn of some weeks. its proprietor, roderick usher, had been one of my boon companions in boyhood; but many years had elapsed since our last meeting. a letter, however, had lately reached me in a distant part of the country,--a letter from him,--which, in its wildly importunate nature, had admitted of no other than a personal reply. the manuscript gave evidence of nervous agitation. the writer spoke of acute bodily illness,--of a mental disorder which oppressed him,--and of an earnest desire to see me, as his best, and indeed his only personal friend, with a view of attempting, by the cheerfulness of my society, some alleviation of his malady. it was the manner in which all this, and much more, was said,--it was the apparent _heart_ that went with his request,--which allowed me no room for hesitation; and i accordingly obeyed forthwith what i still considered a very singular summons. although as boys we had been even intimate associates, yet i really knew little of my friend. his reserve had been always excessive and habitual. i was aware, however, that his very ancient family had been noted, time out of mind, for a peculiar sensibility of temperament, displaying itself, through long ages, in many works of exalted art, and manifested, of late, in repeated deeds of munificent yet unobtrusive charity, as well as in a passionate devotion to the intricacies, perhaps even more than to the orthodox and easily recognizable beauties, of musical science. i had learned, too, the very remarkable fact that the stem of the usher race, all time-honored as it was, had put forth, at no period, any enduring branch; in other words, that the entire family lay in the direct line of descent, and had always, with very trifling and very temporary variation, so lain. it was this deficiency, i considered, while running over in thought the perfect keeping of the character of the premises with the accredited character of the people, and while speculating upon the possible influence which the one, in the long lapse of centuries, might have exercised upon the other,--it was this deficiency, perhaps, of collateral issue, and the consequent undeviating transmission, from sire to son, of the patrimony with the name, which had, at length, so identified the two as to merge the original title of the estate in the quaint and equivocal appellation of the “house of usher,”--an appellation which seemed to include, in the minds of the peasantry who used it, both the family and the family mansion. i have said that the sole effect of my somewhat childish experiment--that of looking down within the tarn--had been to deepen the first singular impression. there can be no doubt that the consciousness of the rapid increase of my superstition--for why should i not so term it?--served mainly to accelerate the increase itself. such, i have long known, is the paradoxical law of all sentiments having terror as a basis. and it might have been for this reason only that, when i again uplifted my eyes to the house itself, from its image in the pool, there grew in my mind a strange fancy,--a fancy so ridiculous, indeed, that i but mention it to show the vivid force of the sensations which oppressed me. i had so worked upon my imagination as really to believe that about the whole mansion and domain hung an atmosphere peculiar to themselves and their immediate vicinity,--an atmosphere which had no affinity with the air of heaven, but which had reeked up from the decayed trees and the gray wall and the silent tarn,--a pestilent and mystic vapor, dull, sluggish, faintly discernible, and leaden-hued. shaking off from my spirit what _must_ have been a dream, i scanned more narrowly the real aspect of the building. its principal feature seemed to be that of an excessive antiquity. the discoloration of ages had been great. minute fungi overspread the whole exterior, hanging in a fine, tangled web-work from the eaves. yet all this was apart from any extraordinary dilapidation. no portion of the masonry had fallen; and there appeared to be a wild inconsistency between its still perfect adaptation of parts and the crumbling condition of the individual stones. in this there was much that reminded me of the specious totality of old woodwork which has rotted for long years in some neglected vault, with no disturbance from the breath of the external air. beyond this indication of extensive decay, however, the fabric gave little token of instability. perhaps the eye of a scrutinizing observer might have discovered a barely perceptible fissure, which, extending from the roof of the building in front, made its way down the wall in a zigzag direction, until it became lost in the sullen waters of the tarn. noticing these things, i rode over a short causeway to the house. a servant in waiting took my horse, and i entered the gothic archway of the hall. a valet, of stealthy step, thence conducted me, in silence, through many dark and intricate passages in my progress to the studio of his master. much that i encountered on the way contributed, i know not how, to heighten the vague sentiments of which i have already spoken. while the objects around me,--while the carvings of the ceilings, the sombre tapestries of the walls, the ebon blackness of the floors, and the phantasmagoric armorial trophies which rattled as i strode, were but matters to which, or to such as which, i had been accustomed from my infancy,--while i hesitated not to acknowledge how familiar was all this, i still wondered to find how unfamiliar were the fancies which ordinary images were stirring up. on one of the staircases, i met the physician of the family. his countenance, i thought, wore a mingled expression of low cunning and perplexity. he accosted me with trepidation, and passed on. the valet now threw open a door and ushered me into the presence of his master. the room in which i found myself was very large and lofty. the windows were long, narrow, and pointed, and at so vast a distance from the black oaken floor as to be altogether inaccessible from within. feeble gleams of encrimsoned light made their way through the trellised panes, and served to render sufficiently distinct the more prominent objects around; the eye, however, struggled in vain to reach the remoter angles of the chamber, or the recesses of the vaulted and fretted ceiling. dark draperies hung upon the walls. the general furniture was profuse, comfortless, antique, and tattered. many books and musical instruments lay scattered about, but failed to give any vitality to the scene. i felt that i breathed an atmosphere of sorrow. an air of stern, deep, and irredeemable gloom hung over and pervaded all. upon my entrance, usher arose from a sofa on which he had been lying at full length, and greeted me with a vivacious warmth which had much in it, i at first thought, of an overdone cordiality,--of the constrained effort of the _ennuyé_ man of the world. a glance, however, at his countenance, convinced me of his perfect sincerity. we sat down; and for some moments, while he spoke not, i gazed upon him with a feeling half of pity, half of awe. surely, man had never before so terribly altered, in so brief a period, as had roderick usher! it was with difficulty that i could bring myself to admit the identity of the wan being before me with the companion of my early boyhood. yet the character of his face had been at all times remarkable. a cadaverousness of complexion; an eye large, liquid, and luminous beyond comparison; lips somewhat thin and very pallid, but of a surpassingly beautiful curve; a nose of a delicate hebrew model, but with a breadth of nostril unusual in similar formations; a finely moulded chin, speaking, in its want of prominence, of a want of moral energy; hair of a more than web-like softness and tenuity;--these features, with an inordinate expansion above the regions of the temple, made up altogether a countenance not easily to be forgotten. and now in the mere exaggeration of the prevailing character of these features, and of the expression they were wont to convey, lay so much of change that i doubted to whom i spoke. the now ghastly pallor of the skin, and the now miraculous lustre of the eye, above all things startled and even awed me. the silken hair, too, had been suffered to grow all unheeded, and as, in its wild gossamer texture, it floated rather than fell about the face, i could not, even with effort, connect its arabesque expression with any idea of simple humanity. in the manner of my friend i was at once struck with an incoherence,--an inconsistency; and i soon found this to arise from a series of feeble and futile struggles to overcome an habitual trepidancy,--an excessive nervous agitation. for something of this nature i had indeed been prepared, no less by his letter than by reminiscences of certain boyish traits, and by conclusions deduced from his peculiar physical conformation and temperament. his action was alternately vivacious and sullen. his voice varied rapidly from a tremulous indecision (when the animal spirits seemed utterly in abeyance) to that species of energetic concision,--that abrupt, weighty, unhurried, and hollow-sounding enunciation,--that leaden, self-balanced, and perfectly modulated guttural utterance, which may be observed in the lost drunkard, or the irreclaimable eater of opium, during the periods of his most intense excitement. it was thus that he spoke of the object of my visit, of his earnest desire to see me, and of the solace he expected me to afford him. he entered, at some length, into what he conceived to be the nature of his malady. it was, he said, a constitutional and a family evil, and one for which he despaired to find a remedy,--a mere nervous affection, he immediately added, which would undoubtedly soon pass off. it displayed itself in a host of unnatural sensations. some of these, as he detailed them, interested and bewildered me; although, perhaps, the terms, and the general manner of the narration had their weight. he suffered much from a morbid acuteness of the senses; the most insipid food was alone endurable; he could wear only garments of certain texture; the odors of all flowers were oppressive; his eyes were tortured by even a faint light; and there were but peculiar sounds, and these from stringed instruments, which did not inspire him with horror. to an anomalous species of terror i found him a bounden slave. “i shall perish,” said he, “i _must_ perish in this deplorable folly. thus, thus, and not otherwise, shall i be lost. i dread the events of the future, not in themselves, but in their results. i shudder at the thought of any, even the most trivial, incident, which may operate upon this intolerable agitation of soul. i have, indeed, no abhorrence of danger, except in its absolute effect,--in terror. in this unnerved, in this pitiable condition, i feel that the period will sooner or later arrive when i must abandon life and reason together, in some struggle with the grim phantasm, fear.” i learned, moreover, at intervals, and through broken and equivocal hints, another singular feature of his mental condition. he was enchained by certain superstitious impressions in regard to the dwelling which he tenanted, and whence, for many years, he had never ventured forth,--in regard to an influence whose suposititious force was conveyed in terms too shadowy here to be restated,--an influence which some peculiarities in the mere form and substance of his family mansion had, by dint of long sufferance, he said, obtained over his spirit,--an effect which the _physique_ of the gray walls and turrets, and of the dim tarn into which they all looked down, had at length brought about upon the _morale_ of his existence. he admitted, however, although with hesitation, that much of the peculiar gloom which thus afflicted him could be traced to a more natural and far more palpable origin,--to the severe and long-continued illness--indeed to the evidently approaching dissolution--of a tenderly beloved sister,--his sole companion for long years,--his last and only relative on earth. “her decease,” he said with a bitterness which i can never forget, “would leave him (him the hopeless and the frail) the last of the ancient race of the ushers.” while he spoke, the lady madeline (for so was she called) passed slowly through a remote portion of the apartment, and, without having noticed my presence, disappeared. i regarded her with an utter astonishment, not unmingled with dread,--and yet i found it impossible to account for such feelings. a sensation of stupor oppressed me, as my eyes followed her retreating steps. when a door, at length, closed upon her, my glance sought instinctively and eagerly the countenance of the brother; but he had buried his face in his hands, and i could only perceive that a far more than ordinary wanness had overspread the emaciated fingers through which trickled many passionate tears. the disease of the lady madeline had long baffled the skill of her physicians. a settled apathy, a gradual wasting away of the person, and frequent although transient affections of a partially cataleptical character, were the unusual diagnosis. hitherto she had steadily borne up against the pressure of her malady, and had not betaken herself finally to bed; but, on the closing in of the evening of my arrival at the house, she succumbed (as her brother told me at night with inexpressible agitation) to the prostrating power of the destroyer; and i learned that the glimpse i had obtained of her person would thus probably be the last i should obtain,--that the lady, at least while living, would be seen by me no more. for several days ensuing, her name was unmentioned by either usher or myself; and during this period i was busied in earnest endeavors to alleviate the melancholy of my friend. we painted and read together; or i listened, as if in a dream, to the wild improvisations of his speaking guitar. and thus, as a closer and still closer intimacy admitted me more unreservedly into the recesses of his spirit, the more bitterly did i perceive the futility of all attempt at cheering a mind from which darkness, as if an inherent, positive quality, poured forth upon all objects of the moral and physical universe, in one unceasing radiation of gloom. i shall ever bear about me a memory of the many solemn hours i thus spent alone with the master of the house of usher. yet i should fail in any attempt to convey an idea of the exact character of the studies, or of the occupations, in which he involved me, or led me the way. an excited and highly distempered ideality threw a sulphureous lustre over all. his long, improvised dirges will ring forever in my ears. among other things, i hold painfully in mind a certain singular perversion and amplification of the wild air of the last waltz of von weber. from the paintings over which his elaborate fancy brooded, and which grew, touch by touch, into vaguenesses at which i shuddered the more thrillingly, because i shuddered knowing not why,--from these paintings (vivid as their images now are before me) i would in vain endeavor to educe more than a small portion which should lie within the compass of merely written words. by the utter simplicity, by the nakedness of his designs, he arrested and overawed attention. if ever mortal painted an idea, that mortal was roderick usher. for me at least--in the circumstances then surrounding me--arose, out of the pure abstractions which the hypochondriac contrived to throw upon his canvas, an intensity of intolerable awe, no shadow of which felt i ever yet in the contemplation of the certainly glowing yet too concrete reveries of fuseli. one of the phantasmagoric conceptions of my friend, partaking not so rigidly of the spirit of abstraction, may be shadowed forth, although feebly, in words. a small picture presented the interior of an immensely long and rectangular vault or tunnel, with low walls, smooth, white, and without interruption or device. certain accessory points of the design served well to convey the idea that this excavation lay at an exceeding depth below the surface of the earth. no outlet was observed in any portion of its vast extent, and no torch, or other artificial source of light was discernible; yet a flood of intense rays rolled throughout, and bathed the whole in a ghastly and inappropriate splendor. i have just spoken of that morbid condition of the auditory nerve which rendered all music intolerable to the sufferer, with the exception of certain effects of stringed instruments. it was, perhaps, the narrow limits to which he thus confined himself upon the guitar, which gave birth, in great measure, to the fantastic character of his performances. but the fervid facility of his impromptus could not be so accounted for. they must have been, and were, in the notes, as well as in the words of his wild fantasias (for he not unfrequently accompanied himself with rhymed verbal improvisations), the result of that intense mental collectedness and concentration to which i have previously alluded as observable only in particular moments of the highest artificial excitement. the words of one of these rhapsodies i have easily remembered. i was, perhaps, the more forcibly impressed with it as he gave it, because, in the under or mystic current of its meaning, i fancied that i perceived, and for the first time, a full consciousness, on the part of usher, of the tottering of his lofty reason upon her throne. the verses, which were entitled “the haunted palace,” ran very nearly, if not accurately, thus:-- in the greenest of our valleys, by good angels tenanted, once a fair and stately palace palace-- radiant palace--reared its head. in the monarch thought’s dominion,-- it stood there! never seraph spread a pinion over fabric half so fair. banners yellow, glorious, golden, on its roof did float and flow (this--all this--was in the olden time long ago); and every gentle air that dallied, in that sweet day, along the ramparts plumed and pallid, a winged odor went away. wanderers in that happy valley through two luminous windows saw spirits moving musically to a lute’s well-tunéd law, round about a throne, where sitting (porphyrogene!) in state his glory well befitting, the ruler of the realm was seen. and all with pearl and ruby glowing was the fair palace door, through which came flowing, flowing, flowing and sparkling evermore, a troop of echoes whose sweet duty was but to sing, in voices of surpassing beauty, the wit and wisdom of their king. but evil things, in robes of sorrow, assailed the monarch’s high estate; (ah, let us mourn, for never morrow shall dawn upon him, desolate!) and, round about his home, the glory that blushed and bloomed is but a dim-remembered story of the old time entombed. and travellers now within that valley, through the red-litten windows, see vast forms that move fantastically to a discordant melody; while, like a rapid, ghastly river, through the pale door, a hideous throng rush out forever, and laugh,--but smile no more. i well remember that suggestions arising from this ballad led us into a train of thought wherein became manifest an opinion of usher’s which i mention not so much on account of its novelty (for other men have thought thus) as on account of the pertinacity with which he maintained it. this opinion, in its general form, was that of the sentience of all vegetable things. but, in his disordered fancy, the idea had assumed a more daring character, and trespassed, under certain conditions, upon the kingdom of inorganization. i lack words to express the full extent or the earnest _abandon_ of his persuasion. the belief, however, was connected (as i have previously hinted) with the gray stones of the home of his forefathers. the conditions of the sentience had been here, he imagined, fulfilled in the method of collocation of these stones,--in the order of their arrangement, as well as in that of the many _fungi_ which overspread them, and of the decayed trees which stood around,--above all, in the long undisturbed endurance of this arrangement, and in its reduplication in the still waters of the tarn. its evidence--the evidence of the sentience--was to be seen, he said (and i here started as he spoke) in the gradual yet certain condensation of an atmosphere of their own about the waters and the walls. the result was discoverable, he added, in that silent, yet importunate and terrible influence which for centuries had moulded the destinies of his family, and which made _him_ what i now saw him,--what he was. such opinions need no comment, and i will make none. our books--the books which, for years, had formed no small portion of the mental existence of the invalid--were, as might be supposed, in strict keeping with this character of phantasm. we pored together over such works as the ververt et chartreuse of gresset; the belphegor of machiavelli; the heaven and hell of swedenborg; the subterranean voyage of nicholas klimm by holberg; the chiromancy of robert flud, of jean d’indaginé, and of de la chambre; the journey into the blue distance of tieck; and the city of the sun of campanella. one favorite volume was a small octavo edition of the _directorium inquisitorium_, by the dominican eymeric de gironne; and there were passages in pomponius mela, about the old african satyrs and œgipans, over which usher would sit dreaming for hours. his chief delight, however, was found in the perusal of an exceedingly rare and curious book in quarto gothic,--the manual of a forgotten church,--the _vigiliæ mortuorum secundum chorum ecclesiæ maguntinæ_. i could not help thinking of the wild ritual of this work, and of its probable influence upon the hypochondriac, when, one evening, having informed me abruptly that the lady madeline was no more, he stated his intention of preserving her corpse for a fortnight (previously to its final interment) in one of the numerous vaults within the main walls of the building. the worldly reason, however, assigned for this singular proceeding, was one which i did not feel at liberty to dispute. the brother had been led to his resolution (so he told me) by consideration of the unusual character of the malady of the deceased, of certain obtrusive and eager inquiries on the part of her medical men, and of the remote and exposed situation of the burial-ground of the family. i will not deny that when i called to mind the sinister countenance of the person whom i met upon the staircase, on the day of my arrival at the house, i had no desire to oppose what i regarded as at best but a harmless, and by no means an unnatural precaution. at the request of usher, i personally aided him in the arrangements for the temporary entombment. the body having been encoffined, we two alone bore it to its rest. the vault in which we placed it (and which had been so long unopened that our torches, half smothered in its oppressive atmosphere, gave us little opportunity for investigation) was small, damp, and entirely without means of admission for light; lying, at great depth, immediately beneath that portion of the building in which was my own sleeping-apartment. it had been used, apparently, in remote feudal times, for the worst purposes of a donjon-keep, and, in later days, as a place of deposit for powder, or some other highly combustible substance, as a portion of its floor, and the whole interior of a long archway through which we reached it, were carefully sheathed with copper. the door of massive iron had been, also, similarly protected. its immense weight caused an unusually sharp, grating sound, as it moved upon its hinges. having deposited our mournful burden upon tressels within this region of horror, we partially turned aside the yet unscrewed lid of the coffin, and looked upon the face of the tenant. a striking similitude between the brother and sister now first arrested my attention; and usher, divining, perhaps, my thoughts, murmured out some few words from which i learned that the deceased and himself had been twins, and that sympathies of a scarcely intelligible nature had always existed between them. our glances, however, rested not long upon the dead,--for we could not regard her unawed. the disease which had thus entombed the lady in the maturity of youth, had left, as usual in all maladies of a strictly cataleptical character, the mockery of a faint blush upon the bosom and the face, and that suspiciously lingering smile upon the lip which is so terrible in death. we replaced and screwed down the lid, and, having secured the door of iron, made our way, with toil, into the scarcely less gloomy apartments of the upper portion of the house. and now, some days of bitter grief having elapsed, an observable change came over the features of the mental disorder of my friend. his ordinary manner had vanished. his ordinary occupations were neglected or forgotten. he roamed from chamber to chamber with hurried, unequal, and objectless step. the pallor of his countenance had assumed, if possible, a more ghastly hue,--but the luminousness of his eye had utterly gone out. the once occasional huskiness of his tone was heard no more; and a tremulous quaver, as if of extreme terror, habitually characterized his utterance. there were times, indeed, when i thought his unceasingly agitated mind was laboring with some oppressive secret, to divulge which he struggled for the necessary courage. at times, again, i was obliged to resolve all into the mere inexplicable vagaries of madness, for i beheld him gazing upon vacancy for long hours, in an attitude of the profoundest attention, as if listening to some imaginary sound. it was no wonder that his condition terrified, that it infected me. i felt creeping upon me, by slow yet certain degrees, the wild influences of his own fantastic yet impressive superstitions. it was, especially, upon retiring to bed late in the night of the seventh or eighth day after the placing of the lady madeline within the donjon, that i experienced the full power of such feelings. sleep came not near my couch,--while the hours waned and waned away. i struggled to reason off the nervousness which had dominion over me. i endeavored to believe that much, if not all, of what i felt was due to the bewildering influence of the gloomy furniture of the room,--of the dark and tattered draperies, which, tortured into motion by the breath of a rising tempest, swayed fitfully to and fro upon the walls, and rustled uneasily about the decorations of the bed. but my efforts were fruitless. an irrepressible tremor gradually pervaded my frame; and, at length, upon my very heart sat an incubus of utterly causeless alarm. shaking this off with a gasp and a struggle, i uplifted myself on the pillows, and, peering earnestly within the intense darkness of the chamber, hearkened--i know not why, except that an instinctive spirit prompted me--to certain low and indefinite sounds which came, through the pauses of the storm, at long intervals, i knew not whence. overpowered by an intense sentiment of horror, unaccountable yet unendurable, i threw on my clothes with haste (for i felt that i should sleep no more during the night), and endeavored to arouse myself from the pitiable condition into which i had fallen, by pacing rapidly to and fro through the apartment. i had taken but few turns in this manner, when a light step on an adjoining staircase arrested my attention. i presently recognized it as that of usher. in an instant afterward he rapped, with a gentle touch, at my door, and entered, bearing a lamp. his countenance was, as usual, cadaverously wan; but, moreover, there was a species of mad hilarity in his eyes,--an evidently restrained _hysteria_ in his whole demeanor. his air appalled me; but anything was preferable to the solitude which i had so long endured, and i even welcomed his presence as a relief. “and you have not seen it?” he said abruptly, after having stared about him for some moments in silence,--“you have not then seen it?--but, stay! you shall.” thus speaking, and having carefully shaded his lamp, he hurried to one of the casements, and threw it freely open to the storm. the impetuous fury of the entering gust nearly lifted us from our feet. it was, indeed, a tempestuous yet sternly beautiful night, and one wildly singular in its terror and its beauty. a whirlwind had apparently collected its force in our vicinity; for there were frequent and violent alterations in the direction of the wind; and the exceeding density of the clouds (which hung so low as to press upon the turrets of the house) did not prevent our perceiving the life-like velocity with which they flew careering from all points against each other, without passing away into the distance. i say that even their exceeding density did not prevent our perceiving this; yet we had no glimpse of the moon or stars, nor was there any flashing forth of the lightning. but the under surfaces of the huge masses of agitated vapor, as well as all terrestrial objects immediately around us, were glowing in the unnatural light of a faintly luminous and distinctly visible gaseous exhalation which hung about and enshrouded the mansion. “you must not, you shall not behold this!” said i, shudderingly, to usher, as i led him, with a gentle violence, from the window to a seat. “these appearances, which bewilder you, are merely electrical phenomena not uncommon; or it may be that they have their ghastly origin in the rank miasma of the tarn. let us close this casement; the air is chilling and dangerous to your frame. here is one of your favorite romances. i will read, and you shall listen; and so we will pass away this terrible night together.” the antique volume which i had taken up was the mad trist of sir launcelot canning; but i had called it a favorite of usher’s more in sad jest than in earnest; for, in truth, there is little in its uncouth and unimaginative prolixity which could have had interest for the lofty and spiritual ideality of my friend. it was, however, the only book immediately at hand; and i indulged a vague hope that the excitement which now agitated the hypochondriac might find relief (for the history of mental disorder is full of similar anomalies) even in the extremeness of the folly which i should read. could i have judged, indeed, by the wild, overstrained air of vivacity with which he hearkened, or apparently hearkened, to the words of the tale, i might well have congratulated myself upon the success of my design. i had arrived at that well-known portion of the story where ethelred, the hero of the trist, having sought in vain for peaceable admission into the dwelling of the hermit, proceeds to make good an entrance by force. here, it will be remembered, the words of the narrative run thus:-- “and ethelred, who was by nature of a doughty heart, and who was now mighty withal, on account of the powerfulness of the wine which he had drunken, waited no longer to hold parley with the hermit, who, in sooth, was of an obstinate and maliceful turn, but, feeling the rain upon his shoulders, and fearing the rising of the tempest, uplifted his mace outright, and, with blows, made quickly room in the plankings of the door for his gauntleted hand; and now pulling therewith sturdily, he so cracked, and ripped, and tore all asunder, that the noise of the dry and hollow-sounding wood alarumed and reverberated throughout the forest.” at the termination of this sentence i started, and for a moment paused; for it appeared to me (although i at once concluded that my excited fancy had deceived me),--it appeared to me that, from some very remote portion of the mansion, came indistinctly to my ears what might have been, in its exact similarity of character, the echo (but a stifled and dull one certainly) of the very cracking and ripping sound which sir launcelot had so particularly described. it was, beyond doubt, the coincidence alone which had arrested my attention; for, amid the rattling of the sashes of the casements, and the ordinary commingled noises of the still increasing storm, the sound, in itself, had nothing, surely, which should have interested or disturbed me. i continued the story. “but the good champion ethelred, now entering within the door, was sore enraged and amazed to perceive no signal of the maliceful hermit; but, in the stead thereof, a dragon of a scaly and prodigious demeanor, and of a fiery tongue, which sate in guard before a palace of gold, with a floor of silver; and upon the wall there hung a shield of shining brass with this legend enwritten:-- ‘who entereth herein, a conqueror hath bin; who slayeth the dragon, the shield he shall win.’ and ethelred uplifted his mace, and struck upon the head of the dragon, which fell before him, and gave up his pesty breath, with a shriek so horrid and harsh, and withal so piercing, that ethelred had fain to close his ears with his hands against the dreadful noise of it, the like whereof was never before heard.” here again i paused abruptly, and now with a feeling of wild amazement; for there could be no doubt whatever that, in this instance, i did actually hear (although from what direction it proceeded i found it impossible to say) a low and apparently distant, but harsh, protracted, and most unusual screaming or grating sound,--the exact counterpart of what my fancy had already conjured up for the dragon’s unnatural shriek as described by the romancer. oppressed, as i certainly was, upon the occurrence of this second and most extraordinary coincidence, by a thousand conflicting sensations, in which wonder and extreme terror were predominant, i still retained sufficient presence of mind to avoid exciting, by any observation, the sensitive nervousness of my companion. i was by no means certain that he had noticed the sounds in question; although, assuredly, a strange alteration had, during the last few minutes, taken place in his demeanor. from a position fronting my own, he had gradually brought round his chair, so as to sit with his face to the door of the chamber; and thus i could but partially perceive his features, although i saw that his lips trembled as if he were murmuring inaudibly. his head had dropped upon his breast; yet i knew that he was not asleep, from the wide and rigid opening of the eye as i caught a glance of it in profile. the motion of his body, too, was at variance with this idea; for he rocked from side to side with a gentle yet constant and uniform sway. having rapidly taken notice of all this, i resumed the narrative of sir launcelot, which thus proceeded:-- “and now the champion, having escaped from the terrible fury of the dragon, bethinking himself of the brazen shield, and of the breaking up of the enchantment which was upon it, removed the carcass from out of the way before him, and approached valorously over the silver pavement of the castle to where the shield was upon the wall; which in sooth tarried not for his full coming, but fell down at his feet upon the silver floor, with a mighty great and terrible ringing sound.” no sooner had these syllables passed my lips, than--as if a shield of brass had indeed, at the moment, fallen heavily upon a floor of silver--i became aware of a distinct, hollow, metallic, and clangorous, yet apparently muffled reverberation. completely unnerved, i leaped to my feet; but the measured rocking movement of usher was undisturbed. i rushed to the chair in which he sat. his eyes were bent fixedly before him, and throughout his whole countenance reigned a stony rigidity. but, as i placed my hand upon his shoulder, there came a strong shudder over his whole person; a sickly smile quivered about his lips; and i saw that he spoke in a low, hurried, and gibbering murmur, as if unconscious of my presence. bending closely over him, i at length drank in the hideous import of his words. “not hear it?--yes, i hear it, and _have_ heard it. long--long--long--many minutes, many hours, many days, have i heard it--yet i dared not--o, pity me, miserable wretch that i am!--i dared not--i _dared_ not speak! _we have put her living in the tomb!_ said i not that my senses were acute? i _now_ tell you that i heard her first feeble movements in the hollow coffin. i heard them--many, many days ago--yet i dared not--_i dared not speak!_ and now--to-night--ethelred--ha! ha!--the breaking of the hermit’s door, and the death-cry of the dragon, and the clangor of the shield!--say, rather, the rending of her coffin, and the grating of the iron hinges of her prison, and her struggles within the coppered archway of the vault! o, whither shall i fly? will she not be here anon? is she not hurrying to upbraid me for my haste? have i not heard her footstep on the stair? do i not distinguish that heavy and horrible beating of her heart? madman!”--here he sprang furiously to his feet, and shrieked out his syllables, as if in the effort he were giving up his soul,--“_madman! i tell you that she now stands without the door!_” as if in the superhuman energy of his utterance had been found the potency of a spell, the huge antique panels to which the speaker pointed threw slowly back, upon the instant, their ponderous and ebony jaws. it was the work of the rushing gust; but then without those doors _did_ stand the lofty and enshrouded figure of the lady madeline of usher. there was blood upon her white robes, and the evidence of some bitter struggle upon every portion of her emaciated frame. for a moment she remained trembling and reeling to and fro upon the threshold, then, with a low moaning cry, fell heavily inward upon the person of her brother, and in her violent and now final death-agonies bore him to the floor a corpse, and a victim to the terrors he had anticipated. from that chamber, and from that mansion, i fled aghast. the storm was still abroad in all its wrath as i found myself crossing the old causeway. suddenly there shot along the path a wild light, and i turned to see whence a gleam so unusual could have issued; for the vast house and its shadows were alone behind me. the radiance was that of the full, setting, and blood-red moon, which now shone vividly through that once barely discernible fissure, of which i have before spoken as extending from the roof of the building, in a zigzag direction, to the base. while i gazed, this fissure rapidly widened,--there came a fierce breath of the whirlwind,--the entire orb of the satellite burst at once upon my sight,--my brain reeled as i saw the mighty walls rushing asunder,--there was a long, tumultuous, shouting sound like the voice of a thousand waters,--and the deep and dank tarn at my feet closed sullenly and silently over the fragments of the house of usher. [illustration: text decoration] [illustration: text decoration] chops the dwarf. by charles dickens. at one period of its reverses, the house to let fell into the hands of a showman. he was found registered as its occupier, on the parish books of the time when he rented the house, and there was therefore no need of any clew to his name. but he himself was less easy to be found; for he had led a wandering life, and settled people had lost sight of him, and people who plumed themselves on being respectable were shy of admitting that they had ever known anything of him. at last among the marsh lands near the river’s level, that lie about deptford and the neighboring market-gardens, a grizzled personage in velveteen, with a face so cut up by varieties of weather that he looked as if he had been tattooed, was found smoking a pipe at the door of a wooden house on wheels. the wooden house was laid up in ordinary for the winter near the mouth of a muddy creek; and everything near it--the foggy river, the misty marshes, and the steaming market-gardens--smoked in company with the grizzled man. in the midst of the smoking party, the funnel-chimney of the wooden house on wheels was not remiss, but took its pipe with the rest in a companionable manner. on being asked if it were he who had once rented the house to let, grizzled velveteen looked surprised, and said yes. then his name was magsman. that was it, toby magsman,--which was lawfully christened robert; but called in the line, from an infant, toby. there was nothing agin toby magsman, he believed? if there was suspicion of such, mention it! there was no suspicion of such, he might rest assured. but some inquiries were making about that house, and would he object to say why he left it? not at all; why should he? he left it along of a dwarf. along of a dwarf? mr. magsman repeated, deliberately and emphatically, “along of a dwarf.” might it be compatible with mr. magsman’s inclination and convenience to enter, as a favor, into a few particulars? mr. magsman entered into the following particulars:-- it was a long time ago to begin with,--afore lotteries and a deal more was done away with. mr. magsman was looking around for a good pitch, and he see that house, and he says to himself, “i’ll have you if you are to be had. if money’ll get you, i’ll have you.” the neighbors cut up rough, and made complaints; but mr. magsman don’t know what they all would have had. it was a lovely thing. first of all, there was the canvas representin the pictur of the giant in spanish trunks and a ruff, who was half the height of the house, and was run up with a line and pulley to a pole of the roof, so that his ed was coeval with the parapet. then there was the canvas representin the pictur of the albina lady, showin her white ’air to the army and navy in correct uniform. then there was the canvas representin the pictur of the wild indian scalpin a member of some foreign nation. then there was the canvas representin the pictur of a child of a british planter seized by two boa-constrictors,--not that we never had no child, nor no constrictors neither. similarly, there was the canvas representin the pictur of the wild ass of the prairies,--not that we never had no wild asses, nor wouldn’t have had ’em as a gift. last there was the canvas representin the pictur of the dwarf, and like him too (considerin), with george the fourth in such a state of astonishment at him as his majesty couldn’t with his utmost politeness and stoutness express. the front of the house was so covered with canvases that there wasn’t a spark of daylight ever visible on that side. “magsman’s amusements,” fifteen foot long by two foot high, ran over the front door and parlor winders. the passage was a arbor of green baize and garden stuff. a barrel-organ performed there unceasing. and as to respectability,--if threepence ain’t respectable, what is? but the dwarf is the principal article at present, and he was worth money. he was wrote up as “major tpschoffki, of the imperial bulgraderian brigade.” nobody couldn’t pronounce the name, and it never was intended anybody should. the public always turned it, as a regular rule, into chopski. in the line he was called chops; partly on that account, and partly because his real name, if he ever had any real name (which was very dubious), was stakes. he was an uncommon small man, he really was. certainly not so small as he was made out to be, but where’s your dwarf as is? he was a most uncommon small man, with a most uncommon large ed; and what he had inside that ed nobody never knowed but himself; even supposin himself to have ever took stock of it, which it would have been a stiff job for him to do. the kindest little man as never growed!--spirited, but not proud. when he travelled with the spotted baby, though he knowed himself to be a nat’ral dwarf, and knowed the baby’s spots to be put onto him artificial, he nursed that baby like a mother. you never heard him give a ill name to a giant. he did allow himself to break out into strong language respectin the fat lady from norfolk; but that was an affair of the ’art; and when a man’s ’art has been trifled with by a lady, and the preference giv to a indian, he ain’t master of his actions. he was always in love, of course; every human nat’ral phenomenon is. and he was always in love with a large woman; i never knowed the dwarf as could be got to love a small one. which helps to keep ’em the curiosities they are. one sing’lar idea he had in that ed of his, which must have meant something, or it wouldn’t have been there. it was always his opinion that he was entitled to property. he never put his name to anything. he had been taught to write by a young man without any arms, who got his living with his toes (quite a writing-master _he_ was, and taught scores in the line), but chops would have starved to death afore he’d gained a bit of bread by putting his hand to a paper. this is the more curious to bear in mind, because he had no property, except his house and a sarser. when i say his house, i mean the box, painted and got up outside like a reg’ler six-roomer, that he used to creep into, with a diamond ring (or quite as good to look at) on his forefinger, and ring a little bell out of what the public believed to be the drawing-room winder. and when i say a sarser, i mean a cheney sarser in which he made a collection for himself at the end of every entertainment. his cue for that he took from me: “ladies and gentlemen, the little man will now walk three times round the cairawan, and retire behind the curtain.” when he said anything important, in private life, he mostly wound it up with this form of words, and they was generally the last thing he said to me afore he went to bed. he had what i consider a fine mind,--a poetic mind. his ideas respectin his property never come upon him so strong as when he sat upon a barrel-organ and had the handle turned. arter the wibration had run through him a little time, he would screech out: “toby, i feel my property coming,--grind away! i’m counting my guineas by thousands, toby,--grind away! toby, i shall be a man of fortun! i feel the mint a jingling in me, toby, and i’m swelling out into the bank of england!” such is the influence of music on the poetic mind. not that he was partial to any other music but a barrel-organ; on the contrairy, he hated it. he had a kind of everlasting grudge agin the public; which is a thing you may notice in many phenomenons that get their living out of it. what riled him most in the nater of his occupation was that it kep him out of society. he was continiwally sayin: “toby, my ambition is to go into society. the curse of my position towards the public is that it keeps me hout of society. this don’t signify to a low beast of a indian; he ain’t formed for society. this don’t signify to a spotted baby; _he_ ain’t formed for society,--i am.” nobody never could make out what chops done with his money. he had a good salary, down on the drum every saturday as the day came round, besides having the run of his teeth,--and he was a woodpecker to eat,--but all dwarfs are. the sarser was a little income, bringing him in so many half-pence that he’d carry ’em, for a week together, tied up in a pocket-handkercher. and yet he never had money. and it couldn’t be the fat lady from norfolk, as was once supposed; because it stands to reason that when you have a animosity towards a indian which makes you grind your teeth at him to his face, and which can hardly hold you from goosing him audible when he’s going through his war-dance,--it stands to reason you wouldn’t under them circumstances deprive yourself to support that indian in the lap of luxury. most unexpected, the mystery came out one day at egham races. the public was shy of bein pulled in, and chops was ringin his little bell out of his drawin-room winder, and was snarlin to me over his shoulder as he kneeled down with his legs out at the back door,--for he couldn’t be shoved into his house without kneeling down, and the premises wouldn’t accommodate his legs,--was snarlin: “here’s a precious public for you; why the devil don’t they tumble up?” when a man in the crowd holds up a carrier-pigeon and cries out: “if there’s any person here as has got a ticket, the lottery’s just drawd, and the number as has come up for the great prize is three, seven, forty-two! three, seven, forty-two!” i was givin the man to the furies myself, for calling of the public’s attention,--for the public will turn away, at any time, to look at anything in preference to the thing showed ’em; and if you doubt it, get ’em together for any individual purpose on the face of the earth, and send only two people in late and see if the whole company ain’t far more interested in taking particular notice of them two than you,--i say i wasn’t best pleased with the man for callin out, wasn’t blessin him in my own mind, when i see chops’s little bell fly out of the winder at a old lady, and he gets up and kicks his box over, exposin the whole secret, and he catches hold of the calves of my legs and he says to me: “carry me into the wan, toby, and throw a pail of water over me, or i’m a dead man, for i’m come into my property!” twelve thousand odd hundred pounds was chops’s winnins. he had bought a half-ticket for the twenty-five thousand prize, and it had come up. the first use he made of his property was to offer to fight the wild indian for five hundred pound a side, him with a poisoned darnin-needle and the indian with a club; but the indian being in want of backers to that amount, it went no further. arter he had been mad for a week--in a state of mind, in short, in which, if i had let him sit on the organ for only two minutes, i believe he would have bust--but we kept the organ from him--mr. chops come round and behaved liberal and beautiful to all. he then sent for a young man he knowed, as had a wery genteel appearance and was a bonnet at a gaming-booth (most respectable brought up, father havin been imminent in the livery-stable line, but unfort’nate in a commercial crisis through paintin a old gray, ginger-bay, and sellin him with a pedigree), and mr. chops said this to bonnet, who said his name was normandy, which it wasn’t:-- “normandy, i’m going into society. will you go with me?” says normandy: “do i understand you, mr. chops, to hintimate that the ’ole of the expenses of that move will be borne by yourself?” “correct,” says mr. chops. “and you shall have a princely allowance too.” the bonnet lifted mr. chops upon a chair to shake hands with him, and replied in poetry, his eyes seemingly full of tears:-- “my boat is on the shore, and my bark is on the sea, and i do not ask for more, but i’ll go--along with thee.” they went into society, in a chaise and four grays, with silk jackets. they took lodgings in pall mall, london, and they blazed away. in consequence of a note that was brought to bartlemy fair in the autumn of next year by a servant, most wonderful got up in milk-white cords and tops, i cleaned myself and went to pall mall, one evening appinted. the gentlemen was at their wine arter dinner, and mr. chops’s eyes was more fixed in that ed of his than i thought good for him. there was three of ’em (in company, i mean), and i knowed the third well. when last met, he had on a white roman shirt, and a bishop’s mitre covered with leopard-skin, and played the clarionet all wrong, in a band, at a wild-beast show. this gent took on not to know me, and mr. chops said: “gentlemen, this is an old friend of former days”; and normandy looked at me through a eyeglass, and said, “magsman, glad to see ye!” which i’ll take my oath he wasn’t. mr. chops, to get him convenient to the table, had his chair on a throne, much of the form of george fourth’s in the canvas, but he hardly appeared to me to be king there in any other pint of view, for his two gentlemen ordered about like emperors. they was all dressed like may-day--gorgeous!--and as to wine, they swam in all sorts. i made the round of the bottles, first separate (to say i had done it), and then tried two of ’em as half-and-half, then t’other two. altogether, i passed a pleasant evenin, but with a tendency to feel muddled, until i considered it good manners to get up and say: “mr. chops, the best of friends must part. i thank you for the wariety of foreign drains you have stood so ’ansome. i looks towards you in red wine, and i takes my leave.” mr. chops replied: “if you’ll just hitch me out of this over your right arm, magsman, and carry me down stairs, i’ll see you out.” i said i couldn’t think of such a thing, but he would have it, so i lifted him off his throne. he smelt strong of madeary, and i couldn’t help thinking, as i carried him down, that it was like carrying a large bottle full of wine, with a rayther ugly stopper, a good deal out of proportion. when i set him on the door-mat in the hall, he kept me close to him by holding on to my coat-collar, and he whispers:-- “i ain’t ’appy, magsman.” “what’s on your mind, mr. chops?” “they don’t use me well. they ain’t graceful to me. they puts me on the mantel-piece when i won’t have in more champagne-wine, and they locks me in the sideboard when i won’t give up my property.” “git rid of ’em, mr. chops.” “i can’t. we’re in society together, and what would society say?” “come out of society,” says i. “i can’t. you don’t know what you’re talking about. when you have once got into society, you mustn’t come out of it.” “then, if you’ll excuse the freedom, mr. chops,” was my remark, shaking my ed grave, “i think it’s a pity you ever went in.” mr. chops shook that deep ed of his to a surprisin extent, and slapped it half a dozen times with his hand, and with more wice than i thought were in him. then he says: “you’re a good feller, but you don’t understand. good night, go long. magsman, the little man will now walk three times around the cairawan, and retire behind the curtain.” the last i see of him on that occasion was his tryin, on the extremest werge of insensibility, to climb up the stairs, one by one, with his hands and knees. they’d have been much too steep for him if he had been sober; but he wouldn’t be helped. it warn’t long after that, that i read in the newspaper of mr. chops’s being presented at court. it was printed: “it will be recollected”--and i’ve noticed in my life that it is sure to be printed that it _will_ be recollected whenever it won’t--“that mr. chops is the individual of small stature whose brilliant success in the last state lottery attracted so much attention.” “well,” i said to myself, “such is life! he has been and done it in earnest at last! he has astonished george the fourth!” on account of which i had that canvas new painted, him with a bag of money in his hand, a presentin it to george the fourth, and a lady in ostrich feathers fallin in love with him in a bagwig, sword, and buckles correct. i took the house as is the subject of present inquiries--though not the honor of being acquainted--and i run magsman’s amusements in it thirteen months--sometimes one thing, sometimes another, sometimes nothin particular, but always all the canvases outside. one night, when we had played the last company out, which was a shy company through its raining heavens hard, i was takin a pipe in the one pair back, along with the young man with the toes, which i had taken on for a month (though he never drawed--except on paper), and i heard a kickin at the street door. “halloa!” i says to the young man, “what’s up?” he rubs his eyebrows with his toes, and he says, “i cant imagine, mr. magsman,”--which he never could imagine nothin, and was monotonous company. the noise not leavin off, i laid down my pipe, and i took up a candle, and i went down and opened the door. i looked out into the street; but nothin could i see, and nothin was i aware of, until i turned round quick, because some creeter run between my legs into the passage. there was mr. chops! “magsman,” he says, “take me on the hold terms, and you’ve got me; if it’s done, say done!” i was all of a maze, but i said, “done, sir.” “done to your done, and double done!” says he. “have you got a bit of supper in the house?” bearin in mind them sparklin warieties of foreign drains as we’d guzzled away at in pall mall, i was ashamed to offer him cold sassages and gin-and-water; but he took ’em both and took ’em free; havin a chair for his table, and sittin down at it on a stool, like hold times,--i all of a maze all the while. it was arter he had made a clean sweep of the sassages (beef, and to the best of my calculations two pounds and a quarter), that the wisdom as was in that little man began to come out of him like perspiration. “magsman,” he says, “look upon me?--you see afore you one as has both gone into society, and come out.” “o, you _are_ out of it, mr. chops? how did you get out, sir?” “sold out!” says he. you never saw the like of the wisdom as his ed expressed, when he made use of them two words. “my friend magsman, i’ll impart to you a discovery i’ve made. it’s wallable; it’s cost twelve thousand five hundred pound; it may do you good in life. the secret of this matter is, that it ain’t so much that a person goes into society, as that society goes into a person.” not exactly keeping up with his meanin, i shook my ed, put on a deep look, and said, “you’re right there, mr. chops.” “magsman,” he says, twitchin me by the leg, “society has gone into me to the tune of every penny of my property.” i felt that i went pale, and though not naturally a bold speaker, i couldn’t hardly say, “where’s normandy?” “bolted,--with the plate,” said mr. chops. “and t’other one?”--meaning him as formerly wore the bishop’s mitre. “bolted,--with the jewels,” said mr. chops. i sat down and looked at him, and he stood up and looked at me. “magsman,” he says, and he seemed to myself to get wiser as he got hoarser, “society, taken in the lump, is all dwarfs. at the court of saint james they was all a doin my bisness--all a goin three times round the cairawan, in the hold court suits and properties. elsewhere, they was most of ’em ringing their little bells out of makebelieves. everywheres, the sarser was a goin round--magsman, the sarser is the universal institution!” i perceived, you understand, that he was soured by his misfortuns, and i felt for mr. chops. “as to fat ladies,” says he, giving his ed a tremendious one agin the wall, “there’s lots of _them_ in society, and worse than the original. _hers_ was a outrage upon taste--simply a outrage upon taste--awakin contempt--carryin its own punishment in the form of a indian!” here he giv himself another tremendious one. “but _theirs_, magsman, _theirs_ is mercenary outrages. lay in cashmere shawls, buy bracelets, strew ’em and a lot of ’andsome fans and things about your rooms, let it be known that you give away like water to all as come to admire, and the fat ladies that don’t exhibit for so much down upon the drum will come from all the pints of the compass to flock about you, whatever you are. they’ll drill holes in your ’art, magsman, like a cullender. and when you’ve no more left to give, they’ll laugh at you to your face, and leave you to have your bones picked dry by wulturs, like the dead wild ass of the prayries that you deserve to be!” here he giv himself the most tremendious one of all, and dropped. i thought he was gone. his ed was so heavy, and he knocked it so hard, and he fell so stony, and the sassagereal disturbance in him must have been so immense, that i thought he was gone. but he soon come round with care, and he sat up on the floor, and he said to me, with wisdom comin out of his eyes, if ever it come,-- “magsman! the most material difference between the two states of existence through which your unappy friend has passed,”--he reached out his poor little hand, and his tears dropped down on the mustache which it was a credit to him to have done his best to grow, but it is not in mortals to command success,--“the difference is this: when i was out of society, i was paid light for being seen. when i went into society, i paid heavy for being seen. i prefer the former, even if i wasn’t forced upon it. give me out through the trumpet, in the hold way, to-morrow.” after that, he slid into the line again as easy as if he had been iled all over. but the organ was kep from him, and no allusions was ever made, when a company was in, to his property. he got wiser every day; his views of society and the public was luminous, bewilderin, awful; and his ed got bigger and bigger as his wisdom expanded it. he took well, and pulled ’em in most excellent for nine weeks. at the expiration of that period, when his ed was a sight, he expressed one evening, the last company havin been turned out, and the doors shut, a wish to have a little music. “mr. chops,” i said (i never dropped the “mr.” with him; the world might do it, but not me),--“mr. chops, are you sure as you are in a state of mind and body to sit upon the organ?” his answer was this: “toby, when next met with on the tramp, i forgive her and the indian. and i am.” it was with fear and tremblin that i began to turn the handle; but he sat like a lamb. it will be my belief to my dying day, that i see his ed expand as he sat; you may therefore judge how great his thoughts was. he sat out all the changes, and then he come off. “toby,” he says with a quiet smile, “the little man will now walk three times round the cairawan, and then retire behind the curtain.” when we called him in the mornin we found he had gone into much better society than mine or pall mall’s. i give mr. chops as comfortable a funeral as lay in my power, followed myself as chief, and had the george the fourth canvas carried first, in the form of a banner. but the house was so dismal afterwards, that i give it up, and took to the wan again. [illustration: text decoration] [illustration: text decoration] wakefield. by nathaniel hawthorne. in some old magazine or newspaper, i recollect a story, told as truth, of a man--let us call him wakefield--who absented himself for a long time from his wife. the fact, thus abstractedly stated, is not very uncommon, nor--without a proper distinction of circumstances--to be condemned either as naughty or nonsensical. howbeit, this, though far from the most aggravated, is perhaps the strangest instance, on record, of marital delinquency; and, moreover, as remarkable a freak as may be found in the whole list of human oddities. the wedded couple lived in london. the man, under pretence of going a journey, took lodgings in the next street to his own house, and there, unheard of by his wife or friends, and without the shadow of a reason for such self-banishment, dwelt upward of twenty years. during that period he beheld his home every day, and frequently the forlorn mrs. wakefield. and after so great a gap in his matrimonial felicity,--when his death was reckoned certain, his estate settled, his name dismissed from memory, and his wife, long, long ago, resigned to her autumnal widowhood,--he entered the door one evening, quietly, as from a day’s absence, and became a loving spouse till death. this outline is all that i remember. but the incident, though of the purest originality, unexampled, and probably never to be repeated, is one, i think, which appeals to the generous sympathies of mankind. we know, each for himself, that none of us would perpetrate such a folly, yet feel as if some other might. to my own contemplations, at least, it has often recurred, always exciting wonder, but with a sense that the story must be true, and a conception of its hero’s character. whenever any subject so forcibly affects the mind, time is well spent in thinking of it. if the reader choose, let him do his own meditation; or if he prefer to ramble with me through the twenty years of wakefield’s vagary, i bid him welcome; trusting that there will be a pervading spirit and a moral, even should we fail to find them, done up neatly, and condensed into the final sentence. thought has always its efficacy, and every striking incident its moral. what sort of man was wakefield? we are free to shape out our own idea, and call it by his name. he was now in the meridian of life; his matrimonial affections, never violent, were sobered into a calm, habitual sentiment; of all husbands, he was likely to be the most constant, because a certain sluggishness would keep his heart at rest, wherever it might be placed. he was intellectual, but not actively so; his mind occupied itself in long and lazy musings, that tended to no purpose, or had not vigor to attain it; his thoughts were seldom so energetic as to seize hold of words. imagination, in the proper meaning of the term, made no part of wakefield’s gifts. with a cold but not depraved nor wandering heart, and a mind never feverish with riotous thoughts, nor perplexed with originality, who could have anticipated that our friend would entitle himself to a foremost place among the doers of eccentric deeds? had his acquaintances been asked who was the man in london the surest to perform nothing to-day which should be remembered on the morrow, they would have thought of wakefield. only the wife of his bosom might have hesitated. she, without having analyzed his character, was partly aware of a quiet selfishness, that had rusted into his inactive mind,--of a peculiar sort of vanity, the most uneasy attribute about him,--of a disposition to craft, which had seldom produced more positive effects than the keeping of petty secrets, hardly worth revealing,--and, lastly, of what she called a little strangeness, sometimes, in the good man. this latter quality is indefinable, and perhaps non-existent. let us now imagine wakefield bidding adieu to his wife. it is the dusk of an october evening. his equipment is a drab great-coat, a hat covered with an oil-cloth, top boots, an umbrella in one hand and a small portmanteau in the other. he has informed mrs. wakefield that he is to take the night coach into the country. she would fain inquire the length of his journey, its object, and the probable time of his return; but, indulgent to his harmless love of mystery, interrogates him only by a look. he tells her not to expect him positively by the return coach, nor to be alarmed should he tarry three or four days; but, at all events, to look for him at supper on friday evening. wakefield himself, be it considered, has no suspicion of what is before him. he holds out his hand; she gives her own, and meets his parting kiss, in the matter-of-course way of a ten years’ matrimony; and forth goes the middle-aged mr. wakefield, almost resolved to perplex his good lady by a whole week’s absence. after the door has closed behind him, she perceives it thrust partly open, and a vision of her husband’s face, through the aperture, smiling on her, and gone in a moment. for the time, this little incident is dismissed without a thought. but, long afterward, when she has been more years a widow than a wife, that smile recurs, and flickers across all her reminiscences of wakefield’s visage. in her many musings, she surrounds the original smile with a multitude of fantasies, which make it strange and awful; as, for instance, if she imagines him in a coffin, that parting look is frozen on his pale features; or, if she dreams of him in heaven, still his blessed spirit wears a quiet and crafty smile. yet, for its sake, when all others have given him up for dead, she sometimes doubts whether she is a widow. but our business is with the husband. we must hurry after him, along the street, ere he lose his individuality, and melt into the great mass of london life. it would be vain searching for him there. let us follow close at his heels, therefore, until, after several superfluous turns and doublings, we find him comfortably established by the fireside of a small apartment, previously bespoken. he is in the next street to his own, and at his journey’s end. he can scarcely trust his good fortune, in having got thither unperceived,--recollecting that, at one time, he was delayed by the throng, in the very focus of a lighted lantern; and, again, there were footsteps, that seemed to tread behind his own, distinct from the multitudinous tramp around him; and, anon, he heard a voice shouting afar, and fancied that it called his name. doubtless a dozen busybodies had been watching him, and told his wife the whole affair. poor wakefield! little knowest thou thine own insignificance in this great world! no mortal eye but mine has traced thee. go quietly to thy bed, foolish man; and, on the morrow, if thou wilt be wise, get thee home to good mrs. wakefield, and tell her the truth. remove not thyself, even for a little week, from thy place in her chaste bosom. were she, for a single moment, to deem thee dead, or lost, or lastingly divided from her, thou wouldst be woefully conscious of a change in thy true wife, forever after. it is perilous to make a chasm in human affections; not that they gape so long and wide, but so quickly close again! almost repenting of his frolic, or whatever it may be termed, wakefield lies down betimes, and, starting from his first nap, spreads forth his arms into the wide and solitary waste of the unaccustomed bed. “no,” thinks he, gathering the bedclothes about him, “i will not sleep alone another night.” in the morning, he rises earlier than usual, and sets himself to consider what he really means to do. such are his loose and rambling modes of thought, that he has taken this very singular step, with the consciousness of a purpose, indeed, but without being able to define it sufficiently for his own contemplation. the vagueness of the project, and the convulsive effort with which he plunges into the execution of it, are equally characteristic of a feeble-minded man. wakefield sifts his ideas, however, as minutely as he may, and finds himself curious to know the progress of matters at home,--how his exemplary wife will endure her widowhood of a week; and, briefly, how the little sphere of creatures and circumstances, in which he was a central object, will be affected by his removal. a morbid vanity, therefore, lies nearest the bottom of the affair. but how is he to attain his ends? not, certainly, by keeping close in this comfortable lodging, where, though he slept and awoke in the next street to his home, he is as effectually abroad as if the stage-coach had been whirling him away all night. yet, should he reappear, the whole project is knocked in the head. his poor brains being hopelessly puzzled with this dilemma, he at length ventures out, partly resolving to cross the head of the street, and send one hasty glance toward his forsaken domicile. habit--for he is a man of habits--takes him by the hand, and guides him, wholly unaware, to his own door, where, just at the critical moment, he is aroused by the scraping of his foot upon the step. wakefield! whither are you going? at that instant, his fate was turning on the pivot. little dreaming of the doom to which his first backward step devotes him, he hurries away, breathless with agitation hitherto unfelt, and hardly dares turn his head at the distant corner. can it be that nobody caught sight of him? will not the whole household--the decent mrs. wakefield, the smart maid-servant, and the dirty little footboy--raise a hue and cry, through london streets, in pursuit of their fugitive lord and master? wonderful escape! he gathers courage to pause and look homeward, but is perplexed with a sense of change about the familiar edifice, such as affects us all when, after a separation of months or years, we again see some hill or lake, or work of art, with which we were friends of old. in ordinary cases, this indescribable impression is caused by the comparison and contrast between our imperfect reminiscences and the reality. in wakefield, the magic of a single night has wrought a similar transformation, because, in that brief period, a great moral change has been effected. but this is a secret from himself. before leaving the spot, he catches a far and momentary glimpse of his wife, passing athwart the front window, with her face turned toward the head of the street. the crafty nincompoop takes to his heels, scared with the idea that, among a thousand such atoms of mortality, her eye must have detected him. right glad is his heart, though his brain be somewhat dizzy, when he finds himself by the coal fire of his lodgings. so much for the commencement of this long whim-wham. after the initial conception, and the stirring up of the man’s sluggish temperament to put it in practice, the whole matter evolves itself in a natural train. we may suppose him, as the result of deep deliberation, buying a new wig, of reddish hair, and selecting sundry garments, in a fashion unlike his customary suit of brown, from a jew’s old-clothes bag. it is accomplished. wakefield is another man. the new system being now established, a retrograde movement to the old would be almost as difficult as the step that placed him in his unparalleled position. furthermore, he is rendered obstinate by a sulkiness, occasionally incident to his temper, and brought on, at present, by the inadequate sensation which he conceives to have been produced in the bosom of mrs. wakefield. he will not go back until she be frightened half to death. well; twice or thrice has she passed before his sight, each time with a heavier step, a paler cheek, and a more anxious brow; and in the third week of his non-appearance, he detects a portent of evil entering the house, in the guise of an apothecary. next day, the knocker is muffled. toward nightfall comes the chariot of a physician, and deposits its big-wigged and solemn burden at wakefield’s door, whence, after a quarter of an hour’s visit, he emerges, perchance the herald of a funeral. dear woman! will she die? by this time, wakefield is excited to something like energy of feeling, but still lingers away from his wife’s bedside, pleading with his conscience, that she must not be disturbed at such a juncture. if aught else restrains him, he does not know it. in the course of a few weeks, she gradually recovers; the crisis is over; her heart is sad, perhaps, but quiet; and, let him return soon or late, it will never be feverish for him again. such ideas glimmer through the mist of wakefield’s mind, and render him indistinctly conscious that an almost impassable gulf divides his hired apartment from his former home. “it is but in the next street!” he sometimes says. fool! it is in another world. hitherto, he has put off his return from one particular day to another; henceforward, he leaves the precise time undetermined. not to-morrow,--probably next week,--pretty soon. poor man! the dead have nearly as much chance of revisiting their earthly homes, as the self-banished wakefield. would that i had a folio to write, instead of an article of a dozen pages! then might i exemplify how an influence, beyond our control, lays its strong hand on every deed which we do, and weaves its consequences into an iron tissue of necessity. wakefield is spellbound. we must leave him, for ten years or so, to haunt around his house, without once crossing the threshold, and to be faithful to his wife, with all the affection of which his heart is capable, while he is slowly fading out of hers. long since, it must be remarked, he has lost the perception of singularity in his conduct. now for a scene! amid the throng of a london street, we distinguish a man, now waxing elderly, with few characteristics to attract careless observers, yet bearing, in his whole aspect, the handwriting of no common fate, for such as have the skill to read it. he is meagre; his low and narrow forehead is deeply wrinkled; his eyes, small and lustreless, sometimes wander apprehensively about him, but oftener seem to look inward. he bends his head, and moves with an indescribable obliquity of gait, as if unwilling to display his full front to the world. watch him long enough to see what we have described, and you will allow that circumstances, which often produce remarkable men from nature’s ordinary handiwork, have produced one such here. next, leaving him to sidle along the footwalk, cast your eyes in the opposite direction, where a portly female, considerably in the wane of life, with a prayer-book in her hand, is proceeding to yonder church. she has the placid mien of settled widowhood. her regrets have either died away, or have become so essential to her heart that they would be poorly exchanged for joy. just as the lean man and the well-conditioned woman are passing, a slight obstruction occurs, and brings these two figures directly in contact. their hands touch; the pressure of the crowd forces her bosom against his shoulder; they stand face to face, staring into each other’s eyes. after a ten years’ separation, thus wakefield meets his wife! the throng eddies away, and carries them asunder. the sober widow, resuming her former pace, proceeds to church, but pauses in the portal, and throws a perplexed glance along the street. she passes in, however, opening her prayer-book as she goes. and the man! with so wild a face that busy and selfish london stands to gaze after him, he hurries to his lodgings, bolts the door, and throws himself upon the bed. the latent feelings of years break out; his feeble mind acquires a brief energy from their strength; all the miserable strangeness of his life is revealed to him at a glance: and he cries out passionately, “wakefield! wakefield! you are mad!” perhaps he was so. the singularity of his situation must have so moulded him to himself, that, considered in regard to his fellow-creatures and the business of life, he could not be said to possess his right mind. he had contrived, or rather he had happened, to dissever himself from the world,--to vanish,--to give up his place and privileges with living men, without being admitted among the dead. the life of a hermit is nowise parallel to his. he was in the bustle of the city, as of old; but the crowd swept by, and saw him not; he was, we may figuratively say, always beside his wife, and at his hearth, yet must never feel the warmth of the one, nor the affection of the other. it was wakefield’s unprecedented fate to retain his original share of human sympathies, and to be still involved in human interests, while he had lost his reciprocal influence on them. it would be a most curious speculation to trace out the effect of such circumstances on his heart and intellect, separately, and in unison. yet, changed as he was, he would seldom be conscious of it, but deem himself the same man as ever; glimpses of the truth, indeed, would come, but only for the moment; and still he would keep saying, “i shall soon go back!”--nor reflect that he had been saying so for twenty years. i conceive, also, that these twenty years would appear, in the retrospect, scarcely longer than the week to which wakefield had at first limited his absence. he would look on the affair as no more than an interlude in the main business of his life. when, after a little while more, he should deem it time to re-enter his parlor, his wife would clap her hands for joy, on beholding the middle-aged mr. wakefield. alas, what a mistake! would time but await the close of our favorite follies, we should be young men, all of us, and till doomsday. one evening, in the twentieth year since he vanished, wakefield is taking his customary walk toward the dwelling which he still calls his own. it is a gusty night of autumn, with frequent showers, that patter down upon the pavement, and are gone, before a man can put up his umbrella. pausing near the house, wakefield discerns, through the parlor windows of the second floor, the red glow, and the glimmer and fitful flash, of a comfortable fire. on the ceiling appears a grotesque shadow of good mrs. wakefield. the cap, the nose and chin, and the broad waist form an admirable caricature, which dances, moreover, with the up-flickering and down-sinking blaze, almost too merrily for the shade of an elderly widow. at this instant, a shower chances to fall, and is driven, by the unmannerly gust, full into wakefield’s face and bosom. he is quite penetrated with its autumnal chill. shall he stand, wet and shivering here, when his own hearth has a good fire to warm him, and his own wife will run to fetch the gray coat and small-clothes, which, doubtless, she has kept carefully in the closet of their bedchamber? no! wakefield is no such fool. he ascends the steps,--heavily!--for twenty years have stiffened his legs, since he came down,--but he knows it not. stay, wakefield! would you go to the sole home that is left you? then step into your grave! the door opens. as he passes in, we have a parting glimpse of his visage, and recognize the crafty smile which was the precursor of the little joke that he has ever since been playing off at his wife’s expense. how unmercifully has he quizzed the poor woman! well, a good night’s rest to wakefield! this happy event--supposing it to be such--could only have occurred at an unpremeditated moment. we will not follow our friend across the threshold. he has left us much food for thought, a portion of which shall lend its wisdom to a moral, and be shaped into a figure. amid the seeming confusion of our mysterious world, individuals are so nicely adjusted to a system, and systems to one another and to a whole, that, by stepping aside for a moment, a man exposes himself to a fearful risk of losing his place forever. like wakefield, he may become, as it were, the outcast of the universe. [illustration: text decoration] [illustration: text decoration] murder, considered as one of the fine arts. by thomas de quincey. we have all heard of a society for the promotion of vice, of the hell-fire club, etc. at brighton, i think it was, that a society was formed for the suppression of virtue. that society was itself suppressed; but i am sorry to say that another exists in london, of a character still more atrocious. in tendency, it may be denominated a society for the encouragement of murder; but, according to their own delicate εἰφημισμός, it is styled, the society of connoisseurs in murder. they profess to be curious in homicide; amateurs and dilettanti in the various modes of bloodshed; and, in short, murder-fanciers. every fresh atrocity of that class, which the police annals of europe bring up, they meet and criticise as they would a picture, statue, or other work of art. but i need not trouble myself with any attempt to describe the spirit of their proceedings, as you will collect _that_ much better from one of the monthly lectures read before the society last year. this has fallen into my hands, accidentally, in spite of all the vigilance exercised to keep their transactions from the public eye. the publication of it will alarm them; and my purpose is that it should. for i would much rather put them down quietly, by an appeal to public opinion, than by such an exposure of names as would follow an appeal to bow street; which last appeal, however, if this should fail, i must positively resort to. lecture. gentlemen,--i have had the honor to be appointed by your committee to the trying task of reading the williams lecture on murder, considered as one of the fine arts; a task which might be easy enough three or four centuries ago, when the art was little understood, and few great models had been exhibited; but in this age, when masterpieces of excellence have been executed by professional men, it must be evident that, in the style of criticism applied to them, the public will look for something of a corresponding improvement. practice and theory must advance _pari passu_. people begin to see that something more goes to the composition of a fine murder than two blockheads to kill and be killed,--a knife,--a purse,--and a dark lane. design, gentlemen, grouping, light and shade, poetry, sentiment, are now deemed indispensable to attempts of this nature. mr. williams has exalted the ideal of murder to all of us; and to me, therefore, in particular, has deepened the arduousness of my task. like æschylus or milton in poetry, like michael angelo in painting, he has carried his art to a point of colossal sublimity; and, as mr. wordsworth observes, has in a manner “created the taste by which he is to be enjoyed.” to sketch the history of the art, and to examine its principles critically, now remains as a duty for the connoisseur, and for judges of quite another stamp from his majesty’s judges of assize. before i begin, let me say a word or two to certain prigs, who affect to speak of our society as if it were in some degree immoral in its tendency. immoral! god bless my soul, gentlemen, what is it that people mean? i am for morality, and always shall be, and for virtue and all that; and i do affirm, and always shall (let what will come of it), that murder is an improper line of conduct, highly improper; and i do not stick to assert that any man who deals in murder must have very incorrect ways of thinking, and truly inaccurate principles; and so far from aiding and abetting him by pointing out his victim’s hiding-place, as a great moralist[a] of germany declared it to be every good man’s duty to do, i would subscribe one shilling and sixpence to have him apprehended, which is more by eighteen-pence than the most eminent moralists have subscribed for that purpose. but what then? everything in this world has two handles. murder, for instance, may be laid hold of by its moral handle (as it generally is in the pulpit, and at the old bailey); and _that_, i confess, is its weak side; or it may also be treated _æsthetically_, as the germans call it, that is, in relation to good taste. to illustrate this, i will urge the authority of three eminent persons, namely, s. t. coleridge, aristotle, and mr. howship the surgeon. to begin with s. t. c. one night, many years ago, i was drinking tea with him in berners street (which, by the way, for a short street, has been uncommonly fruitful in men of genius). others were there besides myself; and amidst some carnal considerations of tea and toast, we were all imbibing a dissertation on plotinus from the attic lips of s. t. c. suddenly a cry arose of “_fire,--fire!_” upon which all of us, master and disciples, plato and ὁι περί τον πλάτωνα, rushed out, eager for the spectacle. the fire was in oxford street, at a piano-forte maker’s; and, as it promised to be a conflagration of merit, i was sorry that my engagements forced me away from mr. coleridge’s party before matters were come to a crisis. some days after, meeting with my platonic host, i reminded him of the case, and begged to know how that very promising exhibition had terminated. “o sir,” said he, “it turned out so ill, that we damned it unanimously!” now, does any man suppose that mr. coleridge,--who, for all he is too fat to be a person of active virtue, is undoubtedly a worthy christian,--that this good s. t. c., i say, was an incendiary, or capable of wishing any ill to the poor man and his piano-fortes (many of them, doubtless, with the additional keys)? on the contrary, i know him to be that sort of man, that i durst stake my life upon it he would have worked an engine in a case of necessity, although rather of the fattest for such fiery trials of his virtue. but how stood the case? virtue was in no request. on the arrival of the fire-engines, morality had devolved wholly on the insurance office. this being the case, he had a right to gratify his taste. he had left his tea. was he to have nothing in return? i contend that the most virtuous man, under the premises stated, was entitled to make a luxury of the fire, and to hiss it, as he would any other performance that raised expectations in the public mind, which afterwards it disappointed. again, to cite another great authority, what says the stagyrite? he (in the fifth book, i think it is, of his metaphysics) describes what he calls κλεπτὴν τέλειον, i.e. _a perfect thief_; and, as to mr. howship, in a work of his on indigestion, he makes no scruple to talk with admiration of a certain ulcer which he had seen, and which he styles “a beautiful ulcer.” now will any man pretend that, abstractly considered, a thief could appear to aristotle a perfect character, or that mr. howship could be enamored of an ulcer? aristotle, it is well known, was himself so very moral a character that, not content with writing his nichomachéan ethics, in one volume octavo, he also wrote another system, called _magna moralia_, or big ethics. now, it is impossible that a man who composes any ethics at all, big or little, should admire a thief _per se_; and, as to mr. howship, it is well known that he makes war upon all ulcers, and, without suffering himself to be seduced by their charms, endeavors to banish them from the county of middlesex. but the truth is, that, however objectionable _per se_, yet, relatively to others of their class, both a thief and an ulcer may have infinite degrees of merit. they are both imperfections, it is true; but to be imperfect being their essence, the very greatness of their imperfection becomes their perfection. _spartam nactus es, hanc exorna._ a thief like autolycus or mr. barrington, and a grim phagedænic ulcer, superbly defined, and running regularly through all its natural stages, may no less justly be regarded as ideals after _their_ kind, than the most faultless moss-rose amongst flowers, in its progress from bud to “bright consummate flower”; or, amongst human flowers, the most magnificent young female, apparelled in the pomp of womanhood. and thus not only the ideal of an inkstand may be imagined (as mr. coleridge demonstrated in his celebrated correspondence with mr. blackwood), in which, by the way, there is not so much, because an inkstand is a laudable sort of thing, and a valuable member of society; but even imperfection itself may have its ideal or perfect state. really, gentlemen, i beg pardon for so much philosophy at one time, and now let me apply it. when a murder is in the paulo-post-futurum tense, and a rumor of it comes to our ears, by all means let us treat it morally. but suppose it over and done, and that you can say of it, τετέλεςαι, or (in that adamantine molossus of medea) είρξαςαι; suppose the poor murdered man to be out of his pain, and the rascal that did it off like a shot, nobody knows whither; suppose, lastly, that we have done our best, by putting out our legs to trip up the fellow in his flight, but all to no purpose,--“abiit, evasit,” etc.,--why, then, i say, what’s the use of any more virtue? enough has been given to morality; now comes the turn of taste and the fine arts. a sad thing it was, no doubt, very sad; but _we_ can’t mend it. therefore let us make the best of a bad matter; and as it is impossible to hammer anything out of it for moral purposes, let us treat it æsthetically, and see if it will turn to account in that way. such is the logic of a sensible man, and what follows? we dry up our tears, and have the satisfaction, perhaps, to discover that a transaction which, morally considered, was shocking, and without a leg to stand upon, when tried by principles of taste, turns out to be a very meritorious performance. thus all the world is pleased; the old proverb is justified, that it is an ill wind which blows nobody good; the amateur, from looking bilious and sulky, by too close an attention to virtue, begins to pick up his crumbs, and general hilarity prevails. virtue has had her day; and henceforward, _vertu_ and connoisseurship have leave to provide for themselves. upon this principle, gentlemen, i propose to guide your studies, from cain to mr. thurtell. through this great gallery of murder, therefore, together let us wander hand in hand, in delighted admiration, while i endeavor to point your attention to the objects of profitable criticism. * * * * * the first murder is familiar to you all. as the inventor of murder, and the father of the art, cain must have been a man of first-rate genius. all the cains were men of genius. tubal cain invented tubes, i think, or some such thing. but, whatever were the originality and genius of the artist, every art was then in its infancy, and the works must be criticised with a recollection of that fact. even tubal’s work would probably be little approved at this day in sheffield; and therefore of cain (cain senior, i mean) it is no disparagement to say, that his performance was but so so. milton, however, is supposed to have thought differently. by his way of relating the case, it should seem to have been rather a pet murder with him, for he retouches it with an apparent anxiety for its picturesque effect:-- “whereat he inly raged; and, as they talk’d, smote him into the midriff with a stone that beat out life: he fell; and, deadly pale, groan’d out his soul _with gushing blood effus’d_.” _par. lost_, b. xi. upon this, richardson, the painter, who had an eye for effect, remarks as follows, in his notes on paradise lost, p. <UNK> “it has been thought,” says he, “that cain beat (as the common saying is) the breath out of his brother’s body with a great stone; milton gives in to this, with the addition, however, of a large wound.” in this place it was a judicious addition; for the rudeness of the weapon, unless raised and enriched by a warm, sanguinary coloring, has too much of the naked air of the savage school; as if the deed were perpetrated by a polypheme without science, premeditation, or anything but a mutton bone. however, i am chiefly pleased with the improvement, as it implies that milton was an amateur. as to shakespeare, there never was a better; as his description of the murdered duke of gloucester, in henry vi., of duncan’s, banquo’s, etc., sufficiently proves. the foundation of the art having been once laid, it is pitiable to see how it slumbered without improvement for ages. in fact, i shall now be obliged to leap over all murders, sacred and profane, as utterly unworthy of notice, until long after the christian era. greece, even in the age of pericles, produced no murder of the slightest merit; and rome had too little originality of genius in any of the arts to succeed, where her model failed her. in fact, the latin language sinks under the very idea of murder. “the man was murdered”;--how will this sound in latin? _interfectus est_, _interemptus est_,--which simply expresses a homicide; and hence the christian latinity of the middle ages was obliged to introduce a new word, such as the feebleness of classic conceptions never ascended to. _murdratus est_, says the sublimer dialect of gothic ages. meantime, the jewish school of murder kept alive whatever was yet known in the art, and gradually transferred it to the western world. indeed the jewish school was always respectable, even in the dark ages, as the case of hugh of lincoln shows, which was honored with the approbation of chaucer, on occasion of another performance from the same school which he puts into the mouth of the lady abbess. recurring, however, for one moment to classical antiquity, i cannot but think that catiline, clodius, and some of that coterie would have made first-rate artists; and it is on all accounts to be regretted, that the priggism of cicero robbed his country of the only chance she had for distinction in this line. as the _subject_ of a murder, no person could have answered better than himself. lord! how he would have howled with panic, if he had heard cethegus under his bed. it would have been truly diverting to have listened to him; and satisfied i am, gentlemen, that he would have preferred the _utile_ of creeping into a closet, or even into a _cloaca_, to the _honestum_ of facing the bold artist. to come now to the dark ages (by which we, that speak with precision, mean, _par excellence_, the tenth century, and the times immediately before and after), these ages ought naturally to be favorable to the art of murder, as they were to church architecture, to stained glass, etc.; and, accordingly, about the latter end of this period, there arose a great character in our art, i mean the old man of the mountains. he was a shining light, indeed, and i need not tell you that the very word “assassin” is deduced from him. so keen an amateur was he, that on one occasion, when his own life was attempted by a favorite assassin, he was so much pleased with the talent shown, that, notwithstanding the failure of the artist, he created him a duke upon the spot, with remainder to the female line, and settled a pension on him for three lives. assassination is a branch of the art which demands a separate notice; and i shall devote an entire lecture to it. meantime, i shall only observe how odd it is that this branch of the art has flourished by fits. it never rains, but it pours. our own age can boast of some fine specimens; and about two centuries ago there was a most brilliant constellation of murders in this class. i need hardly say that i allude especially to those five splendid works,--the assassinations of william i., of orange, of henry iv., of france, of the duke of buckingham (which you will find excellently described in the letters published by mr. ellis, of the british museum), of gustavus adolphus, and of wallenstein. the king of sweden’s assassination, by the by, is doubted by many writers, harte amongst others; but they are wrong. he was murdered; and i consider his murder unique in its excellence; for he was murdered at noonday, and on the field of battle,--a feature of original conception, which occurs in no other work of art that i remember. indeed, all of these assassinations may be studied with profit by the advanced connoisseur. they are all of them _exemplaria_, of which one may say,-- “nocturna versata manu, versate diurne”; especially _nocturna_. in these assassinations of princes and statesmen, there is nothing to excite our wonder; important changes often depend on their deaths; and, from the eminence on which they stand, they are peculiarly exposed to the aim of every artist who happens to be possessed by the craving for scenical effect. but there is another class of assassinations, which has prevailed from an early period of the seventeenth century, that really _does_ surprise me; i mean the assassination of philosophers. for, gentlemen, it is a fact that every philosopher of eminence for the two last centuries has either been murdered, or, at the least, been very near it; insomuch, that if a man calls himself a philosopher, and never had his life attempted, rest assured there is nothing in him; and against locke’s philosophy in particular, i think it an unanswerable objection (if we needed any) that, although he carried his throat about with him in this world for seventy-two years, no man ever condescended to cut it. as these cases of philosophers are not much known, and are generally good and well composed in their circumstances, i shall here read an excursus on that subject, chiefly by way of showing my own learning. the first great philosopher of the seventeenth century (if we except galileo) was des cartes; and if ever one could say of a man that he was all _but_ murdered,--murdered within an inch,--one must say it of him. the case was this, as reported by baillet in his _vie de m. des cartes_, tom. i. pp. <UNK> in the year <UNK> when des cartes might be about twenty-six years old, he was touring about as usual (for he was as restless as a hyena), and, coming to the elbe, either at gluckstadt or at hamburg, he took shipping for east friezland: what he could want in east friezland, no man has ever discovered; and perhaps he took this into consideration himself; for, on reaching embden, he resolved to sail instantly for _west_ friezland; and, being very impatient of delay, he hired a bark, with a few mariners to navigate it. no sooner had he got out to sea, than he made a pleasing discovery, namely, that he had shut himself up in a den of murderers. his crew, says m. baillet, he soon found out to be “des scélérats,”--not _amateurs_, gentlemen, as we are, but professional men,--the height of whose ambition at that moment was to cut his throat. but the story is too pleasing to be abridged; i shall give it, therefore, accurately, from the french of his biographer: “m. des cartes had no company but that of his servant, with whom he was conversing in french. the sailors, who took him for a foreign merchant, rather than a cavalier, concluded that he must have money about him. accordingly they came to a resolution by no means advantageous to his purse. there is this difference, however, between sea-robbers and the robbers in forests, that the latter may, without hazard, spare the lives of their victims; whereas the other cannot put a passenger on shore in such a case without running the risk of being apprehended. the crew of m. des cartes arranged their measures with a view to evade any danger of that sort. they observed that he was a stranger from a distance, without acquaintance in the country, and that nobody would take any trouble to inquire about him, in case he should never come to hand, _quand il viendroit à manquer_.” think, gentlemen, of these friezland dogs discussing a philosopher as if he were a puncheon of rum. “his temper, they remarked, was very mild and patient; and, judging from the gentleness of his deportment, and the courtesy with which he treated themselves, that he could be nothing more than some green young man, they concluded that they should have all the easier task in disposing of his life. they made no scruple to discuss the whole matter in his presence, as not supposing that he understood any other language than that in which he conversed with his servant; and the amount of their deliberation was--to murder him, then to throw him into the sea, and to divide his spoils.” excuse my laughing, gentlemen, but the fact is, i always _do_ laugh when i think of this case,--two things about it seem so droll. one is, the horrid panic or “funk” (as the men of eton call it) in which des cartes must have found himself upon hearing this regular drama sketched for his own death,--funeral,--succession and administration to his effects. but another thing which seems to me still more funny about this affair is, that if these friezland hounds had been “game,” we should have no cartesian philosophy; and how we could have done without _that_, considering the world of books it has produced, i leave to any respectable trunk-maker to declare. however, to go on; spite of his enormous funk, des cartes showed fight, and by that means awed these anti-cartesian rascals. “finding,” says m. baillet, “that the matter was no joke, m. des cartes leaped upon his feet in a trice, assumed a stern countenance that these cravens had never looked for, and, addressing them in their own language, threatened to run them through on the spot if they dared to offer him any insult.” certainly, gentlemen, this would have been an honor far above the merits of such inconsiderable rascals,--to be spitted like larks upon a cartesian sword; and therefore i am glad m. des cartes did not rob the gallows by executing his threat, especially as he could not possibly have brought his vessel to port, after he had murdered his crew; so that he must have continued to cruise forever in the zuyder zee, and would probably have been mistaken by sailors for the _flying dutchman_, homeward bound. “the spirit which m. des cartes manifested,” says his biographer, “had the effect of magic on these wretches. the suddenness of their consternation struck their minds with a confusion which blinded them to their advantage, and they conveyed him to his destination as peaceably as he could desire.” possibly, gentlemen, you may fancy that, on the model of cæsar’s address to his poor ferryman,--“_cæsarem vehis et fortunas ejus_,”--m. des cartes needed only to have said, “dogs, you cannot cut my throat, for you carry des cartes and his philosophy,” and might safely have defied them to do their worst. a german emperor had the same notion, when, being cautioned to keep out of the way of a cannonading, he replied, “tut! man. did you ever hear of a cannon-ball that killed an emperor?” as to an emperor i cannot say, but a less thing has sufficed to smash a philosopher; and the next great philosopher of europe undoubtedly _was_ murdered. this was spinosa. i know very well the common opinion about him is, that he died in his bed. perhaps he did, but he was murdered, for all that; and this i shall prove by a book published at brussels, in the year <UNK> entitled _la vie de spinosa; par m. jean colerus_, with many additions, from a manuscript life, by one of his friends. spinosa died on the <UNK> february, <UNK> being then little more than forty-four years old. this, of itself, looks suspicious; and m. jean admits, that a certain expression in the manuscript life of him would warrant the conclusion, “que sa mort n’a pas été tout-à-fait naturelle.” living in a damp country, and a sailor’s country, like holland, he may be thought to have indulged a good deal in grog, especially in punch,[b] which was then newly discovered. undoubtedly he might have done so; but the fact is, that he did not. m. jean calls him, “extrêmement sobre en son boire et en son manger.” and though some wild stories were afloat about his using the juice of mandragora (p. <UNK> and opium (p. <UNK> yet neither of these articles appeared in his druggist’s bill. living, therefore, with such sobriety, how was it possible that he should die a natural death at forty-four? hear his biographer’s account: “sunday morning, the <UNK> of february, before it was church time, spinosa came down stairs and conversed with the master and mistress of the house.” at this time, therefore, perhaps ten o’clock on sunday morning, you see that spinosa was alive and pretty well. but it seems “he had summoned from amsterdam a certain physician, whom,” says the biographer, “i shall not otherwise point out to notice than by these two letters, l. m. this l. m. had directed the people of the house to purchase an ancient cock, and to have him boiled forthwith, in order that spinosa might take some broth about noon, which in fact he did, and ate some of the _old cock_ with a good appetite, after the landlord and his wife had returned from church. “in the afternoon l. m. stayed alone with spinosa, the people of the house having returned to church; on coming out from which they learnt, with much surprise, that spinosa had died about three o’clock, in the presence of l. m., who took his departure for amsterdam the same evening, by the night boat, without paying the least attention to the deceased. no doubt he was the readier to dispense with these duties, as he had possessed himself of a ducatoon and a small quantity of silver, together with a silver-hafted knife, and had absconded with his pillage.” here you see, gentlemen, the murder is plain, and the manner of it. it was l. m. who murdered spinosa for his money. poor s. was an invalid, meagre and weak: as no blood was observed, l. m. no doubt threw him down and smothered him with pillows,--the poor man being already half suffocated by his infernal dinner. but who was l. m.? it surely never could be lindley murray; for i saw him at york in <UNK> and besides, i do not think he would do such a thing; at least, not to a brother grammarian: for you know, gentlemen, that spinosa wrote a very respectable hebrew grammar. hobbes, but why, or on what principle, i never could understand, was not murdered. this was a capital oversight of the professional men in the seventeenth century; because in every light he was a fine subject for murder, except, indeed, that he was lean and skinny; for i can prove that he had money, and (what is very funny) he had no right to make the least resistance; for, according to himself, irresistible power creates the very highest species of right, so that it is rebellion of the blackest dye to refuse to be murdered, when a competent force appears to murder you. however, gentlemen, though he was not murdered, i am happy to assure you that (by his own account) he was three times very near being murdered. the first time was in the spring of <UNK> when he pretends to have circulated a little manuscript on the king’s behalf, against the parliament; he never could produce this manuscript, by the by: but he says that, “had not his majesty dissolved the parliament” (in may), “it had brought him into danger of his life.” dissolving the parliament, however, was of no use; for, in november of the same year, the long parliament assembled, and hobbes, a second time, fearing he should be murdered, ran away to france. this looks like the madness of john dennis, who thought that louis xiv. would never make peace with queen anne, unless he were given up to his vengeance; and actually ran away from the sea-coast in that belief. in france, hobbes managed to take care of his throat pretty well for ten years; but at the end of that time, by way of paying court to cromwell, he published his leviathan. the old coward now began to “funk” horribly for the third time; he fancied the swords of the cavaliers were constantly at his throat, recollecting how they had served the parliament ambassadors at the hague and madrid. “tum,” says he, in his dog-latin life of himself,-- “tum venit in mentem mihi dorislaus et ascham; tanquam proscripto terror ubique aderat.” and accordingly he ran home to england. now, certainly, it is very true that a man deserved a cudgelling for writing leviathan; and two or three cudgellings for writing a pentameter ending so villanously as, “terror ubique aderat”! but no man ever thought him worthy of anything beyond cudgelling. and, in fact, the whole story is a bounce of his own. for, in a most abusive letter which he wrote “to a learned person” (meaning wallis the mathematician), he gives quite another account of the matter, and says (p. <UNK> he ran home “because he would not trust his safety with the french clergy”; insinuating that he was likely to be murdered for his religion, which would have been a high joke indeed,--tom’s being brought to the stake for religion. bounce or not bounce, however, certain it is, that hobbes, to the end of his life, feared that somebody would murder him. this is proved by the story i am going to tell you: it is not from a manuscript, but (as mr. coleridge says) it is as good as manuscript; for it comes from a book now entirely forgotten, namely, “the creed of mr. hobbes examined; in a conference between him and a student in divinity” (published about ten years before hobbes’s death). the book is anonymous, but it was written by tennison, the same who, about thirty years after, succeeded tillotson as archbishop of canterbury. the introductory anecdote is as follows: “a certain divine, it seems (no doubt tennison himself), took an annual tour of one month to different parts of the island. in one of these excursions <UNK> he visited the peak in derbyshire, partly in consequence of hobbes’s description of it. being in that neighborhood, he could not but pay a visit to buxton; and at the very moment of his arrival, he was fortunate enough to find a party of gentlemen dismounting at the inn door, amongst whom was a long, thin fellow, who turned out to be no less a person than mr. hobbes, who probably had ridden over from chatsworth. meeting so great a lion, a tourist, in search of the picturesque, could do no less than present himself in the character of bore. and luckily for this scheme, two of mr. hobbes’s companions were suddenly summoned away by express; so that, for the rest of his stay at buxton, he had leviathan entirely to himself, and had the honor of bowsing with him in the evening. hobbes, it seems, at first showed a good deal of stiffness, for he was shy of divines; but this wore off, and he became very sociable and funny, and they agreed to go into the bath together. how tennison could venture to gambol in the same water with leviathan, i cannot explain; but so it was: they frolicked about like two dolphins, though hobbes must have been as old as the hills; and in those intervals wherein they abstained from swimming and plunging themselves” (i. e. diving) “they discoursed of many things relating to the baths of the ancients, and the origine of springs. when they had in this manner passed away an hour, they stepped out of the bath; and, having dried and cloathed themselves, they sate down in expectation of such a supper as the place afforded; designing to refresh themselves like the _deipnosophilæ_, and rather to reason than to drink profoundly. but in this innocent intention they were interrupted by the disturbance arising from a little quarrel, in which some of the ruder people in the house were for a short time engaged. at this mr. hobbes seemed much concerned, though he was at some distance from the persons.” and why was he concerned, gentlemen? no doubt you fancy, from some benign and disinterested love of peace and harmony, worthy of an old man and a philosopher. but listen,--“for a while he was not composed, but related it once or twice as to himself, with a low and careful tone, how sextus roscius was murthered after supper by the balneæ palatinæ. of such general extent is that remark of cicero, in relation to epicurus the atheist, of whom he observed that he of all men dreaded most those things which he contemned,--death and the gods.” merely because it was supper-time, and in the neighborhood of a bath, mr. hobbes must have the fate of sextus roscius. what logic was there in this, unless to a man who was always dreaming of murder? here was leviathan, no longer afraid of the daggers of english cavaliers or french clergy, but “frightened from his propriety” by a row in an alehouse between some honest clodhoppers of derbyshire, whom his own gaunt scarecrow of a person, that belonged to quite another century, would have frightened out of their wits. malebranche, it will give you pleasure to hear, was murdered. the man who murdered him is well known; it was bishop berkeley. the story is familiar, though hitherto not put in a proper light. berkeley, when a young man, went to paris and called on père malebranche. he found him in his cell cooking. cooks have ever been a _genus irritabile_; authors still more so; malebranche was both; a dispute arose; the old father, warm already, became warmer; culinary and metaphysical irritations united to derange his liver: he took to his bed, and died. such is the common version of the story: “so the whole ear of denmark is abused.” the fact is, that the matter was hushed up, out of consideration for berkeley, who (as pope remarked) had “every virtue under heaven”: else it was well known that berkeley, feeling himself nettled by the waspishness of the old frenchman, squared at him; a _turn-up_ was the consequence; malebranche was floored in the first round; the conceit was wholly taken out of him; and he would perhaps have given in; but berkeley’s blood was now up, and he insisted on the old frenchman’s retracting his doctrine of occasional causes. the vanity of the man was too great for this; and he fell a sacrifice to the impetuosity of irish youth, combined with his own absurd obstinacy. leibnitz being every way superior to malebranche, one might, _a fortiori_, have counted on _his_ being murdered; which, however, was not the case. i believe he was nettled at this neglect, and felt himself insulted by the security in which he passed his days. in no other way can i explain his conduct at the latter end of his life, when he chose to grow very avaricious, and to hoard up large sums of gold, which he kept in his own house. this was at vienna, where he died; and letters are still in existence, describing the immeasurable anxiety which he entertained for his throat. still his ambition, for being _attempted_ at least, was so great, that he would not forego the danger. a late english pedagogue, of birmingham manufacture, namely, dr. parr, took a more selfish course, under the same circumstances. he had amassed a considerable quantity of gold and silver plate, which was for some time deposited in his bedroom at his parsonage house, hatton. but growing every day more afraid of being murdered, which he knew that he could not stand, and to which, indeed, he never had the slightest pretension, he transferred the whole to the hatton blacksmith; conceiving, no doubt, that the murder of a blacksmith would fall more lightly on the _salus reipublicæ_ than that of a pedagogue. but i have heard this greatly disputed; and it seems now generally agreed that one good horseshoe is worth about two and one fourth spital sermons. as leibnitz, though not murdered, may be said to have died, partly of the fear that he should be murdered, and partly of vexation that he was not,--kant, on the other hand, who had no ambition in that way, had a narrower escape from a murderer than any man we read of, except des cartes. so absurdly does fortune throw about her favors! the case is told, i think, in an anonymous life of this very great man. for health’s sake, kant imposed upon himself, at one time, a walk of six miles every day along a high-road. this fact becoming known to a man who had his private reasons for committing murder, at the third milestone from konigsberg, he waited for his “intended,” who came up to time as duly as a mail-coach. but for an accident, kant was a dead man. however, on considerations of “morality,” it happened that the murderer preferred a little child, whom he saw playing in the road, to the old transcendentalist: this child he murdered; and thus it happened that kant escaped. such is the german account of the matter; but my opinion is, that the murderer was an amateur, who felt how little would be gained to the cause of good taste by murdering an old, arid, and adust metaphysician; there was no room for display, as the man could not possibly look more like a mummy when dead than he had done alive. * * * * * thus, gentlemen, i have traced the connection between philosophy and our art, until insensibly i find that i have wandered into our own era. this i shall not take any pains to characterize apart from that which preceded it, for, in fact, they have no distinct character. the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, together with so much of the nineteenth as we have yet seen, jointly compose the augustan age of murder. the finest work of the seventeenth century is, unquestionably, the murder of sir edmondbury godfrey, which has my entire approbation. at the same time, it must be observed that the quantity of murder was not great in this century, at least amongst our own artists; which, perhaps, is attributable to the want of enlightened patronage. _sint mæcenates, non deerunt, flacce, marones._ consulting grant’s “observations on the bills of mortality” <UNK> edition, oxford, <UNK> i find that, out of <UNK> who died in london during one period of twenty years, in the seventeenth century, not more than eighty-six were murdered; that is, about four and three tenths per annum. a small number this, gentlemen, to found an academy upon; and certainly, where the quantity is so small, we have a right to expect that the quality should be first-rate. perhaps it was; yet still i am of opinion that the best artist in this century was not equal to the best in that which followed. for instance, however praiseworthy the case of sir edmondbury godfrey may be (and nobody can be more sensible of its merits than i am), still, i cannot consent to place it on a level with that of mrs. ruscombe of bristol, either as to originality of design, or boldness and breadth of style. this good lady’s murder took place early in the reign of george iii., a reign which was notoriously favorable to the arts generally. she lived in college green, with a single maid-servant, neither of them having any pretension to the notice of history but what they derived from the great artist whose workmanship i am recording. one fine morning, when all bristol was alive and in motion, some suspicion arising, the neighbors forced an entrance into the house, and found mrs. ruscombe murdered in her bedroom, and the servant murdered on the stairs: this was at noon; and, not more than two hours before, both mistress and servant had been seen alive. to the best of my remembrance, this was in <UNK> upwards of sixty years, therefore, have now elapsed, and yet the artist is still undiscovered. the suspicions of posterity have settled upon two pretenders,--a baker and a chimney-sweeper. but posterity is wrong; no unpractised artist could have conceived so bold an idea as that of a noonday murder in the heart of a great city. it was no obscure baker, gentlemen, or anonymous chimney-sweeper, be assured, that executed this work. i know who it was. (_here there was a general buzz, which at length broke out into open applause; upon which the lecturer blushed, and went on with much earnestness._) for heaven’s sake, gentlemen, do not mistake me; it was not i that did it. i have not the vanity to think myself equal to any such achievement; be assured that you greatly overrate my poor talents; mrs. ruscombe’s affair was far beyond my slender abilities. but i came to know who the artist was, from a celebrated surgeon, who assisted at his dissection. this gentleman had a private museum in the way of his profession, one corner of which was occupied by a cast from a man of remarkably fine proportions. “that,” said the surgeon, “is a cast from the celebrated lancashire highwayman, who concealed his profession for some time from his neighbors, by drawing woollen stockings over his horse’s legs, and in that way muffling the clatter which he must else have made in riding up a flagged alley that led to his stable. at the time of his execution for highway robbery, i was studying under cruickshank; and the man’s figure was so uncommonly fine, that no money or exertion was spared to get into possession of him with the least possible delay. by the connivance of the under-sheriff, he was cut down within the legal time, and instantly put into a chaise and four; so that, when he reached cruickshank’s he was positively not dead. mr.----, a young student at that time, had the honor of giving him the _coup de grace_, and finishing the sentence of the law.” this remarkable anecdote, which seemed to imply that all the gentlemen in the dissecting-room were amateurs of our class, struck me a good deal; and i was repeating it one day to a lancashire lady, who thereupon informed me that she had herself lived in the neighborhood of that highwayman, and well remembered two circumstances, which combined, in the opinion of all his neighbors, to fix upon him the credit of mrs. ruscombe’s affair. one was, the fact of his absence for a whole fortnight at the period of that murder; the other that, within a very little time after, the neighborhood of this highwayman was deluged with dollars: now mrs. ruscombe was known to have hoarded about two thousand of that coin. be the artist, however, who he might, the affair remains a durable monument of his genius; for such was the impression of awe, and the sense of power left behind, by the strength of conception manifested in this murder, that no tenant (as i was told in <UNK> had been found up to that time for mrs. ruscombe’s house. but, whilst i thus eulogize the ruscombian case, let me not be supposed to overlook the many other specimens of extraordinary merit spread over the face of this century. such cases, indeed, as that of miss bland, or of captain donnellan, and sir theophilus boughton, shall never have any countenance from me. fie on these dealers in poison, say i; can they not keep to the old honest way of cutting throats, without introducing such abominable innovations from italy? i consider all these poisoning cases, compared with the legitimate style, as no better than waxwork by the side of sculpture, or a lithographic print by the side of a fine volpato. but, dismissing these, there remain many excellent works of art in a pure style, such as nobody need be ashamed to own, as every candid connoisseur will admit. _candid_, observe, i say; for great allowances must be made in these cases; no artist can ever be sure of carrying through his own fine preconception. awkward disturbances will arise: people will not submit to have their throats cut quietly; they will run, they will kick, they will bite; and whilst the portrait-painter often has to complain of too much torpor in his subject, the artist in our line is generally embarrassed by too much animation. at the same time, however disagreeable to the artist, this tendency in murder to excite and irritate the subject is certainly one of its advantages to the world in general, which we ought not to overlook, since it favors the development of latent talent. jeremy taylor notices, with admiration, the extraordinary leaps which people will take under the influence of fear. there was a striking instance of this in the recent case of the m‘keands; the boy cleared a height such as he will never clear again to his dying day. talents also of the most brilliant description for thumping, and indeed for all the gymnastic exercises, have sometimes been developed by the panic which accompanies our artists; talents else buried and hid under a bushel to the possessors, as much as to their friends. i remember an interesting illustration of this fact, in a case which i learned in germany. riding one day in the neighborhood of munich, i overtook a distinguished amateur of our society, whose name i shall conceal. this gentleman informed me that, finding himself wearied with the frigid pleasures (so he called them) of mere amateurship, he had quitted england for the continent,--meaning to practise a little professionally. for this purpose he resorted to germany, conceiving the police in that part of europe to be more heavy and drowsy than elsewhere. his _début_, as a practitioner, took place at mannheim; and, knowing me to be a brother amateur, he freely communicated the whole of his maiden adventure. “opposite to my lodging,” said he, “lived a baker: he was somewhat of a miser, and lived quite alone. whether it were his great expanse of chalky face, or what else, i know not, but the fact was, i ‘fancied’ him, and resolved to commence business upon his throat, which, by the way, he always carried bare,--a fashion which is very irritating to my desires. precisely at eight o’clock in the evening, i observed that he regularly shut up his windows. one night i watched him when thus engaged,--bolted in after him,--locked the door,--and, addressing him with great suavity, acquainted him with the nature of my errand; at the same time advising him to make no resistance, which would be mutually unpleasant. so saying, i drew out my tools, and was proceeding to operate. but at this spectacle, the baker, who seemed to have been struck by catalepsy at my first announce, awoke into tremendous agitation. ‘i will _not_ be murdered!’ he shrieked aloud; ‘what for will i lose my precious throat?’ ‘what for?’ said i; ‘if for no other reason, for this,--that you put alum into your bread. but no matter, alum or no alum (for i was resolved to forestall any argument on that point), know that i am a virtuoso in the art of murder, am desirous of improving myself in its details, and am enamored of your vast surface of throat, to which i am determined to be a customer.’ ‘is it so?’ said he, ‘but i’ll find you a customer in another line.’ and so saying, he threw himself into a boxing attitude. the very idea of his boxing struck me as ludicrous. it is true, a london baker had distinguished himself in the ring, and became known to fame under the title of the master of the rolls; but he was young and unspoiled; whereas, this man was a monstrous feather-bed in person, fifty years old, and totally out of condition. spite of all this, however, and contending against me, who am a master in the art, he made so desperate a defence that many times i feared he might turn the tables upon me; and that i, an amateur, might be murdered by a rascally baker. what a situation! minds of sensibility will sympathize with my anxiety. how severe it was, you may understand by this that for the first thirteen rounds the baker had the advantage. round the fourteenth, i received a blow on the right eye, which closed it up; in the end, i believe, this was my salvation; for the anger it roused in me was so great that, in this and every one of the three following rounds, i floored the baker. “round <UNK> the baker came up piping, and manifestly the worse for wear. his geometrical exploits in the four last rounds had done him no good. however, he showed some skill in stopping a message which i was sending to his cadaverous mug: in delivering which, my foot slipped, and i went down. “round <UNK> surveying the baker, i became ashamed of having been so much bothered by a shapeless mass of dough; and i went in fiercely, and administered some severe punishment. a rally took place,--both went down,--baker undermost,--ten to three on amateur. “round <UNK> the baker jumped up with surprising agility: indeed, he managed his pins capitally, and fought wonderfully, considering that he was drenched in perspiration; but the shine was now taken out of him, and his game was the mere effect of panic. it was now clear that he could not last much longer. in the course of this round we tried the weaving system, in which i had greatly the advantage, and hit him repeatedly on the conk. my reason for this was, that his conk was covered with carbuncles; and i thought i should vex him by taking such liberties with his conk, which in fact i did. “the three next rounds, the master of the rolls staggered about like a cow on the ice. seeing how matters stood, in round twenty-fourth i whispered something into his ear, which sent him down like a shot. it was nothing more than my private opinion of the value of his throat at an annuity office. this little confidential whisker affected him greatly; the very perspiration was frozen on his face, and for the next two rounds i had it all my own way. and when i called _time_ for the twenty-seventh round, he lay like a log on the floor.” “after which,” said i to the amateur, “it may be presumed that you accomplished your purpose.” “you are right,” said he, mildly, “i did; and a great satisfaction, you know, it was to my mind, for by this means i killed two birds with one stone”; meaning that he had both thumped the baker and murdered him. now, for the life of me, i could not see _that_; for, on the contrary, to my mind it appeared that he had taken two stones to kill one bird, having been obliged to take the conceit out of him first with his fist, and then with his tools. but no matter for his logic. the moral of his story was good, for it showed what an astonishing stimulus to latent talent is contained in any reasonable prospect of being murdered. a pursy, unwieldy, half-cataleptic baker of mannheim had absolutely fought six-and-twenty rounds with an accomplished english boxer merely upon this inspiration; so greatly was natural genius exalted and sublimed by the genial presence of his murderer. really, gentlemen, when one hears of such things as these, it becomes a duty, perhaps, a little to soften that extreme asperity with which most men speak of murder. to hear people talk, you would suppose that all the disadvantages and inconveniences were on the side of being murdered, and that there were none at all in _not_ being murdered. but considerate men think otherwise. “certainly,” says jeremy taylor, “it is a less temporal evil to fall by the rudeness of a sword than the violence of a fever; and the axe” (to which he might have added the ship-carpenter’s mallet and the crow-bar) “is a much less affliction than a strangury.” very true; the bishop talks like a wise man and an amateur, as he is; and another great philosopher, marcus aurelius, was equally above the vulgar prejudices on this subject. he declares it to be one of “the noblest functions of reason to know whether it is time to walk out of the world or not.” (book iii., collers’s translation.) no sort of knowledge being rarer than this, surely _that_ man must be a most philanthropic character, who undertakes to instruct people in this branch of knowledge gratis, and at no little hazard to himself. all this, however, i throw out only in the way of speculation to future moralists; declaring in the mean time my own private conviction, that very few men commit murder upon philanthropic or patriotic principles, and repeating what i have already said once at least,--that, as to the majority of murderers, they are very incorrect characters. with respect to williams’s murders, the sublimest and most entire in their excellence that ever were committed, i shall not allow myself to speak incidentally. nothing less than an entire lecture, or even an entire course of lectures, would suffice to expound their merits. but one curious fact, connected with his case, i shall mention, because it seems to imply that the blaze of his genius absolutely dazzled the eye of criminal justice. you all remember, i doubt not, that the instruments with which he executed his first great work (the murder of the marrs) were a ship-carpenter’s mallet and a knife. now, the mallet belonged to an old swede, one john peterson, and bore his initials. this instrument williams left behind him, in marr’s house, and it fell into the hands of the magistrates. now, gentlemen, it is a fact that the publication of this circumstance of the initials led immediately to the apprehension of williams, and, if made earlier, would have prevented his second great work, the murder of the williamsons, which took place precisely twelve days after. but the magistrates kept back this fact from the public for the entire twelve days, and until that second work was accomplished. that finished, they published it, apparently feeling that williams had now done enough for his fame, and that his glory was at length placed beyond the reach of accident. as to mr. thurtell’s case, i know not what to say. naturally, i have every disposition to think highly of my predecessor in the chair of this society; and i acknowledge that his lectures were unexceptionable. but, speaking ingenuously, i do really think that his principal performance, as an artist, has been much overrated. i admit that at first i was myself carried away by the general enthusiasm. on the morning when the murder was made known in london, there was the fullest meeting of amateurs that i have ever known since the days of williams; old bedridden connoisseurs, who had got into a peevish way of sneering and complaining “that there was nothing doing,” now hobbled down to our clubroom: such hilarity, such benign expression of general satisfaction, i have rarely witnessed. on every side you saw people shaking hands, congratulating each other, and forming dinner-parties for the evening; and nothing was to be heard but triumphant challenges of, “well! will _this_ do?” “is _this_ the right thing?” “are you satisfied at last?” but, in the midst of this, i remember we all grew silent on hearing the old cynical amateur, l. s----, that _laudator temporis acti_, stumping along with his wooden leg; he entered the room with his usual scowl, and, as he advanced, he continued to growl and stutter the whole way. “not an original idea in the whole piece,--mere plagiarism,--base plagiarism from hints that i threw out! besides, his style is as hard as albert durer, and as coarse as fuseli.” many thought that this was mere jealousy and general waspishness; but i confess that when the first glow of enthusiasm had subsided, i have found most judicious critics to agree that there was something _falsetto_ in the style of thurtell. the fact is, he was a member of our society, which naturally gave a friendly bias to our judgments; and his person was universally familiar to the cockneys, which gave him, with the whole london public, a temporary popularity, that his pretensions are not capable of supporting; for _opinionum commenta delet dies, naturæ judicia confirmat_. there was, however, an unfinished design of thurtell’s for the murder of a man with a pair of dumbbells, which i admired greatly; it was a mere outline, that he never completed; but to my mind it seemed every way superior to his chief work. i remember that there was great regret expressed by some amateurs that this sketch should have been left in an unfinished state: but there i cannot agree with them; for the fragments and first bold outlines of original artists have often a felicity about them which is apt to vanish in the management of the details. the case of the m‘keands i consider far beyond the vaunted performance of thurtell,--indeed, above all praise; and bearing that relation, in fact, to the immortal works of williams which the æneid bears to the iliad. but it is now time that i should say a few words about the principles of murder, not with a view to regulate your practice, but your judgment: as to old women, and the mob of newspaper readers, they are pleased with anything, provided it is bloody enough. but the mind of sensibility requires something more. _first_, then, let us speak of the kind of person who is adapted to the purpose of the murderer; _secondly_, of the place where; _thirdly_, of the time when, and other little circumstances. as to the person, i suppose it is evident that he ought to be a good man; because, if he were not, he might himself, by possibility, be contemplating murder at the very time; and such “diamond-cut-diamond” tussles, though pleasant enough where nothing better is stirring, are really not what a critic can allow himself to call murders. i could mention some people (i name no names) who have been murdered by other people in a dark lane; and so far all seemed correct enough; but, on looking further into the matter, the public have become aware that the murdered party was himself, at the moment, planning to rob his murderer, at the least, and possibly to murder him, if he had been strong enough. whenever that is the case, or may be thought to be the case, farewell to all the genuine effects of the art. for the final purpose of murder, considered as a fine art, is precisely the same as that of tragedy, in aristotle’s account of it, namely, “to cleanse the heart by means of pity and terror.” now, terror there may be, but how can there be any pity for one tiger destroyed by another tiger? it is also evident that the person selected ought not to be a public character. for instance, no judicious artist would have attempted to murder abraham newland. for the case was this: everybody read so much about abraham newland, and so few people ever saw him, that there was a fixed belief that he was an abstract idea. and i remember that once, when i happened to mention that i had dined at a coffee-house in company with abraham newland, everybody looked scornfully at me, as though i had pretended to have played at billiards with prester john, or to have had an affair of honor with the pope. and, by the way, the pope would be a very improper person to murder: for he has such a virtual ubiquity as the father of christendom, and, like the cuckoo, is so often heard but never seen, that i suspect most people regard _him_ also as an abstract idea. where, indeed, a public character is in the habit of giving dinners, “with every delicacy of the season,” the case is very different: every person is satisfied that _he_ is no abstract idea; and, therefore, there can be no impropriety in murdering him; only that his murder will fall into the class of assassinations, which i have not yet treated. _thirdly._ the subject chosen ought to be in good health; for it is absolutely barbarous to murder a sick person, who is usually quite unable to bear it. on this principle, no cockney ought to be chosen who is above twenty-five, for after that age he is sure to be dyspeptic. or at least, if a man will hunt in that warren, he ought to murder a couple at one time; if the cockneys chosen should be tailors, he will of course think it his duty, on the old-established equation, to murder eighteen. and, here, in this attention to the comfort of sick people, you will observe the usual effect of a fine art to soften and refine the feelings. the world in general, gentlemen, are very bloody-minded; and all they want in a murder is a copious effusion of blood; gaudy display in this point is enough for _them_. but the enlightened connoisseur is more refined in his taste; and from our art, as from all the other liberal arts when thoroughly cultivated, the result is, to improve and to humanize the heart; so true is it, that “ingenuas didicisse fideliter artes, emollit mores, nec sinit esse feros.” a philosophic friend, well known for his philanthropy and general benignity, suggests that the subject chosen ought also to have a family of young children wholly dependent on his exertions, by way of deepening the pathos. and, undoubtedly, this is a judicious caution. yet i would not insist too keenly on this condition. severe good taste unquestionably demands it; but still, where the man was otherwise unobjectionable in point of morals and health, i would not look with too curious a jealousy to a restriction which might have the effect of narrowing the artist’s sphere. so much for the person. as to the time, the place, and the tools, i have many things to say, which at present i have no room for. the good sense of the practitioner has usually directed him to night and privacy. yet there have not been wanting cases where this rule was departed from with excellent effect. in respect to time, mrs. ruscombe’s case is a beautiful exception, which i have already noticed; and in respect both to time and place, there is a fine exception in the annals of edinburgh (year <UNK> familiar to every child in edinburgh, but which has unaccountably been defrauded of its due portion of fame amongst english amateurs. the case i mean is that of a porter to one of the banks, who was murdered whilst carrying a bag of money, in broad daylight, on turning out of the high street, one of the most public streets in europe, and the murderer is to this hour undiscovered. “sed fugit interea, fugit irreparabile tempus, singula dum capti circumvectamur amore.” and now, gentlemen, in conclusion, let me again solemnly disclaim all pretensions on my own part to the character of a professional man. i never attempted any murder in my life, except in the year <UNK> upon the body of a tom-cat; and _that_ turned out differently from my intention. my purpose, i own, was downright murder. “semper ego auditor tantum?” said i, “nunquamne reponam?” and i went down stairs in search of tom at one o’clock on a dark night, with the “animus” and no doubt with the fiendish looks of a murderer. but when i found him, he was in the act of plundering the pantry of bread and other things. now this gave a new turn to the affair; for the time being one of general scarcity, when even christians were reduced to the use of potato-bread, rice-bread, and all sorts of things, it was downright treason in a tom-cat to be wasting good wheaten-bread in the way he was doing. it instantly became a patriotic duty to put him to death; and as i raised aloft and shook the glittering steel, i fancied myself rising like brutus, effulgent from a crowd of patriots, and, as i stabbed him, i “called aloud on tully’s name, and bade the father of his country hail!” since then, what wandering thoughts i may have had of attempting the life of an ancient ewe, of a superannuated hen, and such “small deer,” are locked up in the secrets of my own breast; but for the higher departments of the art, i confess myself to be utterly unfit. my ambition does not rise so high. no, gentlemen, in the words of horace,-- “fungar vice cotis, acutum reddere quæ ferrum valet, exsors ipsa secandi.” [illustration: text decoration] [illustration: text decoration] the captain’s story. by rebecca harding davis. i have been asked to tell what i know of the case of joseph c. wylie, whose mysterious disappearance caused so much excitement in cincinnati when it occurred. that was in <UNK> however, before the war; and i had supposed all trace of the affair had been swept from the public mind by the events which followed. indeed, i see no reason for reviving it now, except that it bears more fully than any evidence i have ever heard upon the curious matter called spiritualism, and i have thought (though i am only a plain man, not used to dealing in such whimseys) it offers a key to unlock the riddle. wylie was a river-hand; ran the ohio and lower mississippi as clerk and captain on several stern-wheelers, so came to be known pretty generally along shore. he was with me as second clerk when the thing happened. i was running the jacob strader, one of the largest steamboats on the mississippi. i took little account of the fellow; he was a small, red-headed, weak-eyed man, shambling lazily about, whose legs and arms seemed scarcely to have gristle enough in them to hold them firmly together. the only noteworthy trait about him was that he never touched liquor or a card, but found his amusement, instead, in sitting with some of the deck hands below, telling long pointless yarns. i had to stop it at last. that runs contrary to my notions of discipline. it was in april that he disappeared, like a flea, under my very eyes. the strader lay at the wharf, at cincinnati; it was sunday, about noon; she was to get up steam at seven o’clock next morning. i walked up the levee, and just off the cobble-stones met wylie. he had a drum of figs in his hand which he had just bought from some pedler on the david swan, and was going to take home to his little joe, in cairo, he said, as he walked alongside of me. i met john fordyce, and stopped to get a light of him; wylie went into a shanty fitted up as a shop for the sale of cigars, newspapers, and the like; he wanted a “despatch,” he said. the shop was but a single room, opening, front and back, on the wide (and at that hour on sunday morning), empty wharf; a square, plank-built affair, made to hold the two counters and a stove in the middle. wylie went into it, as i said, but out of it he was never seen to come alive. i stood talking with fordyce for some minutes, then called the clerk, and when he did not answer, went in search of him, but found only the boy who tended the shop, asleep under the counter. wylie was not there, nor on the boat, nor on the wharf. he was nowhere, so far as the sharpest eyes of the cincinnati police could discover. the thing staggered me when i had time to take it home and realize that the man was actually gone; spirited away in broad daylight, before my face. it was absurd, impossible; yet it struck me with a sort of horror that did not belong to midnight murder. they called it murder in the papers; there was a great outcry; but where was the foul play? the boy (a child of ten) had heard or seen nothing; it was impossible that wylie could have been foully dealt with, and no sound or cry reach fordyce or me, half a dozen feet off. it was just as impossible that he could have left the shop, unseen by us on the wide, open levee. that he could have gone voluntarily, nobody hinted. the poor fellow had but few ideas beyond his wife and boy, joe. his trunk on board was found filled with cheap summer clothes for them both, some tinware, a japanned tea-tray, a china mug; trifles which he had gathered up at auctions, and was taking to cairo to make their little home comfortable. he had made an engagement to go out with the first clerk that afternoon; his clean shirt, collar, and shaving apparatus were all laid out in his state-room. but that was the last of him. it only remained to gather up these things and carry them with the news to his wife. i shirked that. i cannot face a woman in trouble. i ordered stein, who had been a sort of crony of his, to do it. stein was the steward, and was leaving the boat. he had a good berth offered to him in st. louis, he said; so that i knew he had time to see wylie’s widow, and break it gently to her. if widow she was. if wylie had died naturally i would have dismissed him from my mind; but the matter rankled there, as i might say, from its very doubt and mystery. about two years afterward, therefore, when warrick brought a little boy on board, as the boat lay at cairo, and told me it was wylie’s son, i found myself going, again and again, to the part of the deck where the child was playing, feeling pained to notice how coarsely dressed it was, and how pinched, even hunger-bitten, the little honest face. “is it going so badly with her?” i asked. warrick nodded, saying aloud, “joe’s shaken with the whooping-cough, captain. he’s the deuce of a boy for sniffing up all the ailments that are going up and down the river.” joe looked up and laughed. “he had better shake them down into the river again, then,” i said. “let him and his mother come aboard for a trip or two. nothing like air off of water for that whoop, the old women say.” i sent warrick to urge the plan on mrs. wylie. i knew it was not the air that was needed so much as good, wholesome food. warrick set apart the best state-room for her, and i dropped in myself to see that it was all in order. in the evening, before we started, warrick brought her aboard and into the cabin where i was. i found that she had some exaggerated notions about one or two good turns i had done her husband, and a trifle which i had sent to her when he was lost; so, after that, i held aloof from her. i hate philandering. i kept an eye, though, to see how she fared,--on the little body in her rusty black gown, shying round with joe in the corners, out of the way of the ladies who went sweeping their long dresses up and down. i soon found, however, that all the men on board who had known wylie, from warrick down, vied with each other in treating her with a sort of patronizing respect; even jake, the black cook, was continually sending up little messes for her and joe. she was but a poor mouse of a woman, who had made a god of that stupid little weak-eyed fellow, and of his boy after he was gone; take her on politics, or even gossip, anything outside of wylie and her child, and there was nothing in her. warrick told me that she had never been outside of cairo before, and the near village of blandville, where she had been a sempstress before her marriage; this journey was like a glimpse of a new world to her. i used to see her sitting in a dark corner on deck until late in the night, her eyes strained over the long stretch of shore as we floated by; and i could understand how the heavy, wooded hills, crouching like sullen beasts along the water’s edge, or the miles and miles of yellow cane-brake lying flat and barren in the desolate, homesick twilight of a winter’s day, might have a different meaning to the lonely woman, and to us, who counted them only as “a run” of so many hours. she was sitting this way one evening on our back trip, when the boat stopped to wood at a place called by the boatmen dead man’s riffle. warrick was near me, watching her. “she wears black,” he said, at last. “now for me,” cutting off a quid of tobacco, “i never believed joe wylie was dead. no, it was a bad bit of work, dead or alive,--bad.” “it is work i would give much to see cleared up, before i die,” i said. warrick and i were walking up and down the hurricane-deck. “would you?” he said, slowly, chewing and glancing up at me,--“would you? there’s a way. but no matter--” stopping short and looking ashamed. i said nothing. i never urge a man to speak, if he has ever so little mind to hold his tongue quiet. but warrick had some notion that troubled him. he walked nearer at each turn to the place where a stout, short young woman was sitting, dressed in brown linsey. there was nothing remarkable about her face, which was heavy and dull, if we except a pair of thick, dead, fishy gray eyes. “do you see that girl?” he jerked out. “many of the men aboard would say that she could tell you anything you want to know; the dead are about her all the time, they say. _i_ don’t say it, captain, mind; i’m not such a fool.” “i should hope not, warrick,” i said, gravely, and began to talk of something else. but somehow the matter stuck in my mind. the next day we stopped for freight at natchez. i went up into the city with one of the passengers. old jimmy a. it was,--anybody on the western waters will know who i mean; for strangers i will only say that a. was one of the most thorough misers i ever knew. he was an extensive stock-broker and speculator in western lands. when his wife lived he had always consulted her, and abode by her advice in his business. i believe he mourned for the old woman sincerely, though when she died he had taken the ribbon away with which the women had bound her chin and put twine instead, to save a penny. a. was my companion, as i said. coming down into the old town a sudden idea struck me. “these lots are cheap, mr. a.,” i said. “buy them and put up good dwellings on them, and your fortune is made. real estate is going up here daily.” the old man seized on the plan eagerly, and held me by the coat while he went about the lots, calculating, muttering, chuckling to himself. “it’s a good notion, very good. this swamp could be drained,--it would bring in eleven per cent, eleven and a half--and a half; i wish i knew what ann would think of it, poor ann! i’ve a great mind to go into it; i have indeed.” it was with difficulty i got the old fellow away and on board in time before the boat put off. it was growing dusk as we stepped off the plank on deck. a. still clung to me, following me up and down, charging me to say nothing of the plan until he had well considered it. as we went up to the outer cabin we met the woman to whom warrick had directed my notice the day before. she was pacing up and down with heavy, masculine steps; she stood still as we came up; her dead gray eyes fell on a. and rested there with a curious absorbing look; which, perhaps, i should not have seen but for warrick’s warning. she remained quite quiet until we had passed and returned; then stooping suddenly to a table before her, wrote on a scrap of paper, and handed it to the old man, walking away after she had done so; every motion lifeless, mechanical, like a clumsy machine of wood set in action. a. had not seen her, i think, until she thrust the paper into his hand; he stared, pulled at his ragged gray beard, and then peered at it through his spectacles. there was a queer, scared little noise in his throat, like the crow of a chicken. “why, captain, look here! this is--is--” holding out the dirty scrap of paper. it was a message from his wife. “do not touch real estate, except to mortgage,” she said. “the drainage of the swamp would eat up four years’ profits.” (“i thought of that,” he interrupted, quickly.) “do not withdraw your money from p. c.” “that is all,” i said. “who is this woman, mr. a.?” “god knows. but no human being alive knew of that p. c. money. _ann did._” his face was colorless and his teeth chattered. we went to the woman. she was apparently stolid, and but half educated; i saw no sign of cunning, even shrewdness, about her. “the message had been given to her,” she said. “how, she did not know.” “from a spirit?” “she could not say that. she supposed so. they called her a writing medium.” afterward she said, “this thing would ruin her,” crying in a feeble, stupid way. she had been an operative in some mill in cincinnati, we were told, and was discharged in consequence of it. the “manifestations” were followed by attacks of something resembling paralysis, which would soon leave her helpless. i left the old man talking to her. warrick came to me that evening. he had heard of the affair. “captain,” he said, “i’m going to try if no tidings can be had from joe wylie. have i your permission?” i nodded, shortly. warrick’s broad face was pale and anxious. i sat for a while looking at the closed door of the little office into which they had gone. then i got up and followed them. the woman (lusk was her name) was there, warrick, and the wife of the carpenter,--a shrewd, sensible woman,--who had been a friend of wylie’s, as most women were. she and the girl sat facing each other at a table on which flared a dirty oil lamp. warrick leaned on the back of a chair with both hands, watching the girl’s face. “she knows what she’s got to do, captain,” vigorously chewing and spitting, but not lifting his eyes. “i told her to consult her familiar spirit, or whatever it is. let’s have him up! let’s know what’s become of joe, good or bad.” i had seen warrick cool and grave when a burning boat was drifting with all aboard right into the rapids; but now he was a coward in every bone of his body; his very voice grew piping and boisterous as the woman turned her square, heavy face toward him, and the gray eyes, which they said saw the dead, fell on his. for the girl, i observed that she had the appearance of extreme nervous dejection; her breath was uncertain and feeble; her lips blue. i touched her and found that the blood had almost ceased to circulate. her temples were hot; hands icy cold; the pupils of the eyes contracted. the look was _fastened into_ warrick. i can describe it in no other way. i shook her, but could not loosen the hold of it. it was as if she drew the life out of his burly big body with her dull eyes. “bring up the spirit of wylie, my woman,” he said, with a loud, uneasy laugh that suddenly died into profound silence. she shook her head; raised her forefinger slowly, pointing into the shadow behind him. “what do you see?” “i see a ship--three-masted--a bark.” (warrick started, nodding his head with a muttered oath.) “the sea is frozen; the ship is wedged between masses of ice; the sky is like a bronze plane above; there is neither sun nor wind.” “on a whaler!” burst in warrick. “i always knew it! i was in just such a scrape, off--go on, go on.” “there are two men on deck. one is heavily built, gray-headed; the other is spare, short, with red hair. there is a blood-mark on his chin.” “wylie! alive!” “alive. his clothes are gray--” “he wore gray the day he left,” said warrick. “but, come to think of it now, he wouldn’t--” “i was wrong. he wears a sailor’s dress.” she got up hastily, putting her hand to her forehead. her face was covered with a cold sweat. “nothing--nothing! i am sick. stop--no more,” she gasped. mrs. pallet, the carpenter’s wife, put her arm about her. “i’ll take her to her room, captain?” looking at me. “there’s no cheating in her, at any rate,” as she led her out. “it’s my belief it’s the devil’s work.” warrick straightened himself and drew a long breath. “do you think it is the devil’s work, sir?” “god knows.” “it is the truth, whether or no. wylie always had a hankering for a sea life. he used to listen to my old whaling yarns twenty times over. and i’ve heard lately, captain, that poor joe was deep in debt when he disappeared. some old matters, before he came aboard the strader. he had a reason for going. but ellen thinks him dead,--thinks him dead,” stroking his whiskers. “would you tell her of this now, eh, captain?” looking up. “yes, i would,” after a pause. “it can do no harm. but gently, warrick, gently.” it did do harm, however gently it was told. the next day wylie’s wife came to me where i stood alone, near the texas. her nose was red from crying, and her eyes angry, which made the rest of her face more hunger-nipped and pale. she touched my sleeve, and then drew off, holding her little boy by the hand. “captain roberts,” she said, in a low, steady voice, “there is a woman on the boat who pretends to have seen my husband alive. if he is alive, he has deserted me. he is dead.” “be calm, madam.” “he is dead. you shall not think ill of joe.” she was silent a moment, holding her throat with one hand. “if he is alive, he has deserted me, and--i’ll tell you, captain roberts, but i never meant to tell any living man. when you brought me and joe on the boat, i hadn’t touched meat for four months. it took all i could make to keep life in the boy, and barely that. i went out scrubbing when sewing failed me. i scrubbed and whitewashed. i didn’t beg. do you think joe would have left me to that? and him alive? he’s dead. there’s some days i’ve went through--if joe had been on the face of the earth he’d have come to me them days. he’s dead; he’s waiting, somewheres--” she held little joe tighter by the hand, looking beyond me--god knows where--into the place where old joe waited for her, i suppose; the somewheres where the poor starved soul hoped to find the comfort and love of her married life again. i hesitated. “would you like to see this woman? i will not say that i credit her assertions, but there is a curious--” she drew herself up, growing pale. “i, sir? no; i only wished that you should do my husband justice. for the woman--no matter. i will not detain you, captain roberts.” and so, scarcely waiting for me to speak to the boy, she drew him away with her. “that cut ellen hard,” warrick said,--“hard. these women would rather a man should die any day than cease to care for them. but it’s true. joe wylie went on a whaler, sir.” the girl lusk went ashore at new albany, and i saw her no more. she became afterward a noted medium, i believe; and old a., by the way, used to consult her in all of his undertakings, or rather his wife, through her. the matter puzzled me. i did _not_ believe the spirits of the dead had anything to do with it; though the woman, before she went off the boat, brought me a message from one who has been gone from me this many a year. i will say no more of this. since she died i have not named her name. i did not believe the words came from her. i did not believe the girl lusk was an impostor. i thought, as every impartial, cool observer must, that there was a something--not charlatanism--in this matter, and i think, in the end, i got the key to it; but of that you must judge. the matter puzzled and troubled me so much that i determined to try an experiment, which, perhaps, was cruel. i took ellen to a medium, without warning her of my intention. warrick told me of her,--“she has never showed herself in public.” he said, “she takes no pay. that makes me trust her. she’s miserably poor, too; a huckster in the cincinnati market.” it was early dawn when i took ellen to her. she occupied a corner of the market as a fruit and vegetable stall, and as we came near was hanging nets of apples and oranges in front of it, i remember. a skinny, sour-visaged, middle-aged woman, dressed in a sluttish gown and calico sun-bonnet. i noticed the same peculiarity in the eye as in the girl lusk: they were opaque, gray, dead. the market-house was nearly empty; a few butchers were arranging their meat at some distance inside, or swallowing their coffee at the eating-stalls by the light of a few candles. this woman’s stall was out on the solitary street, however, and the pleasant morning light shone about it. i made a pretence of buying some fruit. “this is the business for which i brought you ashore,” i said to ellen. it was impossible that the woman could have heard me, yet she turned sharply, eying ellen as she came forward. “it was for no oranges you come. why didn’t ye say what you come for? if there’s any dead belonging to ye, i’ll bring ye word from them. there’s spirits all about me; there’s spirits at yer back, there’s spirits fillin’ the street. what’ll you have, my young man?” to a boy who stopped. “eight and ten cents them is.” ellen drew back. “let us go, let us go,” she said. at that moment a series of soft double-knocks, as if made by two knuckles of a gloved hand, sounded all about us,--under the pavement, on the roof, on the stall. “there’s yer change.--i’ve a message for _you_,” suddenly facing ellen; “there’s a spirit here to speak to you.” “he is dead, then?” catching both hands together as if to support herself. the woman took down a greasy card, on which the alphabet was printed, from a nail where it hung, and ran her pencil lightly along it, as the raps continued in swift, soft succession. she spelled out this message:-- “i think of you here. of you and joe. you will come to me.” “where--how was it done?” i cried. the woman glanced at ellen, who leaned against the edge of the block. “i was murdered; drugged and murdered,” was the answer. “he is dead. there is no chance any more.” that was all she said, with a strange inconsistency, forgetting her anger of the other day. “there is no chance, no chance,” i heard her mutter, as we went back to the boat; “he’s gone now.” the blow was as hard as if it had struck her for the first time. i told warrick the story without comment. “it goes dead against the other,” he exclaimed. “and yet where did either woman get their knowledge of the business we wanted cleared. the blood-mark on the chin, the possibility that the dead man had been drugged and murdered? there’s truth in it, in all the muddle.” i said nothing. but the matter had taken a hold on me which i could not shake off. i determined to look through the absurdity and mystery of this so-called spiritualism until i had discovered the truth which warrick believed lay in it. i could not divest myself, either, of an unaccountable impression that at last we were upon the track of the missing man. i induced mrs. wylie to remain on the boat during its next run, for the boy’s sake, who grew stronger and more rugged every day. there was the making of a man in the little fellow; he had a hearty, straightforward look in his puny face, that made a friend of everybody. for the woman, from the day when the message came to her from her husband, dead, she gave way in mind or body as if some sinew had been snapped which had held her up. i fancied that unconsciously she had been keeping some vague hope alive which was gone now, forever. she crept out now to the hurricane-deck, and sat all day; where her look settled, or her hands fell on her lap, there they rested, immovable. as i knew her better, i discovered why the men held her in such a pitying aspect. she was a simple-hearted, credulous creature, such as everybody feels bound and anxious to take care of when they are left drifting about the world. so we made our way up to the headwaters of the ohio. it was late in october, i remember,--warm, yellow sunshine by day, and cold nights. the fields nipped brown and red in the early frosts. i used to think if anything could take the poor woman’s thoughts off the dead, the cheerful sights and sounds along shore ought to do it. the water was unusually clear, and curdled and bubbled back from the edge of the boat all day, filled with a frothed, green light; the hills on both sides kept rising back and back to the sky beyond, mottled with purple and crimson and blackish greens; we passed thousands of little islands shying out of the current, which were mere beds of feathery moss and golden-rod. then there were pretty, new little villages, and the busy larger towns, and farms, at long intervals; and when these were passed we floated into the deep solitude again. i noticed it the more because we were out of our usual run; the strader plied then between louisville and new orleans. but the woman saw nothing of it, i think. when we reached pittsburg, and had discharged cargo, i determined, with warrick, to make a final test of the matter. f. was then in the city, just back from england, the most successful medium, next to home, who ever left the states. he was willing, “for a consideration,” to hold a private _séance_ and bring us in contact with any of the dead. he was hardly the person to whom one would think st. peter would have lent his keys for ever so short a time; an oily, bloated sensualist, with thick lips, and thicker eyelids half closed over a dull, sleepy eye. he was dressed like an orleans blackleg, gaudy with purple velvet waistcoat and flash jewelry. but if there was any truth in spiritualism, here was its interpreter. i engaged him to come on board on saturday evening; no one was to be present but warrick, ellen, and myself; the boat was empty at the time, with the exception of its regular crew, below. there was but little persuasion needed to induce ellen to consent. “he may bring me another message,” with a light flickering into her eyes. “joe will be glad to find the way.” it is people like ellen who are always sure converts of spiritualism; it seems so natural to them that their dead should come back, that they are blind to any absurd discrepancies in the manner. on saturday morning, on the wharf, i met stein, who had left the boat some two years before, and remembering his old liking for joe, told him what we were about to do. stein was a hard-headed, shrewd little yankee; i was surprised, therefore, to see how discomposed and startled he appeared at the first mention of the affair; he denounced f. as a humbug with a great deal of heat, and tried to persuade and chaff me out of it; but finding he could not, asked leave to come himself to the _séance_. “you’re bitten, captain,” he said. “it will be easy to persuade you that you see ghosts yourself. you had better let me bring a little daylight with me.” i told warrick of my meeting with stein, and he, having nothing else to do, sauntered off in the afternoon to bring him down. i told ellen also, who, to my surprise, reddened and grew pale, when i named him. “he is a man whom i have no reason to like,” she said. “but it does not matter.” in the evening f. came on board, stopping in the outer cabin, where we were soon joined by stein. we waited an hour for warrick, who did not return, and then entered the saloon where ellen was seated. i noticed that stein drew back, muttering, “you did not tell me that woman was here,” and that no greeting passed between them. the _séance_ proceeded according to the usual formula. we sat around a bare table, on which were placed by stein and myself the names of those whom we wished to appear written on scraps of paper rolled up in pellets, and laid in a small heap. ellen wrote none. “he will come,” she said, simply. but few raps were heard. f. delivered the messages by writing, his fat, lumpy hand moving spasmodically over the sheets of paper. from several of the names written on the pellets came communications, vague and meaningless, any one of which might have been exchanged for the other without loss of force. f. glanced shrewdly around from time to time, fixing his strange, introverted gaze oftenest on ellen and little joe, who had crept in and stood looking him boldly in the face. he turned to me. “one whom you desire to appear has not yet come? so far the _séance_ has failed--for you?” he said. i nodded. his face heightened in color as if the blood slowly rose to his head; the veins swelled; drops of sweat oozed out on his neck and forehead; he peered sharply about the room, as if out of the dark shadows he expected visible spirits to rise. “he is coming!” said ellen, with a gasp. stein became ghastly pale at the words, and looked, terrified, over his shoulder, recovering himself with a feeble laugh. the table where we sat was under the chandelier, two of the lamps of which barely sufficed to light that end of the cabin. the remainder stretched, long and narrow and black, to the far upper deck. the medium, looking at stein as if he saw through him into this outer darkness, sat motionless. there was a long silence. then he raised his hand, made a slow beckoning movement into the shadow. ellen and stein turned their pale faces, breathlessly. “they are coming! they are here!” he said. “they tell me all you would know. the man you seek is not dead. he was cheated, deceived, carried off to caraccas that another man might marry his wife.” as his voice rose, stein rose with it, stood facing him with a look of terror and ferocity, like a wild animal whose lair has suddenly been uncovered. sudden light flashed on me. i sprang up; ellen cowered with a cry, but above all sounded f.’s sharp, monotonous sentences. “he is not dead; he has returned! he is--_here_!” as stein, with an oath, pointed into the shadow where warrick appeared, and leaped back as though the ghost of his victim confronted him. it was no ghost. a little, red-headed, weak-eyed fellow had his arms about ellen’s neck, holding her to his breast as if he had the strength of a lion. warrick, the medium, and i exclaimed and swore, choking for words; but he was silent. he only held her as close as if he had indeed come back from the grave to find her, putting back her head, now and then, and looking at her with a wonderful love in his puny, insignificant face. “ellen! ellen!” he said at last; “they told me you were dead,--you and the boy. this my joe!--little joe?” picking up the boy, handling his legs and arms and looking into his face, his own contorted and wet with tears. we men moved off down into the lower cabin, leaving them alone; but i saw joe a long time after, still sitting there with his wife clinging to him, and the boy on his knees, and i could not help it, i went in and held out my hand. “i congratulate you, old fellow! god has been good to you!” but he only looked up with a bewildered smile. “yes, god has been good. this is ellen, captain. and my little son. _my little son._” wylie’s story is soon told. stein had persuaded him to give his creditors the slip and make for california, promising to join him shortly, and that they would speedily make their fortunes. wylie was a man easily led, and consented. he was concealed under a trap-door in the cigar-shop, and escaped while fordyce and i sought the police. stein had intercepted his letters to his wife until such time as he could send him word of her death. in his own plans upon her he was disappointed. i am glad to say that joe brought back enough yellow dust to keep the wolf from the door for many a day. he and his wife are living somewhere in indiana. joe, their son, was a drummer-boy in the thirty-sixth ohio, under captain saunders, and i’ll venture to say no braver heart kept time to his “rat-tat-too” than that which beat under his own little jacket. i consented to write down these facts, as i said, because of their bearing upon the matter of spiritualism. in this case, as in every other of which i have become cognizant, the mediums have only put into shape the thoughts of those who question them. to admit that certain persons can at will become possessed of the secret movements in the mind of another, will solve the whole mystery. in this case of wylie, the mediums, lusk, the woman at cincinnati, and finally f., simply reproduced the surmises or knowledge of warrick, ellen, and stein. it is not agreeable to think that an animal so gross as f. should have power to decipher our inmost thoughts. better that, however, than to believe that those we have lost should hold out their hands to us through such a messenger.

"crusoe recoiling from the foot-print, achilles shouting over against the trojans, ulysses bending the great bow, christian running with his fingers in his ears; these are each culminating moments, and each has been printed on the mind's eye for <UNK> [footnote <UNK> a gossip on romance, from _memories and portraits_, by r.l. stevenson.] the secondary importance of the detailed language in which an incident is narrated, when compared with the total impression made by the naked action contained in the incident, is seen in the case of ballad poetry, where a man may retain a vivid mental picture of the localities, atmosphere, and dramatic moments created by coleridge's _ancient mariner_, or rossetti's _white ship_, and yet be quite incapable of repeating two consecutive lines of the verse. in literature of narration, whether prose or verse, the dramatic worth of the action related must be the first consideration. in earlier days, when much of the current fiction was not written down, but travelled from mouth to mouth, as it does in the orient to-day, this fact must have been realized--that, in the short-story, plot is superior to style. among modern writers, however, there has been a growing tendency to make up for scantiness of plot by high literary workmanship; the result has been in reality not a short-story, but a descriptive sketch or vignette, dealing chiefly with moods and landscapes. so much has this been the case that the writer of a recent _practical treatise on the art of the short-story_ has found it necessary to make the bald statement that "the first requisite of a short-story is that the writer have a story to <UNK> [footnote <UNK> _short-story writing_, by charles raymond barrett.] however lacking the stories which have come down to us from ancient times may be in technique, they invariably narrate action--they have something to tell. if they had not done so, they would not have been interesting to the men who first heard them, and, had they not been interesting, they would not have survived. their paramount worth in this respect of _action_ is proved by the constant borrowings which modern writers have made from them. take one case in illustration. in the twenty-eighth chapter of aristotle's _secretum secretorum_ appears a story in which "a queen of india is said to have treacherously sent to alexander, among other costly presents, the pretended testimonies of friendship, a girl of exquisite beauty, who, having been fed with serpents from her infancy, partook of their nature." it comes to light again, in an altered and expanded form, in the _gesta romanorum_, as the eleventh tale, being entitled _of the poison of sin_. "alexander was a prince of great power, and a disciple of aristotle, who instructed him in every branch of learning. the queen of the north, having heard of his proficiency, nourished her daughter from the cradle upon a certain kind of deadly poison; and when she grew up, she was considered so beautiful, that the sight of her alone affected many to madness. the queen sent her to alexander to espouse. he had no sooner beheld her than he became violently enamoured, and with much eagerness desired to possess her; but aristotle, observing his weakness, said: 'do not touch her, for if you do, you will certainly perish. she has been nurtured upon the most deleterious food, which i will prove to you immediately. here is a malefactor who is already condemned to death. he shall be united to her, and you shall soon see the truth of what i advance.' "accordingly the culprit was brought without delay to the girl; and scarcely had he touched her lips, before his whole frame was impregnated with poison, and he expired. alexander, glad at his escape from such imminent destruction, bestowed all thanks on his instructor, and returned the girl to her mother." after which follows the monkish application of the moral, as long as the entire story: alexander being made to stand for a good christian; the queen of the north for "a superfluity of the things of life, which sometimes destroys the spirit, and generally the body"; the poison maid for luxury and gluttony, "which feed men with delicacies that are poison to the soul"; aristotle for conscience and reason, which reprove and oppose any union which would undo the soul; and the malefactor for the evil man, disobedient unto his god. there have been at least three writers of english fiction who, borrowing this germ-plot from the _gesta romanorum_, have handled it with distinction and originality. nathaniel hawthorne, having changed its period and given it an italian setting, wove about it one of the finest and most imaginative of his short-stories, _rappaccini's daughter_. oliver wendell holmes, with a freshness and vigor all his own, developed out of it his fictional biography of _elsie venner_. and so recent a writer as mr. richard garnett, attracted by the subtle and magic possibilities of the conception, has given us yet another rendering, restoring to the story its classic setting, in _the poison <UNK> thus, within the space of a hundred years, three master-craftsmen have found their inspiration in the slender anecdote which aristotle, in the opulence of his genius, was content to hurry into a few sentences and bury beneath the mass of his material. [footnote <UNK> vide _the twilight of the gods and other tales_, published by john lane, <UNK> ii probably the first stories of mankind were _true stories_, but the true story is rarely good art. it is perhaps for this reason that few true stories of early times have come down to us. mr. cable, in his _strange true stories of louisiana_, explains the difference between the fabricated tale and the incident as it occurs in life. "the relations and experiences of real men and women," he writes, "rarely fall in such symmetrical order as to make an artistic whole. until they have had such treatment as we give stone in the quarry or gems in the rough, they seldom group themselves with that harmony of values and brilliant unity of interest that result when art comes in--not so much to transcend nature as to make nature transcend herself." in other words, it is not until the true story has been converted into fiction by the suppression of whatever is discursive or ungainly, and the addition of a stroke of fantasy, that it becomes integral, balanced in all its parts, and worthy of literary remembrance. in the fragments of fiction which have come down to us from the days when books were not, odd chapters from the fieldings and smollets of the age of noah, remnants of the verbal libraries which men repeated one to the other, squatting round "the savage camp-fire," when the hunt was over and night had gathered, the stroke of fantasy predominates and tends to comprise the whole. men spun their fictions from the materials with which their minds were stored, much as we do to-day, and the result was a cycle of beast-fables--an odyssey of the brute creation. of these the tales of aesop are the best examples. the beast-fable has never quite gone out of fashion, and never will so long as men retain their world-wonder, and childishness of mind. a large part of gulliver's adventures belong to this class of literature. it was only the other day that mr. kipling gave us his _just-so stories_, and his _jungle-book_, each of which found an immediate and secure place in the popular memory. mr. chandler harris, in his introduction to _uncle remus_, warns us that however humorous his book may appear, "its intention is perfectly serious." he goes on to insist on its historic value, as a revelation of primitive modes of thought. at the outset, when he wrote his stories serially for publication in _the atlanta constitution_, he believed that he was narrating plantation legends peculiar to the south. he was quickly undeceived. prof. j.w. powell, who was engaged in an investigation of the mythology of the north american indians, informed him that some of uncle remus's stories appear "in a number of different languages, and in various modified forms among the indians." mr. herbert h. smith had "met with some of these stories among tribes of south american indians, and one in particular he had traced to india, and as far east as siam." "when did the negro or north american indian ever come in contact with the tribes of south america?" mr. harris asks. and he quotes mr. smith's reply in answer to the question: "i am not prepared to form a theory about these stories. there can be no doubt that some of them, found among the negroes and the indians, had a common origin. the most natural solution would be to suppose that they originated in africa, and were carried to south america by the negro slaves. they are certainly found among the red negroes; but, unfortunately for the african theory, it is equally certain that they are told by savage indians of the amazon's valley, away up on the tapajos, red negro, and tapura. these indians hardly ever see a negro.... it is interesting to find a story from upper egypt (that of the fox who pretended to be dead) identical with an amazonian story, and strongly resembling one found by you among the negroes.... one thing is certain. the animal stories told by the negroes in our southern states and in brazil were brought by them from africa. whether they originated there, or with the arabs, or egyptians, or with yet more ancient nations, must still be an open question. whether the indians got them from the negroes or from some earlier source is equally uncertain." whatever be the final solution to this problem, enough has been said to show that the beast-fable is, in all probability, the most primitive form of short-story which we possess. iii for our purpose, that of tracing the evolution of the english short-story, its history commences with the _gesta romanorum_. at the authorship of this collection of mediaeval tales, many guesses have been made. nothing is known with certainty; it seems probable, however, judging from the idioms which occur, that it took its present form in england, about the end of the thirteenth or the beginning of the fourteenth century, and thence passed to the continent. the work is written in latin, and was evidently compiled by a man in holy orders, for its guiding purpose is to edify. in this we can trace the influence of aesop's beast-fables, which were moral lessons drawn from the animal creation for the instruction of mankind. every chapter of the _gesta romanorum_ consists of a moral tale; so much so that in many cases the application of the moral is as long as the tale itself. the title of the collection, _the deeds of the romans_, is scarcely justified; in the main it is a garnering of all the deathless plots and dramatic motives which we find scattered up and down the ages, in the legend and folklore of whatsoever nation. the themes of many of its stories were being told, their characters passing under other names, when romulus and remus were suckled by their wolf-mother, before there was a roman nation or a city named rome. in the bible we have many admirable specimens of the short-story. jotham's parable of the trees of the wood choosing a king is as good an instance of the nature-fable, touched with fine irony and humor, as could be found. the hebrew prophet himself was often a story-teller. thus, when nathan would bring home the nature of his guilt to david, he does it by a story of the most dramatic character, which loses nothing, and indeed gains all its terrific impact, by being strongly impregnated with moral passion. many such instances will occur to the student of the bible. in the absence of a written or printed literature the story-teller had a distinct vocation, as he still has among the peoples of the east. every visitor to tangier has seen in the market-place the professional story-teller, surrounded from morn till night with his groups of attentive listeners, whose kindling eyes, whose faces moved by every emotion of wonder, anger, tenderness, and sympathy, whose murmured applause and absorbed silence, are the witnesses and the reward of his art. through such a scene we recover the atmosphere of the arabian nights, and indeed look back into almost limitless antiquity. possibly, could we follow the story which is thus related, we might discover that this also drew its elemental incidents from sources as old as the times of jotham and nathan. the most that can be said for the latin origin of the _gesta romanorum_ is that the nucleus is made up of extracts, frequently of glaring inaccuracy, from roman writers and historians. the cologne edition comprises one hundred and eighty-one chapters, each consisting of a tale or anecdote followed by a moral application, commencing formally with the words, "my beloved, the prince is intended to represent any good christian," or, "my beloved, the emperor is christ; the soldier is any sinner." they are not so much short-stories as illustrated homilies. in the literary armory of the lazy parish priest of the fourteenth century, the _gesta romanorum_ must have held the place which volumes of sermon-outlines occupy upon the book-shelves of certain of his brethren to-day. "the method of instructing by fables is a practice of remote antiquity; and has always been attended with very considerable benefit. its great popularity encouraged the monks to adopt this medium, not only for the sake of illustrating their discourses, but of making a more durable impression upon the minds of their illiterate auditors. an abstract argument, or logical deduction (had they been capable of supplying it), would operate but faintly upon intellects rendered even more obtuse by the rude nature of their customary employments; while, on the other hand, an apposite story would arouse attention and stimulate that blind and unenquiring devotion which is so remarkably characteristic of the middle <UNK> [footnote <UNK> introduction to _gesta romanorum_, translated by the rev. charles swan, revised and corrected by wynnard hooper, b.a.] iv the influence of the _gesta romanorum_ is most conspicuously to be traced in the work of gower, chaucer, and lydgate; but it has served as a source of inspiration to the flagging ingenuity of each succeeding generation. it would be tedious to enter on an enumeration of the various indebtednesses of english literature to these early tales. a few instances will serve as illustration. it seems a far cry from the _the ingoldsby legends_ to _the deeds of the romans_, nevertheless _the leech of folk-stone_ was directly taken from the hundred and second tale, _of the transgressions and wounds of the soul_. shakespeare himself was a frequent borrower, and planned his entire play of _pericles, prince of tyre_, upon the hundred and fifty-third tale, _of temporal tribulation_. in some cases the language is almost identical, as for instance in the fifth tale, where the king warns his son, saying, "son, i tell thee that thou canst not confide in her, and consequently ought not to espouse her. _she deceived her own father when she liberated thee from prison_; for this did her father lose the price of thy ransom." compare with this: "look to her, moor; have a quick eye to see; _she has deceived her father, and may <UNK> [footnote <UNK> _othello_, act i, scene iii.] but the ethical treatment of the short-story, as exemplified in these monkish fables, handicapped its progress and circumscribed its field of endeavor. morality necessitated the twisting of incidents, so that they might harmonize with the sermonic summing-up that was in view. life is not always moral; it is more often perplexing, boisterous, unjust, and flippant. the wicked dwell in prosperity. "there are no pangs in their death; their strength is firm. they are not in trouble as other men; neither are they plagued as other men. they have more than heart could wish." but the art of the teller of tales "is occupied, and bound to be occupied not so much in making stories true as in making them <UNK> [footnote <UNK> from a humble remonstrance, in _memories and portraits_, by r.l. stevenson.] the ethical method of handling fiction falls between two stools; it not only fails in portraying that which is true for the individual, but it incurs the graver error of ceasing to be true to the race, i.e., typical. it would be interesting, had we space, to follow shakespeare in his borrowings, noticing what he adopts and incorporates in his work as artistically true, and what he rejects. like a water-color landscape-painter, he pauses above the box of crude materials which others have made, takes a dab here and a dab there with his brush, rarely takes all of one color, blends them, eyes the result judicially, and flashes in the combination with swiftness and certainty of touch. for instance, from the lengthy story which appears as the hundred and first tale in mr. douce's edition of the _gesta_, he selects but one scene of action, yet it is the making of _macbeth_--one would almost suppose that this was the germ-thought which kindled his furious fancy, preceding his discovery of the macbeth tradition as related in holinshed's <UNK> [footnote <UNK> _the chronicle of england and scotland_, first published in <UNK> the emperor manelay has set forth to the holy land, leaving his empress and kingdom in his brother's care. no sooner has he gone than the regent commences to make love to his brother's wife. she rejects him scornfully. angered by her indignation, he leads her into a forest and hangs her by the hair upon a tree, leaving her there to starve. as good-fortune will have it, on the third day a noble earl comes by, and, finding her in that condition, releases her, takes her home with him, and makes her governess to his only daughter. a feeling of shame causes her to conceal her noble rank, and so it comes about that the earl's steward aspires to her affection. her steadfast refusal of all his advances turns his love to hatred, so that he plans to bring about her downfall. then comes the passage which shakespeare seized upon as vital: "it befell upon a night that the earl's chamber door was forgotten and left unshut, which the steward had anon perceived; and when they were all asleep he went and espied the light of the lamp where the empress and the young maid lay together, and with that he drew out his knife and cut the throat of the earl's daughter and put the knife into the empress's hand, she being asleep, and nothing knowing thereof, to the intent that when the earl awakened he should think that she had cut his daughter's throat, and so would she be put to a shameful death for his mischievous deed." the laws of immediateness and concentration, which govern the short-story, are common also to the drama; by reason of their brevity both demand a directness of approach which leads up, without break of sequence or any waste of words, through a dependent series of actions to a climax which is final. it will usually be found in studying the borrowings which the masters have made from such sources as the _gesta romanorum_ that the portions which they have discriminated as worth taking from any one tale have been the only artistically essential elements which the narrative contains; the remainder, which they have rejected, is either untrue to art or unnecessary to the plot's development. these tales, as told by their monkish compiler, lack "that harmony of values and brilliant unity of interest that results when art comes in"--they are splendid jewels badly cut. v as has been already stated, a short-story theme, however fine, can only be converted into good art by the suppression of whatever is discursive or ungainly, so that it becomes integral and balanced in all its parts; and by the addition of a stroke of fantasy, so that it becomes vast, despite its brevity, implying a wider horizon than it actually describes; but, in excess of these qualities, there is a last of still greater importance, without which it fails--_the power to create the impression of having been possible_. now the beast-fable, as handled by aesop, falls short of being high art by reason of its overwhelming fantasy, which annihilates all chance of its possibility. the best short-stories represent a struggle between fantasy and fact. and the mediaeval monkish tale fails by reason of the discursiveness and huddling together of incidents, without regard to their dramatic values, which the moral application necessitates. in a word, both are deficient in technique--the concealed art which, when it has combined its materials so that they may accomplish their most impressive effect, causes the total result to command our credulity because it seems typical of human experience. the technique of the english prose short-story had a tardy evolution. that there were any definite laws, such as obtain in poetry, by which it must abide was not generally realized until edgar allan poe formulated them in his criticism of nathaniel hawthorne. as he states them, they are five in number, as follows: firstly, that the short-story must be short, i.e., capable of being read at one sitting, in order that it may gain "the immense force derivable from _totality_." secondly, that the short-story must possess _immediateness_; it should aim at a single or unique effect--"if the very initial sentence tend not to the outbringing of this effect, then it has failed in its first step." thirdly, that the short-story must be subjected to _compression_; "in the whole composition there should not be one word written of which the tendency, direct or indirect, is not to the one pre-established design." fourthly, that it must assume the aspect of _verisimilitude_; "truth is often, and in very great degree, the aim of the tale--some of the finest tales are tales of ratiocination." fifthly, that it must give the impression of _finality_; the story, and the interest in the characters which it introduces, must begin with the opening sentence and end with the last. these laws, and the technique which they formulate, were first discovered and worked out for the short-story in the medium of <UNK> the ballad and narrative poem must be, by reason of their highly artificial form, comparatively short, possessing totality, immediateness, compression, verisimilitude, and finality. the old ballad which commemorates the battle of otterbourne, fought on august <UNK> <UNK> is a fine example of the short-story method. its opening stanza speaks the last word in immediateness of narration: "it felle abowght the lamasse tyde, when husbands wynn ther haye, the dowghtye dowglasse bowynd hym to ryde in england to take a praye." [footnote <UNK> poe himself implies this when he says, in an earlier passage of his essay on hawthorne: "the tale proper" (i.e., short-story), "in my opinion, affords unquestionably the fairest field for the exercise of the loftiest talent which can be afforded by the wide domains of mere prose. were i bidden to say how the highest genius could be most advantageously employed for the best display of its own powers, i should answer, without hesitation, in the composition of a rhymed poem, not to exceed in length what might be perused in an hour. within this limit alone can the highest order of true poetry exist. i need only here say, upon this topic, that in almost all classes of composition the unity of effect or impression is a point of the greatest importance. _it is clear_, moreover, _that this unity cannot be thoroughly preserved in productions whose perusal cannot be completed at one sitting_."] thomas hood's poem of _the dream of eugene aram_, written at a time when the prose short-story, under the guidance of hawthorne and poe, was just beginning to take its place as a separate species of literary art, has never been surpassed for short-story technique by any of the practitioners of prose. prof. brander matthews has pointed out that "there were nine muses in greece of old, and no one of these daughters of apollo was expected to inspire the writer of <UNK> [footnote <UNK> in his introduction to _materials and methods of fiction_, by clayton hamilton, published by the baker & taylor co., new york.] he argues from this that "prose seemed to the greeks, and even to the latins who followed in their footsteps, as fit only for pedestrian purposes." it is more probable that, as regards prose-fiction, they did not realize that they were called upon to explain the omission of the tenth muse. her exclusion was based on no reasoned principle, but was due to a sensuous art-instinct: the greeks felt that the unnatural limitations of the poetic medium were more in keeping with the <UNK> brevity of a story which must be short. the exquisite prose tales which have been handed down to us belong to the age of their decadence as a nation; in their great period their tellers of brief tales unconsciously cast their rendering in the poetic <UNK> in natures of the highest genius the most arduous is instinctively the favorite task. [footnote <UNK> "the short-story is artificial, and to a considerable degree unnatural. it could hardly be otherwise, for it takes out of our complex lives a single person or a single incident and treats that as if it were complete in itself. such isolation is not known to nature."--page <UNK> of _short-story writing_, by charles raymond barrett, published by the baker & taylor co., new york.] [footnote <UNK> for example, the story told by demodocus of _the illicit love of ares for aphrodite, and the revenge which hephaestus planned_--odyssey, bk. viii.] chaucer, by reason of his intimate acquaintance with both the poetry and prose-fiction of boccaccio, had the opportunity to choose between these two mediums of short-story narration; and he chose the former. he was as familiar with boccaccio's poetic method, as exemplified in the _teseide_, as with his prose, as exemplified at much greater length in the _decameron_, for he borrowed from them both. yet in only two instances in the _canterbury tales_ does he relapse into prose. the _teseide_ in chaucer's hands, retaining its poetic medium, is converted into the _knight's tale_; while the _reeve's tale_, the _franklin's_, and the _shipman's_, each borrowed from the prose version of the _decameron_, are given by him a poetic setting. this preference for poetry over prose as a medium for short-story narration cannot have been accidental or unreasoned on his part; nor can it be altogether accounted for by the explanation that "he was by nature a poet," for he _did_ experiment with the prose medium to the extent of using it twice. he had the brilliant and innovating precedent of the _decameron_, and yet, while adopting some of its materials, he abandoned its medium. he was given the opportunity of ante-dating the introduction of technique into the english prose short-story by four hundred and fifty years, and he disregarded it almost cavalierly. how is such wilful neglect to be accounted for? only by his instinctive feeling that the technique, which boccaccio had applied in the _decameron_, belonged by right to the realm of poetry, had been learned in the practising of the poetic art, and could arrive at its highest level of achievement only in that medium. that in chaucer's case this choice was justified cannot be disputed; the inferiority of the short-story technique contained in his two prose efforts, when compared with that displayed in the remainder of the _canterbury tales_, is very marked. take, for instance, the _prioress' tale_ and apply to it the five short-story tests established by poe, as a personal discovery, four and a half centuries later; it survives them all. it attains, in addition, the crowning glory, coveted by stevenson, of appearing _typical_. there may never have been a christian child who was martyred by the jews in the particularly gruesome way described--probably there never was; but, in listening to the prioress, it does not enter into our heads to doubt her word--the picture which she leaves with us of how the christian regarded the jew in the middle ages is too vivid to allow any breathing-space for incredulity. no knowledge of mediaeval anti-jewish legislation, however scholarly, can bring us to realize the fury of race-hatred which then existed more keenly than this story of a little over two thousand words. by its perusal we gain an illuminating insight into that ill-directed religious enthusiasm which led men on frenzied quests for the destruction of the heretic in their own land and of the saracen abroad, causing them to become at one and the same time unjust and heroic. in a word, within the compass of three hundred lines of verse, chaucer contrives to body forth his age--to give us something which is _typical_. the _morte d'arthur_ of malory is again a collection of traditional stories, as is the _gesta romanorum_, and not the creative work of a single intellect. as might be expected, it straggles, and overlays its climax with a too-lavish abundance of incidents; it lacks the _harmony of values_ which results from the introduction of a unifying purpose--_i.e_., of art. imaginative and full of action though the books of the _morte d'arthur_ are, it remained for the latter-day artist to exhaust their individual incidents of their full dramatic possibilities. from the eyes of the majority of modern men the brilliant quality of their magic was concealed, until it had been disciplined and refashioned by the severe technique of the short-story. by the eighteenth century the influence of malory was scarcely felt at all; but his imaginativeness, as interpreted by tennyson, in _the idylls of the king_, and by william morris, in his _defence of guinevere_, has given to the anglo-saxon world a new romantic background for its thoughts. _the idylls of the king_ are not tennyson's most successful interpretation. the finest example of his superior short-story craftsmanship is seen in the triumphant use which he makes of the theme contained in _the book of elaine_, in his poem of _the lady of shalott_. not only has he remodelled and added fantasy to the story, but he has threaded it through with _atmosphere_--an entirely modern attribute, of which more must be said hereafter. so much for our contention that the laws and technique of the prose short-story, as formulated by poe, were first instinctively discovered and worked out in the medium of poetry. vi "_the golden ass_ of apuleius is, so to say, a beginning of modern literature. from this brilliant medley of reality and romance, of wit and pathos, of fantasy and observation, was born that new art, complex in thought, various in expression, which gives a semblance of frigidity to perfection itself. an indefatigable youthfulness is its <UNK> [footnote <UNK> from the introduction, by charles whibley, to the tudor translations' edition by w.e. henley, of _the golden ass of apuleius_, published by david nutt, london, <UNK> all other quotations bearing upon apuleius are taken from the same source.] _an indefatigable youthfulness_ was also the prime distinction of the elizabethan era's writings and doings; it was fitting that such a period should have witnessed the first translation into the english language of this benjamin of a classic literature's old age. apuleius was an unconventional cosmopolitan in that ancient world which he so vividly portrays; he was a barbarian by birth, a greek by education, and wrote his book in the romans' language. in his use of luminous slang for literary purposes he was rudyard kipling's prototype. "he would twist the vulgar words of every-day into quaint unheard-of meanings, nor did he deny shelter to those loafers and footpads of speech which inspire the grammarian with horror. on every page you encounter a proverb, a catchword, a literary allusion, a flagrant redundancy. one quality only was distasteful to him--the commonplace." there are other respects in which we can trace mr. kipling's likeness: in his youthful precocity--he was twenty-five when he wrote his _metamorphoses_; in his daring as an innovator; in his manly stalwartness in dealing with the calamities of life; in his adventurous note of world-wideness and realistic method of handling the improbable and uncanny. like all great artists, he was a skilful borrower from the literary achievements of a bygone age; and so successfully does he borrow that we prefer his copy to the original. the germ-idea of kipling's _finest story in the world_ is to be found in poe's _tale of the ragged mountains_; apuleius's germ-plot, of the man who was changed by enchantment into an ass, and could only recover his human shape by eating rose-leaves, was taken either from lucian or from lucius of patrae. in at least three of his interpolations he remarkably foreshadows the prose short-story method, upon which we are wont to pride ourselves as being a unique discovery of the past eight decades: these are _bellepheron's story; the story of cupid and psyche_, one of the most exquisite both in form and matter in any language or age; and the story of _the deceitful woman and the tub_, which boccaccio made use of in his _decameron_ as the second novel for the seventh day. in the intense and visual quality of the atmosphere with which he pervades his narrative he has no equal among the writers of english prose-fiction until sir walter scott appears. "apuleius has enveloped his world of marvels in a heavy air of witchery and romance. you wander with lucius across the hills and through the dales of thessaly. with all the delight of a fresh curiosity you approach its far-seen towns. you journey at midnight under the stars, listening in terror for the howling of the wolves or the stealthy ambush. at other whiles you sit in the robbers' cave and hear the ancient legends of greece retold. the spring comes on, and 'the little birds chirp and sing their steven melodiously.' secret raids, ravished brides, valiant rescues, the gayest intrigues--these are the diverse matters of this many-colored book." but as a short-story writer he shares the failing of all his english brothers in that art, until james hogg, the ettrick shepherd, penned his tales--namely, that his short-stories do not stand apart, as things total in themselves, but are woven into a larger narrative by whose proportions they are dwarfed, so that their true completeness is disguised. "he cares not how he loiters by the way; he is always ready to beguile his reader with a milesian story--one of those quaint and witty interludes which have travelled the world over and become part, not merely of every literature, but of every life." it is to three of these chance loiterings of this kipling of rome in its decadence that we owe the famous stories alluded to above. to the elizabethan period belong the most masterly translations of which the english language is possessed; and this not by virtue of their accuracy and scholarship, but because, to use doctor johnson's words, the translator "exhibits his author's thoughts in such a dress as the author would have given them had his language been english." that same "indefatigable youthfulness" which converted courtiers into sailors and despatched them into unknown seas to ransack new worlds, urged men of the pen to seek out and to pillage, with an equal ardor of adventure, the intellectual wealth of their contemporaries in other lands and the buried and forgotten stores of the ancients upon their own neighboring book-shelves. a universal and contagious curiosity was abroad. to this age belong william paynter's version of the _decameron_, entitled _the palace of pleasure_, <UNK> from which shakespeare borrowed; geoffrey fenton's translation of bandello's _tragical discourses_, <UNK> sir thomas north's rendering of _plutarch's lives_, <UNK> thomas underdowne's _heliodorus_, <UNK> thomas shelton's _don quixote_, <UNK> and others too numerous to mention. it seems extraordinary at first sight that when such models of advanced technique were set before them, englishmen were so slow to follow; for though professor baldwin is probably correct in his analysis of the _decameron_ when he states that, of the hundred tales, over fifty are not much more than anecdotes, about forty are but outlined plots, three follow the modern short-story method only part way, and, of the hundred, <UNK> alone are perfect examples, yet those two perfect examples remained and were capable of imitation. the explanation of this neglect is, perhaps, that the elizabethans were too busy originating to find time for copying; they were very willing to borrow ideas, but must be allowed to develop them in their own way--usually along dramatic lines for stage purposes, because this was at that time the most financially profitable. [footnote <UNK> the second novel of the second day, and the sixth of the ninth day.] vii the blighting influence of constitutional strife and intestine war which followed in the stuarts' reigns turned the serious artist's thoughts aside to grave and prophetic forms of literary utterance, while writers of the frivolous sort devoted their talent to a lighter and less sincere art than that of the short-story--namely, court-poetry. it was an age of extremes which bred despair and religious fervor in men of the puritan party, as represented by bunyan and milton, and conscious artificiality and mock heroics in those of the cavalier faction, as represented by herrick and the earl of rochester. the examples of semi-fictional prose which can be gathered from this period serve only to illustrate how the short-story instinct, though stifled, was still present. isaak walton as a diarist had it; thomas fuller as an historian had it; john bunyan as an ethical writer had it. each one was possessed of the short-story faculty, but only manifested it, as it were, by accident. not until daniel defoe and the rise of the newspaper do we note any advance in technique. defoe's main contribution was the _short-story essay_, which stands midway between the anecdote, or germ-plot, buried in a mass of extraneous material, and the short-story proper. the growth of this form, as developed by swift, steel, addison, goldsmith, and lamb, has been traced and criticised <UNK> it had this one great advantage that, whatever its departures from the strict technique of the modern short-story, it was capable of being read at one sitting, stood by itself, and gained "the immense force derivable from _totality_." [footnote <UNK> in the third chapter of _the great english essayists_, vol. iii of _the reader's library_, published by messrs. harper & brothers, <UNK> in the _true revelation of the apparition of one mrs. veal_, defoe is again strangely in advance of his time, as he is in so many other ways. here is an almost perfect example of the most modern method of handling a ghost-tale. surely, in whatever department of literature we seek, we shall find nothing to surpass it in the quality of _verisimilitude_. the way in which drelincourt's _book on death_ is introduced and subsequently twice referred to is a master-stroke of genius. in days gone by, before they were parted, we are told, mrs. veal and mrs. bargrave "would often console each other's adverse fortunes, and read together drelincourt _on death_ and other good books." at the time when the story opens mrs. bargrave has gone to live in canterbury, and mrs. veal is in dover. to mrs. bargrave in canterbury the apparition appears, though she does not know that it is an apparition, for there is nothing to denote that it is not her old friend still alive. one of the first things the apparition does is "to remind mrs. bargrave of the many friendly offices she did her in former days, and much of the conversation they had with each other in the times of their adversity; what books they read, and what comfort in particular they received from drelincourt's _book on death_. drelincourt, she said, had the clearest notions of death and of the future state of any who had handled that subject. then she asked mrs. bargrave whether she had drelincourt. she said, 'yes,' says mrs. veal, 'fetch it.' some days after, when mrs. bargrave, having discovered that the visitor was a ghost, has gone about telling her neighbors, defoe observes, 'drelincourt's _book on death_ is, since this happened, bought up strangely,'" this masterpiece of defoe is before its time by a hundred years; nothing can be found in the realm of the english prose short-story to approach it in symmetry until the ettrick shepherd commenced to write. of all the models of prose-fiction which the tudor translations had given to english literature, the first to be copied was that of cervantes's _don quixote_, rendered into english by thomas shelton in <UNK> swift must have had the rambling method of cervantes well in mind when he wrote his _gulliver_; and smollett confessedly took it as his pattern and set out to imitate. the most that was required by such a method in the way of initial construction was to select a hero, give some account of his early history, from the day of his birth up to the point where the true narrative commences, and then send him upon his travels. usually it was thought necessary to have a sancho to act as background to don quixote; thus crusoe is given his man friday, tom jones his mr. partridge, and roderick random his strap; but this was not always done, for both gulliver and the hero of the _sentimental journey_ set out on their journeyings unaccompanied. the story which grew out of such a method usually consisted of a series of plots, anecdotes, and incidents linked together only by the characters, and governed by no unifying purpose which made each one a necessary and ascending step toward a prearranged climax. these early novels are often books of descriptive travel rather than novels in the modern sense; the sole connection between their first incident and their last being the long road which lies between them, and has been traversed in the continual company of the same leading characters. many of the chapters, taken apart from their context, are short-story themes badly handled. some of them are mere interpolations introduced on the flimsiest of excuses, which arrest the progress of the main narrative--_i.e_., the travel--and give the author an opportunity to use up some spare material which he does not know what to do with. such are "the man of the hill," in _tom jones_; "the history of melopoyn the playwright" in _roderick random_; the "memoirs of a lady of quality," occupying fifty-three thousand words, in _peregrine pickle_; "the philosophic vagabond," in the _vicar of wakefield_; and "wandering willie's tale," in _redgauntlet_. the reason why the eighteenth-century novelist did not know what to do with these materials was, in certain cases, that he had discovered a true short-story theme and was perplexed by it. he knew that it was good--his artist's instinct made him aware of that; but somehow, to his great bewilderment and annoyance, it refused to be expanded. so, in order that it might not be entirely lost to him, he tied the little boat on behind the great schooner of his main narration, and set them afloat together. by the modern reader, whether of the short-story or the novel, the lack of atmosphere and of immediateness in eighteenth-century prose-fiction is particularly felt. there is no use made of landscapes, moods, and the phenomena of nature; the story happens at almost any season of the year. of these things and their use the modern short-story writer is meticulously careful. by how much would the worth of hardy's _the three strangers_ be diminished if the description of the march rain driving across the wessex moorland were left out? before he commences the story contained in _a lodging for the night_, stevenson occupies three hundred words in painting the picture of paris under snow. in the same way, in his story of _the man who would be king_, kipling is at great pains to make us burn with the scorching heat which, in the popular mind, is associated with india. for such effects you will search the prose-fiction of the eighteenth century in vain; whereas the use of _atmosphere_ has been carried to such extremes to-day by certain writers that the short-story in their hands is in danger of becoming all atmosphere and no story. the impression created by the old technique, such as it was, when contrasted with the new, when legitimately handled, is the difference between reading a play and seeing it staged. as regards immediateness of narration, laurence sterne may, perhaps, be pointed out as an example. but he is not immediate in the true sense; he is abrupt, and this too frequently for his own sly purposes--which have nothing to do with either technique or the short-story. most of the english short-stories, previous to those written by james hogg, are either prefaced with a biography of their main characters or else the biography is made to do service as though it were a plot--nothing is left to the imagination. even in the next century, when the short-story had come to be recognized in america, through the example set by hawthorne and poe, as a distinct species of literary art, the productions of british writers were too often nothing more than compressed novels. in fact, it is true to say that there is more of short-story technique in the short-story essays of goldsmith and lamb than can be found in many of the brief tales of dickens and anthony trollope, which in their day passed muster unchallenged as short-stories. viii but between the irrelevant brief story, interpolated in a larger narrative, and the perfect short-story, which could not be expanded and is total in itself, of hawthorne and poe, there stands the work of a man who is little known in america, and by no means popular in england, that of the ettrick shepherd, james hogg. he was born in scotland, among the mountains of ettrick and yarrow, the son of a shepherd. when he was but six years old he commenced to earn his living as a cowherd, and by his seventh year had received all the schooling which he was destined to have--two separate periods of three months. matthew arnold, when accounting for the sterility of gray as a poet, says that throughout the first nine decades of the eighteenth century, until the french revolution roused men to generosity, "a spiritual east wind was blowing." hogg's early ignorance of letters had at least this advantage, that it saved him from the blighting intellectual influences of his age--left him unsophisticated, free to find in all things matter for wonder, and to work out his mental processes unprejudiced by a restraining knowledge of other men's past achievements. in his eighteenth year he taught himself to read, choosing as his text-books henry the minstrel's _life and adventures of sir william wallace_ and the _gentle shepherd_ of allan ramsay. not until his twenty-sixth year did he acquire the art of penmanship, which he learned "upon the hillside by copying the italian alphabet, using his knee as his desk, and having the ink-bottle suspended from his button." during the next fourteen years he followed his shepherd's calling, making it romantic with sundry more or less successful attempts at authorship. he had reached his fortieth year before he abandoned sheep-raising and journeyed to edinburgh, there definitely to adopt the literary career. he was by this time firm in his philosophy of life and established in his modes of thought; whatever else he might not be, among townsmen and persons of artificial training, his very simplicity was sure to make him original. in his forty-seventh year, having so far cast his most important work into the poetic form, he contributed to _blackwood's magazine_ his _shepherd's calendar_, followed in the same year by the publishing of _the brownie of bodsbeck_; these were his first two serious excursions into the realm of prose-fiction. from then on until his death, in <UNK> he continued his efforts in this direction, pouring out a mass of country-side tradition and fairy-folklore, amazing in its fantasy and wealth of drama. for the imparting of _atmosphere_ to his stories, a talent so conspicuously lacking not only in his predecessors, but also in many of his contemporaries, he had a native faculty. the author of _bonny kilmeny_ could scarcely fail in this respect, when he turned his attention from poetry to prose. he had lived too close to nature to be able ever to keep the green and silver of woods and rivers far from his thoughts; they were the mirrors in which his fancy saw itself. professor wilson, who had known him as a friend, writing of him in _blackwood's_ after his death, says: "living for years in solitude, he unconsciously formed friendships with the springs, the brooks, the caves, the hills, and with all the more fleeting and faithless pageantry of the sky, that to him came in place of those human affections from whose indulgence he was debarred by the necessities that kept him aloof from the cottage fire and up among the mists of the mountain-top. the still green beauty of the pastoral hills and vales where he passed his youth inspired him with ever-brooding visions of fairyland, till, as he lay musing in his lonely shieling, the world of fantasy seemed, in the clear depths of his imagination, a lovelier reflection of that of nature, like the hills and heavens more softly shining in the water of his native lake." his taste is often defective, as is that of burns on occasions. this is a fault which might be expected in a man of his training; but the vigor and essential worth of the matters which he relates are beyond all question. he did not always know where to begin his short-story, or where to terminate. some of his tales, if edited with blue-pencil erasures, would be found to contain a nucleus-technique which, though far from perfect, is more than equal to that of washington irving, who, like apuleius, "cared not how he loitered by the way," and very superior to that of most of his immediate successors in the art. his story here included, of _the mysterious <UNK> could scarcely be bettered in its method. to tell it in fewer words would be to obscure it; to tell it at greater length would be to rob it of its mystery and to make it obvious. moreover, by employing atmosphere he tells it in such a way as to leave the reader with the impression that this occurrence, for all its magic, might not only be possible, but even probable--which achievement is the greatest triumph of the short-story writer's art. [footnote <UNK> compare with kipling's treatment of a similar theme in _the brushwood boy_.] as this history of the evolution of the english short-story commenced with a poet, <UNK> who wrote all save two of his short-stories in poetry, so it fittingly closes with a poet, the ettrick shepherd, who wrote most of his short-stories in prose. it remained for yet another poet, edgar allan poe, who may never have heard the name or have read a line from the writings of james hogg, to bring to perfection the task on which he had spent his labor. [footnote <UNK> the _gesta romanorum_ was written in latin.] the apparition of mrs. veal _daniel defoe_ <UNK> this thing is so rare in all its circumstances, and on so good authority, that my reading and conversation have not given me anything like it. it is fit to gratify the most ingenious and serious inquirer. mrs. bargrave is the person to whom mrs. veal appeared after her death; she is my intimate friend, and i can avouch for her reputation for these fifteen or sixteen years, on my own knowledge; and i can confirm the good character she had from her youth to the time of my acquaintance. though, since this relation, she is calumniated by some people that are friends to the brother of mrs. veal who appeared, who think the relation of this appearance to be a reflection, and endeavor what they can to blast mrs. bargrave's reputation and to laugh the story out of countenance. but by the circumstances thereof, and the cheerful disposition of mrs. bargrave, notwithstanding the ill usage of a very wicked husband, there is not yet the least sign of dejection in her face; nor did i ever hear her let fall a desponding or murmuring expression; nay, not when actually under her husband's barbarity, which i have been a witness to, and several other persons of undoubted reputation. now you must know mrs. veal was a maiden gentlewoman of about thirty years of age, and for some years past had been troubled with fits, which were perceived coming on her by her going off from her discourse very abruptly to some impertinence. she was maintained by an only brother, and kept his house in dover. she was a very pious woman, and her brother a very sober man to all appearance; but now he does all he can to null and quash the story. mrs. veal was intimately acquainted with mrs. bargrave from her childhood. mrs. veal's circumstances were then mean; her father did not take care of his children as he ought, so that they were exposed to hardships. and mrs. bargrave in those days had as unkind a father, though she wanted neither for food nor clothing; while mrs. veal wanted for both, insomuch that she would often say, "mrs. bargrave, you are not only the best, but the only friend i have in the world; and no circumstance of life shall ever dissolve my friendship." they would often condole each other's adverse fortunes, and read together _drelincourt upon death_, and other good books; and so, like two christian friends, they comforted each other under their sorrow. some time after, mr. veal's friends got him a place in the custom-house at dover, which occasioned mrs. veal, by little and little, to fall off from her intimacy with mrs. bargrave, though there was never any such thing as a quarrel; but an indifferency came on by degrees, till at last mrs. bargrave had not seen her in two years and a half, though above a twelvemonth of the time mrs. bargrave hath been absent from dover, and this last half-year has been in canterbury about two months of the time, dwelling in a house of her own. in this house, on the eighth of september, one thousand seven hundred and five, she was sitting alone in the forenoon, thinking over her unfortunate life, and arguing herself into a due resignation to providence, though her condition seemed hard: "and," said she, "i have been provided for hitherto, and doubt not but i shall be still, and am well satisfied that my afflictions shall end when it is most fit for me." and then took up her sewing work, which she had no sooner done but she hears a knocking at the door; she went to see who was there, and this proved to be mrs. veal, her old friend, who was in a riding-habit. at that moment of time the clock struck twelve at noon. "madam," says mrs. bargrave, "i am surprised to see you, you have been so long a stranger"; but told her she was glad to see her, and offered to salute her, which mrs. veal complied with, till their lips almost touched, and then mrs. veal drew her hand across her own eyes, and said, "i am not very well," and so waived it. she told mrs. bargrave she was going a journey, and had a great mind to see her first. "but," says mrs. bargrave, "how can you take a journey alone? i am amazed at it, because i know you have a fond brother." "oh," says mrs. veal, "i gave my brother the slip, and came away, because i had so great a desire to see you before i took my journey." so mrs. bargrave went in with her into another room within the first, and mrs. veal sat her down in an elbow-chair, in which mrs. bargrave was sitting when she heard mrs. veal knock. "then," says mrs. veal, "my dear friend, i am come to renew our old friendship again, and beg your pardon for my breach of it; and if you can forgive me, you are the best of women." "oh," says mrs. bargrave, "do not mention such a thing; i have not had an uneasy thought about it." "what did you think of me?" says mrs. veal. says mrs. bargrave, "i thought you were like the rest of the world, and that prosperity had made you forget yourself and me." then mrs. veal reminded mrs. bargrave of the many friendly offices she did her in former days, and much of the conversation they had with each other in the times of their adversity; what books they read, and what comfort in particular they received from drelincourt's _book of death_, which was the best, she said, on the subject ever wrote. she also mentioned doctor sherlock, and two dutch books, which were translated, wrote upon death, and several others. but drelincourt, she said, had the clearest notions of death and of the future state of any who had handled that subject. then she asked mrs. bargrave whether she had drelincourt. she said, "yes." says mrs. veal, "fetch it." and so mrs. bargrave goes up-stairs and brings it down. says mrs. veal, "dear mrs. bargrave, if the eyes of our faith were as open as the eyes of our body, we should see numbers of angels about us for our guard. the notions we have of heaven now are nothing like what it is, as drelincourt says; therefore be comforted under your afflictions, and believe that the almighty has a particular regard to you, and that your afflictions are marks of god's favor; and when they have done the business they are sent for, they shall be removed from you. and believe me, my dear friend, believe what i say to you, one minute of future happiness will infinitely reward you for all your sufferings. for i can never believe" (and claps her hand upon her knee with great earnestness, which, indeed, ran through most of her discourse) "that ever god will suffer you to spend all your days in this afflicted state. but be assured that your afflictions shall leave you, or you them, in a short time." she spake in that pathetical and heavenly manner that mrs. bargrave wept several times, she was so deeply affected with it. then mrs. veal mentioned doctor kendrick's _ascetic_, at the end of which he gives an account of the lives of the primitive christians. their pattern she recommended to our imitation, and said, "their conversation was not like this of our age. for now," says she, "there is nothing but vain, frothy discourse, which is far different from theirs. theirs was to edification, and to build one another up in faith, so that they were not as we are, nor are we as they were. but," said she, "we ought to do as they did; there was a hearty friendship among them; but where is it now to be found?" says mrs. bargrave, "it is hard indeed to find a true friend in these days." says mrs. veal, "mr. norris has a fine copy of verses, called _friendship in perfection_, which i wonderfully admire. have you seen the book?" says mrs. veal. "no," says mrs. bargrave, "but i have the verses of my own writing out." "have you?" says mrs. veal; "then fetch them"; which she did from above stairs, and offered them to mrs. veal to read, who refused, and waived the thing, saying, "holding down her head would make it ache"; and then desiring mrs. bargrave to read them to her, which she did. as they were admiring _friendship_, mrs. veal said, "dear mrs. bargrave, i shall love you forever." in these verses there is twice used the word "elysian." "ah!" says mrs. veal, "these poets have such names for heaven." she would often draw her hand across her own eyes, and say, "mrs. bargrave, do not you think i am mightily impaired by my fits?" "no," says mrs. bargrave; "i think you look as well as ever i knew you." after this discourse, which the apparition put in much finer words than mrs. bargrave said she could pretend to, and as much more than she can remember--for it cannot be thought that an hour and three quarters' conversation could all be retained, though the main of it she thinks she does--she said to mrs. bargrave she would have her write a letter to her brother, and tell him she would have him give rings to such and such; and that there was a purse of gold in her cabinet, and that she would have two broad pieces given to her cousin watson. talking at this rate, mrs. bargrave thought that a fit was coming upon her, and so placed herself on a chair just before her knees, to keep her from falling to the ground, if her fits should occasion it; for the elbow-chair, she thought, would keep her from falling on either side. and to divert mrs. veal, as she thought, took hold of her gown-sleeve several times, and commended it. mrs. veal told her it was a scoured silk, and newly made up. but, for all this, mrs. veal persisted in her request, and told mrs. bargrave she must not deny her. and she would have her tell her brother all their conversation when she had the opportunity. "dear mrs. veal," says mrs. bargrave, "this seems so impertinent that i cannot tell how to comply with it; and what a mortifying story will our conversation be to a young gentleman. why," says mrs. bargrave, "it is much better, methinks, to do it yourself." "no," says mrs. veal; "though it seems impertinent to you now, you will see more reasons for it hereafter." mrs. bargrave, then, to satisfy her importunity, was going to fetch a pen and ink, but mrs. veal said, "let it alone now, but do it when i am gone; but you must be sure to do it"; which was one of the last things she enjoined her at parting, and so she promised her. then mrs. veal asked for mrs. bargrave's daughter. she said she was not at home. "but if you have a mind to see her," says mrs. bargrave, "i'll send for her." "do," says mrs. veal; on which she left her, and went to a neighbor's to see her; and by the time mrs. bargrave was returning, mrs. veal was got without the door in the street, in the face of the beast-market, on a saturday (which is market-day), and stood ready to part as soon as mrs. bargrave came to her. she asked her why she was in such haste. she said she must be going, though perhaps she might not go her journey till monday; and told mrs. bargrave she hoped she should see her again at her cousin watson's before she went whither she was going. then she said she would take her leave of her, and walked from mrs. bargrave, in her view, till a turning interrupted the sight of her, which was three-quarters after one in the afternoon. mrs. veal died the seventh of september, at twelve o'clock at noon, of her fits, and had not above four hours' senses before her death, in which time she received the sacrament. the next day after mrs. veal's appearance, being sunday, mrs. bargrave was mightily indisposed with a cold and sore throat, that she could not go out that day; but on monday morning she sends a person to captain watson's to know if mrs. veal was there. they wondered at mrs. bargrave's inquiry, and sent her word she was not there, nor was expected. at this answer, mrs. bargrave told the maid she had certainly mistook the name or made some blunder. and though she was ill, she put on her hood and went herself to captain watson's, though she knew none of the family, to see if mrs. veal was there or not. they said they wondered at her asking, for that she had not been in town; they were sure, if she had, she would have been there. says mrs. bargrave, "i am sure she was with me on saturday almost two hours." they said it was impossible, for they must have seen her if she had. in comes captain watson, while they were in dispute, and said that mrs. veal was certainly dead, and the escutcheons were making. this strangely surprised mrs. bargrave, when she sent to the person immediately who had the care of them, and found it true. then she related the whole story to captain watson's family; and what gown she had on, and how striped; and that mrs. veal told her that it was scoured. then mrs. watson cried out, "you have seen her indeed, for none knew but mrs. veal and myself that the gown was scoured." and mrs. watson owned that she described the gown exactly; "for," said she, "i helped her to make it up." this mrs. watson blazed all about the town, and avouched the demonstration of truth of mrs. bargrave's seeing mrs. veal's apparition. and captain watson carried two gentlemen immediately to mrs. bargrave's house to hear the relation from her own mouth. and when it spread so fast that gentlemen and persons of quality, the judicious and sceptical part of the world, flocked in upon her, it at last became such a task that she was forced to go out of the way; for they were in general extremely satisfied of the truth of the thing, and plainly saw that mrs. bargrave was no hypochondriac, for she always appears with such a cheerful air and pleasing mien that she has gained the favor and esteem of all the gentry, and it is thought a great favor if they can but get the relation from her own mouth. i should have told you before that mrs. veal told mrs. bargrave that her sister and brother-in-law were just come down from london to see her. says mrs. bargrave, "how came you to order matters so strangely?" "it could not be helped," said mrs. veal. and her brother and sister did come to see her, and entered the town of dover just as mrs. veal was expiring. mrs. bargrave asked her whether she would drink some tea. says mrs. veal, "i do not care if i do; but i'll warrant you this mad fellow"--meaning mrs. bargrave's husband--"has broke all your trinkets." "but," says mrs. bargrave, "i'll get something to drink in for all that"; but mrs. veal waived it, and said, "it is no matter; let it alone"; and so it passed. all the time i sat with mrs. bargrave, which was some hours, she recollected fresh sayings of mrs. veal. and one material thing more she told mrs. bargrave, that old mr. bretton allowed mrs. veal ten pounds a year, which was a secret, and unknown to mrs. bargrave till mrs. veal told her. mrs. bargrave never varies in her story, which puzzles those who doubt of the truth, or are unwilling to believe it. a servant in the neighbor's yard adjoining to mrs. bargrave's house heard her talking to somebody an hour of the time mrs. veal was with her. mrs. bargrave went out to her next neighbor's the very moment she parted with mrs. veal, and told her what ravishing conversation she had had with an old friend, and told the whole of it. drelincourt's _book of death_ is, since this happened, bought up strangely. and it is to be observed that, notwithstanding all the trouble and fatigue mrs. bargrave has undergone upon this account, she never took the value of a farthing, nor suffered her daughter to take anything of anybody, and therefore can have no interest in telling the story. but mr. veal does what he can to stifle the matter, and said he would see mrs. bargrave; but yet it is certain matter of fact that he has been at captain watson's since the death of his sister, and yet never went near mrs. bargrave; and some of his friends report her to be a liar, and that she knew of mr. bretton's ten pounds a year. but the person who pretends to say so has the reputation to be a notorious liar among persons whom i know to be of undoubted credit. now, mr. veal is more of a gentleman than to say she lies, but says a bad husband has crazed her; but she needs only present herself, and it will effectually confute that pretence. mr. veal says he asked his sister on her death-bed whether she had a mind to dispose of anything. and she said no. now the things which mrs. veal's apparition would have disposed of were so trifling, and nothing of justice aimed at in the disposal, that the design of it appears to me to be only in order to make mrs. bargrave satisfy the world of the reality thereof as to what she had seen and heard, and to secure her reputation among the reasonable and understanding part of mankind. and then, again, mr. veal owns that there was a purse of gold; but it was not found in her cabinet, but in a comb-box. this looks improbable; for that mrs. watson owned that mrs. veal was so very careful of the key of her cabinet that she would trust nobody with it; and if so, no doubt she would not trust her gold out of it. and mrs. veal's often drawing her hands over her eyes, and asking mrs. bargrave whether her fits had not impaired her, looks to me as if she did it on purpose to remind mrs. bargrave of her fits, to prepare her not to think it strange that she should put her upon writing to her brother, to dispose of rings and gold, which look so much like a dying person's request; and it took accordingly with mrs. bargrave as the effect of her fits coming upon her, and was one of the many instances of her wonderful love to her and care of her, that she should not be affrighted, which, indeed, appears in her whole management, particularly in her coming to her in the daytime, waiving the salutation, and when she was alone; and then the manner of her parting, to prevent a second attempt to salute her. now, why mr. veal should think this relation a reflection--as it is plain he does, by his endeavoring to stifle it--i cannot imagine; because the generality believe her to be a good spirit, her discourse was so heavenly. her two great errands were, to comfort mrs. bargrave in her affliction, and to ask her forgiveness for her breach of friendship, and with a pious discourse to encourage her. so that, after all, to suppose that mrs. bargrave could hatch such an invention as this, from friday noon to saturday noon--supposing that she knew of mrs. veal's death the very first moment--without jumbling circumstances, and without any interest, too, she must be more witty, fortunate, and wicked, too, than any indifferent person, i dare say, will allow. i asked mrs. bargrave several times if she was sure she felt the gown. she answered, modestly, "if my senses be to be relied on, i am sure of it." i asked her if she heard a sound when she clapped her hand upon her knee. she said she did not remember she did, but said she appeared to be as much a substance as i did who talked with her. "and i may," said she, "be as soon persuaded that your apparition is talking to me now as that i did not really see her; for i was under no manner of fear, and received her as a friend, and parted with her as such. i would not," says she, "give one farthing to make any one believe it; i have no interest in it; nothing but trouble is entailed upon me for a long time, for aught i know; and, had it not come to light by accident, it would never have been made public." but now she says she will make her own private use of it, and keep herself out of the way as much as she can; and so she has done since. she says she had a gentleman who came thirty miles to her to hear the relation; and that she had told it to a roomful of people at the time. several particular gentlemen have had the story from mrs. bargrave's own mouth. this thing has very much affected me, and i am as well satisfied as i am of the best-grounded matter of fact. and why we should dispute matter of fact, because we cannot solve things of which we can have no certain or demonstrative notions, seems strange to me; mrs. bargrave's authority and sincerity alone would have been undoubted in any other case. the mysterious <UNK> [footnote <UNK> from _tales and sketches_, by the ettrick shepherd.] _james hogg_ <UNK> a great number of people nowadays are beginning broadly to insinuate that there are no such things as ghosts, or spiritual beings visible to mortal sight. even sir walter scott is turned renegade, and, with his stories made up of half-and-half, like nathaniel gow's toddy, is trying to throw cold water on the most certain, though most impalpable, phenomena of human nature. the bodies are daft. heaven mend their wits! before they had ventured to assert such things, i wish they had been where i have often been; or, in particular, where the laird of birkendelly was on st. lawrence's eve, in the year <UNK> and sundry times subsequent to that. be it known, then, to every reader of this relation of facts that happened in my own remembrance that the road from birkendelly to the great muckle village of balmawhapple (commonly called the muckle town, in opposition to the little town that stood on the other side of the burn)--that road, i say, lay between two thorn-hedges, so well kept by the laird's hedger, so close, and so high, that a rabbit could not have escaped from the highway into any of the adjoining fields. along this road was the laird riding on the eve of st. lawrence, in a careless, indifferent manner, with his hat to one side, and his cane dancing a hornpipe before him. he was, moreover, chanting a song to himself, and i have heard people tell what song it was too. there was once a certain, or rather uncertain, bard, ycleped robert burns, who made a number of good songs; but this that the laird sang was an amorous song of great antiquity, which, like all the said bard's best songs, was sung one hundred and fifty years before he was born. it began thus: "i am the laird of windy-wa's, i cam nae here without a cause, an' i hae gotten forty fa's in coming o'er the knowe, joe. the night it is baith wind and weet; the morn it will be snaw and sleet; my shoon are frozen to my feet; o, rise an' let me in, joe! let me in this ae night," etc. this song was the laird singing, while, at the same time, he was smudging and laughing at the catastrophe, when, ere ever aware, he beheld, a short way before him, an uncommonly elegant and beautiful girl walking in the same direction with him. "aye," said the laird to himself, "here is something very attractive indeed! where the deuce can she have sprung from? she must have risen out of the earth, for i never saw her till this breath. well, i declare i have not seen such a female figure--i wish i had such an assignation with her as the laird of windy-wa's had with his sweetheart." as the laird was half-thinking, half-speaking this to himself, the enchanting creature looked back at him with a motion of intelligence that she knew what he was half-saying, half-thinking, and then vanished over the summit of the rising ground before him, called the birky brow. "aye, go your ways!" said the laird; "i see by you, you'll not be very hard to overtake. you cannot get off the road, and i'll have a chat with you before you make the deer's den." the laird jogged on. he did not sing the _laird of windy-wa's_ any more, for he felt a stifling about his heart; but he often repeated to himself, "she's a very fine woman!--a very fine woman indeed!--and to be walking here by herself! i cannot comprehend it." when he reached the summit of the birky brow he did not see her, although he had a longer view of the road than before. he thought this very singular, and began to suspect that she wanted to escape him, although apparently rather lingering on him before. "i shall have another look at her, however," thought the laird, and off he set at a flying trot. no. he came first to one turn, then another. there was nothing of the young lady to be seen. "unless she take wings and fly away, i shall be up with her," quoth the laird, and off he set at the full gallop. in the middle of his career he met with mr. mcmurdie, of aulton, who hailed him with, "hilloa, birkendelly! where the deuce are you flying at that rate?" "i was riding after a woman," said the laird, with great simplicity, reining in his steed. "then i am sure no woman on earth can long escape you, unless she be in an air balloon." "i don't know that. is she far gone?" "in which way do you mean?" "in this." "aha-ha-ha! hee-hee-hee!" nichered mcmurdie, misconstruing the laird's meaning. "what do you laugh at, my dear sir? do you know her, then?" "ho-ho-ho! hee-hee-hee! how should i, or how can i, know her, birkendelly, unless you inform me who she is?" "why, that is the very thing i want to know of you. i mean the young lady whom you met just now." "you are raving, birkendelly. i met no young lady, nor is there a single person on the road i have come by, while you know that for a mile and a half forward your way she could not get out of it." "i know that," said the laird, biting his lip and looking greatly puzzled; "but confound me if i understand this; for i was within speech of her just now on the top of the birky brow there, and, when i think of it, she could not have been even thus far as yet. she had on a pure white gauze frock, a small green bonnet and feathers, and a green veil, which, flung back over her left shoulder, hung below her waist, and was altogether such an engaging figure that no man could have passed her on the road without taking some note of her. are you not making game of me? did you not really meet with her?" "on my word of truth and honor, i did not. come, ride back with me, and we shall meet her still, depend on it. she has given you the go-by on the road. let us go; i am only to call at the mill about some barley for the distillery, and will return with you to the big town." birkendelly returned with his friend. the sun was not yet set, yet m'murdie could not help observing that the laird looked thoughtful and confused, and not a word could he speak about anything save this lovely apparition with the white frock and the green veil; and lo! when they reached the top of birky brow there was the maiden again before them, and exactly at the same spot where the laird first saw her before, only walking in the contrary direction. "well, this is the most extraordinary thing that i ever knew!" exclaimed the laird. "what is it, sir?" said m'murdie. "how that young lady could have eluded me," returned the laird. "see, here she is still!" "i beg your pardon, sir, i don't see her. where is she?" "there, on the other side of the angle; but you are shortsighted. see, there she is ascending the other eminence in her white frock and green veil, as i told you. what a lovely creature!" "well, well, we have her fairly before us now, and shall see what she is like at all events," said mcmurdie. between the birky brow and this other slight eminence there is an obtuse angle of the road at the part where it is lowest, and, in passing this, the two friends necessarily lost sight of the object of their curiosity. they pushed on at a quick pace, cleared the low angle--the maiden was not there! they rode full speed to the top of the eminence from whence a long extent of road was visible before them--there was no human creature in view. mcmurdie laughed aloud, but the laird turned pale as death and bit his lip. his friend asked him good-humoredly why he was so much affected. he said, because he could not comprehend the meaning of this singular apparition or illusion, and it troubled him the more as he now remembered a dream of the same nature which he had, and which terminated in a dreadful manner. "why, man, you are dreaming still," said mcmurdie. "but never mind; it is quite common for men of your complexion to dream of beautiful maidens with white frocks, and green veils, bonnets, feathers, and slender waists. it is a lovely image, the creation of your own sanguine imagination, and you may worship it without any blame. were her shoes black or green? and her stockings--did you note them? the symmetry of the limbs, i am sure you did! good-bye; i see you are not disposed to leave the spot. perhaps she will appear to you again." so saying, mcmurdie rode on toward the mill, and birkendelly, after musing for some time, turned his beast's head slowly round, and began to move toward the great muckle village. the laird's feelings were now in terrible commotion. he was taken beyond measure with the beauty and elegance of the figure he had seen, but he remembered, with a mixture of admiration and horror, that a dream of the same enchanting object had haunted his slumbers all the days of his life; yet, how singular that he should never have recollected the circumstance till now! but farther, with the dream there were connected some painful circumstances which, though terrible in their issue, he could not recollect so as to form them into any degree of arrangement. as he was considering deeply of these things and riding slowly down the declivity, neither dancing his cane nor singing the _laird of windy-wa's_, he lifted up his eyes, and there was the girl on the same spot where he saw her first, walking deliberately up the birky brow. the sun was down, but it was the month of august and a fine evening, and the laird, seized with an unconquerable desire to see and speak with that incomparable creature, could restrain himself no longer, but shouted out to her to stop till he came up. she beckoned acquiescence, and slackened her pace into a slow movement. the laird turned the corner quickly, but when he had rounded it the maiden was still there, though on the summit of the brow. she turned round, and, with an ineffable smile and curtsy, saluted him, and again moved slowly on. she vanished gradually beyond the summit, and while the green feathers were still nodding in view, and so nigh that the laird could have touched them with a fishing-rod, he reached the top of the brow himself. there was no living soul there, nor onward, as far as his view reached. he now trembled in every limb, and, without knowing what he did, rode straight on to the big town, not daring well to return and see what he had seen for three several times; and certain he would see it again when the shades of evening were deepening, he deemed it proper and prudent to decline the pursuit of such a phantom any farther. he alighted at the queen's head, called for some brandy and water, quite forgot what was his errand to the great muckle town that afternoon, there being nothing visible to his mental sight but lovely images, with white gauze frocks and green veils. his friend m'murdie joined him; they drank deep, bantered, reasoned, got angry, reasoned themselves calm again, and still all would not do. the laird was conscious that he had seen the beautiful apparition, and, moreover, that she was the very maiden, or the resemblance of her, who, in the irrevocable decrees of providence, was destined to be his. it was in vain that m'murdie reasoned of impressions on the imagination, and "of fancy moulding in the mind, light visions on the passing wind." vain also was a story that he told him of a relation of his own, who was greatly harassed by the apparition of an officer in a red uniform that haunted him day and night, and had very nigh put him quite distracted several times, till at length his physician found out the nature of this illusion so well that he knew, from the state of his pulse, to an hour when the ghost of the officer would appear, and by bleeding, low diet, and emollients contrived to keep the apparition away altogether. the laird admitted the singularity of this incident, but not that it was one in point; for the one, he said, was imaginary, the other real, and that no conclusions could convince him in opposition to the authority of his own senses. he accepted of an invitation to spend a few days with m'murdie and his family, but they all acknowledged afterward that the laird was very much like one bewitched. as soon as he reached home he went straight to the birky brow, certain of seeing once more the angelic phantom, but she was not there. he took each of his former positions again and again, but the desired vision would in no wise make its appearance. he tried every day and every hour of the day, all with the same effect, till he grew absolutely desperate, and had the audacity to kneel on the spot and entreat of heaven to see her. yes, he called on heaven to see her once more, whatever she was, whether a being of earth, heaven, or hell. he was now in such a state of excitement that he could not exist; he grew listless, impatient, and sickly, took to his bed, and sent for m'murdie and the doctor; and the issue of the consultation was that birkendelly consented to leave the country for a season, on a visit to his only sister in ireland, whither we must accompany him for a short space. his sister was married to captain bryan, younger, of scoresby, and they two lived in a cottage on the estate, and the captain's parents and sisters at scoresby hall. great was the stir and preparation when the gallant young laird of birkendelly arrived at the cottage, it never being doubted that he came to forward a second bond of connection with the family, which still contained seven dashing sisters, all unmarried, and all alike willing to change that solitary and helpless state for the envied one of matrimony--a state highly popular among the young women of ireland. some of the misses bryan had now reached the years of womanhood, several of them scarcely, but these small disqualifications made no difference in the estimation of the young ladies themselves; each and all of them brushed up for the competition with high hopes and unflinching resolutions. true, the elder ones tried to check the younger in their good-natured, forthright irish way; but they retorted, and persisted in their superior pretensions. then there was such shopping in the county town! it was so boundless that the credit of the hall was finally exhausted, and the old squire was driven to remark that "och, and to be sure it was a dreadful and tirrabell concussion, to be put upon the equipment of seven daughters all at the same moment, as if the young gentleman could marry them all! och, then, poor dear shoul, he would be after finding that one was sufficient, if not one too many. and therefore there was no occasion, none at all, at all, and that there was not, for any of them to rig out more than one." it was hinted that the laird had some reason for complaint at this time, but as the lady sided with her daughters, he had no chance. one of the items of his account was thirty-seven buckling-combs, then greatly in vogue. there were black combs, pale combs, yellow combs, and gilt ones, all to suit or set off various complexions; and if other articles bore any proportion at all to these, it had been better for the laird and all his family that birkendelly had never set foot in ireland. the plan was all concocted. there was to be a grand dinner at the hall, at which the damsels were to appear in all their finery. a ball to follow, and note be taken which of the young ladies was their guest's choice, and measures taken accordingly. the dinner and the ball took place; and what a pity i may not describe that entertainment, the dresses, and the dancers, for they were all exquisite in their way, and _outré_ beyond measure. but such details only serve to derange a winter evening's tale such as this. birkendelly having at this time but one model for his choice among womankind, all that ever he did while in the presence of ladies was to look out for some resemblance to her, the angel of his fancy; and it so happened that in one of old bryan's daughters named luna, or, more familiarly, loony, he perceived, or thought he perceived, some imaginary similarity in form and air to the lovely apparition. this was the sole reason why he was incapable of taking his eyes off from her the whole of that night; and this incident settled the point, not only with the old people, but even the young ladies were forced, after every exertion on their own parts, to "yild the p'int to their sister loony, who certainly was not the mist genteelest nor mist handsomest of that guid-lucking fimily." the next day lady luna was dispatched off to the cottage in grand style, there to live hand in glove with her supposed lover. there was no standing all this. there were the two parrocked together, like a ewe and a lamb, early and late; and though the laird really appeared to have, and probably had, some delight in her company, it was only in contemplating that certain indefinable air of resemblance which she bore to the sole image impressed on his heart. he bought her a white gauze frock, a green bonnet and feather, with a veil, which she was obliged to wear thrown over her left shoulder, and every day after, six times a day, was she obliged to walk over a certain eminence at a certain distance before her lover. she was delighted to oblige him; but still, when he came up, he looked disappointed, and never said, "luna, i love you; when are we to be married?" no, he never said any such thing, for all her looks and expressions of fondest love; for, alas! in all this dalliance he was only feeding a mysterious flame that preyed upon his vitals, and proved too severe for the powers either of reason or religion to extinguish. still, time flew lighter and lighter by, his health was restored, the bloom of his cheek returned, and the frank and simple confidence of luna had a certain charm with it that reconciled him to his sister's irish economy. but a strange incident now happened to him which deranged all his immediate plans. he was returning from angling one evening, a little before sunset, when he saw lady luna awaiting him on his way home. but instead of brushing up to meet him as usual, she turned, and walked up the rising ground before him. "poor sweet girl! how condescending she is," said he to himself, "and how like she is in reality to the angelic being whose form and features are so deeply impressed on my heart! i now see it is no fond or fancied resemblance. it is real! real! real! how i long to clasp her in my arms, and tell her how i love her; for, after all, that is the girl that is to be mine, and the former a vision to impress this the more on my heart." he posted up the ascent to overtake her. when at the top she turned, smiled, and curtsied. good heavens! it was the identical lady of his fondest adoration herself, but lovelier, far lovelier, than ever. he expected every moment that she would vanish, as was her wont; but she did not--she awaited him, and received his embraces with open arms. she was a being of real flesh and blood, courteous, elegant, and affectionate. he kissed her hand, he kissed her glowing cheek, and blessed all the powers of love who had thus restored her to him again, after undergoing pangs of love such as man never suffered. "but, dearest heart, here we are standing in the middle of the highway," said he; "suffer me to conduct you to my sister's house, where you shall have an apartment with a child of nature having some slight resemblance to yourself." she smiled, and said, "no, i will not sleep with lady luna to-night. will you please to look round you, and see where you are." he did so, and behold they were standing on the birky brow, on the only spot where he had ever seen her. she smiled at his embarrassed look, and asked if he did not remember aught of his coming over from ireland. he said he thought he did remember something of it, but love with him had long absorbed every other sense. he then asked her to his own house, which she declined, saying she could only meet him on that spot till after their marriage, which could not be before st. lawrence's eve come three years. "and now," said she, "we must part. my name is jane ogilvie, and you were betrothed to me before you were born. but i am come to release you this evening, if you have the slightest objection." he declared he had none; and kneeling, swore the most solemn oath to be hers forever, and to meet her there on st. lawrence's eve next, and every st. lawrence's eve until that blessed day on which she had consented to make him happy by becoming his own forever. she then asked him affectionately to change rings with her, in pledge of their faith and troth, in which he joyfully acquiesced; for she could not have then asked any conditions which, in the fulness of his heart's love, he would not have granted; and after one fond and affectionate kiss, and repeating all their engagements over again, they parted. birkendelly's heart was now melted within him, and all his senses overpowered by one overwhelming passion. on leaving his fair and kind one, he got bewildered, and could not find the road to his own house, believing sometimes that he was going there, and sometimes to his sister's, till at length he came, as he thought, upon the liffey, at its junction with loch allan; and there, in attempting to call for a boat, he awoke from a profound sleep, and found himself lying in his bed within his sister's house, and the day sky just breaking. if he was puzzled to account for some things in the course of his dream, he was much more puzzled to account for them now that he was wide awake. he was sensible that he had met his love, had embraced, kissed, and exchanged vows and rings with her, and, in token of the truth and reality of all these, her emerald ring was on his finger, and his own away; so there was no doubt that they had met--by what means it was beyond the power of man to calculate. there was then living with mrs. bryan an old scotswoman, commonly styled lucky black. she had nursed birkendelly's mother, and been dry-nurse to himself and sister; and having more than a mother's attachment for the latter, when she was married, old lucky left her country to spend the last of her days in the house of her beloved young lady. when the laird entered the breakfast-parlor that morning she was sitting in her black velvet hood, as usual, reading _the fourfold state of man_, and, being paralytic and somewhat deaf, she seldom regarded those who went or came. but chancing to hear him say something about the <UNK> of august, she quitted reading, turned round her head to listen, and then asked, in a hoarse, tremulous voice: "what's that he's saying? what's the unlucky callant saying about the <UNK> of august? aih? to be sure it is st. lawrence's eve, although the <UNK> be his day. it's ower true, ower true, ower true for him an' a' his kin, poor man! aih? what was he saying then?" the men smiled at her incoherent earnestness, but the lady, with true feminine condescension, informed her, in a loud voice, that allan had an engagement in scotland on st. lawrence's eve. she then started up, extended her shrivelled hands, that shook like the aspen, and panted out: "aih, aih? lord preserve us! whaten an engagement has he on st. lawrence's eve? bind him! bind him! shackle him wi' bands of steel, and of brass, and of iron! o may he whose blessed will was pleased to leave him an orphan sae soon, preserve him from the fate which i tremble to think on!" she then tottered round the table, as with supernatural energy, and seizing the laird's right hand, she drew it close to her unstable eyes, and then perceiving the emerald ring chased in blood, she threw up her arms with a jerk, opened her skinny jaws with a fearful gape, and uttering a shriek that made all the house yell, and every one within it to tremble, she fell back lifeless and rigid on the floor. the gentlemen both fled, out of sheer terror; but a woman never deserts her friends in extremity. the lady called her maids about her, had her old nurse conveyed to bed, where every means were used to restore animation. but, alas, life was extinct! the vital spark had fled forever, which filled all their hearts with grief, disappointment, and horror, as some dreadful tale of mystery was now sealed up from their knowledge which, in all likelihood, no other could reveal. but to say the truth, the laird did not seem greatly disposed to probe it to the bottom. not all the arguments of captain bryan and his lady, nor the simple entreaties of lady luna, could induce birkendelly to put off his engagement to meet his love on the birky brow on the evening of the <UNK> of august; but he promised soon to return, pretending that some business of the utmost importance called him away. before he went, however, he asked his sister if ever she had heard of such a lady in scotland as jane ogilvie. mrs. bryan repeated the name many times to herself, and said that name undoubtedly was once familiar to her, although she thought not for good, but at that moment she did not recollect one single individual of the name. he then showed her the emerald ring that had been the death of lucky black; but the moment the lady looked at it, she made a grasp at it to take it off by force, which she had very nearly effected. "oh, burn it! burn it!" cried she; "it is not a right ring! burn it!" "my dear sister, what fault is in the ring?" said he. "it is a very pretty ring, and one that i set great value by." "oh, for heaven's sake, burn it, and renounce the giver!" cried she. "if you have any regard for your peace here or your soul's welfare hereafter, burn that ring! if you saw with your own eyes, you would easily perceive that that is not a ring befitting a christian to wear." this speech confounded birkendelly a good deal. he retired by himself and examined the ring, and could see nothing in it unbecoming a christian to wear. it was a chased gold ring, with a bright emerald, which last had a red foil, in some lights giving it a purple gleam, and inside was engraven "_elegit_," much defaced, but that his sister could not see; therefore he could not comprehend her vehement injunctions concerning it. but that it might no more give her offence, or any other, he sewed it within his vest, opposite his heart, judging that there was something in it which his eyes were withholden from discerning. thus he left ireland with his mind in great confusion, groping his way, as it were, in a hole of mystery, yet with the passion that preyed on his heart and vitals more intense than ever. he seems to have had an impression all his life that some mysterious fate awaited him, which the correspondence of his dreams and day visions tended to confirm. and though he gave himself wholly up to the sway of one overpowering passion, it was not without some yearnings of soul, manifestations of terror, and so much earthly shame, that he never more mentioned his love, or his engagements, to any human being, not even to his friend m'murdie, whose company he forthwith shunned. it is on this account that i am unable to relate what passed between the lovers thenceforward. it is certain they met at the birky brow that st. lawrence's eve, for they were seen in company together; but of the engagements, vows, or dalliance that passed between them i can say nothing; nor of all their future meetings, until the beginning of august, <UNK> when the laird began decidedly to make preparations for his approaching marriage; yet not as if he and his betrothed had been to reside at birkendelly, all his provisions rather bespeaking a meditated journey. on the morning of the <UNK> he wrote to his sister, and then arraying himself in his new wedding suit, and putting the emerald ring on his finger, he appeared all impatience, until toward evening, when he sallied out on horseback to his appointment. it seems that his mysterious inamorata had met him, for he was seen riding through the big town before sunset, with a young lady behind him, dressed in white and green, and the villagers affirmed that they were riding at the rate of fifty miles an hour! they were seen to pass a cottage called mosskilt, ten miles farther on, where there was no highway, at the same tremendous speed; and i could never hear that they were any more seen, until the following morning, when birkendelly's fine bay horse was found lying dead at his own stable door; and shortly after his master was likewise discovered lying, a blackened corpse, on the birky brow at the very spot where the mysterious but lovely dame had always appeared to him. there was neither wound, bruise, nor dislocation in his whole frame; but his skin was of a livid color, and his features terribly distorted. this woful catastrophe struck the neighborhood with great consternation, so that nothing else was talked of. every ancient tradition and modern incident were raked together, compared, and combined; and certainly a most rare concatenation of misfortunes was elicited. it was authenticated that his father had died on the same spot that day twenty years, and his grandfather that day forty years, the former, as was supposed, by a fall from his horse when in liquor, and the latter, nobody knew how; and now this allan was the last of his race, for mrs. bryan had no children. it was, moreover, now remembered by many, and among the rest by the rev. joseph taylor, that he had frequently observed a young lady, in white and green, sauntering about the spot on a st. lawrence's eve. when captain bryan and his lady arrived to take possession of the premises, they instituted a strict inquiry into every circumstance; but nothing further than what was related to them by mr. m'murdie could be learned of this mysterious bride, besides what the laird's own letter bore. it ran thus: "dearest sister,--i shall before this time to-morrow be the most happy, or most miserable, of mankind, having solemnly engaged myself this night to wed a young and beautiful lady, named jane ogilvie, to whom it seems i was betrothed before i was born. our correspondence has been of a most private and mysterious nature; but my troth is pledged, and my resolution fixed. we set out on a far journey to the place of her abode on the nuptial eve, so that it will be long before i see you again. yours till death, "allan george sandison. "birkendelly, _august <UNK> <UNK> that very same year, an old woman, named marion haw, was returned upon that, her native parish, from glasgow. she had led a migratory life with her son--who was what he called a bell-hanger, but in fact a tinker of the worst grade--for many years, and was at last returned to the muckle town in a state of great destitution. she gave the parishioners a history of the mysterious bride, so plausibly correct, but withal so romantic, that everybody said of it (as is often said of my narratives, with the same narrow-minded prejudice and injustice) that it was a _made story_. there were, however, some strong testimonies of its veracity. she said the first allan sandison, who married the great heiress of birkendelly, was previously engaged to a beautiful young lady named jane ogilvie, to whom he gave anything but fair play; and, as she believed, either murdered her, or caused her to be murdered, in the midst of a thicket of birch and broom, at a spot which she mentioned; and she had good reason for believing so, as she had seen the red blood and the new grave, when she was a little girl, and ran home and mentioned it to her grandfather, who charged her as she valued her life never to mention that again, as it was only the nombles and hide of a deer which he himself had buried there. but when, twenty years subsequent to that, the wicked and unhappy allan sandison was found dead on that very spot, and lying across the green mound, then nearly level with the surface, which she had once seen a new grave, she then for the first time ever thought of a divine providence; and she added, "for my grandfather, neddy haw, he dee'd too; there's naebody kens how, nor ever shall." as they were quite incapable of conceiving from marion's description anything of the spot, mr. m'murdie caused her to be taken out to the birky brow in a cart, accompanied by mr. taylor and some hundreds of the town's folks; but whenever she saw it, she said, "aha, birkies! the haill kintra's altered now. there was nae road here then; it gaed straight ower the tap o' the hill. an' let me see--there's the thorn where the cushats biggit; an' there's the auld birk that i ance fell aff an' left my shoe sticking i' the cleft. i can tell ye, birkies, either the deer's grave or bonny jane ogilvie's is no twa yards aff the place where that horse's hind-feet are standin'; sae ye may howk, an' see if there be ony remains." the minister and m'murdie and all the people stared at one another, for they had purposely caused the horse to stand still on the very spot where both the father and son had been found dead. they digged, and deep, deep below the road they found part of the slender bones and skull of a young female, which they deposited decently in the church-yard. the family of the sandisons is extinct, the mysterious bride appears no more on the eve of st. lawrence, and the wicked people of the great muckle village have got a lesson on divine justice written to them in lines of blood. the devil and tom walker <UNK> [footnote <UNK> from _the money-diggers_.] _washington irving_ <UNK> a few miles from boston, in massachusetts, there is a deep inlet winding several miles into the interior of the country from charles bay, and terminating in a thickly wooded swamp or morass. on one side of this inlet is a beautiful dark grove; on the opposite side the land rises abruptly from the water's edge into a high ridge, on which grow a few scattered oaks of great age and immense size. under one of these gigantic trees, according to old stories, there was a great amount of treasure buried by kidd the pirate. the inlet allowed a facility to bring the money in a boat secretly, and at night, to the very foot of the hill; the elevation of the place permitted a good lookout to be kept that no one was at hand; while the remarkable trees formed good landmarks by which the place might easily be found again. the old stories add, moreover, that the devil presided at the hiding of the money, and took it under his guardianship; but this, it is well known, he always does with buried treasure, particularly when it has been ill-gotten. be that as it may, kidd never returned to recover his wealth; being shortly after seized at boston, sent out to england, and there hanged for a pirate. about the year <UNK> just at the time that earthquakes were prevalent in new england, and shook many tall sinners down upon their knees, there lived near this place a meagre, miserly fellow, of the name of tom walker. he had a wife as miserly as himself; they were so miserly that they even conspired to cheat each other. whatever the woman could lay hands on she hid away; a hen could not cackle but she was on the alert to secure the new-laid egg. her husband was continually prying about to detect her secret hoards, and many and fierce were the conflicts that took place about what ought to have been common property. they lived in a forlorn-looking house that stood alone and had an air of starvation. a few straggling savin-trees, emblems of sterility, grew near it; no smoke ever curled from its chimney; no traveller stopped at its door. a miserable horse, whose ribs were as articulate as the bars of a gridiron, stalked about a field, where a thin carpet of moss, scarcely covering the ragged beds of pudding-stone, tantalized and balked his hunger; and sometimes he would lean his head over the fence, look piteously at the passer-by, and seem to petition deliverance from this land of famine. the house and its inmates had altogether a bad name. tom's wife was a tall termagant, fierce of temper, loud of tongue, and strong of arm. her voice was often heard in wordy warfare with her husband; and his face sometimes showed signs that their conflicts were not confined to words. no one ventured, however, to interfere between them. the lonely wayfarer shrank within himself at the horrid clamor and clapper-clawing; eyed the den of discord askance; and hurried on his way, rejoicing, if a bachelor, in his celibacy. one day that tom walker had been to a distant part of the neighborhood, he took what he considered a short-cut homeward, through the swamp. like most short-cuts, it was an ill-chosen route. the swamp was thickly grown with great, gloomy pines and hemlocks, some of them ninety feet high, which made it dark at noonday and a retreat for all the owls of the neighborhood. it was full of pits and quagmires, partly covered with weeds and mosses, where the green surface often betrayed the traveller into a gulf of black, smothering mud; there were also dark and stagnant pools, the abodes of the tadpole, the bull-frog, and the water-snake, where the trunks of pines and hemlocks lay half-drowned, half-rotting, looking like alligators sleeping in the mire. tom had long been picking his way cautiously through this treacherous forest, stepping from tuft to tuft of rushes and roots, which afforded precarious footholds among deep sloughs, or pacing carefully, like a cat, along the prostrate trunks of trees, startled now and then by the sudden screaming of the bittern, or the quacking of a wild duck, rising on the wing from some solitary pool. at length he arrived at a firm piece of ground, which ran like a peninsula into the deep bosom of the swamp. it had been one of the strongholds of the indians during their wars with the first colonists. here they had thrown up a kind of fort, which they had looked upon as almost impregnable, and had used as a place of refuge for their squaws and children. nothing remained of the old indian fort but a few embankments, gradually sinking to the level of the surrounding earth, and already overgrown in part by oaks and other forest trees, the foliage of which formed a contrast to the dark pines and hemlocks of the swamps. it was late in the dusk of evening when tom walker reached the old fort, and he paused there awhile to rest himself. any one but he would have felt unwilling to linger in this lonely, melancholy place, for the common people had a bad opinion of it, from the stories handed down from the times of the indian wars, when it was asserted that the savages held incantations here and made sacrifices to the evil spirit. tom walker, however, was not a man to be troubled with any fears of the kind. he reposed himself for some time on the trunk of a fallen hemlock, listening to the boding cry of the tree-toad, and delving with his walking-staff into a mound of black mould at his feet. as he turned up the soil unconsciously, his staff struck against something hard. he raked it out of the vegetable mould, and lo! a cloven skull, with an indian tomahawk buried deep in it, lay before him. the rust on the weapon showed the time that had elapsed since this death-blow had been given. it was a dreary memento of the fierce struggle that had taken place in this last foothold of the indian warriors. "humph!" said tom walker, as he gave it a kick to shake the dirt from it. "let that skull alone!" said a gruff voice. tom lifted up his eyes and beheld a great black man seated directly opposite him, on the stump of a tree. he was exceedingly surprised, having neither heard nor seen any one approach; and he was still more perplexed on observing, as well as the gathering gloom would permit, that the stranger was neither negro nor indian. it is true he was dressed in a rude indian garb, and had a red belt or sash swathed round his body; but his face was neither black nor copper-color, but swarthy and dingy, and begrimed with soot, as if he had been accustomed to toil among fires and forges. he had a shock of coarse black hair, that stood out from his head in all directions, and bore an axe on his shoulder. he scowled for a moment at tom with a pair of great red eyes. "what are you doing on my grounds?" said the black man, with a hoarse, growling voice. "your grounds!" said tom, with a sneer; "no more your grounds than mine; they belong to deacon peabody." "deacon peabody be damned," said the stranger, "as i flatter myself he will be, if he does not look more to his own sins and less to those of his neighbors. look yonder, and see how deacon peabody is faring." tom looked in the direction that the stranger pointed, and beheld one of the great trees, fair and flourishing without, but rotten at the core, and saw that it had been nearly hewn through, so that the first high wind was likely to blow it down. on the bark of the tree was scored the name of deacon peabody, an eminent man who had waxed wealthy by driving shrewd bargains with the indians. he now looked around, and found most of the tall trees marked with the name of some great man of the colony, and all more or less scored by the axe. the one on which he had been seated, and which had evidently just been hewn down, bore the name of crowninshield; and he recollected a mighty rich man of that name, who made a vulgar display of wealth, which it was whispered he had acquired by buccaneering. "he's just ready for burning!" said the black man, with a growl of triumph. "you see i am likely to have a good stock of firewood for winter." "but what right have you," said tom, "to cut down deacon peabody's timber?" "the right of a prior claim," said the other. "this woodland belonged to me long before one of your white-faced race put foot upon the soil." "and, pray, who are you, if i may be so bold?" said tom. "oh, i go by various names. i am the wild huntsman in some countries; the black miner in others. in this neighborhood i am known by the name of the black woodsman. i am he to whom the red men consecrated this spot, and in honor of whom they now and then roasted a white man, by way of sweet-smelling sacrifice. since the red men have been exterminated by you white savages, i amuse myself by presiding at the persecutions of quakers and anabaptists; i am the great patron and prompter of slave-dealers and the grand-master of the salem witches." "the upshot of all which is, that, if i mistake not," said tom, sturdily, "you are he commonly called old scratch." "the same, at your service!" replied the black man, with a half-civil nod. such was the opening of this interview, according to the old story; though it has almost too familiar an air to be credited. one would think that to meet with such a singular personage in this wild, lonely place would have shaken any man's nerves; but tom was a hard-minded fellow, not easily daunted, and he had lived so long with a termagant wife that he did not even fear the devil. it is said that after this commencement they had a long and earnest conversation together, as tom returned homeward. the black man told him of great sums of money buried by kidd the pirate under the oak-trees on the high ridge, not far from the morass. all these were under his command, and protected by his power, so that none could find them but such as propitiated his favor. these he offered to place within tom walker's reach, having conceived an especial kindness for him; but they were to be had only on certain conditions. what these conditions were may be easily surmised, though tom never disclosed them publicly. they must have been very hard, for he required time to think of them, and he was not a man to stick at trifles when money was in view. when they had reached the edge of the swamp, the stranger paused. "what proof have i that all you have been telling me is true?" said tom. "there's my signature," said the black man, pressing his finger on tom's forehead. so saying, he turned off among the thickets of the swamp, and seemed, as tom said, to go down, down, down, into the earth, until nothing but his head and shoulders could be seen, and so on, until he totally disappeared. when tom reached home he found the black print of a finger burned, as it were, into his forehead, which nothing could obliterate. the first news his wife had to tell him was the sudden death of absalom crowninshield, the rich buccaneer. it was announced in the papers, with the usual flourish, that "a great man had fallen in israel." tom recollected the tree which his black friend had just hewn down, and which was ready for burning. "let the freebooter roast," said tom; "who cares!" he now felt convinced that all he had heard and seen was no illusion. he was not prone to let his wife into his confidence; but as this was an uneasy secret, he willingly shared it with her. all her avarice was awakened at the mention of hidden gold, and she urged her husband to comply with the black man's terms, and secure what would make them wealthy for life. however tom might have felt disposed to sell himself to the devil, he was determined not to do so to oblige his wife; so he flatly refused, out of the mere spirit of contradiction. many and bitter were the quarrels they had on the subject; but the more she talked, the more resolute was tom not to be damned to please her. at length she determined to drive the bargain on her own account, and, if she succeeded, to keep all the gain to herself. being of the same fearless temper as her husband, she set off for the old indian fort toward the close of a summer's day. she was many hours absent. when she came back, she was reserved and sullen in her replies. she spoke something of a black man, whom she had met about twilight hewing at the root of a tall tree. he was sulky, however, and would not come to terms; she was to go again with a propitiatory offering, but what it was she forbore to say. the next evening she set off again for the swamp, with her apron heavily laden. tom waited and waited for her, but in vain; midnight came, but she did not make her appearance; morning, noon, night returned, but still she did not come. tom now grew uneasy for her safety, especially as he found she had carried off in her apron the silver tea-pot and spoons, and every portable article of value. another night elapsed, another morning came; but no wife. in a word, she was never heard of more. what was her real fate nobody knows, in consequence of so many pretending to know. it is one of those facts which have become confounded by a variety of historians. some asserted that she lost her way among the tangled mazes of the swamp, and sank into some pit or slough; others, more uncharitable, hinted that she had eloped with the household booty, and made off to some other province; while others surmised that the tempter had decoyed her into a dismal quagmire, on the top of which her hat was found lying. in confirmation of this, it was said a great black man, with an axe on his shoulder, was seen late that very evening coming out of the swamp, carrying a bundle tied in a check apron, with an air of surly triumph. the most current and probable story, however, observes that tom walker grew so anxious about the fate of his wife and his property that he set out at length to seek them both at the indian fort. during a long summer's afternoon he searched about the gloomy place, but no wife was to be seen. he called her name repeatedly, but she was nowhere to be heard. the bittern alone responded to his voice, as he flew screaming by; or the bull-frog croaked dolefully from a neighboring pool. at length, it is said, just in the brown hour of twilight, when the owls began to hoot and the bats to flit about, his attention was attracted by the clamor of carrion crows hovering about a cypress-tree. he looked up and beheld a bundle tied in a check apron and hanging in the branches of the tree, with a great vulture perched hard by, as if keeping watch upon it. he leaped with joy, for he recognized his wife's apron, and supposed it to contain the household valuables. "let us get hold of the property," said he, consolingly, to himself, "and we will endeavor to do without the woman." as he scrambled up the tree, the vulture spread its wide wings and sailed off, screaming, into the deep shadows of the forest. tom seized the checked apron, but, woful sight! found nothing but a heart and liver tied up in it! such, according to this most authentic old story, was all that was to be found of tom's wife. she had probably attempted to deal with the black man as she had been accustomed to deal with her husband; but though a female scold is generally considered a match for the devil, yet in this instance she appears to have had the worst of it. she must have died game, however; for it is said tom noticed many prints of cloven feet deeply stamped about the tree, and found handfuls of hair, that looked as if they had been plucked from the coarse black shock of the woodsman. tom knew his wife's prowess by experience. he shrugged his shoulders as he looked at the signs of fierce clapper-clawing. "egad," said he to himself, "old scratch must have had a tough time of it!" tom consoled himself for the loss of his property, with the loss of his wife, for he was a man of fortitude. he even felt something like gratitude toward the black woodsman, who, he considered, had done him a kindness. he sought, therefore, to cultivate a further acquaintance with him, but for some time without success; the old black-legs played shy, for, whatever people may think, he is not always to be had for the calling; he knows how to play his cards when pretty sure of his game. at length, it is said, when delay had whetted tom's eagerness to the quick and prepared him to agree to anything rather than not gain the promised treasure, he met the black man one evening in his usual woodsman's dress, with his axe on his shoulder, sauntering along the swamp and humming a tune. he affected to receive tom's advances with great indifference, made brief replies, and went on humming his tune. by degrees, however, tom brought him to business, and they began to haggle about the terms on which the former was to have the pirate's treasure. there was one condition which need not be mentioned, being generally understood in all cases where the devil grants favors; but there were others about which, though of less importance, he was inflexibly obstinate. he insisted that the money found through his means should be employed in his service. he proposed, therefore, that tom should employ it in the black traffic; that is to say, that he should fit out a slave-ship. this, however, tom resolutely refused; he was bad enough in all conscience, but the devil himself could not tempt him to turn slave-trader. finding tom so squeamish on this point, he did not insist upon it, but proposed, instead, that he should turn usurer; the devil being extremely anxious for the increase of usurers, looking upon them as his peculiar people. to this no objections were made, for it was just to tom's taste. "you shall open a broker's shop in boston next month," said the black man. "i'll do it to-morrow, if you wish," said tom walker. "you shall lend money at two per cent. a month." "egad, i'll charge four!" replied tom walker. "you shall extort bonds, foreclose mortgages, drive the merchants to bankruptcy--" "i'll drive them to the devil," cried tom walker. "_you_ are the usurer for my money!" said black-legs with delight. "when will you want the rhino?" "this very night." "done!" said the devil. "done!" said tom walker. so they shook hands and struck a bargain. a few days' time saw tom walker seated behind his desk in a counting-house in boston. his reputation for a ready-moneyed man, who would lend money out for a good consideration, soon spread abroad. everybody remembers the time of governor belcher, when money was particularly scarce. it was a time of paper credit. the country had been deluged with government bills; the famous land bank had been established; there had been a rage for speculating; the people had run mad with schemes for new settlements, for building cities in the wilderness; land-jobbers went about with maps of grants and townships and eldorados, lying nobody knew where, but which everybody was ready to purchase. in a word, the great speculating fever which breaks out every now and then in the country had raged to an alarming degree, and everybody was dreaming of making sudden fortunes from nothing. as usual, the fever had subsided, the dream had gone off, and the imaginary fortunes with it; the patients were left in doleful plight, and the whole country resounded with the consequent cry of "hard times." at this propitious time of public distress did tom walker set up as usurer in boston. his door was soon thronged by customers. the needy and adventurous, the gambling speculator, the dreaming land-jobber, the thriftless tradesman, the merchant with cracked credit--in short, everyone driven to raise money by desperate means and desperate sacrifices hurried to tom walker. thus tom was the universal friend to the needy, and acted like "a friend in need"; that is to say, he always exacted good pay and security. in proportion to the distress of the applicant was the hardness of his terms. he accumulated bonds and mortgages, gradually squeezed his customers closer and closer, and sent them at length, dry as a sponge, from his door. in this way he made money hand over hand, became a rich and mighty man, and exalted his cocked hat upon "change." he built himself, as usual, a vast house, out of ostentation, but left the greater part of it unfinished and unfurnished, out of parsimony. he even set up a carriage in the fulness of his vain-glory, though he nearly starved the horses which drew it; and, as the ungreased wheels groaned and screeched on the axle-trees, you would have thought you heard the souls of the poor debtors he was squeezing. as tom waxed old, however, he grew thoughtful. having secured the good things of this world, he began to feel anxious about those of the next. he thought with regret of the bargain he had made with his black friend, and set his wits to work to cheat him out of the conditions. he became, therefore, all of a sudden, a violent church-goer. he prayed loudly and strenuously, as if heaven were to be taken by force of lungs. indeed, one might always tell when he had sinned most during the week by the clamor of his sunday devotion. the quiet christians who had been modestly and steadfastly travelling zionward were struck with self-reproach at seeing themselves so suddenly outstripped in their career by this new-made convert. tom was as rigid in religious as in money matters; he was a stern supervisor and censurer of his neighbors, and seemed to think every sin entered up to their account became a credit on his own side of the page. he even talked of the expediency of reviving the persecution of quakers and anabaptists. in a word, tom's zeal became as notorious as his riches. still, in spite of all this strenuous attention to forms, tom had a lurking dread that the devil, after all, would have his due. that he might not be taken unawares, therefore, it is said he always carried a small bible in his coat-pocket. he had also a great folio bible on his counting-house desk, and would frequently be found reading it when people called on business; on such occasions he would lay his green spectacles in the book, to mark the place, while he turned round to drive some usurious bargain. some say that tom grew a little crack-brained in his old days, and that, fancying his end approaching, he had his horse new shod, saddled, and bridled, and buried with his feet uppermost; because he supposed that at the last day the world would be turned upside-down; in which case he should find his horse standing ready for mounting, and he was determined at the worst to give his old friend a run for it. this, however, is probably a mere old wives' fable. if he really did take such a precaution, it was totally superfluous; at least so says the authentic old legend, which closes his story in the following manner: one hot summer afternoon in the dog-days, just as a terrible black thunder-gust was coming up, tom sat in his counting-house, in his white linen cap and india silk morning-gown. he was on the point of foreclosing a mortgage, by which he would complete the ruin of an unlucky land-speculator for whom he had professed the greatest friendship. the poor land-jobber begged him to grant a few months' indulgence. tom had grown testy and irritated, and refused another delay. "my family will be ruined, and brought upon the parish," said the land-jobber. "charity begins at home," replied tom; "i must take care of myself in these hard times." "you have made so much money out of me," said the speculator. tom lost his patience and his piety. "the devil take me," said he, "if i have made a farthing!" just then there were three loud knocks at the street door. he stepped out to see who was there. a black man was holding a black horse, which neighed and stamped with impatience. "tom, you're come for," said the black fellow, gruffly. tom shrank back, but too late. he had left his little bible at the bottom of his coat-pocket and his big bible on the desk buried under the mortgage he was about to foreclose: never was sinner taken more unawares. the black man whisked him like a child into the saddle, gave the horse the lash, and away he galloped, with tom on his back, in the midst of the thunder-storm. the clerks stuck their pens behind their ears, and stared after him from the windows. away went tom walker, dashing down the streets, his white cap bobbing up and down, his morning-gown fluttering in the wind, and his steed striking fire out of the pavement at every bound. when the clerks turned to look for the black man, he had disappeared. tom walker never returned to foreclose the mortgage. a countryman, who lived on the border of the swamp, reported that in the height of the thunder-gust he had heard a great clattering of hoofs and a howling along the road, and running to the window caught sight of a figure, such as i have described, on a horse that galloped like mad across the fields, over the hills, and down into the black hemlock swamp toward the old indian fort, and that shortly after a thunder-bolt falling in that direction seemed to set the whole forest in a blaze. the good people of boston shook their heads and shrugged their shoulders, but had been so much accustomed to witches and goblins, and tricks of the devil, in all kinds of shapes, from the first settlement of the colony, that they were not so much horror-struck as might have been expected. trustees were appointed to take charge of tom's effects. there was nothing, however, to administer upon. on searching his coffers, all his bonds and mortgages were reduced to cinders. in place of gold and silver, his iron chest was filled with chips and shavings; two skeletons lay in his stable instead of his half-starved horses, and the very next day his great house took fire and was burned to the ground. such was the end of tom walker and his ill-gotten wealth. let all gripping money-brokers lay this story to heart. the truth of it is not to be doubted. the very hole under the oak-trees, whence he dug kidd's money, is to be seen to this day; and the neighboring swamp and old indian fort are often haunted in stormy nights by a figure on horseback, in morning-gown and white cap, which is doubtless the troubled spirit of the usurer. in fact, the story has resolved itself into a proverb, and is the origin of that popular saying, so prevalent throughout new england, of "the devil and tom walker." dr. heidegger's experiment _nathaniel hawthorne_ <UNK> that very singular man, old doctor heidegger, once invited four venerable friends to meet him in his study. there were three white-bearded gentlemen, mr. medbourne, colonel killigrew, and mr. gascoigne, and a withered gentlewoman whose name was the widow wycherley. they were all melancholy old creatures, who had been unfortunate in life, and whose greatest misfortune it was that they were not long ago in their graves. mr. medbourne, in the vigor of his age, had been a prosperous merchant, but had lost his all by a frantic speculation, and was no little better than a mendicant. colonel killigrew had wasted his best years, and his health and substance, in the pursuit of sinful pleasures, which had given birth to a brood of pains, such as the gout and divers other torments of soul and body. mr. gascoigne was a ruined politician, a man of evil fame, or at least had been so, till time had buried him from the knowledge of the present generation, and made him obscure instead of infamous. as for the widow wycherley, tradition tells us that she was a great beauty in her day; but, for a long while past, she had lived in deep seclusion, on account of certain scandalous stories which had prejudiced the gentry of the town against her. it is a circumstance worth mentioning that each of these three old gentlemen, mr. medbourne, colonel killigrew, and mr. gascoigne, were early lovers of the widow wycherley, and had once been on the point of cutting each other's throats for her sake. and, before proceeding further, i will merely hint that doctor heidegger and all his four guests were sometimes thought to be a little beside themselves; as is not unfrequently the case with old people, when worried either by present troubles or woful recollections. "my dear friends," said doctor heidegger, motioning them to be seated, "i am desirous of your assistance in one of those little experiments with which i amuse myself here in my study." if all stories were true, doctor heidegger's study must have been a very curious place. it was a dim, old-fashioned chamber, festooned with cobwebs and besprinkled with antique dust. around the walls stood several oaken bookcases, the lower shelves of which were filled with rows of gigantic folios and black-letter quartos, and the upper with little parchment-covered duodecimos. over the central bookcase was a bronze bust of hippocrates, with which, according to some authorities, doctor heidegger was accustomed to hold consultations in all difficult cases of his practice. in the obscurest corner of the room stood a tall and narrow oaken closet, with its door ajar, within which doubtfully appeared a skeleton. between two of the bookcases hung a looking-glass, presenting its high and dusty plate within a tarnished gilt frame. among many wonderful stories related of this mirror, it was fabled that the spirits of all the doctor's deceased patients dwelt within its verge, and would stare him in the face whenever he looked thitherward. the opposite side of the chamber was ornamented with the full-length portrait of a young lady, arrayed in the faded magnificence of silk, satin, and brocade, and with a visage as faded as her dress. above half a century ago doctor heidegger had been on the point of marriage with this young lady; but, being affected with some slight disorder, she had swallowed one of her lover's prescriptions, and died on the bridal evening. the greatest curiosity of the study remains to be mentioned; it was a ponderous folio volume, bound in black leather, with massive silver clasps. there were no letters on the back, and nobody could tell the title of the book. but it was well known to be a book of magic; and once, when a chambermaid had lifted it, merely to brush away the dust, the skeleton had rattled in its closet, the picture of the young lady had stepped one foot upon the floor, and several ghastly faces had peeped forth from the mirror; while the brazen head of hippocrates frowned, and said: "forbear!" such was doctor heidegger's study. on the summer afternoon of our tale a small round table, as black as ebony, stood in the centre of the room, sustaining a cut-glass vase of beautiful form and workmanship. the sunshine came through the window, between the heavy festoons of two faded damask curtains, and fell directly across this vase; so that a mild splendor was reflected from it on the ashen visages of the five old people who sat around. four champagne glasses were also on the table. "my dear old friends," repeated doctor heidegger, "may i reckon on your aid in performing an exceedingly curious experiment?" now doctor heidegger was a very strange old gentleman, whose eccentricity had become the nucleus for a thousand fantastic stories. some of these fables, to my shame be it spoken, might possibly be traced back to mine own veracious self; and if any passages of the present tale should startle the reader's faith, i must be content to bear the stigma of a fiction-monger. when the doctor's four guests heard him talk of his proposed experiment, they anticipated nothing more wonderful than the murder of a mouse in an air-pump or the examination of a cobweb by the microscope, or some similiar nonsense, with which he was constantly in the habit of pestering his intimates. but without waiting for a reply, doctor heidegger hobbled across the chamber, and returned with the same ponderous folio, bound in black leather, which common report affirmed to be a book of magic. undoing the silver clasps, he opened the volume, and took from among its black-letter pages a rose, or what was once a rose, though now the green leaves and crimson petals had assumed one brownish hue, and the ancient flower seemed ready to crumble to dust in the doctor's hands. "this rose," said doctor heidegger, with a sigh, "this same withered and crumbling flower, blossomed five and fifty years ago. it was given me by sylvia ward, whose portrait hangs yonder, and i meant to wear it in my bosom at our wedding. five and fifty years it has been treasured between the leaves of this old volume. now, would you deem it possible that this rose of half a century could ever bloom again?" "nonsense!" said the widow wycherley, with a peevish toss of her head. "you might as well ask whether an old woman's wrinkled face could ever bloom again." "see!" answered doctor heidegger. he uncovered the vase, and threw the faded rose into the water which it contained. at first, it lay lightly on the surface of the fluid, appearing to imbibe none of its moisture. soon, however, a singular change began to be visible. the crushed and dried petals stirred, and assumed a deepening tinge of crimson, as if the flower were reviving from a death-like slumber; the slender stalk and twigs of foliage became green; and there was the rose of half a century, looking as fresh as when sylvia ward had first given it to her lover. it was scarcely full blown; for some of its delicate red leaves curled modestly around its moist bosom, within which two or three dewdrops were sparkling. "that is certainly a very pretty deception," said the doctor's friends; careless, however, for they had witnessed greater miracles at a conjurer's show; "pray how was it effected?" "did you ever hear of the 'fountain of youth,'" asked doctor heidegger, "which ponce de leon, the spanish adventurer, went in search of, two or three centuries ago?" "but did ponce de leon ever find it?" said the widow wycherley. "no," answered doctor heidegger, "for he never sought it in the right place. the famous fountain of youth, if i am rightly informed, is situated in the southern part of the floridian peninsula, not far from lake macaco. its source is overshadowed by several magnolias, which, though numberless centuries old, have been kept as fresh as violets, by the virtues of this wonderful water. an acquaintance of mine, knowing my curiosity in such matters, has sent me what you see in the vase." "ahem!" said colonel killigrew, who believed not a word of the doctor's story; "and what may be the effect of this fluid on the human frame?" "you shall judge for yourself, my dear colonel," replied doctor heidegger; "and all of you, my respected friends, are welcome to so much of this admirable fluid as may restore to you the bloom of youth. for my own part, having had much trouble in growing old, i am in no hurry to grow young again. with your permission, therefore, i will merely watch the progress of the experiment." while he spoke, doctor heidegger had been filling the four champagne glasses with the water of the fountain of youth. it was apparently impregnated with an effervescent gas; for little bubbles were continually ascending from the depths of the glasses, and bursting in silvery spray at the surface. as the liquor diffused a pleasant perfume, the old people doubted now that it possessed cordial and comfortable properties; and though utter sceptics as to its rejuvenescent power, they were inclined to swallow it at once. but doctor heidegger besought them to stay a moment. "before you drink, my respectable old friends," said he, "it would be well that, with the experience of a lifetime to direct you, you should draw up a few general rules for your guidance, in passing a second time through the perils of youth. think what a sin and shame it would be if, with your peculiar advantages, you should not become patterns of virtue and wisdom to all the young people of the age!" the doctor's four venerable friends made him no answer, except by a feeble and tremulous laugh; so very ridiculous was the idea that, knowing how closely repentance treads behind the steps of error, they should ever go astray again. "drink, then," said the doctor, bowing: "i rejoice that i have so well selected the subjects of my experiment." with palsied hands they raised the glasses to their lips. the liquor, if it really possessed such virtues as doctor heidegger imputed to it, could not have been bestowed on four human beings who needed it more wofully. they looked as if they had never known what youth or pleasure was, but had been the offspring of nature's dotage, and always the gray, decrepit, sapless, miserable creatures, who now sat stooping round the doctor's table, without life enough in their souls or bodies to be animated even by the prospect of growing young again. they drank off the water, and replaced their glasses on the table. assuredly there was an almost immediate improvement in the aspect of the party, not unlike what might have been produced by a glass of generous wine, together with a sudden glow of cheerful sunshine, brightening over all their visages at once. there was a healthful suffusion on their cheeks, instead of the ashen hue that had made them look so corpselike. they gazed at one another, and fancied that some magic power had really begun to smooth away the deep and sad inscriptions which father time had been so long engraving on their brows. the widow wycherley adjusted her cap, for she felt almost like a woman again. "give us more of this wondrous water!" cried they, eagerly. "we are younger--but we are still too old! quick--give us more!" "patience! patience!" quoth doctor heidegger, who sat watching the experiment with philosophic coolness. "you have been a long time growing old. surely you might be content to grow young in half an hour! but the water is at your service." again he filled their glasses with the liquor of youth, enough of which still remained in the vase to turn half the old people in the city to the age of their own grandchildren. while the bubbles were yet sparkling on the brim, the doctor's four guests snatched their glasses from the table, and swallowed the contents at a single gulp. was it delusion? even while the draught was passing down their throats it seemed to have wrought a change on their whole systems. their eyes grew clear and bright; a dark shade deepened among their silvery locks; they sat round the table, three gentlemen of middle age, and a woman hardly beyond her buxom prime. "my dear widow, you are charming!" cried colonel killigrew, whose eyes had been fixed upon her face, while the shadows of age were flitting from it like darkness from the crimson daybreak. the fair widow knew of old that colonel killigrew's compliments were not always measured by sober truth; so she started up and ran to the mirror, still dreading that the ugly visage of an old woman would meet her gaze. meanwhile the three gentlemen behaved in such a manner as proved that the water of the fountain of youth possessed some intoxicating qualities, unless, indeed, their exhilaration of spirits were merely a lightsome dizziness, caused by the sudden removal of the weight of years. mr. gascoigne's mind seemed to run on political topics, but whether relating to the past, present, or future could not easily be determined, since the same ideas and phrases have been in vogue these fifty years. now he rattled forth full-throated sentences about patriotism, national glory, and the people's rights; now he muttered some perilous stuff or other, in a sly and doubtful whisper, so cautiously that even his own conscience could scarcely catch the secret; and now, again, he spoke in measured accents and a deeply deferential tone, as if a royal ear were listening to his well-turned periods. colonel killigrew all this time had been trolling forth a jolly battle-song, and ringing his glass toward the buxom figure of the widow wycherley. on the other side of the table mr. medbourne was involved in a calculation of dollars and cents, with which was strangely intermingled a project for supplying the east indies with ice, by harnessing a team of whales to the polar icebergs. as for the widow wycherley, she stood before the mirror, courtesying and simpering to her own image, and greeting it as the friend whom she loved better than all the world beside. she thrust her face close to the glass to see whether some long-remembered wrinkle or crow's-foot had indeed vanished. she examined whether the snow had so entirely melted from her hair that the venerable cap could be safely thrown aside. at last, turning briskly away, she came with a sort of dancing step to the table. "my dear old doctor," cried she, "pray favor me with another glass!" "certainly, my dear madam, certainly!" replied the complaisant doctor. "see! i have already filled the glasses." there, in fact, stood the four glasses, brimful of this wonderful water, the delicate spray of which, as it effervesced from the surface, resembled the tremulous glitter of diamonds. it was now so nearly sunset that the chamber had grown duskier than ever; but a mild and moon-like splendor gleamed from within the vase, and rested alike on the four guests, and on the doctor's venerable figure. he sat in a high-backed, elaborately carved oaken chair, with a gray dignity of aspect that might have well befitted that very father time, whose power had never been disputed, save by this fortunate company. even while quaffing the third draught of the fountain of youth, they were almost awed by the expression of his mysterious visage. but the next moment the exhilarating gush of young life shot through their veins. they were now in the happy prime of youth. age, with its miserable train of cares, and sorrows, and diseases, was remembered only as the trouble of a dream, from which they had joyously awoke. the fresh gloss of the soul, so early lost, and without which the world's successive scenes had been but a gallery of faded pictures, again threw its enchantment over all their prospects. they felt like new-created beings in a new-created universe. "we are young! we are young!" they cried, exultingly. youth, like the extremity of age, had effaced the strongly marked characteristics of middle life, and mutually assimilated them all. they were a group of merry youngsters, almost maddened with the exuberant frolicsomeness of their years. the most singular effect of their gayety was an impulse to mock the infirmity and decrepitude of which they had so lately been the victims. they laughed loudly at their old-fashioned attire--the wide-skirted coats and flapped waistcoats of the young men, and the ancient cap and gown of the blooming girl. one limped across the floor like a gouty grandfather; one set a pair of spectacles astride of his nose, and pretended to pore over the black-letter pages of the book of magic; a third seated himself in an arm-chair, and strove to imitate the venerable dignity of doctor heidegger. then all shouted mirthfully, and leaped about the room. the widow wycherley--if so fresh a damsel could be called a widow--tripped up to the doctor's chair with a mischievous merriment in her rosy face. "doctor, you dear old soul," cried she, "get up and dance with me!" and then the four young people laughed louder than ever, to think what a queer figure the poor old doctor would cut. "pray excuse me," answered the doctor, quietly. "i am old and rheumatic, and my dancing days were over long ago. but either of these gay young gentlemen will be glad of so pretty a partner." "dance with me, clara!" cried colonel killigrew. "she promised me her hand fifty years ago!" exclaimed mr. medbourne. they all gathered round her. one caught both her hands in his passionate grasp--another threw his arm about her waist--the third buried his hand among the curls that clustered beneath the widow's cap. blushing, panting, struggling, chiding, laughing, her warm breath fanning each of their faces by turns, she strove to disengage herself, yet still remained in their triple embrace. never was there a livelier picture of youthful rivalship, with bewitching beauty for the prize. yet, by a strange deception, owing to the duskiness of the chamber and the antique dresses which they still wore, the tall mirror is said to have reflected the figures of the three old, gray, withered grand-sires, ridiculously contending for the skinny ugliness of a shrivelled grandam. but they were young: their burning passions proved them so. inflamed to madness by the coquetry of the girl-widow, who neither granted nor quite withheld her favors, the three rivals began to interchange threatening glances. still keeping hold of the fair prize, they grappled fiercely at one another's throats. as they struggled to and fro, the table was overturned, and the vase dashed into a thousand fragments. the precious water of youth flowed in a bright stream across the floor, moistening the wings of a butterfly, which, grown old in the decline of summer, had alighted there to die. the insect fluttered lightly through the chamber, and settled on the snowy head of doctor heidegger. "come, come, gentlemen!--come, madame wycherley!" exclaimed the doctor, "i really must protest against this riot." they stood still and shivered; for it seemed as if gray time were calling them back from their sunny youth, far down into the chill and darksome vale of years. they looked at old doctor heidegger, who sat in his carved arm-chair, holding the rose of half a century which he had rescued from among the fragments of the shattered vase. at the motion of his hand the rioters resumed their seats, the more readily because their violent exertions had wearied them, youthful though they were. "my poor sylvia's rose!" ejaculated doctor heidegger, holding it in the light of the sunset clouds; "it appears to be fading again." and so it was. even while the party were looking at it the flower continued to shrivel up, till it became as dry and fragile as when the doctor had first thrown it into the vase. he shook off the few drops of moisture which clung to its petals. "i love it as well thus as in its dewy freshness," observed he, pressing the withered rose to his withered lips. while he spoke, the butterfly fluttered down from the doctor's snowy head, and fell upon the floor. his guests shivered again. a strange dullness, whether of the body or spirit they could not tell, was creeping gradually over them all. they gazed at one another, and fancied that each fleeting moment snatched away a charm, and left a deepening furrow where none had been before. was it an illusion? had the changes of a lifetime been crowded into so brief a space, and were they now four aged people, sitting with their old friend, doctor heidegger? "are we grown old again so soon?" cried they, dolefully. in truth, they had. the water of youth possessed merely a virtue more transient than that of wine. the delirium which it created had effervesced away. yes, they were old again! with a shuddering impulse, that showed her a woman still, the widow clasped her skinny hands over her face, and wished that the coffin lid were over it, since it could be no longer beautiful. "yes, friends, ye are old again," said doctor heidegger; "and lo! the water of youth is all lavished on the ground. well, i bemoan it not; for if the fountain gushed at my doorstep, i would not stoop to bathe my lips in it--no, though its delirium were for years instead of moments. such is the lesson ye have taught me!" but the doctor's four friends had taught no such lesson to themselves. they resolved forthwith to make a pilgrimage to florida, and quaff at morning, noon, and night from the fountain of youth. the purloined <UNK> [footnote <UNK> the pattern in method for all detective stories.] _edgar allan poe_ <UNK> at paris, just after dark one gusty evening in the autumn of <UNK> i was enjoying the twofold luxury of meditation and a meerschaum, in company with my friend, c. auguste dupin, in his little back library, or book-closet, _au troisième_, no. <UNK> rue dunôt, faubourg st. germain. for one hour at least we had maintained a profound silence, while each, to any casual observer, might have seemed intently and exclusively occupied with the curling eddies of smoke that oppressed the atmosphere of the chamber. for myself, however, i was mentally discussing certain topics which had formed matter for conversation between us at an earlier period of the evening; i mean the affair of the rue morgue, and the mystery attending the murder of marie rogêt. i looked upon it, therefore, as something of a coincidence, when the door of our apartment was thrown open and admitted our old acquaintance, monsieur g----, the prefect of the parisian police. we gave him a hearty welcome; for there was nearly half as much of the entertaining as of the contemptible about the man, and we had not seen him for several years. we had been sitting in the dark, and dupin now arose for the purpose of lighting a lamp, but sat down again, without doing so, upon g----'s saying that he had called to consult us, or rather to ask the opinion of my friend, about some official business which had occasioned a great deal of trouble. "if it is any point requiring reflection," observed dupin, as he forebore to enkindle the wick, "we shall examine it to better purpose in the dark." "that is another of your odd notions," said the prefect, who had the fashion of calling everything "odd" that was beyond his comprehension, and thus lived amid an absolute legion of "oddities." "very true," said dupin, as he supplied his visitor with a pipe, and rolled toward him a comfortable chair. "and what is the difficulty now?" i asked. "nothing more in the assassination way, i hope?" "oh no, nothing of that nature. the fact is, the business is _very_ simple indeed, and i make no doubt that we can manage it sufficiently well ourselves; but then i thought dupin would like to hear the details of it, because it is so excessively _odd_." "simple and odd," said dupin. "why, yes; and not exactly that, either. the fact is, we have all been a good deal puzzled because the affair is so simple, and yet baffles us altogether." "perhaps it is the very simplicity of the thing which puts you at fault," said my friend. "what nonsense you _do_ talk!" replied the prefect, laughing heartily. "perhaps the mystery is a little _too_ plain," said dupin. "oh, good heavens! who ever heard of such an idea?" "a little _too_ self-evident." "ha! ha! ha!--ha! ha! ha!--ho! ho! ho!" roared our visitor, profoundly amused, "oh, dupin, you will be the death of me yet!" "and what, after all, _is_ the matter on hand?" i asked. "why, i will tell you," replied the prefect, as he gave a long, steady, and contemplative puff, and settled himself in his chair. "i will tell you in a few words; but, before i begin, let me caution you that this is an affair demanding the greatest secrecy, and that i should most probably lose the position i now hold were it known that i confided it to any one." "proceed," said i. "or not," said dupin. "well, then; i have received personal information, from a very high quarter, that a certain document of the last importance has been purloined from the royal apartments. the individual who purloined it is known; this beyond a doubt; he was seen to take it. it is known, also, that it still remains in his possession." "how is this known?" asked dupin. "it is clearly inferred," replied the prefect, "from the nature of the document, and from the non-appearance of certain results which would at once arise from its passing _out_ of the robber's possession--that is to say, from his employing it as he must design in the end to employ it." "be a little more explicit," i said. "well, i may venture so far as to say that the paper gives its holder a certain power in a certain quarter where such power is immensely valuable." the prefect was fond of the cant of diplomacy. "still i do not quite understand," said dupin. "no? well, the disclosure of the document to a third person, who shall be nameless, would bring in question the honor of a personage of the most exalted station, and this fact gives the holder of the document an ascendancy over the illustrious personage whose honor and peace are so jeopardized." "but this ascendancy," i interposed, "would depend upon the robber's knowledge of the loser's knowledge of the robber. who would dare--" "the thief," said g----, "is the minister d----, who dares all things, those unbecoming as well as those becoming a man. the method of the theft was not less ingenious than bold. the document in question--a letter, to be frank--had been received by the personage robbed while alone in the royal _boudoir_. during its perusal she was suddenly interrupted by the entrance of the other exalted personage from whom especially it was her wish to conceal it. after a hurried and vain endeavor to thrust it in a drawer, she was forced to place it, open as it was, upon a table. the address, however, was uppermost, and, the contents thus unexposed, the letter escaped notice. at this juncture enters the minister d----. his lynx eye immediately perceives the paper, recognizes the handwriting of the address, observes the confusion of the personage addressed, and fathoms her secret. after some business transactions, hurried through in his ordinary manner, he produces a letter somewhat similar to the one in question, opens it, pretends to read it, and then places it in close juxtaposition to the other. again he converses, for some fifteen minutes, upon the public affairs. at length, in taking leave, he takes also from the table the letter to which he had no claim. its rightful owner saw, but of course, dared not call attention to the act, in the presence of the third personage who stood at her elbow. the minister decamped, leaving his own letter--one of no importance--upon the table." "here, then," said dupin to me, "you have precisely what you demand to make the ascendancy complete--the robber's knowledge of the loser's knowledge of the robber." "yes," replied the prefect, "and the power thus attained has, for some months past, been wielded, for political purposes, to a very dangerous extent. the personage robbed is more thoroughly convinced, every day, of the necessity of reclaiming her letter. but this, of course, cannot be done openly. in fine, driven to despair, she has committed the matter to me." "than whom," said dupin, amid a perfect whirlwind of smoke, "no more sagacious agent could, i suppose, be desired, or even imagined." "you flatter me," replied the prefect; "but it is possible that some such opinion may have been entertained." "it is clear," said i, "as you observe, that the letter is still in the possession of the minister; since it is this possession, and not any employment of the letter, which bestows the power. with the employment the power departs." "true," said g----; "and upon this conviction i proceeded. my first care was to make thorough search of the minister's hotel; and here my chief embarrassment lay in the necessity of searching without his knowledge. beyond all things, i have been warned of the danger which would result from giving him reason to suspect our design." "but," said i, "you are quite _au fait_ in these investigations. the parisian police have done this thing often before." "oh yes, and for this reason i did not despair. the habits of the minister gave me, too, a great advantage. he is frequently absent from home all night. his servants are by no means numerous. they sleep at a distance from their master's apartment, and, being chiefly neapolitans, are readily made drunk. i have keys, as you know, with which i can open any chamber or cabinet in paris. for three months a night has not passed during the greater part of which i have not been engaged, personally, in ransacking the d---- hotel. my honor is interested, and, to mention a great secret, the reward is enormous. so i did not abandon the search until i had become fully satisfied that the thief is a more astute man than myself. i fancy that i have investigated every nook and corner of the premises in which it is possible that the paper can be concealed." "but is it not possible," i suggested, "that although the letter may be in the possession of the minister, as it unquestionably is, he may have concealed it elsewhere than upon his own premises?" "this is barely possible," said dupin. "the present peculiar condition of affairs at court, and especially of those intrigues in which d---- is known to be involved, would render the instant availability of the document--its susceptibility of being produced at a moment's notice--a point of nearly equal importance with its possession." "its susceptibility of being produced?" said i. "that is to say, of being _destroyed_," said dupin. "true," i observed; "the paper is clearly, then, upon the premises. as for its being upon the person of the minister, we may consider that as out of the question." "entirely," said the prefect. "he has been twice waylaid, as if by footpads, and his person rigidly searched under my own inspection." "you might have spared yourself this trouble," said dupin. "d----, i presume, is not altogether a fool; and, if not, must have anticipated these waylayings, as a matter of course." "not _altogether_ a fool," said g----; "but, then, he is a poet, which i take to be only one remove from a fool." "true," said dupin, after a long and thoughtful whiff from his meerschaum, "although i have been guilty of certain doggrel myself." "suppose you detail," said i, "the particulars of your search." "why, the fact is, we took our time, and we searched _everywhere_. i have had long experience in these affairs. i took the entire building, room by room, devoting the nights of a whole week to each. we examined, first, the furniture of each apartment. we opened every possible drawer; and i presume you know that, to a properly trained police-agent, such a thing as a '_secret_' drawer is impossible. any man is a dolt who permits a 'secret' drawer to escape him in a search of this kind. the thing is so plain. there is a certain amount of bulk--of space--to be accounted for in every cabinet. then we have accurate rules. the fiftieth part of a line could not escape us. after the cabinets we took the chairs. the cushions we probed with the fine long needles you have seen me employ. from the tables we removed the tops." "why so?" "sometimes the top of a table, or other similarly arranged piece of furniture, is removed by the person wishing to conceal an article; then the leg is excavated, the article deposited within the cavity, and the top replaced. the bottoms and tops of bedposts are employed in the same way." "but could not the cavity be detected by sounding?" i asked. "by no means, if, when the article is deposited, a sufficient wadding of cotton be placed around it. besides, in our case, we were obliged to proceed without noise." "but you could not have removed--you could not have taken to pieces _all_ articles of furniture in which it would have been possible to make a deposit in the manner you mention. a letter may be compressed into a thin spiral roll, not differing much in shape or bulk from a large knitting-needle, and in this form it might be inserted into the rung of a chair, for example. you did not take to pieces all the chairs?" "certainly not; but we did better--we examined the rungs of every chair in the hotel, and, indeed, the jointings of every description of furniture, by the aid of a most powerful microscope. had there been any traces of recent disturbance we should not have failed to detect it instantly. a single grain of gimlet-dust, for example, would have been as obvious as an apple. any disorder in the gluing--any unusual gaping in the joints--would have sufficed to insure detection." "i presume you looked to the mirrors, between the boards and the plates, and you probed the beds and the bedclothes, as well as the curtains and carpets." "that, of course; and when we had absolutely completed every particle of the furniture in this way, then we examined the house itself. we divided its entire surface into compartments, which we numbered, so that none might be missed; then we scrutinized each individual square inch throughout the premises, including the two houses immediately adjoining, with the microscope, as before." "the two houses adjoining!" i exclaimed. "you must have had a great deal of trouble." "we had; but the reward offered is prodigious." "you include the _grounds_ about the houses?" "all the grounds are paved with brick. they gave us comparatively little trouble. we examined the moss between the bricks, and found it undisturbed." "you looked among d----'s papers, of course, and into the books of the library?" "certainly; we opened every package and parcel; we not only opened every book, but we turned over every leaf in each volume, not contenting ourselves with a mere shake, according to the fashion of some of our police officers. we also measured the thickness of every book-_cover_, with the most accurate admeasurement, and applied to each the most jealous scrutiny of the microscope. had any of the bindings been recently meddled with, it would have been utterly impossible that the fact should have escaped observation. some five or six volumes, just from the hands of the binder, we carefully probed, longitudinally, with the needles." "you explored the floors beneath the carpets?" "beyond doubt. we removed every carpet, and examined the boards with the microscope." "and the paper on the walls?" "yes." "you looked into the cellars?" "we did." "then," i said, "you have been making a miscalculation, and the letter is _not_ upon the premises, as you suppose." "i fear you are right there," said the prefect. "and now, dupin, what would you advise me to do?" "to make a thorough research of the premises." "that is absolutely needless," replied g----. "i am not more sure that i breathe than i am that the letter is not at the hotel." "i have no better advice to give you," said dupin. "you have, of course, an accurate description of the letter?" "oh yes!" and here the prefect, producing a memorandum book, proceeded to read aloud a minute account of the internal, and especially of the external, appearance of the missing document. soon after finishing the perusal of this description, he took his departure, more entirely depressed in spirits than i had ever known the good gentleman before. in about a month afterward he paid us another visit, and found us occupied very nearly as before. he took a pipe and a chair, and entered into some ordinary conversation. at length i said: "well, but, g----, what of the purloined letter? i presume you have at last made up your mind that there is no such thing as overreaching the minister?" "confound him, say i--yes; i made the re-examination, however, as dupin suggested--but it was all labor lost, as i knew it would be." "how much was the reward offered, did you say?" asked dupin. "why, a very great deal--a _very_ liberal reward--i don't like to say how much, precisely; but one thing i _will_ say, that i wouldn't mind giving my individual check for fifty thousand francs to any one who could obtain me that letter. the fact is, it is becoming of more and more importance every day; and the reward has been lately doubled. if it were trebled, however, i could do no more than i have done." "why, yes," said dupin, drawling, between the whiffs of his meerschaum, "i really--think, g----, you have not exerted yourself--to the utmost in this matter. you might--do a little more, i think; eh?" "how?--in what way?" "why"--puff, puff--"you might"--puff, puff--"employ counsel in the matter, eh"--puff, puff, puff. "do you remember the story they tell of abernethy?" "no; hang abernethy!" "to be sure! hang him and welcome. but, once upon a time, a certain miser conceived the design of spunging upon this abernethy for a medical opinion. getting up, for this purpose, an ordinary conversation in a private company, he insinuated his case to the physician as that of an imaginary individual." "'we will suppose,' said the miser, 'that his symptoms are such and such; now, doctor, what would _you_ have directed him to take?' "'take!' said abernethy. 'why, take _advice_, to be sure.'" "but," said the prefect, a little discomposed, "_i_ am _perfectly_ willing to take advice, and to pay for it. i would _really_ give fifty thousand francs to any one who would aid me in the matter." "in that case," replied dupin, opening a drawer, and producing a check-book, "you may as well fill me up a check for the amount mentioned. when you have signed it, i will hand you the letter." i was astounded. the prefect appeared absolutely thunder-stricken. for some minutes he remained speechless and motionless, looking incredulously at my friend with open mouth, and eyes that seemed starting from their sockets; then apparently recovering himself in some measure, he seized a pen, and after several pauses and vacant stares, finally filled up and signed a check for fifty thousand francs, and handed it across the table to dupin. the latter examined it carefully and deposited it in his pocket-book; then, unlocking an _escritoire_, took thence a letter and gave it to the prefect. this functionary grasped it in a perfect agony of joy, opened it with a trembling hand, cast a rapid glance at its contents, and then, scrambling and struggling to the door, rushed at length unceremoniously from the room and from the house, without having uttered a syllable since dupin had requested him to fill up the check. when he had gone, my friend entered into some explanation. "the parisian police," he said, "are exceedingly able in their way. they are persevering, ingenious, cunning, and thoroughly versed in the knowledge which their duties seem chiefly to demand. thus, when g---- detailed to us his mode of searching the premises at the hotel d----, i felt entire confidence in his having made a satisfactory investigation--so far as his labors extended." "so far as his labors extended?" said i. "yes," said dupin. "the measures adopted were not only the best of their kind, but carried out to absolute perfection. had the letter been deposited within the range of their search, these fellows would, beyond a question, have found it." i merely laughed--but he seemed quite serious in all that he said. "the measures, then," he continued, "were good in their kind, and well executed; their defect lay in their being inapplicable to the case and to the man. a certain set of highly ingenious resources are, with the prefect, a sort of procrustean bed, to which he forcibly adapts his designs. but he perpetually errs by being too deep or too shallow for the matter in hand, and many a school-boy is a better reasoner than he. i knew one about eight years of age, whose success at guessing in the game of 'even and odd' attracted universal admiration. this game is simple, and is played with marbles. one player holds in his hand a number of these toys, and demands of another whether that number is even or odd. if the guess is right, the guesser wins one; if wrong, he loses one. the boy to whom i allude won all the marbles of the school. of course, he had some principle of guessing; and this lay in mere observation and admeasurement of the astuteness of his opponents. for example, an arrant simpleton is his opponent, and, holding up his closed hand, asks, 'are they even or odd?' our school-boy replies, 'odd,' and loses; but upon the second trial he wins, for he then says to himself: 'the simpleton had them even upon the first trial, and his amount of cunning is just sufficient to make him have them odd upon the second; i will therefore guess odd'; he guesses odd, and wins. now, with a simpleton a degree above the first, he would have reasoned thus; 'this fellow finds that in the first instance i guessed odd, and, in the second, he will propose to himself, upon the first impulse, a simple variation from even to odd, as did the first simpleton; but then a second thought will suggest that this is too simple a variation, and finally he will decide upon putting it even as before. i will therefore guess even'; he guesses even, and wins. now this mode of reasoning in the school-boy, whom his fellows termed 'lucky,' what, in its last analysis, is it?" "it is merely," i said, "an identification of the reasoner's intellect with that of his opponent." "it is," said dupin; "and, upon inquiring of the boy by what means he effected the _thorough_ identification in which his success consisted, i received answer as follows: 'when i wish to find out how wise, or how stupid, or how good, or how wicked, is any one, or what are his thoughts at the moment, i fashion the expression of my face, as accurately as possible, in accordance with the expression of his, and then wait to see what thoughts or sentiments arise in my mind or heart, as if to match or correspond with the expression.' this response of the school-boy lies at the bottom of all the spurious profundity which has been attributed to rochefoucault, to la bougive, to machiavelli, and to campanella." "and the identification," i said, "of the reasoner's intellect with that of his opponent, depends, if i understand you aright, upon the accuracy with which the opponent's intellect is admeasured." "for its practical value it depends upon this," replied dupin; "and the prefect and his cohort fail so frequently, first, by default of this identification, and, secondly, by ill-admeasurement, or rather through non-admeasurement, of the intellect with which they are engaged. they consider only their _own_ ideas of ingenuity; and, in searching for anything hidden, advert only to the modes in which _they_ would have hidden it. they are right in this much--that their own ingenuity is a faithful representative of that of _the mass_; but when the cunning of the individual felon is diverse in character from their own, the felon foils them of course. this always happens when it is above their own, and very usually when it is below. they have no variation of principle in their investigations; at best, when urged by some unusual emergency--by some extraordinary reward--they extend or exaggerate their old modes of _practice_, without touching their principles. what, for example, in this case of d----, has been done to vary the principle of action? what is all this boring, and probing, and sounding, and scrutinizing with the microscope, and dividing the surface of the building into registered square inches--what is it all but an exaggeration of the application of the one principle or set of principles of search, which are based upon the one set of notions retarding human ingenuity, to which the prefect, in the long routine of his duty, has been accustomed? do you not see he had taken it for granted that _all_ men proceed to conceal a letter, not exactly in a gimlet-hole bored in a chair-leg, but, at least, in _some_ out-of-the-way hole or corner suggested by the same tenor of thought which would urge a man to secrete a letter in a gimlet-hole bored in a chair-leg? and do you not see, also, that such _recherché_ nooks for concealment are adapted only for ordinary occasions, and would be adopted only by ordinary intellects; for, in all cases of concealment, a disposal of the article concealed--a disposal of it in this _recherché_ manner--is, in the very first instance, presumable and presumed; and thus its discovery depends, not at all upon the acumen, but altogether upon the mere care, patience, and determination of the seekers; and where the case is of importance--or, when the reward is of magnitude--the qualities in question have _never_ been known to fail. you will now understand what i meant in suggesting that, had the purloined letter been hidden anywhere within the limits of the prefect's examination--in other words, had the principle of its concealment been comprehended within the principles of the prefect--its discovery would have been a matter altogether beyond question. this functionary, however, has been thoroughly mystified; and the remote source of his defeat lies in the supposition that the minister is a fool, because he has acquired renown as a poet. all fools are poets; this the prefect _feels_; and he is merely guilty of a _non distributio medii_ in thence inferring that all poets are fools. i mean to say, that if the minister had been no more than a mathematician, the prefect would have been under no necessity of giving me this check. i knew him, however, as both mathematician and poet, and my measures were adapted to his capacity, with reference to the circumstances by which he was surrounded. i knew him as a courtier, too, and as a bold _intriguant_. such a man, i considered, could not fail to be aware of the ordinary political modes of action. he could not have failed to anticipate--and events have proved that he did not fail to anticipate--the waylayings to which he was subjected. he must have foreseen, i reflected, the secret investigations of his premises. his frequent absences from home at night, which were hailed by the prefect as certain aids to his success, i regarded only as _ruses_, to afford opportunity for thorough search to the police, and thus the sooner to impress them with the conviction to which g----, in fact, did finally arrive--the conviction that the letter was not upon the premises. i felt, also, that the whole train of thought, which i was at some pains in detailing to you just now, concerning the invariable principle of political action in searches for articles concealed--i felt that this whole train of thought would necessarily pass through the mind of the minister. it would imperatively lead him to despise all the ordinary _nooks_ of concealment. _he_ could not, i reflected, be so weak as not to see that the most intricate and remote recess of his hotel would be as open as his commonest closets to the eyes, to the probes, to the gimlets, and to the microscopes of the prefect. i saw, in fine, that he would be driven, as a matter of course, to _simplicity_, if not deliberately induced to it as a matter of choice. you will remember, perhaps, how desperately the prefect laughed when i suggested, upon our first interview, that it was just possible this mystery troubled him so much on account of its being so _very_ self-evident." "yes," said i, "i remember his merriment well. i really thought he would have fallen into convulsions." "the material world," continued dupin, "abounds with very strict analogies to the immaterial; and thus some color of truth has been given to the rhetorical dogma that metaphor, or simile, may be made to strengthen an argument as well as to embellish a description. the principle of the _vis inertiae_, for example, seems to be identical in physics and metaphysics. it is not more true, in the former, that a large body is with more difficulty set in motion than a smaller one, and that its subsequent _momentum_ is commensurate with this difficulty, than it is, in the latter, that intellects of the vaster capacity, while more forcible, more constant, and more eventful in their movements than those of inferior grade, are yet the less readily moved, and more embarrassed, and full of hesitation in the first few steps of their progress. again: have you ever noticed which of the street signs, over the shop doors, are the most attractive of attention?" "i have never given the matter a thought," i said. "there is a game of puzzles," he resumed, "which is played upon a map. one party playing requires another to find a given word--the name of town, river, state, or empire--any word, in short, upon the motley and perplexed surface of the chart. a novice in the game generally seeks to embarrass his opponents by giving them the most minutely lettered names; but the adept selects such words as stretch, in large characters, from one end of the chart to the other. these, like the over-largely lettered signs and placards of the street, escape observation by dint of being excessively obvious; and here the physical oversight is precisely analogous with the moral inapprehension by which the intellect suffers to pass unnoticed those considerations which are too obtrusively and too palpably self-evident. but this is a point, it appears, somewhat above or beneath the understanding of the prefect. he never once thought it probable, or possible, that the minister had deposited the letter immediately beneath the nose of the whole world, by way of best preventing any portion of that world from perceiving it. "but the more i reflected upon the daring, dashing, and discriminating ingenuity of d----; upon the fact that the document must always have been _at hand_, if he intended to use it to good purpose; and upon the decisive evidence, obtained by the prefect, that it was not hidden within the limits of that dignitary's ordinary search, the more satisfied i became that, to conceal this letter, the minister had resorted to the comprehensive and sagacious expedient of not attempting to conceal it. "full of these ideas, i prepared myself with a pair of green spectacles, and called one fine morning, quite by accident, at the ministerial hotel. i found d---- at home, yawning, lounging, and dawdling, as usual, and pretending to be in the last extremity of _ennui_. he is, perhaps, the most really energetic human being now alive--but that is only when nobody sees him. "to be even with him, i complained of my weak eyes, and lamented the necessity of the spectacles, under cover of which i cautiously and thoroughly surveyed the whole apartment, while seemingly intent only upon the conversation of my host. "i paid especial attention to a large writing-table near which he sat, and upon which lay confusedly some miscellaneous letters and other papers, with one or two musical instruments and a few books. here, however, after a long and very deliberate scrutiny, i saw nothing to excite particular suspicion. "at length my eyes, in going the circuit of the room, fell upon a trumpery filigree card-rack of pasteboard that hung dangling by a dirty blue ribbon from a little brass knob just beneath the middle of the mantelpiece. in this rack, which had three or four compartments, were five or six soiled cards and a solitary letter. this last was much soiled and crumpled. it was torn nearly in two, across the middle--as if a design, in the first instance, to tear it entirely up as worthless had been altered or stayed in the second. it had a large black seal, bearing the d---- cipher _very_ conspicuously, and was addressed, in a diminutive female hand, to d----, the minister, himself. it was thrust carelessly, and even, as it seemed, contemptuously, into one of the uppermost divisions of the rack. "no sooner had i glanced at this letter than i concluded it to be that of which i was in search. to be sure, it was, to all appearance, radically different from the one of which the prefect had read us so minute a description. here the seal was large and black, with the d---- cipher; there it was small and red, with the ducal arms of the s---- family. here the address, to the minister, was diminutive and feminine; there the superscription, to a certain royal personage, was markedly bold and decided; the size alone formed a point of correspondence. but, then, the _radicalness_ of these differences, which was excessive; the dirt; the soiled and torn condition of the paper, so inconsistent with the _true_ methodical habits of d----, and so consistent of a design to delude the beholder into an idea of the worthlessness of the document--these things, together with the hyperobtrusive situation of this document, full in the view of every visitor, and thus exactly in accordance with the conclusions to which i had previously arrived--these things, i say, were strongly corroborative of suspicion in one who came with the intention to suspect. "i protracted my visit as long as possible, and, while i maintained a most animated discussion with the minister upon a topic which i knew well had never failed to interest and excite him, i kept my attention riveted upon the letter. in this examination i committed to memory its external appearance and arrangement in the rack, and also fell, at length, upon a discovery which set at rest whatever trivial doubt i might have entertained. in scrutinizing the edges of the paper, i observed them to be more _chafed_ than seemed necessary. they presented the _broken_ appearance which is manifested when a stiff paper, having been once folded and pressed with a folder, is refolded in a reversed direction, in the same creases or edges which formed the original fold. this discovery was sufficient. it was clear to me that the letter had been turned, as a glove, inside out, re-directed and re-sealed. i bade the minister good-morning, and took my departure at once, leaving a gold snuff-box upon the table. "the next morning i called for the snuff-box, when we resumed, quite eagerly, the conversation of the preceding day. while thus engaged, however, a loud report, as if of a pistol, was heard immediately beneath the windows of the hotel, and was succeeded by a series of fearful screams and the shoutings of a terrified mob. d---- rushed to a casement, threw it open, and looked out. in the mean time i stepped to the card-rack, took the letter, put it in my pocket, and replaced it by a _facsimile_ (so far as regards externals), which i had carefully prepared at my lodgings--imitating the d---- cipher, very readily, by means of a seal formed of bread. "the disturbance in the street had been occasioned by the frantic behavior of a man with a musket. he had fired it among a crowd of women and children. it proved, however, to have been without ball, and the fellow was suffered to go his way as a lunatic or a drunkard. when he had gone, d---- came from the window, whither i had followed him immediately upon securing the object in view. soon afterward i bade him farewell. the pretended lunatic was a man in my own pay." "but what purpose had you," i asked, "in replacing the letter by a _facsimile_? would it not have been better, at the first visit, to have seized it openly and departed?" "d----," replied dupin, "is a desperate man and a man of nerve. his hotel, too, is not without attendants devoted to his interests. had i made the wild attempt you suggest, i might never have left the ministerial presence alive. the good people of paris might have heard of me no more. but i had an object apart from these considerations. you know my political prepossessions. in this matter i act as a partisan of the lady concerned. for eighteen months the minister has had her in his power. she has now him in hers--since, being unaware that the letter is not in his possession, he will proceed with his exactions as if it was. thus will he inevitably commit himself, at once, to his political destruction. his downfall, too, will not be more precipitate than awkward. it is all very well to talk about the _facilis descensus averni_; but in all kinds of climbing, as catalani said of singing, it is far more easy to get up than to come down. in the present instance i have no sympathy--at least no pity--for him who descends. he is that _monstrum horrendum_, an unprincipled man of genius. i confess, however, that i should like very well to know the precise character of his thoughts, when, being defied by her whom the prefect terms 'a certain personage,' he is reduced to opening the letter i left for him in the card-rack." "how? did you put anything particular in it?" "why--it did not seem altogether right to leave the interior blank--that would have been insulting. d----, at vienna once, did me an evil turn, which i told him, quite good-humoredly, that i should remember. so, as i knew he would feel some curiosity in regard to the identity of the person who had outwitted him, i thought it a pity not to give him a clew. he is well acquainted with my ms., and i just copied into the middle of the blank sheet the words: "'---- ... un dessein si funeste, s'il n'est digne d'atrée, este digne de thyeste.' they are to be found in crébillon's _atrée_." rab and his friends _dr. john brown_ <UNK> four-and-thirty years ago, bob ainslie and i were coming up infirmary street from the high school, our heads together, and our arms intertwisted as only lovers and boys know how or why. when we got to the top of the street and turned north we espied a crowd at the tron church. "a dog-fight!" shouted bob, and was off; and so was i, both of us all but praying that it might not be over before we got up! and is not this boy-nature, and human nature, too? and don't we all wish a house on fire not to be out before we see it? dogs like fighting; old isaac says they "delight" in it, and for the best of all reasons; and boys are not cruel because they like to see the fight. they see three of the great cardinal virtues of dog or man--courage, endurance, and skill--in intense action. this is very different from a love of making dogs fight, and aggravating and making gain by their pluck. a boy--be he ever so fond himself of fighting, if he be a good boy, hates and despises all this, but he would have run off with bob and me fast enough; it is a natural, and a not wicked, interest that all boys and men have in witnessing intense energy in action. does any curious and finely ignorant woman wish to know how bob's eye at a glance announced a dog-fight to his brain? he did not--he could not--see the dogs fighting; it was a flash of an inference, a rapid induction. the crowd round a couple of dogs fighting is a crowd masculine mainly, with an occasional active, compassionate woman fluttering wildly round the outside and using her tongue and her hands freely upon the men, as so many "brutes"; it is a crowd annular, compact, and mobile; a crowd centripetal, having its eyes and its heads all bent downward and inward to one common focus. well, bob and i are up, and find it is not over; a small thoroughbred, white bull-terrier is busy throttling a large shepherd's dog, unaccustomed to war but not to be trifled with. they are hard at it; the scientific little fellow doing his work in great style, his pastoral enemy fighting wildly, but with the sharpest of teeth and a great courage. science and breeding, however, soon had their own; the game chicken, as the premature bob called him, working his way up, took his final grip of poor yarrow's throat--and he lay gasping and done for. his master, a brown, handsome, big, young shepherd from tweedsmuir, would have liked to have knocked down any man, would "drink up esil, or eat a crocodile," for that part, if he had a chance; it was no use kicking the little dog; that would only make him hold the closer. many were the means shouted out in mouthfuls of the best possible ways of ending it. "water!" but there was none near, and many cried for it who might have got it from the well at blackfriar's wynd. "bite the tail!" and a large, vague, benevolent, middle-aged man, more desirous than wise, with some struggle got the bushy end of yarrow's tail into his ample mouth and bit it with all his might. this was more than enough for the much-enduring, much-perspiring shepherd, who, with a gleam of joy over his broad visage, delivered a terrific facer upon our large, vague, benevolent, middle-aged friend, who went down like a shot. still the chicken holds; death not far off. "snuff! a pinch of snuff!" observed a calm, highly dressed young buck with an eye-glass in his eye. "snuff, indeed!" growled the angry crowd, affronted and glaring. "snuff! a pinch of snuff!" again observes the buck, but with more urgency; whereon were produced several open boxes, and from a mull which may have been at culloden he took a pinch, knelt down, and presented it to the nose of the chicken, the laws of physiology and of snuff take their course; the chicken sneezes, and yarrow is free! the young pastoral giant stalks off with yarrow in his arms--comforting him. but the bull-terrier's blood is up, and his soul unsatisfied; he grips the first dog he meets, and, discovering she is not a dog, in homeric phrase, he makes a brief sort of _amende_ and is off. the boys, with bob and me at their head, are after him: down niddry street he goes, bent on mischief; up the cowgate like an arrow--bob and i, and our small men; panting behind. there, under the single arch of the south bridge, is a huge mastiff, sauntering down the middle of the causeway, as if with his hands in his pockets; he is old, brindled, as big as a little highland bull, and has the shakespearean dewlaps shaking as he goes. the chicken makes straight at him, and fastens on his throat. to our astonishment, the great creature does nothing but stand still, hold himself up, and roar--yes, roar, a long, serious, remonstrative roar. how is this? bob and i are up to them. _he is muzzled_! the bailies had proclaimed a general muzzling, and his master, studying strength and economy mainly, had encompassed his huge jaws in a home-made apparatus constructed out of the leather of some ancient _breechin_. his mouth was open as far as it could; his lips curled up in rage--a sort of terrible grin; his teeth gleaming, ready, from out the darkness; the strap across his mouth tense as a bowstring; his whole frame stiff with indignation and surprise; his roar asking us all round, "did you ever see the like of this?" he looked a statue of anger and astonishment done in aberdeen granite. we soon had a crowd; the chicken held on. "a knife!" cried bob; and a cobbler gave him his knife; you know the kind of knife, worn obliquely to a point and always keen. i put its edge to the tense leather; it ran before it; and then!--one sudden jerk of that enormous head, a sort of dirty mist about his mouth, no noise, and the bright and fierce little fellow is dropped, limp and dead. a solemn pause; this was more than any of us had bargained for. i turned the little fellow over, and saw he was quite dead: the mastiff had taken him by the small of the back like a rat and broken it. he looked down at his victim appeased, ashamed, and amazed; sniffed him all over, stared at him, and, taking a sudden thought, turned round and trotted off. bob took the dead dog up, and said, "john, we'll bury him after tea." "yes," said i, and was off after the mastiff. he made up the cowgate at a rapid swing; he had forgotten some engagement. he turned up the candlemaker row, and stopped at the harrow inn. there was a carrier's cart ready to start, and a keen, thin, impatient, black-a-vised little man, his hand at his gray horse's head, looking about angrily for something. "rab, ye thief!" said he, aiming a kick at my great friend, who drew cringing up, and, avoiding the heavy shoe with more agility than dignity and watching his master's eye? slunk dismayed under the cart--his ears down, and as much as he had of tail down, too. what a man this must be--thought i--to whom my tremendous hero turns tail! the carrier saw the muzzle hanging, cut and useless, from his neck, and i eagerly told him the story, which bob and i always thought, and still think, homer, or king david, or sir walter alone were worthy to rehearse. the severe little man was mitigated, and condescended to say, "rab, ma man--puir rabbie," whereupon the stump of a tail rose up, the ears were cocked, the eyes filled and were comforted; the two friends were reconciled. "hupp!" and a stroke of the whip were given to jess, and off went the three. bob and i buried the game chicken that night (we had not much of a tea) in the back-green of his house, in melville street, no. <UNK> with considerable gravity and silence; and being at the time in the iliad, and, like all boys, trojans, we of course called him hector. six years have passed--a long time for a boy and a dog; bob ainslie is off to the wars; i am a medical student, and clerk at minto house hospital. rab i saw almost every week, on the wednesday, and we had much pleasant intimacy. i found the way to his heart by frequent scratching of his huge head and an occasional bone. when i did not notice him he would plant himself straight before me and stand wagging that bud of a tail, and looking up, with his head a little to the one side. his master i occasionally saw; he used to call me "maister john," but was laconic as any spartan. one fine october afternoon i was leaving the hospital, when i saw the large gate open, and in walked rab, with that great and easy saunter of his. he looked as if taking possession of the place, like the duke of wellington entering a subdued city, satiated with victory and peace. after him came jess, now white from age, with her cart; and in it a woman carefully wrapped up--the carrier leading the horse anxiously and looking back. when he saw me, james (for his name was james noble) made a curt and grotesque "boo," and said, "maister john, this is the mistress; she's got a trouble in her breest--some kind o' an income, we're thinkin'." by this time i saw the woman's face; she was sitting on a sack filled with straw, with her husband's plaid round her, and his big-coat, with its large, white metal buttons, over her feet. i never saw a more unforgettable face--pale, serious, _lonely_, delicate, sweet, without being at all what we call fine. she looked sixty, and had on a mutch, white as snow, with its black ribbon; her silvery, smooth hair setting off her dark-gray eyes--eyes such as one sees only twice or thrice in a lifetime, full of suffering, full also of the overcoming of it; her eyebrows black and delicate, and her mouth firm, patient, and contented, which few mouths ever are. as i have said, i never saw a more beautiful countenance, or one more subdued to settled quiet. "ailie," said james, "this is maister john, the young doctor; rab's friend, ye ken. we often speak aboot you, doctor." she smiled and made a movement, but said nothing, and prepared to come down, putting her plaid aside and rising. had solomon, in all his glory, been handing down the queen of sheba at his palace gate, he could not have done it more daintily, more tenderly, more like a gentleman than james, the howland carrier, when he lifted down ailie, his wife. the contrast of his small, swarthy, weather-beaten, keen, worldly face to hers--pale, subdued, and beautiful--was something wonderful. rab looked on concerned and puzzled, but ready for anything that might turn up, were it to strangle the nurse, the porter, or even me. ailie and he seemed great friends. "as i was sayin', she's got a kind o' trouble in her breest, doctor; wull ye tak' a look at it?" we walked into the consulting-room, all four; rab, grim and comic, willing to be happy and confidential if cause should be shown, willing also to be the reverse on the same terms. ailie sat down, undid her open gown and her lawn handkerchief round her neck, and, without a word, showed me her right breast. i looked at it and examined it carefully, she and james watching me, and rab eying all three. what could i say? there it was, that had once been so soft, so shapely, so white, so gracious and bountiful, so "full of all blessed condition," hard as a stone, a centre of horrid pain, making that pale face, with its gray, lucid, reasonable eyes, and its sweet, resolved mouth, express the full measure of suffering overcome. why was that gentle, modest, sweet woman, clean and lovable, condemned by god to bear such a burden? i got her away to bed. "may rab and me bide?" said james. "_you_ may; and rab, if he will behave himself." "i'se warrant he's do that, doctor." and in slunk the faithful beast. there are no such dogs now. he belonged to a lost tribe. as i have said, he was brindled, and gray like rubislaw granite; his hair short, hard, and close, like a lion's; his body thick-set, like a little bull--a sort of compressed hercules of a dog. he must have been ninety pounds' weight, at the least; he had a large, blunt head; his muzzle black as night; his mouth blacker than any night; a tooth or two--being all he had--gleaming out of his jaws of darkness. his head was scarred with the records of old wounds, a sort of series of fields of battles all over it; one eye out, one ear cropped as close as was archbishop leighton's father's; the remaining eye had the power of two; and above it, and in constant communication with it, was a tattered rag of an ear, which was forever unfurling itself, like an old flag; and then that bud of a tail, about one inch long, if it could in any sense be said to be long, being as broad as long--the mobility, the instantaneousness of that bud were very funny and surprising, and its expressive twinklings and winkings, the intercommunications between the eye, the ear, and it, were of the oddest and swiftest. rab had the dignity and simplicity of great size; and, having fought his way all along the road to absolute supremacy, he was as mighty in his own line as julius caesar or the duke of wellington, and had the gravity of all great fighters. you must have often observed the likeness of certain men to certain animals, and of certain dogs to men. now, i never looked at rab without thinking of the great baptist preacher, andrew fuller. the same large, heavy, menacing, combative, sombre, honest countenance, the same deep, inevitable eye; the same look, as of thunder asleep, but ready--neither a dog nor a man to be trifled with. next day my master, the surgeon, examined ailie. there could be no doubt it must kill her, and soon. if it could be removed--it might never return--it would give her speedy relief--she should have it done. she curtsied, looked at james, and said, "when?" "to-morrow," said the kind surgeon--a man of few words. she and james and rab and i retired. i noticed that he and she spoke little, but seemed to anticipate everything in each other. the following day, at noon, the students came in, hurrying up the great stair. at the first landing-place, on a small, well-known blackboard, was a bit of paper fastened by wafers, and many remains of old wafers beside it. on the paper were the words: "an operation to-day.--j.b., _clerk_." up ran the youths, eager to secure good places; in they crowded, full of interest and talk. "what's the case?" "which side is it?" don't think them heartless; they are neither better nor worse than you or i; they get over their professional horrors, and into their proper work; and in them pity, as an _emotion_, ending in itself or at best in tears and a long-drawn breath, lessens, while pity, as a _motive_, is quickened, and gains power and purpose. it is well for poor human nature that it is so. the operating-theatre is crowded; much talk and fun, and all the cordiality and stir of youth. the surgeon with his staff of assistants is there. in comes ailie; one look at her quiets and abates the eager students. that beautiful old woman is too much for them; they sit down, and are dumb, and gaze at her. these rough boys feel the power of her presence. she walks in quietly, but without haste; dressed in her mutch, her neckerchief, her white dimity short-gown, her black bombazeen petticoat, showing her white worsted stockings and her carpet shoes. behind her was james with rab. james sat down in the distance, and took that huge and noble head between his knees. rab looked perplexed and dangerous--forever cocking his ear and dropping it as fast. ailie stepped up on a seat, and laid herself on the table, as her friend the surgeon told her; arranged herself, gave a rapid look at james, shut her eyes, rested herself on me, and took my hand. the operation was at once begun; it was necessarily slow; and chloroform--one of god's best gifts to his suffering children--was then unknown. the surgeon did his work. the pale face showed its pain, but was still and silent. rab's soul was working within him; he saw something strange was going on, blood flowing from his mistress, and she suffering; his ragged ear was up and importunate; he growled and gave now and then a sharp, impatient yelp; he would have liked to have done something to that man. but james had him firm, and gave him a _glower_ from time to time, and an intimation of a possible kick; all the better for james--it kept his eye and his mind off ailie. it is over; she is dressed, steps gently and decently down from the table, looks for james; then turning to the surgeon and the students, she curtsies, and in a low, clear voice, begs their pardon if she has behaved ill. the students--all of us--wept like children; the surgeon wrapped her up carefully, and, resting on james and me, ailie went to her room, and rab followed. we put her to bed. james took off his heavy shoes, crammed with tackets, heel-capped and toe-capped, and put them carefully under the table, saying: "maister john, i'm for nane o' yer strynge nurse bodies for ailie. i'll be her nurse, and i'll gang aboot on my stockin' soles as canny as pussy." and so he did; and handy and clever, and swift and tender as any woman was that horny-handed, snell, peremptory little man. everything she got he gave her; he seldom slept; and often i saw his small, shrewd eyes out of the darkness, fixed on her. as before, they spoke little. rab behaved well, never moving, showing us how meek and gentle he could be, and occasionally, in his sleep, letting us know that he was demolishing some adversary. he took a walk with me every day, generally to the candlemaker row; but he was sombre and mild; declined doing battle, though some fit cases offered, and indeed submitted to sundry indignities; and was always very ready to turn, and came faster back, and trotted up the stair with much lightness, and went straight to that door. jess, the mare, had been sent, with her weather-beaten cart, to howgate, and had doubtless her own dim and placid meditations and confusions on the absence of her master and rab and her unnatural freedom from the road and her cart. for some days ailie did well. the wound healed "by the first intention"; for as james said, "oor ailie's skin's ower clean to beil." the students came in quiet and anxious, and surrounded her bed. she said she liked to see their young, honest faces. the surgeon dressed her, and spoke to her in his own short, kind way, pitying her through his eyes, rab and james outside the circle--rab being now reconciled, and even cordial, and having made up his mind that as yet nobody required worrying, but, as you may suppose, _semper paratus_. so far well; but, four days after the operation, my patient had a sudden and long shivering, a "groosin," as she called it. i saw her soon after; her eyes were too bright, her cheek colored; she was restless, and ashamed of being so; the balance was lost; mischief had begun. on looking at the wound, a blush of red told the secret; her pulse was rapid, her breathing anxious and quick; she wasn't herself, as she said, and was vexed at her restlessness. we tried what we could. james did everything, was everywhere, never in the way, never out of it; rab subsided under the table into a dark place, and was motionless, all but his eye, which followed every one. ailie got worse; began to wander in her mind, gently; was more demonstrative in her ways to james, rapid in her questions, and sharp at times. he was vexed, and said, "she was never that way afore, no, never." for a time she knew her head was wrong, and was always asking our pardon--the dear, gentle old woman; then delirium set in strong, without pause. her brain gave way, and then came that terrible spectacle, "the intellectual power, through words and things, went sounding on, a dim and perilous way"; she sang bits of old songs and psalms, stopping suddenly, mingling the psalms of david and the diviner words of his son and lord with homely odds and ends of ballads. nothing more touching, or in a sense more strangely beautiful, did i ever witness. her tremulous, rapid, affectionate, eager, scotch voice--the swift, aimless, bewildered mind, the baffled utterance, the bright and perilous eye; some wild words, some household cares, something for james, the names of the dead, rab called rapidly and in a "fremyt" voice, and he starting up, surprised, and slinking off as if he were to blame somehow, or had been dreaming he heard. many eager questions and beseechings which james and i could make nothing of, and on which she seemed to set her all, and then sink back ununderstood. it was very sad, but better than many things that are not called sad. james hovered about, put out and miserable, but active and exact as ever; read to her, when there was a lull, short bits from the psalms, prose and metre, chanting the latter in his own rude and serious way, showing great knowledge of the fit words, bearing up like a man, and doating over her as his "ain ailie." "ailie, ma woman!" "ma ain bonnie wee dawtie!" the end was drawing on; the golden bowl was breaking; the silver cord was fast being loosed--that _animula, blandula, vagula, hospes, comesque_, was about to flee. the body and the soul--companions for sixty years--were being sundered and taking leave. she was walking, alone, through the valley of that shadow into which one day we must all enter--and yet she was not alone, for we know whose rod and staff were comforting her. one night she had fallen quiet, and, as we hoped, asleep; her eyes were shut. we put down the gas, and sat watching her. suddenly she sat up in bed, and, taking a bedgown which was lying on it rolled up, she held it eagerly to her breast--to the right side. we could see her eyes bright with a surprising tenderness and joy, bending over this bundle of clothes. she held it as a woman holds her sucking child; opening out her night-gown impatiently, and holding it close and brooding over it and murmuring foolish little words, as over one whom his mother comforteth, and who sucks and is satisfied. it was pitiful and strange to see her wasted, dying look, keen and yet vague--her immense love. "preserve me!" groaned james, giving way. and then she rocked back and forward, as if to make it sleep, hushing it, and wasting on it her infinite fondness. "wae's me, doctor; i declare she's thinkin' it's that bairn." "what bairn?" "the only bairn we ever had; our wee mysie, and she's in the kingdom forty years and mair." it was plainly true; the pain in the breast, telling its urgent story to a bewildered, ruined brain, was misread and mistaken; it suggested to her the uneasiness of a breast full of milk, and then the child; and so again once more they were together, and she had her ain wee mysie on her bosom. this was the close. she sank rapidly; the delirium left her; but, as she whispered, she was "clean silly"; it was the lightening before the final darkness. after having for some time lain still, her eyes shut, she said, "james!" he came close to her, and, lifting up her calm, clear, beautiful eyes, she gave him a long look, turned to me kindly but shortly, looked for rab but could not see him, then turned to her husband again, as if she would never leave off looking, shut her eyes, and composed herself. she lay for some time breathing quick, and passed away so gently that, when we thought she was gone, james, in his old-fashioned way, held the mirror to her face. after a long pause, one small spot of dimness was breathed out; it vanished away, and never returned, leaving the blank, clear darkness without a stain. "what is our life? it is even as a vapor, which appeareth for a little time, and then vanisheth away." rab all this time had been full awake and motionless; he came forward beside us; ailie's hand, which james had held, was hanging down; it was soaked with his tears; rab licked it all over carefully, looked at her, and returned to his place under the table. james and i sat, i don't know how long, but for some time. saying nothing, he started up abruptly, and with some noise went to the table, and, putting his right fore and middle fingers each into a shoe, pulled them out and put them on, breaking one of the leather latchets, and muttering in anger, "i never did the like o' that afore!" i believe he never did; nor after either. "rab!" he said, roughly, and, pointing with his thumb to the bottom of the bed. rab leaped up and settled himself, his head and eye to the dead face. "maister john, ye'll wait for me," said the carrier; and disappeared in the darkness, thundering down-stairs in his heavy shoes. i ran to a front window; there he was, already round the house and out at the gate, fleeing like a shadow. i was afraid about him, and yet not afraid; so i sat down beside rab, and, being wearied, fell asleep. i awoke from a sudden noise outside. it was november, and there had been a heavy fall of snow. rab was _in statu quo_; he heard the noise, too, and plainly knew it, but never moved. i looked out; and there, at the gate, in the dim morning--for the sun was not up--was jess and the cart, a cloud of steam rising from the old mare. i did not see james; he was already at the door, and came up the stairs and met me. it was less than three hours since he left, and he must have posted out--who knows how?--to howgate, full nine miles off, yoked jess, and driven her astonished into town. he had an armful of blankets, and was streaming with perspiration. he nodded to me, and spread out on the floor two pairs of clean old blankets having at their corners, "a.g., <UNK> in large letters in red worsted. these were the initials of alison graeme, and james may have looked in at her from without--himself unseen but not unthought of--when he was "wat, wat, and weary," and, after having walked many a mile over the hills, may have seen her sitting, while "a' the lave were sleeping," and by the firelight working her name on the blankets for her ain james's bed. he motioned rab down, and, taking his wife in his arms, laid her in the blankets, and happed her carefully and firmly up, leaving the face uncovered; and then, lifting her, he nodded again sharply to me, and with a resolved but utterly miserable face strode along the passage and down-stairs, followed by rab. i followed with a light; but he didn't need it. i went out, holding stupidly the candle in my hand in the calm, frosty air; we were soon at the gate. i could have helped him, but i saw he was not to be meddled with, and he was strong, and did not need it. he laid her down as tenderly, as safely, as he had lifted her out ten days before--as tenderly as when he had her first in his arms when she was only "a.g."--sorted her, leaving that beautiful sealed face open to the heavens; and then, taking jess by the head, he moved away. he did not notice me, neither did rab, who presided behind the cart. i stood till they passed through the long shadow of the college and turned up nicolson street. i heard the solitary cart sound through the streets, and die away and come again; and i returned, thinking of that company going up libberton brae, then along roslin muir, the morning light touching the pentlands, and making them like onlooking ghosts; then down the hill through auchindinny woods, past "haunted woodhouselee"; and as daybreak came sweeping up the bleak lammermuirs, and fell on his own door, the company would stop, and james would take the key, and lift ailie up again, laying her on her own bed, and, having put jess up, would return with rab and shut the door. james buried his wife, with his neighbors mourning, rab watching the proceedings from a distance. it was snow, and that black, ragged hole would look strange in the midst of the swelling, spotless cushion of white. james looked after everything; then rather suddenly fell ill, and took to bed; was insensible when the doctor came, and soon died. a sort of low fever was prevailing in the village, and his want of sleep, his exhaustion, and his misery made him apt to take it. the grave was not difficult to reopen. a fresh fall of snow had again made all things white and smooth; rab once more looked on, and slunk home to the stable. and what of rab? i asked for him next week at the new carrier who got the good-will of james's business and was now master of jess and her cart. "how's rab?" he put me off, and said, rather rudely, "what's _your_ business wi' the dowg?" i was not to be so put off. "where's rab?" he, getting confused and red, and intermeddling with his hair, said, "'deed, sir, rab's deid." "dead! what did he die of?" "weel, sir," said he, getting redder, "he didna' exactly dee; he was killed. i had to brain him wi' a rack-pin; there was nae doin' wi' him. he lay in the treviss wi' the mear, and wadna come oot. i tempit him wi' kail and meat, but he wad tak naething, and keepit me frae feeding the beast, and he was aye gurrin', and grup, gruppin' me by the legs. i was laith to mak' awa' wi' the auld dowg, his like wasna atween this and thornhill--but, 'deed, sir, i could do naething else." i believed him. fit end for rab, quick and complete. his teeth and his friends gone, why should he keep the peace and be civil? he was buried in the braeface, near the burn, the children of the village, his companions, who used to make very free with him and sit on his ample stomach as he lay half asleep at the door in the sun, watching the solemnity. the boots at the holly-tree inn _charles dickens_ <UNK> where had he been in his time? he repeated, when i asked him the question, lord, he had been everywhere! and what had he been? bless you, he had been everything you could mention, a'most! seen a good deal? why, of course he had. i should say so, he could assure me, if i only knew about a twentieth part of what had come in _his_ way. why, it would be easier for him, he expected, to tell what he hadn't seen than what he had. ah! a deal, it would. what was the curiousest thing he had seen? well! he didn't know. he couldn't momently name what was the curiousest thing he had seen--unless it was a unicorn--and he see _him_ once at a fair. but supposing a young gentleman not eight year old was to run away with a fine young woman of seven, might i think _that_ a queer start? certainly. then that was a start as he himself had had his blessed eyes on, and he had cleaned the shoes they run away in--and they was so little he couldn't get his hand into 'em. master harry walmers' father, you see, he lived at the elmses, down away by shooter's hill there, six or seven miles from lunnon. he was a gentleman of spirit, and good-looking, and held his head up when he walked, and had what you call fire about him. he wrote poetry, and he rode, and he ran, and he cricketed, and he danced, and he acted, and he done it all equally beautiful. he was uncommon proud of master harry as was his only child; but he didn't spoil him neither. he was a gentleman that had a will of his own and a eye of his own, and that would be minded. consequently, though he made quite a companion of the fine bright boy, and was delighted to see him so fond of reading his fairy-books, and was never tired of hearing him say my name is norval, or hearing him sing his songs about young may moons is beaming love, and when he as adores thee has left but the name, and that; still he kept the command over the child, and the child _was_ a child, and it's to be wished more of 'em was. how did boots happen to know all this? why, through being under-gardener. of course he couldn't be under-gardener, and he always about, in the summer-time, near the windows on the lawn, a-mowing, and sweeping, and weeding, and pruning, and this and that, without getting acquainted with the ways of the family. even supposing master harry hadn't come to him one morning early, and said, "cobbs, how should you spell norah, if you was asked?" and then began cutting it in print all over the fence. he couldn't say that he had taken particular notice of children before that; but really it was pretty to see them two mites a-going about the place together, deep in love. and the courage of the boy! bless your soul, he'd have throwed off his little hat, and tucked up his little sleeves, and gone in at a lion, he would, if they had happened to meet one, and she had been frightened of him. one day he stops, along with her, where boots was hoeing weeds in the gravel, and says, speaking up, "cobbs," he says, "i like _you." "do_ you, sir? i'm proud to hear it." "yes, i do, cobbs. why do i like you, do you think, cobbs?" "don't know, master harry, i am sure." "because norah likes you, cobbs." "indeed, sir? that's very gratifying." "gratifying, cobbs? it's better than millions of the brightest diamonds to be liked by norah." "certainly, sir." "would you like another situation, cobbs?" "well, sir, i shouldn't object if it was a good 'un." "then, cobbs," says he, "you shall be our head gardener when we are married." and he tucks her, in her little sky-blue mantle, under his arm, and walks away. boots could assure me that it was better than a picter, and equal to a play, to see them babies, with their long, bright, curling hair, their sparkling eyes, and their beautiful light tread, a-rambling about the garden, deep in love. boots was of opinion that the birds believed they was birds, and kept up with 'em, singing to please 'em. sometimes they would creep under the tulip-tree, and would sit there with their arms round one another's necks, and their soft cheeks touching, a-reading about the prince and the dragon, and the good and bad enchanters, and the king's fair daughter. sometimes he would hear them planning about a house in a forest, keeping bees and a cow, and living entirely on milk and honey. once he came upon them by the pond, and heard master harry say, "adorable norah, kiss me, and say you love me to distraction, or i'll jump in head foremost." and boots made no question he would have done it if she hadn't complied. on the whole, boots said it had a tendency to make him feel he was in love himself--only he didn't exactly know who with. "cobbs," said master harry, one evening, when cobbs was watering the flowers, "i am going on a visit, this present midsummer, to my grandmamma's at york." "are you, indeed, sir? i hope you'll have a pleasant time. i am going into yorkshire, myself, when i leave here." "are you going to your grandmamma's, cobbs?" "no, sir. i haven't got such a thing." "not as a grandmamma, cobbs?" "no, sir." the boy looked on at the watering of the flowers for a little while, and then said, "i shall be very glad indeed to go, cobbs--norah's going." "you'll be all right, then, sir," says cobbs, "with your beautiful sweetheart by your side." "cobbs," returned the boy, flushing, "i never let anybody joke about it when i can prevent them." "it wasn't a joke, sir," says cobbs, with humility--"wasn't so meant." "i am glad of that, cobbs, because i like you, you know, and you're going to live with us. cobbs!" "sir." "what do you think my grandmamma gives me when i go down there?" "i couldn't so much as make a guess, sir." "a bank-of-england five-pound note, cobbs." "whew!" says cobbs, "that's a spanking sum of money, master harry." "a person could do a great deal with such a sum of money as that--couldn't a person, cobbs?" "i believe you, sir!" "cobbs," said the boy, "i'll tell you a secret. at norah's house they have been joking her about me, and pretending to laugh at our being engaged--pretending to make game of it, cobbs!" "such, sir," says cobbs, "is the depravity of human natur'." the boy, looking exactly like his father, stood for a few minutes with his glowing face toward the sunset, and then departed with, "good-night, cobbs. i'm going in." if i was to ask boots how it happened that he was a-going to leave that place just at that present time, well, he couldn't rightly answer me. he did suppose he might have stayed there till now if he had been anyways inclined. but you see, he was younger then, and he wanted change. that's what he wanted--change. mr. walmers, he said to him when he gave him notice of his intentions to leave, "cobbs," he says, "have you anythink to complain of? i make the inquiry, because if i find that any of my people really has anythink to complain of, i wish to make it right if i can." "no, sir," says cobbs; "thanking you, sir, i find myself as well sitiwated here as i could hope to be anywheres. the truth is, sir, that i'm a-going to seek my fortun'." "oh, indeed, cobbs!" he says; "i hope you may find it." and boots could assure me--which he did, touching his hair with his bootjack, as a salute in the way of his present calling--that he hadn't found it yet. well, sir! boots left the elmses when his time was up, and master harry, he went down to the old lady's at york, which old lady would have given that child the teeth out of her head (if she had had any), she was so wrapped up in him. what does that infant do--for infant you may call him, and be within the mark--but cut away from that old lady's with his norah, on a expedition to go to gretna green and be married! sir, boots was at this identical holly-tree inn (having left it several times to better himself, but always come back through one thing or another), when, one summer afternoon, the coach drives up, and out of the coach gets them two children. the guard says to our governor, "i don't quite make out these little passengers, but the young gentleman's words was, that they was to be brought here." the young gentleman gets out; hands his lady out; gives the guard something for himself; says to our governor, "we're to stop here to-night, please. sitting-room and two bedrooms will be required. chops and cherry-pudding for two!" and tucks her in her little sky-blue mantle, under his arm, and walks into the house much bolder than brass. boots leaves me to judge what the amazement of that establishment was, when these two tiny creatures all alone by themselves was marched into the angel--much more so when he, who had seen them without their seeing him, give the governor his views upon the expedition they was upon. "cobbs," says the governor, "if this is so, i must set off myself to york, and quiet their friends' minds. in which case you must keep your eye upon 'em, and humor 'em till i come back. but before i take these measures, cobbs, i should wish you to find from themselves whether your opinions is correct." "sir, to you," says cobbs, "that shall be done directly." so boots goes up-stairs to the angel, and there he finds master harry, on a e'normous sofa--immense at any time, but looking like the great bed of ware, compared with him--a-drying the eyes of miss norah with his pocket-hankecher. their little legs was entirely off the ground, of course, and it really is not possible for boots to express to me how small them children looked. "it's cobbs! it's cobbs!" cries master harry, and comes running to him on t'other side, and catching hold of his t'other hand, and they both jump for joy. "i see you a-getting out, sir," says cobbs. "i thought it was you. i thought i couldn't be mistaken in your height and figure. what's the object of your journey, sir? matrimonial?" "we're going to be married, cobbs, at gretna green," returned the boy. "we have run away on purpose. norah has been in rather low spirits, cobbs; but she'll be happy, now we have found you to be our friend." "thank you, sir, and thank _you_, miss," says cobbs, "for your good opinion. _did_ you bring any luggage with you, sir?" if i will believe boots when he gives me his word and honor upon it, the lady had got a parasol, a smelling-bottle, a round and a half of cold buttered toast, eight peppermint drops, and a hair-brush--seemingly a doll's. the gentleman had got about half a dozen yards of string, a knife, three or four sheets of writing-paper, folded up surprising small, a orange, and a chaney mug with his name upon it. "what may be the exact nature of your plans, sir?" says cobbs. "to go on," replied the boy--which the courage of that boy was something wonderful!--"in the morning, and be married to-morrow." "just so, sir," says cobbs. "would it meet your views, sir, if i was to accompany you?" when cobbs said this, they both jumped for joy again, and cried out, "oh yes, yes, cobbs! yes!" "well, sir!" says cobbs. "if you will excuse me having the freedom to give an opinion, what i should recommend would be this. i am acquainted with a pony, sir, which, put in a pheayton that i could borrow, would take you and mrs. harry walmers, junior (myself driving, if you approved), to the end of your journey in a very short space of time. i am not altogether sure, sir, that this pony will be at liberty to-morrow, but even if you had to wait over to-morrow for him, it might be worth your while. as to the small account here, sir, in case you was to find yourself running at all short, that don't signify; because i am a part proprietor of this inn, and it could stand over." boots assures me that when they clapped their hands, and jumped for joy again, and called him "good cobbs!" and "dear cobbs!" and bent across him to kiss one another in the delight of their confiding hearts, he felt himself the meanest rascal for deceiving 'em that ever was born. "is there anything you want just at present, sir?" says cobbs, mortally ashamed of himself. "we should like some cakes after dinner," answered master harry, folding his arms, putting out one leg, and looking straight at him, "and two apples and jam. with dinner we should like to have toast and water. but norah has always been accustomed to half a glass of currant wine at dessert. and so have i." "it shall be ordered at the bar, sir," says cobbs; and away he went. boots has the feeling as fresh upon him this moment of speaking as he had then, that he would far rather have had it out in half a dozen rounds with the governor than have combined with him; and that he wished with all his heart there was any impossible place where two babies could make an impossible marriage, and live impossibly happy ever afterward. however, as it couldn't be, he went into the governor's plans, and the governor set off for york in half an hour. the way in which the women of that house--without exception--every one of 'em--married _and_ single--took to that boy when they heard the story, boots considers surprising. it was as much as he could do to keep 'em from dashing into the room and kissing him. they climbed up all sorts of places, at the risk of their lives, to look at him through a pane of glass. they was seven deep at the keyhole. they was out of their minds about him and his bold spirit. in the evening, boots went into the room to see how the runaway couple was getting on. the gentleman was on the window-seat, supporting the lady in his arms. she had tears upon her face, and was lying, very tired and half asleep, with her head upon his shoulder. "mrs. harry walmers, junior, fatigued, sir?" says cobbs. "yes, she is tired, cobbs; but she is not used to be away from home, and she has been in low spirits again. cobbs, do you think you could bring a biffin, please?" "i ask your pardon, sir," says cobbs. "what was it you--" "i think a norfolk biffin would rouse her, cobbs. she is very fond of them." boots withdrew in search of the required restorative, and, when he brought it in, the gentleman handed it to the lady, and fed her with a spoon, and took a little himself; the lady being heavy with sleep, and rather cross. "what should you think, sir," says cobbs, "of a chamber candlestick?" the gentleman approved; the chambermaid went first, up the great staircase; the lady, in her sky-blue mantle, followed, gallantly escorted by the gentleman; the gentleman embraced her at her door, and retired to his own apartment, where boots softly locked him in. boots couldn't but feel with increased acuteness what a base deceiver he was, when they consulted him at breakfast (they had ordered sweet milk-and-water, and toast and currant jelly, over-night) about the pony. it really was as much as he could do, he don't mind confessing to me, to look them two young things in the face, and think what a wicked old father of lies he had grown up to be. howsomever, he went on a-lying like a trojan about the pony. he told 'em that it did so unfortunately happen that the pony was half clipped, you see, and that he couldn't be taken out in that state, for fear it should strike to his inside. but that he'd be finished clipping in the course of the day, and that to-morrow morning at eight o'clock the pheayton would be ready. boots' view of the whole case, looking back on it in my room, is, that mrs. harry walmers, junior, was beginning to give in. she hadn't had her hair curled when she went to bed, and she didn't seem quite up to brushing it herself, and its getting in her eyes put her out. but nothing put out master harry. he sat behind his breakfast-cup, a-tearing away at the jelly, as if he had been his own father. after breakfast boots is inclined to consider they drawed soldiers--at least he knows that many such was found in the fireplace, all on horseback. in the course of the morning master harry rang the bell--it was surprising how that there boy did carry on--and said, in a sprightly way, "cobbs, is there any good walks in this neighborhood?" "yes, sir," says cobbs. "there's love lane." "get out with you, cobbs!"--that was that there boy's expression--"you're joking." "begging your pardon, sir," says cobbs, "there _really is_ love lane. and a pleasant walk it is, and proud shall i be to show it to yourself and mrs. harry walmers, junior." "norah, dear," says master harry, "this is curious. we really ought to see love lane. put on your bonnet, my sweetest darling, and we will go there with cobbs." boots leaves me to judge what a beast he felt himself to be, when that young pair told him, as they all three jogged along together, that they had made up their minds to give him two thousand guineas a year as head gardener, on account of his being so true a friend to 'em. boots could have wished at the moment that the earth would have opened and swallowed him up, he felt so mean, with their beaming eyes a-looking at him, and believing him. well, sir, he turned the conversation as well as he could, and he took 'em down love lane to the water-meadows, and there master harry would have drowned himself in half a moment more, a-getting out a water-lily for her--but nothing daunted that boy. well, sir, they was tired out. all being so new and strange to 'em, they was tired as tired could be. and they laid down on a bank of daisies, like the children in the wood, leastways meadows, and fell asleep. boots don't know--perhaps i do--but never mind, it don't signify either way--why it made a man fit to make a fool of himself to see them two pretty babies a-lying there in the clear, still day, not dreaming half so hard when they was asleep as they done when they was awake. but, lord! when you come to think of yourself, you know, and what a game you have been up to ever since you was in your own cradle, and what a poor sort of chap you are, and how it's always either yesterday with you, or to-morrow, and never to-day, that's where it is! well, sir, they woke up at last, and then one thing was getting pretty clear to boots--namely, that mrs. harry walmerses, junior's, temper was on the move. when master harry took her round the waist, she said he "teased her so"; and when he says, "norah, my young may moon, your harry tease you?" she tells him, "yes; and i want to go home." a biled fowl and baked bread-and-butter pudding brought mrs. walmers up a little; but boots could have wished, he must privately own to me, to have seen her more sensible of the woice of love, and less abandoning of herself to currants. however, master harry, he kept up, and his noble heart was as fond as ever. mrs. walmers turned very sleepy about dusk, and began to cry. therefore, mrs. walmers went off to bed as per yesterday; and master harry ditto repeated. about eleven or twelve at night comes back the governor in a chaise, along with mr. walmers and a elderly lady. mr. walmers looks amused and very serious, both at once, and says to our missis: "we are much indebted to you, ma'am; for your kind care of our little children, which we can never sufficiently acknowledge. pray, ma'am, where is my boy?" our missis says: "cobbs has the dear child in charge, sir. cobbs, show forty!" then he says to cobbs: "ah, cobbs, i am glad to see _you_! i understood you was here!" and cobbs says: "yes, sir. your most obedient, sir." i may be surprised to hear boots say it, perhaps; but boots assures me that his heart beat like a hammer, going up-stairs. "i beg your pardon, sir," says he, while unlocking the door; "i do hope you are not angry with master harry. for master harry is a fine boy, sir, and will do you credit and honor." and boots signifies to me that, if the fine boy's father had contradicted him in the daring state of mind in which he then was, he thinks he should have "fetched him a crack," and taken the consequences. but mr. walmers only says: "no, cobbs. no, my good fellow. thank you!" and, the door being opened, goes in. boots goes in, too, holding the light, and he sees mr. walmers go up to the bedside, bend gently down, and kiss the little sleeping face. then he stands looking at it for a minute, looking wonderfully like it (they do say he ran away with mrs. walmers); and then he gently shakes the little shoulder. "harry, my dear boy! harry!" master harry starts up and looks at him. looks at cobbs, too. such is the honor of that mite, that he looks at cobbs, to see whether he has brought him into trouble. "i'm not angry, my child. i only want you to dress yourself and come home." "yes, pa." master harry dresses himself quickly. his breast begins to swell when he has nearly finished, and it swells more and more as he stands, at last, a-looking at his father; his father standing a-looking at him, the quiet image of him. "please may i"--the spirit of that little creatur', and the way he kept his rising tears down!--"please, dear pa--may i--kiss norah before i go?" "you may, my child." so he takes master harry in his hand, and boots leads the way with the candle, and they come to that other bedroom, where the elderly lady is seated by the bed, and poor little mrs. harry walmers, junior, is fast asleep. there the father lifts the child up to the pillow, and he lays his little face down for an instant by the little warm face of poor unconscious little mrs. harry walmers, junior, and gently draws it to him--a sight so touching to the chambermaids, who are peeping through the door, that one of them called out, "it's a shame to part 'em!" but this chambermaid was always, as boots informs us, a softhearted one. not that there was any harm in that girl. far from it. finally, boots says, that's all about it. mr. walmers drove away in the chaise, having hold of master harry's hand. the elderly lady and mrs. walmers, junior, that was never to be (she married a captain long afterward, and died in india), went off next day. in conclusion, boots puts it to me whether i hold with him in two opinions: firstly, that there are not many couples on their way to be married who are half as innocent of guile as those two children; secondly, that it would be a jolly good thing for a great many couples on their way to be married, if they could only be stopped in time, and brought back separately. a story of seven <UNK> [footnote <UNK> from _amos kilbright and other stories_. <UNK> _frank r. stockton_ <UNK> the negro church which stood in the pine woods near the little village of oxford cross roads, in one of the lower counties of virginia, was presided over by an elderly individual, known to the community in general as uncle pete; but on sundays the members of his congregation addressed him as brudder pete. he was an earnest and energetic man, and, although he could neither read nor write, he had for many years expounded the scriptures to the satisfaction of his hearers. his memory was good, and those portions of the bible, which from time to time he had heard read, were used by him, and frequently with powerful effect, in his sermons. his interpretations of the scriptures were generally entirely original, and were made to suit the needs, or what he supposed to be the needs, of his congregation. whether as "uncle pete" in the garden and corn-field, or "brudder pete" in the church, he enjoyed the good opinion of everybody excepting one person, and that was his wife. she was a high-tempered and somewhat dissatisfied person, who had conceived the idea that her husband was in the habit of giving too much time to the church, and too little to the acquisition of corn-bread and pork. on a certain saturday she gave him a most tremendous scolding, which so affected the spirits of the good man that it influenced his decision in regard to the selection of the subject for his sermon the next day. his congregation was accustomed to being astonished, and rather liked it, but never before had their minds received such a shock as when the preacher announced the subject of his discourse. he did not take any particular text, for this was not his custom, but he boldly stated that the bible declared that every woman in this world was possessed by seven devils; and the evils which this state of things had brought upon the world, he showed forth with much warmth and feeling. subject-matter, principally from his own experience, crowded in upon his mind, and he served it out to his audience hot and strong. if his deductions could have been proved to be correct, all women were creatures who, by reason of their sevenfold diabolic possession, were not capable of independent thought or action, and who should in tears and humility place themselves absolutely under the direction and authority of the other sex. when he approached the conclusion of his sermon, brother peter closed with a bang the bible, which, although he could not read a word of it, always lay open before him while he preached, and delivered the concluding exhortation of his sermon. "now, my dear brev'ren ob dis congregation," he said, "i want you to understan' dat dar's nuffin in dis yer sarmon wot you've jus' heerd ter make you think yousefs angels. by no means, brev'ren; you was all brung up by women, an' you've got ter lib wid' em, an ef anythin' in dis yer worl' is ketchin', my dear brev'ren, it's habin debbils, an' from wot i've seen ob some ob de men ob dis worl' i 'spect dey is persest ob 'bout all de debbils dey got room fur. but de bible don' say nuffin p'intedly on de subjec' ob de number ob debbils in man, an' i 'spec' dose dat's got 'em--an' we ought ter feel pow'ful thankful, my dear brev'ren, dat de bible don' say we all's got 'em--has 'em 'cordin to sarcumstances. but wid de women it's dif'rent; dey's got jus' sebin, an' bless my soul, brev'ren, i think dat's 'nuff. "while i was a-turnin' ober in my min' de subjec' ob dis sarmon, dere come ter me a bit ob scripter wot i heerd at a big preachin' an' baptizin' at kyarter's mills, 'bout ten year' ago. one ob de preachers was a-tellin' about ole mudder ebe a-eatin' de apple, and says he: de sarpint fus' come along wid a red apple, an' says he: 'you gib dis yer to your husban', an' he think it so mighty good dat when he done eat it he gib you anything you ax him fur, ef you tell him whar de tree is.' ebe, she took one bite, an' den she frew dat apple away. 'wot you mean, you triflin' sarpint,' says she, 'a fotchin' me dat apple wot ain't good fur nuffin but ter make cider wid?' den de sarpint he go fotch her a yaller apple, an' she took one bite, an' den says she: 'go 'long wid ye, you fool sarpint, wot you fotch me dat june apple wot ain't got no taste to it?' den de sarpint he think she like sumpin' sharp, an' he fotch her a green apple. she takes one bite ob it, an' den she frows it at his head, an' sings out: 'is you 'spectin' me to gib dat apple to yer uncle adam an' gib him de colic?' den de debbil he fotch her a lady-apple, but she say she won't take no sich triflin' nubbins as dat to her husban', an' she took one bite ob it, an' frew it away. den he go fotch her two udder kin' ob apples, one yaller wid red stripes, an' de udder one red on one side an' green on de udder--mighty good-lookin' apples, too--de kin' you git two dollars a bar'l fur at the store. but ebe, she wouldn't hab neider ob 'em, an' when she done took one bite out ob each one, she frew it away. den de ole debbil-sarpint, he scratch he head, an' he say to hese'f: 'dis yer ebe, she pow'ful 'ticklar 'bout her apples. reckin i'll have ter wait till after fros', an' fotch her a real good one,' an' he done wait till after fros', and then he fotch her a' albemarle pippin, an' when she took one bite ob dat, she jus' go 'long an' eat it all up, core, seeds, an' all. 'look h'yar, sarpint,' says she, 'hab you got anudder ob dem apples in your pocket?' an' den he tuk one out, an' gib it to her. ''cuse me,' says she, 'i's gwine ter look up adam, an' ef he don' want ter know war de tree is wot dese apples grow on, you can hab him fur a corn-field han'.' "an' now, my dear brev'ren," said brother peter, "while i was a-turnin' dis subjec' ober in my min', an' wonderin' how de women come ter hab jus' seben debbils apiece, i done reckerleck dat bit ob scripter wot i heerd at kyarter's mills, an' i reckon dat 'splains how de debbils got inter woman. de sarpint he done fotch mudder ebe seben apples, an' ebery one she take a bite out of gib her a debbil." as might have been expected, this sermon produced a great sensation, and made a deep impression on the congregation. as a rule, the men were tolerably well satisfied with it; and when the services were over many of them made it the occasion of shy but very plainly pointed remarks to their female friends and relatives. but the women did not like it at all. some of them became angry, and talked very forcibly, and feelings of indignation soon spread among all the sisters of the church. if their minister had seen fit to stay at home and preach a sermon like this to his own wife (who, it may be remarked, was not present on this occasion), it would have been well enough, provided he had made no allusions to outsiders; but to come there and preach such things to them was entirely too much for their endurance. each one of the women knew she had not seven devils, and only a few of them would admit of the possibility of any of the others being possessed by quite so many. their preacher's explanation of the manner in which every woman came to be possessed of just so many devils appeared to them of little importance. what they objected to was the fundamental doctrine of his sermon, which was based on his assertion that the bible declared every woman had seven devils. they were not willing to believe that the bible said any such thing. some of them went so far as to state it was their opinion that uncle pete had got this fool notion from some of the lawyers at the court-house when he was on a jury a month or so before. it was quite noticeable that, although sunday afternoon had scarcely begun, the majority of the women of the congregation called their minister uncle pete. this was very strong evidence of a sudden decline in his popularity. some of the more vigorous-minded women, not seeing their minister among the other people in the clearing in front of the log church, went to look for him, but he was not to be found. his wife had ordered him to be home early, and soon after the congregation had been dismissed he departed by a short cut through the woods. that afternoon an irate committee, composed principally of women, but including also a few men who had expressed disbelief in the new doctrine, arrived at the cabin of their preacher, but found there only his wife, cross-grained old aunt rebecca. she informed them that her husband was not at home. "he's done 'gaged hisse'f," she said, "ter cut an' haul wood fur kunnel martin ober on little mount'n fur de whole ob nex' week. it's fourteen or thirteen mile' from h'yar, an' ef he'd started ter-morrer mawnm', he'd los' a'mos' a whole day. 'sides dat, i done tole him dat ef he git dar ter-night he'd have his supper frowed in. wot you all want wid him? gwine to pay him fur preachin'?" any such intention as this was instantaneously denied, and aunt rebecca was informed of the subject upon which her visitors had come to have a very plain talk with her husband. strange to say, the announcement of the new and startling dogma had apparently no disturbing effect upon aunt rebecca. on the contrary, the old woman seemed rather to enjoy the news. "reckin he oughter know all 'bout dat," she said. "he's done had three wives, an' he ain't got rid o' dis one yit." judging from her chuckles and waggings of the head when she made this remark, it might be imagined that aunt rebecca was rather proud of the fact that her husband thought her capable of exhibiting a different kind of diabolism every day in the week. the leader of the indignant church-members was susan henry; a mulatto woman of a very independent turn of mind. she prided herself that she never worked in anybody's house but her own, and this immunity from outside service gave her a certain pre-eminence among her sisters. not only did susan share the general resentment with which the startling statement of old peter had been received, but she felt that its promulgation had affected her position in the community. if every woman was possessed by seven devils, then, in this respect, she was no better nor worse than any of the others; and at this her proud heart rebelled. if the preacher had said some women had eight devils and others six, it would have been better. she might then have made a mental arrangement in regard to her relative position which would have somewhat consoled her. but now there was no chance for that. the words of the preacher had equally debased all women. a meeting of the disaffected church-members was held the next night at susan henry's cabin, or rather in the little yard about it, for the house was not large enough to hold the people who attended it. the meeting was not regularly organized, but everybody said what he or she had to say, and the result was a great deal of clamor, and a general increase of indignation against uncle pete. "look h'yar!" cried susan, at the end of some energetic remarks, "is dar enny pusson h'yar who kin count up figgers?" inquiries on the subject ran through the crowd, and in a few moments a black boy, about fourteen, was pushed forward as an expert in arithmetic. "now, you jim," said susan, "you's been, to school, an' you kin count up figgers. 'cordin' ter de chu'ch books dar's forty-seben women b'longin' to our meetin', an' ef each one ob dem dar has got seben debbils in her, i jus' wants you ter tell me how many debbils come to chu'ch ebery clear sunday ter hear dat ole uncle pete preach." this view of the case created a sensation, and much interest was shown in the result of jim's calculations, which were made by the aid of a back of an old letter and a piece of pencil furnished by susan. the result was at last announced as three hundred and nineteen, which, although not precisely correct, was near enough to satisfy the company. "now, you jus' turn dat ober in you all's minds," said susan. "more'n free hundred debbils in chu'ch ebery sunday, an' we women fotchin 'em. does anybody s'pose i's gwine ter b'lieve dat fool talk?" a middle-aged man now lifted up his voice and said: "i's been thinkin' ober dis h'yar matter and i's 'cluded dat p'r'aps de words ob de preacher was used in a figgeratous form o' sense. p'r'aps de seben debbils meant chillun." these remarks were received with no favor by the assemblage. "oh, you git out!" cried susan. "your ole woman's got seben chillun, shore 'nuf, an' i s'pec' dey's all debbils. but dem sent'ments don't apply ter all de udder women h'yar, 'tic'larly ter dem dar young uns wot ain't married yit." this was good logic, but the feeling on the subject proved to be even stronger, for the mothers in the company became so angry at their children being considered devils that for a time there seemed to be danger of an amazonian attack on the unfortunate speaker. this was averted, but a great deal of uproar now ensued, and it was the general feeling that something ought to be done to show the deep-seated resentment with which the horrible charge against the mothers and sisters of the congregation had been met. many violent propositions were made, some of the younger men going so far as to offer to burn down the church. it was finally agreed, quite unanimously, that old peter should be unceremoniously ousted from his place in the pulpit which he had filled so many years. as the week passed on, some of the older men of the congregation who had friendly feelings toward their old companion and preacher talked the matter over among themselves, and afterward, with many of their fellow-members, succeeded at last in gaining the general consent that uncle pete should be allowed a chance to explain himself, and give his grounds and reasons for his astounding statement in regard to womankind. if he could show biblical authority for this, of course nothing more could be said. but if he could not, then he must get down from the pulpit, and sit for the rest of his life on a back seat of the church. this proposition met with the more favor, because even those who were most indignant had an earnest curiosity to know what the old man would say for himself. during all this time of angry discussion, good old peter was quietly and calmly cutting and hauling wood on the little mountain. his mind was in a condition of great comfort and peace, for not only had he been able to rid himself, in his last sermon, of many of the hard thoughts concerning women that had been gathering themselves together for years, but his absence from home had given him a holiday from the harassments of aunt rebecca's tongue, so that no new notions of woman's culpability had risen within him. he had dismissed the subject altogether, and had been thinking over a sermon regarding baptism, which he thought he could make convincing to certain of the younger members of his congregation. he arrived at home very late on saturday night, and retired to his simple couch without knowing anything of the terrible storm which had been gathering through the week, and which was to burst upon him on the morrow. but the next morning, long before church time, he received warning enough of what was going to happen. individuals and deputations gathered in and about his cabin--some to tell him all that had been said and done; some to inform him what was expected of him; some to stand about and look at him; some to scold; some to denounce; but, alas! not one to encourage; nor one to call him "brudder pete," that sunday appellation dear to his ears. but the old man possessed a stubborn soul, not easily to be frightened. "wot i says in de pulpit," he remarked, "i'll 'splain in de pulpit, an' you all ud better git 'long to de chu'ch, an' when de time fur de sarvice come, i'll be dar." this advice was not promptly acted upon, but in the course of half an hour nearly all the villagers and loungers had gone off to the church in the woods; and when uncle peter had put on his high black hat, somewhat battered, but still sufficiently clerical looking for that congregation, and had given something of a polish to his cowhide shoes, he betook himself by the accustomed path to the log building where he had so often held forth to his people. as soon as he entered the church he was formally instructed by a committee of the leading members that before he began to open the services, he must make it plain to the congregation that what he had said on the preceding sunday about every woman being possessed by seven devils was scripture truth, and not mere wicked nonsense out of his own brain. if he could not do that, they wanted no more praying or preaching from him. uncle peter made no answer, but, ascending the little pulpit, he put his hat on the bench behind him where it was used to repose, took out his red cotton handkerchief and blew his nose in his accustomed way, and looked about him. the house was crowded. even aunt rebecca was there. after a deliberate survey of his audience, the preacher spoke: "brev'eren an' sisters, i see afore me brudder bill hines, who kin read de bible, an' has got one. ain't dat so, brudder?" bill hines having nodded and modestly grunted assent, the preacher continued. "an' dars' ann' priscilla's boy, jake, who ain't a brudder yit, though he's plenty old 'nuf, min', i tell ye; an' he kin read de bible, fus' rate, an' has read it ter me ober an' ober ag'in. ain't dat so, jake?" jake grinned, nodded, and hung his head, very uncomfortable at being thus publicly pointed out. "an' dar's good ole aun' patty, who knows more scripter dan ennybuddy h'yar, havin' been teached by de little gals from kunnel jasper's an' by dere mudders afore 'em. i reckin she know' de hull bible straight froo, from de garden of eden to de new jerus'lum. an' dar are udders h'yar who knows de scripters, some one part an' some anudder. now i axes ebery one ob you all wot know de scripters ef he don' 'member how de bible tells how our lor' when he was on dis yearth cas' seben debbils out o' mary magdalum?" a murmur of assent came from the congregation, most of them remembered that. "but did enny ob you ebber read, or hab read to you, dat he ebber cas' 'em out o' enny udder woman?" negative grunts and shakes of the head signified that nobody had ever heard of this. "well, den," said the preacher, gazing blandly around, "all de udder women got 'em yit." a deep silence fell upon the assembly, and in a few moments an elderly member arose. "brudder pete," he said, "i reckin you mought as well gib out de hyme." a dog's <UNK> [footnote <UNK> <UNK> _mark twain_ <UNK> i my father was a st. bernard, my mother was a collie, but i am a presbyterian. this is what my mother told me; i do not know these nice distinctions myself. to me they are only fine large words meaning nothing. my mother had a fondness for such; she liked to say them, and see other dogs look surprised and envious, as wondering how she got so much education. but, indeed, it was not real education; it was only show: she got the words by listening in the dining-room and drawing-room when there was company, and by going with the children to sunday-school and listening there; and whenever she heard a large word she said it over to herself many times, and so was able to keep it until there was a dogmatic gathering in the neighborhood, then she would get it off, and surprise and distress them all, from pocket-pup to mastiff, which rewarded her for all her trouble. if there was a stranger he was nearly sure to be suspicious, and when he got his breath again he would ask her what it meant. and she always told him. he was never expecting this, but thought he would catch her; so when she told him, he was the one that looked ashamed, whereas he had thought it was going to be she. the others were always waiting for this, and glad of it and proud of her, for they knew what was going to happen, because they had had experience. when she told the meaning of a big word they were all so taken up with admiration that it never occurred to any dog to doubt if it was the right one; and that was natural, because, for one thing, she answered up so promptly that it seemed like a dictionary speaking, and for another thing, where could they find out whether it was right or not? for she was the only cultivated dog there was. by-and-by, when i was older, she brought home the word unintellectual, one time, and worked it pretty hard all the week at different gatherings, making much unhappiness and despondency; and it was at this time that i noticed that during that week she was asked for the meaning at eight different assemblages, and flashed out a fresh definition every time, which showed me that she had more presence of mind than culture, though i said nothing, of course. she had one word which she always kept on hand, and ready, like a life-preserver, a kind of emergency word to strap on when she was likely to get washed overboard in a sudden way--that was the word synonymous. when she happened to fetch out a long word which had had its day weeks before and its prepared meanings gone to her dump-pile, if there was a stranger there of course it knocked him groggy for a couple of minutes, then he would come to, and by that time she would be away down the wind on another tack, and not expecting anything; so when he'd hail and ask her to cash in, i (the only dog on the inside of her game) could see her canvas flicker a moment,--but only just a moment,--then it would belly out taut and full, and she would say, as calm as a summer's day, "it's synonymous with supererogation," or some godless long reptile of a word like that, and go placidly about and skim away on the next tack, perfectly comfortable, you know, and leave that stranger looking profane and embarrassed, and the initiated slatting the floor with their tails in unison and their faces transfigured with a holy joy. and it was the same with phrases. she would drag home a whole phrase, if it had a grand sound, and play it six nights and two matinees, and explain it a new way every time,--which she had to, for all she cared for was the phrase; she wasn't interested in what it meant, and knew those dogs hadn't wit enough to catch her, anyway. yes, she was a daisy! she got so she wasn't afraid of anything, she had such confidence in the ignorance of those creatures. she even brought anecdotes that she had heard the family and the dinner guests laugh and shout over; and as a rule she got the nub of one chestnut hitched onto another chestnut, where, of course, it didn't fit and hadn't any point; and when she delivered the nub she fell over and rolled on the floor and laughed and barked in the most insane way, while i could see that she was wondering to herself why it didn't seem as funny as it did when she first heard it. but no harm was done; the others rolled and barked too, privately ashamed of themselves for not seeing the point, and never suspecting that the fault was not with them and there wasn't any to see. you can see by these things that she was of a rather vain and frivolous character; still, she had virtues, and enough to make up, i think. she had a kind heart and gentle ways, and never harbored resentments for injuries done her, but put them easily out of her mind and forgot them; and she taught her children her kindly way, and from her we learned also to be brave and prompt in time of danger, and not to run away, but face the peril that threatened friend or stranger, and help him the best we could without stopping to think what the cost might be to us. and she taught us, not by words only, but by example, and that is the best way and the surest and the most lasting. why, the brave things she did, the splendid things! she was just a soldier; and so modest about it--well, you couldn't help admiring her, and you couldn't help imitating her; not even a king charles spaniel could remain entirely despicable in her society. so, as you see, there was more to her than her education. ii when i was well grown, at last, i was sold and taken away, and i never saw her again. she was broken-hearted, and so was i, and we cried; but she comforted me as well as she could, and said we were sent into this world for a wise and good purpose, and must do our duties without repining, take our life as we might find it, live it for the best good of others, and never mind about the results; they were not our affair. she said men who did like this would have a noble and beautiful reward by-and-by in another world, and although we animals would not go there, to do well and right without reward would give to our brief lives a worthiness and dignity which in itself would be a reward. she had gathered these things from time to time when she had gone to the sunday-school with the children, and had laid them up in her memory more carefully than she had done with those other words and phrases; and she had studied them deeply, for her good and ours. one may see by this that she had a wise and thoughtful head, for all there was so much lightness and vanity in it. so we said our farewells, and looked our last upon each other through our tears; and the last thing she said--keeping it for the last to make me remember it the better, i think--was, "in memory of me, when there is a time of danger to another do not think of yourself, think of your mother, and do as she would do." do you think i could forget that? no. iii it was such a charming home!--my new one; a fine great house, with pictures, and delicate decorations, and rich furniture, and no gloom anywhere, but all the wilderness of dainty colors lit up with flooding sunshine; and the spacious grounds around it, and the great garden--oh, greensward, and noble trees, and flowers, no end! and i was the same as a member of the family; and they loved me, and petted me, and did not give me a new name, but called me by my old one that was dear to me because my mother had given it me--aileen mavourneen. she got it out of a song; and the grays knew that song, and said it was a beautiful name. mrs. gray was thirty, and so sweet and so lovely, you cannot imagine it; and sadie was ten, and just like her mother, just a darling slender little copy of her, with auburn tails down her back, and short frocks; and the baby was a year old, and plump and dimpled, and fond of me, and never could get enough of hauling on my tail, and hugging me, and laughing out its innocent happiness; and mr. gray was thirty-eight, and tall and slender and handsome, a little bald in front, alert, quick in his movements, businesslike, prompt, decided, unsentimental, and with that kind of trim-chiselled face that just seems to glint and sparkle with frosty intellectuality! he was a renowned scientist. i do not know what the word means, but my mother would know how to use it and get effects. she would know how to depress a rat-terrier with it and make a lap-dog look sorry he came. but that is not the best one; the best one was laboratory. my mother could organize a trust on that one that would skin the tax-collars off the whole herd. the laboratory was not a book, or a picture, or a place to wash your hands in, as the college president's dog said--no, that is the lavatory; the laboratory is quite different, and is filled with jars, and bottles, and electrics, and wires, and strange machines; and every week other scientists came there and sat in the place, and used the machines, and discussed, and made what they called experiments and discoveries; and often i came, too, and stood around and listened, and tried to learn, for the sake of my mother, and in loving memory of her, although it was a pain to me, as realizing what she was losing out of her life and i gaining nothing at all; for try as i might, i was never able to make anything out of it at all. other times i lay on the floor in the mistress's workroom and slept, she gently using me for a footstool, knowing it pleased me, for it was a caress; other times i spent an hour in the nursery, and got well tousled and made happy; other times i watched by the crib there, when the baby was asleep and the nurse out for a few minutes on the baby's affairs; other times i romped and raced through the grounds and the garden with sadie till we were tired out, then slumbered on the grass in the shade of a tree while she read her book; other times i went visiting among the neighbor dogs,--for there were some most pleasant ones not far away, and one very handsome and courteous and graceful one, a curly haired irish setter by the name of robin adair, who was a presbyterian like me, and belonged to the scotch minister. the servants in our house were all kind to me and were fond of me, and so, as you see, mine was a pleasant life. there could not be a happier dog than i was, nor a gratefuller one. i will say this for myself, for it is only the truth: i tried in all ways to do well and right, and honor my mother's memory and her teachings, and earn the happiness that had come to me, as best i could. by-and-by came my little puppy, and then my cup was full, my happiness was perfect. it was the dearest little waddling thing, and so smooth and soft and velvety, and had such cunning little awkward paws, and such affectionate eyes, and such a sweet and innocent face; and it made me so proud to see how the children and their mother adored it, and fondled it, and exclaimed over every little wonderful thing it did. it did seem to me that life was just too lovely to-- then came the winter. one day i was standing a watch in the nursery. that is to say, i was asleep on the bed. the baby was asleep in the crib, which was alongside the bed, on the side next the fireplace. it was the kind of crib that has a lofty tent over it made of a gauzy stuff that you can see through. the nurse was out, and we two sleepers were alone. a spark from the wood-fire was shot out, and it lit on the slope of the tent. i suppose a quiet interval followed, then a scream from the baby woke me, and there was that tent flaming up toward the ceiling! before i could think, i sprang to the floor in my fright, and in a second was half-way to the door; but in the next half-second my mother's farewell was sounding in my ears, and i was back on the bed again. i reached my head through the flames and dragged the baby out by the waistband, and tugged it along, and we fell to the floor together in a cloud of smoke; i snatched a new hold, and dragged the screaming little creature along and out at the door and around the bend of the hall, and was still tugging away, all excited and happy and proud, when the master's voice shouted: "begone, you cursed beast!" and i jumped to save myself; but he was wonderfully quick, and chased me up, striking furiously at me with his cane, i dodging this way and that, in terror, and at last a strong blow fell upon my left fore-leg, which made me shriek and fall, for the moment, helpless; the cane went up for another blow, but never descended, for the nurse's voice rang wildly out, "the nursery's on fire!" and the master rushed away in that direction, and my other bones were saved. the pain was cruel, but, no matter, i must not lose any time; he might come back at any moment; so i limped on three legs to the other end of the hall, where there was a dark little stairway leading up into a garret where old boxes and such things were kept, as i had heard say, and where people seldom went. i managed to climb up there, then i searched my way through the dark among the piles of things, and hid in the secretest place i could find. it was foolish to be afraid there, yet still i was; so afraid that i held in and hardly even whimpered, though it would have been such a comfort to whimper, because that eases the pain, you know. but i could lick my leg, and that did me some good. for half an hour there was a commotion down-stairs, and shoutings, and rushing footsteps, and then there was quiet again. quiet for some minutes, and that was grateful to my spirit, for then my fears began to go down; and fears are worse than pains,--oh, much worse. then came a sound that froze me! they were calling me--calling me by name--hunting for me! it was muffled by distance, but that could not take the terror out of it, and it was the most dreadful sound to me that i had ever heard. it went all about, everywhere, down there: along the halls, through all the rooms, in both stories, and in the basement and the cellar; then outside, and further and further away--then back, and all about the house again, and i thought it would never, never stop. but at last it did, hours and hours after the vague twilight of the garret had long ago been blotted out by black darkness. then in that blessed stillness my terror fell little by little away, and i was at peace and slept. it was a good rest i had, but i woke before the twilight had come again. i was feeling fairly comfortable, and i could think out a plan now. i made a very good one; which was, to creep down, all the way down the back stairs, and hide behind the cellar door, and slip out and escape when the iceman came at dawn, while he was inside filling the refrigerator; then i would hide all day, and start on my journey when night came; my journey to--well, anywhere where they would not know me and betray me to the master. i was feeling almost cheerful now; then suddenly i thought, why, what would life be without my puppy! that was despair. there was no plan for me; i saw that; i must stay where i was; stay, and wait, and take what might come--it was not my affair; that was what life is--my mother had said it. then--well, then the calling began again! all my sorrows came back. i said to myself, the master will never forgive. i did not know what i had done to make him so bitter and so unforgiving, yet i judged it was something a dog could not understand, but which was clear to a man and dreadful. they called and called--days and nights, it seemed to me. so long that the hunger and thirst near drove me mad, and i recognized that i was getting very weak. when you are this way you sleep a great deal, and i did. once i woke in an awful fright--it seemed to me that the calling was right there in the garret! and so it was: it was sadie's voice, and she was crying; my name was falling from her lips all broken, poor thing, and i could not believe my ears for the joy of it when i heard her say, "come back to us--oh, come back to us, and forgive--it is all so sad without our--" i broke in with _such_ a grateful little yelp, and the next moment sadie was plunging and stumbling through the darkness and the lumber and shouting for the family to hear, "she's found! she's found!" the days that followed--well, they were wonderful. the mother and sadie and the servants--why, they just seemed to worship me. they couldn't seem to make me a bed that was fine enough; and as for food, they couldn't be satisfied with anything but game and delicacies that were out of season; and every day the friends and neighbors flocked in to hear about my heroism--that was the name they called it by, and it means agriculture. i remember my mother pulling it on a kennel once, and explaining it that way, but didn't say what agriculture was, except that it was synonymous with intramural incandescence; and a dozen times a day mrs. gray and sadie would tell the tale to new-comers, and say i risked my life to save the baby's, and both of us had burns to prove it, and then the company would pass me around and pet me and exclaim about me, and you could see the pride in the eyes of sadie and her mother; and when the people wanted to know what made me limp, they looked ashamed and changed the subject, and sometimes when people hunted them this way and that way with questions about it, it looked to me as if they were going to cry. and this was not all the glory; no, the master's friends came, a whole twenty of the most distinguished people, and had me in the laboratory, and discussed me as if i was a kind of discovery; and some of them said it was wonderful in a dumb beast, the finest exhibition of instinct they could call to mind; but the master said, with vehemence, "it's far above instinct; it's _reason_, and many a man, privileged to be saved and go with you and me to a better world by right of its possession, has less of it than this poor silly quadruped that's foreordained to perish"; and then he laughed, and said, "why, look at me--i'm a sarcasm! bless you, with all my grand intelligence, the only thing i inferred was that the dog had gone mad and was destroying the child, whereas but for the beast's intelligence--it's _reason_, i tell you!--the child would have perished!" they disputed and disputed, and _i_ was the very centre and subject of it all, and i wished my mother could know that this grand honor had come to me; it would have made her proud. then they discussed optics, as they called it, and whether a certain injury to the brain would produce blindness or not, but they could not agree about it, and said they must test it by experiment by-and-by; and next they discussed plants, and that interested me, because in the summer sadie and i had planted seeds--i helped her dig the holes, you know,--and after days and days a little shrub or a flower came up there, and it was a wonder how that could happen; but it did, and i wished i could talk,--i would have told those people about it and shown them how much i knew, and been all alive with the subject; but i didn't care for the optics; it was dull, and when they came back to it again it bored me, and i went to sleep. pretty soon it was spring, and sunny and pleasant and lovely, and the sweet mother and the children patted me and the puppy good-bye, and went away on a journey and a visit to their kin, and the master wasn't any company for us, but we played together and had good times, and the servants were kind and friendly, so we got along quite happily and counted the days and waited for the family. and one day those men came again, and said now for the test, and they took the puppy to the laboratory, and i limped three-leggedly along, too, feeling proud, for any attention shown the puppy was a pleasure to me, of course. they discussed and experimented, and then suddenly the puppy shrieked, and they set him on the floor, and he went staggering around, with his head all bloody, and the master clapped his hands, and shouted: "there, i've won--confess it! he's as blind as a bat!" and they all said, "it's so--you've proved your theory, and suffering humanity owes you a great debt from henceforth," and they crowded around him, and wrung his hand cordially and thankfully, and praised him. but i hardly saw or heard these things, for i ran at once to my little darling, and snuggled close to it where it lay, and licked the blood, and it put its head against mine, whimpering softly, and i knew in my heart it was a comfort to it in its pain and trouble to feel its mother's touch, though it could not see me. then it drooped down, presently, and its little velvet nose rested upon the floor, and it was still, and did not move any more. soon the master stopped discussing a moment, and rang in the footman, and said, "bury it in the far corner of the garden," and then went on with the discussion, and i trotted after the footman, very happy and grateful, for i knew the puppy was out of its pain now, because it was asleep. we went far down the garden to the furthest end, where the children and the nurse and the puppy and i used to play in the summer in the shade of a great elm, and there the footman dug a hole, and i saw he was going to plant the puppy, and i was glad, because it would grow and come up a fine handsome dog, like robin adair, and be a beautiful surprise for the family when they came home; so i tried to help him dig, but my lame leg was no good, being stiff, you know, and you have to have two, or it is no use. when the footman had finished and covered little robin up, he patted my head, and there were tears in his eyes, and he said, "poor little doggie, you saved _his_ child." i have watched two whole weeks, and he doesn't come up! this last week a fright has been stealing upon me. i think there is something terrible about this. i do not know what it is, but the fear makes me sick, and i cannot eat, though the servants bring me the best of food; and they pet me so, and even come in the night, and cry, and say, "poor doggie--do give it up and come home; _don't_ break our hearts!" and all this terrifies me the more, and makes me sure something has happened. and i am so weak; since yesterday i cannot stand on my feet any more. and within this hour the servants, looking toward the sun where it was sinking out of sight and the night chill coming on, said things i could not understand, but they carried something cold to my heart. "those poor creatures! they do not suspect. they will come home in the morning, and eagerly ask for the little doggie that did the brave deed, and who of us will be strong enough to say the truth to them: 'the humble little friend is gone where go the beasts that perish.'" the outcasts of poker <UNK> [footnote <UNK> from _the luck of roaring camp_. <UNK> _bret harte_ <UNK> as mr. john oakhurst, gambler, stepped into the main street of poker flat on the morning of the <UNK> of november, <UNK> he was conscious of a change in its moral atmosphere since the preceding night. two or three men, conversing earnestly together, ceased as he approached, and exchanged significant glances. there was a sabbath lull in the air, which, in a settlement unused to sabbath influences, looked ominous. mr. oakhurst's calm, handsome face betrayed small concern in these indications. whether he was conscious of any predisposing cause was another question. "i reckon they're after somebody," he reflected; "likely it's me." he returned to his pocket the handkerchief with which he had been whipping away the red dust of poker flat from his neat boots, and quietly discharged his mind of any further conjecture. in point of fact, poker flat was "after somebody." it had lately suffered the loss of several thousand dollars, two valuable horses, and a prominent citizen. it was experiencing a spasm of virtuous reaction, quite as lawless and ungovernable as any of the acts that had provoked it. a secret committee had determined to rid the town of all improper persons. this was done permanently in regard of two men who were then hanging from the boughs of a sycamore in the gulch, and temporarily in the banishment of certain other objectionable characters. i regret to say that some of these were ladies. it is but due to the sex, however, to state that their impropriety was professional, and it was only in such easily established standards of evil that poker flat ventured to sit in judgment. mr. oakhurst was right in supposing that he was included in this category. a few of the committee had urged hanging him as a possible example, and a sure method of reimbursing themselves from his pockets of the sums he had won from them. "it's agin justice," said jim wheeler, "to let this yer young man from roaring camp--an entire stranger--carry away our money." but a crude sentiment of equity residing in the breasts of those who had been fortunate enough to win from mr. oakhurst overruled this narrower local prejudice. mr. oakhurst received his sentence with philosophic calmness, none the less coolly that he was aware of the hesitation of his judges. he was too much of a gambler not to accept fate. with him life was at best an uncertain game, and he recognized the usual percentage in favor of the dealer. a body of armed men accompanied the deported wickedness of poker flat to the outskirts of the settlement. besides mr. oakhurst, who was known to be a coolly desperate man, and for whose intimidation the armed escort was intended, the expatriated party consisted of a young woman familiarly known as the "duchess"; another who had won the title of "mother shipton"; and "uncle billy," a suspected sluice-robber and confirmed drunkard. the cavalcade provoked no comments from the spectators, nor was any word uttered by the escort. only when the gulch which marked the uttermost limit of poker flat was reached, the leader spoke briefly and to the point. the exiles were forbidden to return at the peril of their lives. as the escort disappeared, their pent-up feelings found vent in a few hysterical tears from the duchess, some bad language from mother shipton, and a parthian volley of expletives from uncle billy. the philosophic oakhurst alone remained silent. he listened calmly to mother shipton's desire to cut somebody's heart out, to the repeated statements of the duchess that she would die in the road, and to the alarming oaths that seemed to be bumped out of uncle billy as he rode forward. with the easy good-humor characteristic of his class, he insisted upon exchanging his own riding-horse, "five spot," for the sorry mule which the duchess rode. but even this act did not draw the party into any closer sympathy. the young woman readjusted her somewhat draggled plumes with a feeble, faded coquetry; mother shipton eyed the possessor of "five spot" with malevolence, and uncle billy included the whole party in one sweeping anathema. the road to sandy bar--a camp that, not having as yet experienced the regenerating influences of poker flat, consequently seemed to offer some invitation to the emigrants--lay over a steep mountain range. it was distant a day's severe travel. in that advanced season, the party soon passed out of the moist, temperate regions of the foot-hills into the dry, cold, bracing air of the sierras. the trail was narrow and difficult. at noon the duchess, rolling out of her saddle upon the ground, declared her intention of going no farther, and the party halted. the spot was singularly wild and impressive. a wooded amphitheatre, surrounded on three sides by precipitous cliffs of naked granite, sloped gently toward the crest of another precipice that overlooked the valley. it was, undoubtedly, the most suitable spot for a camp, had camping been advisable. but mr. oakhurst knew that scarcely half the journey to sandy bar was accomplished; and the party were not equipped or provisioned for delay. this fact he pointed out to his companions curtly, with a philosophic commentary on the folly of "throwing up their hand before the game was played out." but they were furnished with liquor, which in this emergency stood them in place of food, fuel, rest, and prescience. in spite of his remonstrances, it was not long before they were more or less under its influence. uncle billy passed rapidly from a bellicose state into one of stupor, the duchess became maudlin, and mother shipton snored. mr. oakhurst alone remained erect, leaning against a rock, calmly surveying them. mr. oakhurst did not drink. it interfered with a profession which required coolness, impassiveness, and presence of mind, and, in his own language, he "couldn't afford it." as he gazed at his recumbent fellow-exiles, the loneliness begotten of his pariah-trade, his habits of life, his very vices, for the first time seriously oppressed him. he bestirred himself in dusting his black clothes, washing his hands and face, and other acts characteristic of his studiously neat habits, and for a moment forgot his annoyance. the thought of deserting his weaker and more pitiable companions never perhaps occurred to him. yet he could not help feeling the want of that excitement which, singularly enough, was most conducive to that calm equanimity for which he was notorious. he looked at the gloomy walls that rose a thousand feet sheer above the circling pines around him; at the sky, ominously clouded; at the valley below, already deepening into shadow. and, doing so, suddenly he heard his own name called. a horseman slowly ascended the trail. in the fresh, open face of the new-comer mr. oakhurst recognized tom simson, otherwise known as the "innocent," of sandy bar. he had met him some months before over a "little game," and had, with perfect equanimity, won the entire fortune--amounting to some forty dollars--of that guileless youth. after the game was finished, mr. oakhurst drew the youthful speculator behind the door and thus addressed him: "tommy, you're a good little man, but you can't gamble worth a cent. don't try it over again." he then handed him his money back, pushed him gently from the room, and so made a devoted slave of tom simson. there was a remembrance of this in his boyish and enthusiastic greeting of mr. oakhurst. he had started, he said, to go to poker flat to seek his fortune. "alone?" no, not exactly alone; in fact (a giggle), he had run away with piney woods. didn't mr. oakhurst remember piney? she that used to wait on the table at the temperance house? they had been engaged a long time, but old jake woods had objected, and so they had run away, and were going to poker flat to be married, and here they were. and they were tired out, and how lucky it was they had found a place to camp, and company. all this the innocent delivered rapidly, while piney, a stout, comely damsel of fifteen, emerged from behind the pine-tree where she had been blushing unseen, and rode to the side of her lover. mr. oakhurst seldom troubled himself with sentiment, still less with propriety; but he had a vague idea that the situation was not fortunate. he retained, however, his presence of mind sufficiently to kick uncle billy, who was about to say something, and uncle billy was sober enough to recognize in mr. oakhurst's kick a superior power that would not bear trifling. he then endeavored to dissuade tom simson from delaying further, but in vain. he even pointed out the fact that there was no provision, nor means of making a camp. but, unluckily, the innocent met this objection by assuring the party that he was provided with an extra mule loaded with provisions, and by the discovery of a rude attempt at a log-house near the trail. "piney can stay with mrs. oakhurst," said the innocent, pointing to the duchess, "and i can shift for myself." nothing but mr. oakhurst's admonishing foot saved uncle billy from bursting into a roar of laughter. as it was, he felt compelled to retire up the cañon until he could recover his gravity. there he confided the joke to the tall pine-trees, with many slaps of his leg, contortions of his face, and the usual profanity. but when he returned to the party, he found them seated by a fire--for the air had grown strangely chill and the sky overcast--in apparently amicable conversation. piney was actually talking in an impulsive, girlish fashion to the duchess, who was listening with an interest and animation she had not shown for many days. the innocent was holding forth, apparently with equal effect, to mr. oakhurst and mother shipton, who was actually relaxing into amiability. "is this yer a d---d picnic?" said uncle billy, with inward scorn, as he surveyed the sylvan group, the glancing firelight, and the tethered animals in the foreground. suddenly an idea mingled with the alcoholic fumes that disturbed his brain. it was apparently of a jocular nature, for he felt impelled to slap his leg again and cram his fist into his mouth. as the shadows crept slowly up the mountain, a slight breeze rocked the tops of the pine-trees, and moaned through their long and gloomy aisles. the ruined cabin, patched and covered with pine-boughs, was set apart for the ladies. as the lovers parted they unaffectedly exchanged a kiss, so honest and sincere that it might have been heard above the swaying pines. the frail duchess and the malevolent mother shipton were probably too stunned to remark upon this last evidence of simplicity, and so turned without a word to the hut. the fire was replenished, the men lay down before the door, and in a few minutes were asleep. mr. oakhurst was a light sleeper. toward morning he awoke benumbed and cold. as he stirred the dying fire, the wind, which was now blowing strongly, brought to his cheek that which caused the blood to leave it--snow! he started to his feet with the intention of awakening the sleepers, for there was no time to lose. but turning to where uncle billy had been lying, he found him gone. a suspicion leaped to his brain and a curse to his lips. he ran to the spot where the mules had been tethered; they were no longer there. the tracks were already rapidly disappearing in the snow. the momentary excitement brought mr. oakhurst back to the fire with his usual calm. he did not waken the sleepers. the innocent slumbered peacefully, with a smile on his good-humored, freckled face; the virgin piney slept beside her frailer sisters as sweetly as though attended by celestial guardians, and mr. oakhurst, drawing his blanket over his shoulders, stroked his mustaches and waited for the dawn. it came slowly in a whirling mist of snowflakes, that dazzled and confused the eye. what could be seen of the landscape appeared magically changed. he looked over the valley, and summed up the present and future in two words--"snowed in!" a careful inventory of the provisions, which, fortunately for the party, had been stored within the hut, and so escaped the felonious fingers of uncle billy, disclosed the fact that with care and prudence they might last ten days longer. "that is," said mr. oakhurst, _sotto voce_ to the innocent, "if you're willing to board us. if you ain't--and perhaps you'd better not--you can wait till uncle billy gets back with provisions." for some occult reason, mr. oakhurst could not bring himself to disclose uncle billy's rascality, and so offered the hypothesis that he had wandered from the camp and had accidentally stampeded the animals. he dropped a warning to the duchess and mother shipton, who of course knew the facts of their associate's defection. "they'll find out the truth about us _all_ when they find out anything," he added, significantly, "and there's no good frightening them now." tom simson not only put all his worldly store at the disposal of mr. oakhurst, but seemed to enjoy the prospect of their enforced seclusion. "we'll have a good camp for a week, and then the snow'll melt, and we'll all go back together." the cheerful gayety of the young man and mr. oakhurst's calm infected the others. the innocent, with the aid of pine-boughs, extemporized a thatch for the roofless cabin, and the duchess directed piney in the rearrangement of the interior with a taste and tact that opened the blue eyes of that provincial maiden to their fullest extent. "i reckon now you're used to fine things at poker flat," said piney. the duchess turned away sharply to conceal something that reddened her cheeks through their professional tint, and mother shipton requested piney not to "chatter." but when mr. oakhurst returned from a weary search for the trail, he heard the sound of happy laughter echoed from the rocks. he stopped in some alarm, and his thoughts first naturally reverted to the whiskey, which he had prudently _cachéd_. "and yet it don't somehow sound like whiskey," said the gambler. it was not until he caught sight of the blazing fire through the still blinding storm and the group around it that he settled to the conviction that it was "square fun." whether mr. oakhurst had _cachéd_ his cards with the whiskey as something debarred the free access of the community, i cannot say. it was certain that, in mother shipton's words, he "didn't say cards once," during that evening. haply the time was beguiled by an accordion, produced somewhat ostentatiously by tom simson from his pack. notwithstanding some difficulties attending the manipulation of this instrument, piney woods managed to pluck several reluctant melodies from its keys, to an accompaniment by the innocent on a pair of bone castanets. but the crowning festivity of the evening was reached in a rude camp-meeting hymn, which the lovers, joining hands, sang with great earnestness and vociferation. i fear that a certain defiant tone and covenanter's swing to its chorus, rather than any devotional quality, caused it speedily to infect the others, who at last joined in the refrain: "i'm proud to live in the service of the lord, and i'm bound to die in his army." the pines rocked, the storm eddied and whirled above the miserable group, and the flames of their altar leaped heavenward, as if in token of the vow. at midnight the storm abated, the rolling clouds parted, and the stars glittered keenly above the sleeping camp. mr. oakhurst, whose professional habits had enabled him to live on the smallest possible amount of sleep, in dividing the watch with tom simson, somehow managed to take upon himself the greater part of that duty. he excused himself to the innocent by saying that he had "often been a week without sleep." "doing what?" asked tom. "poker!" replied oakhurst, sententiously; "when a man gets a streak of luck--nigger-luck--he don't get tired. the luck gives in first. luck," continued the gambler, reflectively, "is a mighty queer thing. all you know about it for certain is that it's bound to change. and it's finding out when it's going to change that makes you. we've had a streak of bad luck since we left poker flat--you come along, and slap you get into it, too. if you can hold your cards right along, you're all right. for," added the gambler, with cheerful irrelevance-- "'i'm proud to live in the service of the lord, and i'm bound to die in his army,'" the third day came, and the sun, looking through the white-curtained valley, saw the outcasts divide their slowly decreasing store of provisions for the morning meal. it was one of the peculiarities of that mountain climate that its rays diffused a kindly warmth over the wintry landscape, as if in regretful commiseration of the past. but it revealed drift on drift of snow piled high around the hut--a hopeless, uncharted, trackless sea of white lying below the rocky shores to which the castaways still clung. through the marvellously clear air the smoke of the pastoral village of poker flat rose miles away. mother shipton saw it, and from a remote pinnacle of her rocky fastness hurled in that direction a final malediction. it was her last vituperative attempt, and perhaps for that reason was invested with a certain degree of sublimity. it did her good, she privately informed the duchess. "just you go out there and cuss, and see." she then set herself to the task of amusing "the child," as she and the duchess were pleased to call piney. piney was no chicken, but it was a soothing and original theory of the pair thus to account for the fact that she didn't swear and wasn't improper. when night crept up again through the gorges, the reedy notes of the accordion rose and fell in fitful spasms and long-drawn gasps by the flickering camp-fire. but music failed to fill entirely the aching void left by insufficient food, and a new diversion was proposed by piney--story-telling. neither mr., oakhurst nor his female companions caring to relate their personal experiences, this plan would have failed, too, but for the innocent. some months before he had chanced upon a stray copy of mr. pope's ingenious translation of the _iliad_. he now proposed to narrate the principal incidents of that poem--having thoroughly mastered the argument and fairly forgotten the words--in the current vernacular of sandy bar. and so for the rest of that night the homeric demigods again walked the earth. trojan bully and wily greek wrestled in the winds, and the great pines in the cañon seemed to bow to the wrath of the son of peleus. mr. oakhurst listened with quiet satisfaction. most especially was he interested in the fate of "ash-heels," as the innocent persisted in denominating the "swift-footed achilles." so with small food and much of homer and the accordion, a week passed over the heads of the outcasts. the sun again forsook them, and again from leaden skies the snowflakes were sifted over the land. day by day closer around them drew the snowy circle, until at last they looked from their prison over drifted walls of dazzling white, that towered twenty feet above their heads. it became more and more difficult to replenish their fires, even from the fallen trees beside them, now half hidden in the drifts. and yet no one complained. the lovers turned from the dreary prospect and looked into each other's eyes, and were happy. mr. oakhurst settled himself coolly to the losing game before him. the duchess, more cheerful than she had been, assumed the care of piney. only mother shipton--once the strongest of the party--seemed to sicken and fade. at midnight on the tenth day she called oakhurst to her side. "i'm going," she said, in a voice of querulous weakness, "but don't say anything about it. don't waken the kids. take the bundle from under my head and open it." mr. oakhurst did so. it contained mother shipton's rations for the last week, untouched. "give 'em to the child," she said, pointing to the sleeping piney. "you've starved yourself," said the gambler. "that's what they call it," said the woman, querulously, as she lay down again, and, turning her face to the wall, passed quietly away. the accordion and the bones were put aside that day, and homer was forgotten. when the body of mother shipton had been committed to the snow, mr. oakhurst took the innocent aside and showed him a pair of snow-shoes, which he had fashioned from the old pack-saddle. "there's one chance in a hundred to save her yet," he said, pointing to piney; "but it's there," he added, pointing toward poker flat. "if you can reach there in two days she's safe." "and you?" asked tom simson. "i'll stay here," was the curt reply. the lovers parted with a long embrace. "you are not going, too?" said the duchess, as she saw mr. oakhurst apparently waiting to accompany him. "as far as the cañon," he replied. he turned suddenly and kissed the duchess, leaving her pallid face aflame and her trembling limbs rigid with amazement. night came, but not mr. oakhurst. it brought the storm again and the whirling snow. then the duchess, feeding the fire, found that some one had quietly piled beside the hut enough fuel to last a few days longer. the tears rose to her eyes, but she hid them from piney. the women slept but little. in the morning, looking into each other's faces, they read their fate. neither spoke; but piney, accepting the position of the stronger, drew near and placed her arm around the duchess's waist. they kept this attitude for the rest of the day. that night the storm reached its greatest fury, and, rending asunder the protecting pines, invaded the very hut. toward morning they found themselves unable to feed the fire, which gradually died away. as the embers slowly blackened, the duchess crept closer to piney, and broke the silence of many hours: "piney, can you pray?" "no, dear," said piney, simply. the duchess, without knowing exactly why, felt relieved, and, putting her head upon piney's shoulder, spoke no more. and so reclining, the younger and purer pillowing the head of her soiled sister upon her virgin breast, they fell asleep. the wind lulled as if it feared to waken them. feathery drifts of snow, shaken from the long pine-boughs, flew like white-winged birds, and settled about them as they slept. the moon through the rifted clouds looked down upon what had been the camp. but all human stain, all trace of earthly travail, was hidden beneath the spotless mantle mercifully flung from above. they slept all that day and the next, nor did they waken when voices and footsteps broke the silence of the camp. and when pitying fingers brushed the snow from their wan faces, you could scarcely have told, from the equal peace that dwelt upon them, which was she that had sinned. even the law of poker flat recognized this, and turned away, leaving them still locked in each other's arms. but at the head of the gulch, on one of the largest pine-trees, they found the deuce of clubs pinned to the bark with a bowie-knife. it bore the following, written in pencil, in a firm hand: + beneath this tree lies the body of john oakhurst, who struck a streak of bad luck on the <UNK> of november, <UNK> and handed in his checks on the <UNK> december, <UNK> + and pulseless and cold, with a derringer by his side and a bullet in his heart, though still calm as in life, beneath the snow lay he who was at once the strongest and yet the weakest of the outcasts of poker flat. the three <UNK> [footnote <UNK> from _wessex tales_.] _thomas hardy_ <UNK> among the few features of agricultural england which retain an appearance but little modified by the lapse of centuries, may be reckoned the high, grassy and furzy downs, coombs, or ewe-leases, as they are indifferently called, that fill a large area of certain counties in the south and southwest. if any mark of human occupation is met with hereon, it usually takes the form of the solitary cottage of some shepherd. fifty years ago such a lonely cottage stood on such a down, and may possibly be standing there now. in spite of its loneliness, however, the spot, by actual measurement, was not more than five miles from a county-town. yet that affected it little. five miles of irregular upland, during the long inimical seasons, with their sleets, snows, rains, and mists, afford withdrawing space enough to isolate a timon or a nebuchadnezzar; much less, in fair weather, to please that less repellent tribe, the poets, philosophers, artists, and others who "conceive and meditate of pleasant things." some old earthen camp or barrow, some clump of trees, at least some starved fragment of ancient hedge is usually taken advantage of in the erection of these forlorn dwellings. but, in the present case, such a kind of shelter had been disregarded. higher crowstairs, as the house was called, stood quite detached and undefended. the only reason for its precise situation seemed to be the crossing of two footpaths at right angles hard by, which may have crossed there and thus for a good five hundred years. hence the house was exposed to the elements on all sides. but, though the wind up here blew unmistakably when it did blow, and the rain hit hard whenever it fell, the various weathers of the winter season were not quite so formidable on the coomb as they were imagined to be by dwellers on low ground. the raw rimes were not so pernicious as in the hollows, and the frosts were scarcely so severe. when the shepherd and his family who tenanted the house were pitied for their sufferings from the exposure, they said that upon the whole they were less inconvenienced by "wuzzes and flames" (hoarses and phlegms) than when they had lived by the stream of a snug neighboring valley. the night of march <UNK> <UNK> was precisely one of the nights that were wont to call forth these expressions of commiseration. the level rainstorm smote walls, slopes, and hedges like the clothyard shafts of senlac and crecy. such sheep and outdoor animals as had no shelter stood with their buttocks to the winds; while the tails of little birds trying to roost on some scraggy thorn were blown inside-out like umbrellas. the gable-end of the cottage was stained with wet, and the eavesdroppings flapped against the wall. yet never was commiseration for the shepherd more misplaced. for that cheerful rustic was entertaining a large party in glorification of the christening of his second girl. the guests had arrived before the rain began to fall, and they were all now assembled in the chief or living room of the dwelling. a glance into the apartment at eight o'clock on this eventful evening would have resulted in the opinion that it was as cosy and comfortable a nook as could be wished for in boisterous weather. the calling of its inhabitant was proclaimed by a number of highly-polished sheep crooks without stems that were hung ornamentally over the fireplace, the curl of each shining crook varying from the antiquated type engraved in the patriarchal pictures of old family bibles to the most approved fashion of the last local sheep-fair. the room was lighted by half-a-dozen candles, having wicks only a trifle smaller than the grease which enveloped them, in candlesticks that were never used but at high-days, holy-days, and family feasts. the lights were scattered about the room, two of them standing on the chimney-piece. this position of candles was in itself significant. candles on the chimney-piece always meant a party. on the hearth, in front of a back-brand to give substance, blazed a fire of thorns, that crackled "like the laughter of the fool." nineteen persons were gathered here. of these, five women, wearing gowns of various bright hues, sat in chairs along the wall; girls shy and not shy filled the window-bench; four men, including charley jake the hedge-carpenter, elijah new the parish-clerk, and john pitcher, a neighboring dairyman, the shepherd's father-in-law, lolled in the settle; a young man and maid, who were blushing over tentative _pourparlers_ on a life-companionship, sat beneath the corner-cupboard; and an elderly engaged man of fifty or upward moved restlessly about from spots where his betrothed was not to the spot where she was. enjoyment was pretty general, and so much the more prevailed in being unhampered by conventional restrictions. absolute confidence in each other's good opinion begat perfect ease, while the finishing stroke of manner, amounting to a truly princely serenity, was lent to the majority by the absence of any expression or trait denoting that they wished to get on in the world, enlarge their minds, or do any eclipsing thing whatever--which nowadays so generally nips the bloom and _bonhomie_ of all except the two extremes of the social scale. shepherd fennel had married well, his wife being a dairyman's daughter from a vale at a distance, who brought fifty guineas in her pocket--and kept them there, till they should be required for ministering to the needs of a coming family. this frugal woman had been somewhat exercised as to the character that should be given to the gathering. a sit-still party had its advantages; but an undisturbed position of ease in chairs and settles was apt to lead on the men to such an unconscionable deal of toping that they would sometimes fairly drink the house dry. a dancing-party was the alternative; but this, while avoiding the foregoing objection on the score of good drink, had a counterbalancing disadvantage in the matter of good victuals, the ravenous appetites engendered by the exercise causing immense havoc in the buttery. shepherdess fennel fell back upon the intermediate plan of mingling short dances with short periods of talk and singing, so as to hinder any ungovernable rage in either. but this scheme was entirely confined to her own gentle mind: the shepherd himself was in the mood to exhibit the most reckless phases of hospitality. the fiddler was a boy of those parts, about twelve years of age, who had a wonderful dexterity in jigs and reels, though his fingers were so small and short as to necessitate a constant shifting for the high notes, from which he scrambled back to the first position with sounds not of unmixed purity of tone. at seven the shrill tweedle-dee of this youngster had begun, accompanied by a booming ground-bass from elijah new, the parish-clerk, who had thoughtfully brought with him his favorite musical instrument, the serpent. dancing was instantaneous, mrs. fennel privately enjoining the players on no account to let the dance exceed the length of a quarter of an hour. but elijah and the boy, in the excitement of their position, quite forgot the injunction. moreover, oliver giles, a man of seventeen, one of the dancers, who was enamoured of his partner, a fair girl of thirty-three rolling years, had recklessly handed a new crown-piece to the musicians, as a bribe to keep going as long as they had muscle and wind. mrs. fennel, seeing the steam begin to generate on the countenances of her guests, crossed over and touched the fiddler's elbow and put her hand on the serpent's mouth. but they took no notice, and fearing she might lose her character of genial hostess if she were to interfere too markedly, she retired and sat down helpless. and so the dance whizzed on with cumulative fury, the performers moving in their planet-like courses, direct and retrograde, from apogee to perigee, till the hand of the well-kicked clock at the bottom of the room had travelled over the circumference of an hour. while these cheerful events were in course of enactment within fennel's pastoral dwelling, an incident having considerable bearing on the party had occurred in the gloomy night without. mrs. fennel's concern about the growing fierceness of the dance corresponded in point of time with the ascent of a human figure to the solitary hill of higher crowstairs from the direction of the distant town. this personage strode on through the rain without a pause, following the little-worn path which, further on in its course, skirted the shepherd's cottage. it was nearly the time of full moon, and on this account, though the sky was lined with a uniform sheet of dripping cloud, ordinary objects out of doors were readily visible. the sad wan light revealed the lonely pedestrian to be a man of supple frame; his gait suggested that he had somewhat passed the period of perfect and instinctive agility, though not so far as to be otherwise than rapid of motion when occasion required. at a rough guess, he might have been about forty years of age. he appeared tall, but a recruiting sergeant, or other person accustomed to the judging of men's heights by the eye, would have discerned that this was chiefly owing to his gauntness, and that he was not more than five-feet-eight or nine. notwithstanding the regularity of his tread, there was caution in it, as in that of one who mentally feels his way; and despite the fact that it was not a black coat nor a dark garment of any sort that he wore, there was something about him which suggested that he naturally belonged to the black-coated tribes of men. his clothes were of fustian, and his boots hobnailed, yet in his progress he showed not the mud-accustomed bearing of hobnailed and fustianed peasantry. by the time that he had arrived abreast of the shepherd's premises the rain came down, or rather came along, with yet more determined violence. the outskirts of the little settlement partially broke the force of wind and rain, and this induced him to stand still. the most salient of the shepherd's domestic erections was an empty sty at the forward corner of his hedgeless garden, for in these latitudes the principle of masking the homelier features of your establishment by a conventional frontage was unknown. the traveller's eye was attracted to this small building by the pallid shine of the wet slates that covered it. he turned aside, and, finding it empty, stood under the pent-roof for shelter. while he stood, the boom of the serpent within the adjacent house, and the lesser strains of the fiddler, reached the spot as an accompaniment to the surging hiss of the flying rain on the sod, its louder beating on the cabbage-leaves of the garden, on the eight or ten beehives just discernible by the path, and its dripping from the eaves into a row of buckets and pans that had been placed under the walls of the cottage. for at higher crowstairs, as at all such elevated domiciles, the grand difficulty of housekeeping was an insufficiency of water; and a casual rainfall was utilized by turning out, as catchers, every utensil that the house contained. some queer stories might be told of the contrivances for economy in suds and dishwaters that are absolutely necessitated in upland habitations during the droughts of summer. but at this season there were no such exigencies; a mere acceptance of what the skies bestowed was sufficient for an abundant store. at last the notes of the serpent ceased and the house was silent. this cessation of activity aroused the solitary pedestrian from the reverie into which he had elapsed, and, emerging from the shed, with an apparently new intention, he walked up the path to the house-door. arrived here, his first act was to kneel down on a large stone beside the row of vessels, and to drink a copious draught from one of them. having quenched his thirst, he rose and lifted his hand to knock, but paused with his eye upon the panel. since the dark surface of the wood revealed absolutely nothing, it was evident that he must be mentally looking through the door, as if he wished to measure thereby all the possibilities that a house of this sort might include, and how they might bear upon the question of his entry. in his indecision he turned and surveyed the scene around. not a soul was anywhere visible. the garden-path stretched downward from his feet, gleaming like the track of a snail; the roof of the little well (mostly dry), the well-cover, the top rail of the garden-gate, were varnished with the same dull liquid glaze; while, far away in the vale, a faint whiteness of more than usual extent showed that the rivers were high in the meads. beyond all this winked a few bleared lamplights through the beating drops--lights that denoted the situation of the county-town from which he had appeared to come. the absence of all notes of life in that direction seemed to clinch his intentions, and he knocked at the door. within, a desultory chat had taken the place of movement and musical sound. the hedge-carpenter was suggesting a song to the company, which nobody just then was inclined to undertake, so that the knock afforded a not unwelcome diversion. "walk in!" said the shepherd, promptly. the latch clicked upward, and out of the night our pedestrian appeared upon the door-mat. the shepherd arose, snuffed two of the nearest candles, and turned to look at him. their light disclosed that the stranger was dark in complexion and not unprepossessing as to feature. his hat, which for a moment he did not remove, hung low over his eyes, without concealing that they were large, open, and determined, moving with a flash rather than a glance round the room. he seemed pleased with his survey, and, baring his shaggy head, said, in a rich, deep voice: "the rain is so heavy, friends, that i ask leave to come in and rest awhile." "to be sure, stranger," said the shepherd. "and faith, you've been lucky in choosing your time, for we are having a bit of a fling for a glad cause--though, to be sure, a man could hardly wish that glad cause to happen more than once a year." "nor less," spoke up a woman. "for 'tis best to get your family over and done with, as soon as you can, so as to be all the earlier out of the fag o't." "and what may be this glad cause?" asked the stranger. "a birth and christening," said the shepherd. the stranger hoped his host might not be made unhappy either by too many or two few of such episodes, and being invited by a gesture to a pull at the mug, he readily acquiesced. his manner, which, before entering, had been so dubious, was now altogether that of a careless and candid man. "late to be traipsing athwart this coomb--hey?" said the engaged man of fifty. "late it is, master, as you say.--i'll take a seat in the chimney-corner, if you have nothing to urge against it, ma'am; for i am a little moist on the side that was next the rain." mrs. shepherd fennel assented, and made room for the self-invited comer, who, having got completely inside the chimney-corner, stretched out his legs and arms with the expansiveness of a person quite at home. "yes, i am rather cracked in the vamp," he said freely, seeing that the eyes of the shepherd's wife fell upon his boots, "and i am not well fitted either. i have had some rough times lately, and have been forced to pick up what i can get in the way of wearing, but i must find a suit better fit for working-days when i reach home." "one of hereabouts?" she inquired. "not quite that--further up the country." "i thought so. and so be i; and by your tongue you come from my neighborhood." "but you would hardly have heard of me," he said quickly. "my time would be long before yours, ma'am, you see." this testimony to the youthfulness of his hostess had the effect of stopping her cross-examination. "there is only one thing more wanted to make me happy," continued the new-comer, "and that is a little baccy, which i am sorry to say i am out of." "i'll fill your pipe," said the shepherd. "i must ask you to lend me a pipe likewise." "a smoker, and no pipe about 'ee?" "i have dropped it somewhere on the road." the shepherd filled and handed him a new clay pipe, saying, as he did so, "hand me your baccy-box--i'll fill that too, now i am about it." the man went through the movement of searching his pockets. "lost that too?" said his entertainer, with some surprise. "i am afraid so," said the man with some confusion. "give it to me in a screw of paper." lighting his pipe at the candle with a suction that drew the whole flame into the bowl, he resettled himself in the corner and bent his looks upon the faint steam from his damp legs, as if he wished to say no more. meanwhile the general body of guests had been taking little notice of this visitor by reason of an absorbing discussion in which they were engaged with the band about a tune for the next dance. the matter being settled, they were about to stand up when an interruption came in the shape of another knock at the door. at sound of the same the man in the chimney-corner took up the poker and began stirring the brands as if doing it thoroughly were the one aim of his existence; and a second time the shepherd said, "walk in!" in a moment another man stood upon the straw-woven door-mat. he too was a stranger. this individual was one of a type radically different from the first. there was more of the commonplace in his manner, and a certain jovial cosmopolitanism sat upon his features. he was several years older than the first arrival, his hair being slightly frosted, his eyebrows bristly, and his whiskers cut back from his cheeks. his face was rather full and flabby, and yet it was not altogether a face without power. a few grog-blossoms marked the neighborhood of his nose. he flung back his long drab greatcoat, revealing that beneath it he wore a suit of cinder-gray shade throughout, large heavy seals, of some metal or other that would take a polish, dangling from his fob as his only personal ornament. shaking the water-drops from his low-crowned glazed hat, he said, "i must ask for a few minutes' shelter, comrades, or i shall be wetted to my skin before i get to casterbridge." "make yourself at home, master," said the shepherd, perhaps a trifle less heartily than on the first occasion. not that fennel had the least tinge of niggardliness in his composition; but the room was far from large, spare chairs were not numerous, and damp companions were not altogether desirable at close quarters for the women and girls in their bright-colored gowns. however, the second comer, after taking off his greatcoat, and hanging his hat on a nail in one of the ceiling-beams as if he had been specially invited to put it there, advanced and sat down at the table. this had been pushed so closely into the chimney-corner, to give all available room to the dancers, that its inner edge grazed the elbow of the man who had ensconced himself by the fire; and thus the two strangers were brought into close companionship. they nodded to each other by way of breaking the ice of unacquaintance, and the first stranger handed his neighbor the family mug--a huge vessel of brown ware, having its upper edge worn away like a threshold by the rub of whole generations of thirsty lips that had gone the way of all flesh, and bearing the following inscription burnt upon its rotund side in yellow letters: there is no fun untill i cum. the other man, nothing loth, raised the mug to his lips, and drank on, and on, and on--till a curious blueness overspread the countenance of the shepherd's wife, who had regarded with no little surprise the first stranger's free offer to the second of what did not belong to him to dispense. "i knew it!" said the toper to the shepherd with much satisfaction. "when i walked up your garden before coming in, and saw the hives all of a row, i said to myself, 'where there's bees there's honey, and where there's honey there's mead,' but mead of such a truly comfortable sort as this i really didn't expect to meet in my older days." he took yet another pull at the mug, till it assumed an ominous elevation. "glad you enjoy it!" said the shepherd warmly. "it is goodish mead," assented mrs. fennel, with an absence of enthusiasm which seemed to say that it was possible to buy praise for one's cellar at too heavy a price. "it is trouble enough to make--and really i hardly think we shall make any more. for honey sells well, and we ourselves can make shift with a drop o' small mead and metheglin for common use from the comb-washings." "o, but you'll never have the heart!" reproachfully cried the stranger in cinder-gray, after taking up the mug a third time and setting it down empty. "i love mead, when 'tis old like this, as i love to go to church o' sundays, or to relieve the needy any day of the week." "ha, ha, ha!" said the man in the chimney-corner, who, in spite of the taciturnity induced by the pipe of tobacco, could not or would not refrain from this slight testimony to his comrade's humor. now the old mead of those days, brewed of the purest first-year or maiden honey, four pounds to the gallon--with its due complement of white of eggs, cinnamon, ginger, cloves, mace, rosemary, yeast, and processes of working, bottling, and cellaring--tasted remarkably strong; but it did not taste so strong as it actually was. hence, presently, the stranger in cinder-gray at the table, moved by its creeping influence, unbuttoned his waistcoat, threw himself back in his chair, spread his legs, and made his presence felt in various ways. "well, well, as i say," he resumed, "i am going to casterbridge, and to casterbridge i must go. i should have been almost there by this time; but the rain drove me into your dwelling, and i'm not sorry for it." "you don't live in casterbridge?" said the shepherd. "not as yet; though i shortly mean to move there." "going to set up in trade, perhaps?" "no, no," said the shepherd's wife. "it is easy to see that the gentleman is rich, and don't want to work at anything." the cinder-gray stranger paused, as if to consider whether he would accept that definition of himself. he presently rejected it by answering, "rich is not quite the word for me, dame. i do work, and i must work. and even if i only get to casterbridge by midnight i must begin work there at eight to-morrow morning. yes, het or wet, blow or snow, famine or sword, my day's work to-morrow must be done." "poor man! then, in spite o' seeming, you be off than we." replied the shepherd's wife. "'tis the nature of my trade, men and maidens. tis the nature of my trade more than my poverty.... but really and truly i must up and off, or i shan't get a lodging in the town." however, the speaker did not move, and directly added, "there's time for one more draught of friendship before i go; and i'd perform it at once if the mug were not dry." "here's a mug o' small," said mrs. fennel. "small, we call it, though to be sure 'tis only the first wash o' the combs." "no," said the stranger, disdainfully. "i won't spoil your first kindness by partaking o' your second." "certainly not," broke in fennel. "we don't increase and multiply every day, and i'll fill the mug again." he went away to the dark place under the stairs where the barrel stood. the shepherdess followed him. "why should you do this?" she said, reproachfully, as soon as they were alone. "he's emptied it once, though it held enough for ten people; and now he's not contented wi' the small, but must needs call for more o' the strong! and a stranger unbeknown to any of us. for my part, i don't like the look o' the man at all." "but he's in the house, my honey; and 'tis a wet night, and a christening. daze it, what's a cup of mead more or less? there'll be plenty more next bee-burning." "very well--this time, then," she answered, looking wistfully at the barrel. "but what is the man's calling, and where is he one of, that he should come in and join us like this?" "i don't know. i'll ask him again." the catastrophe of having the mug drained dry at one pull by the stranger in cinder-gray was effectually guarded against this time by mrs. fennel. she poured out his allowance in a small cup, keeping the large one at a discreet distance from him. when he had tossed off his portion the shepherd renewed his inquiry about the stranger's occupation. the latter did not immediately reply, and the man in the chimney-corner, with sudden demonstrativeness, said, "anybody may know my trade--i'm a wheelwright." "a very good trade for these parts," said the shepherd. "and anybody may know mine--if they've the sense to find it out," said the stranger in cinder-gray. "you may generally tell what a man is by his claws," observed the hedge-carpenter, looking at his own hands. "my fingers be as full of thorns as an old pin-cushion is of pins." the hands of the man in the chimney-corner instinctively sought the shade, and he gazed into the fire as he resumed his pipe. the man at the table took up the hedge-carpenter's remark, and added smartly, "true; but the oddity of my trade is that, instead of setting a mark upon me, it sets a mark upon my customers." no observation being offered by anybody in elucidation of this enigma, the shepherd's wife once more called for a song. the same obstacles presented themselves as at the former time--one had no voice, another had forgotten the first verse. the stranger at the table, whose soul had now risen to a good working temperature, relieved the difficulty by exclaiming that, to start the company, he would sing himself. thrusting one thumb into the arm-hole of his waistcoat, he waved the other hand in the air, and, with an extemporizing gaze at the shining sheep-crooks above the mantelpiece, began: "o my trade it is the rarest one, simple shepherds all-- my trade is a sight to see; for my customers i tie, and take them up on high, and waft 'em to a far countree!" the room was silent when he had finished the verse--with one exception, that of the man in the chimney-corner, who, at the singer's word, "chorus!" joined him in a deep bass voice of musical relish: "and waft 'em to a far countree!" oliver giles, john pitcher the dairyman, the parish-clerk, the engaged man of fifty, the row of young women against the wall, seemed lost in thought not of the gayest kind. the shepherd looked meditatively on the ground, the shepherdess gazed keenly at the singer, and with some suspicion; she was doubting whether this stranger were merely singing an old song from recollection, or was composing one there and then for the occasion. all were as perplexed at the obscure revelation as the guests at belshazzar's feast, except the man in the chimney-corner, who quietly said, "second verse, stranger," and smoked on. the singer thoroughly moistened himself from his lips inward, and went on with the next stanza as requested: "my tools are but common ones, simple shepherds all-- my tools are no sight to see: a little hempen string, and a post whereon to swing, are implements enough for me!" shepherd fennel glanced round. there was no longer any doubt that the stranger was answering his question rhythmically. the guests one and all started back with suppressed exclamations. the young woman engaged to the man of fifty fainted half-way, and would have proceeded, but finding him wanting in alacrity for catching her she sat down trembling. "o, he's the--!" whispered the people in the background, mentioning the name of an ominous public officer. "he's come to do it! 'tis to be at casterbridge jail to-morrow--the man for sheep-stealing--the poor clock-maker we heard of, who used to live away at shottsford and had no work to do--timothy summers, whose family were a-starving, and so he went out of shottsford by the high-road, and took a sheep in open daylight, defying the farmer and the farmer's wife and the farmer's lad, and every man jack among 'em. he" (and they nodded toward the stranger of the deadly trade) "is come from up the country to do it because there's not enough to do in his own county-town, and he's got the place here now our own county man's dead; he's going to live in the same cottage under the prison wall." the stranger in cinder-gray took no notice of this whispered string of observations, but again wetted his lips. seeing that his friend in the chimney-corner was the only one who reciprocated his joviality in any way, he held out his cup toward that appreciative comrade, who also held out his own. they clinked together, the eyes of the rest of the room hanging upon the singer's actions. he parted his lips for the third verse; but at that moment another knock was audible upon the door. this time the knock was faint and hesitating. the company seemed scared; the shepherd looked with consternation toward the entrance, and it was with some effort that he resisted his alarmed wife's deprecatory glance, and uttered for the third time the welcoming words, "walk in!" the door was gently opened, and another man stood upon the mat. he, like those who had preceded him, was a stranger. this time it was a short, small personage, of fair complexion, and dressed in a decent suit of dark clothes. "can you tell me the way to--?" he began: when, gazing round the room to observe the nature of the company among whom he had fallen, his eyes lighted on the stranger in cinder-gray. it was just at the instant when the latter, who had thrown his mind into his song with such a will that he scarcely heeded the interruption, silenced all whispers and inquiries by bursting into his third verse: "to-morrow is my working day, simple shepherds all-- to-morrow is a working day for me: for the farmer's sheep is slain, and the lad who did it ta'en, and on his soul may god ha' merc-y!" the stranger in the chimney-corner, waving cups with the singer so heartily that his mead splashed over on the hearth, repeated in his bass voice as before: "and on his soul may god ha' merc-y!" all this time the third stranger had been standing in the doorway. finding now that he did not come forward or go on speaking, the guests particularly regarded him. they noticed to their surprise that he stood before them the picture of abject terror--his knees trembling, his hand shaking so violently that the door-latch by which he supported himself rattled audibly: his white lips were parted, and his eyes fixed on the merry officer of justice in the middle of the room. a moment more and he had turned, closed the door, and fled. "what a man can it be?" said the shepherd. the rest, between the awfulness of their late discovery and the odd conduct of this third visitor, looked as if they knew not what to think, and said nothing. instinctively they withdrew further and further from the grim gentleman in their midst, whom some of them seemed to take for the prince of darkness himself, till they formed a remote circle, an empty space of floor being left between them and him-- "... circulus, cujus centrum diabolus." the room was so silent--though there were more than twenty people in it--that nothing could be heard but the patter of the rain against the window-shutters, accompanied by the occasional hiss of a stray drop that fell down the chimney into the fire, and the steady puffing of the man in the corner, who had now resumed his pipe of long clay. the stillness was unexpectedly broken. the distant sound of a gun reverberated through the air--apparently from the direction of the county-town. "be jiggered!" cried the stranger who had sung the song, jumping up. "what does that mean?" asked several. "a prisoner escaped from the jail--that's what it means." all listened. the sound was repeated, and none of them spoke but the man in the chimney-corner, who said quietly, "i've often been told that in this county they fire a gun at such times; but i never heard it till now." "i wonder if it is _my_ man?" murmured the personage in cinder-gray. "surely it is!" said the shepherd involuntarily. "and surely we've zeed him! that little man who looked in at the door by now, and quivered like a leaf when he zeed ye and heard your song!" "his teeth chattered, and the breath went out of his body," said the dairyman. "and his heart seemed to sink within him like a stone," said oliver giles. "and he bolted as if he'd been shot at," said the hedge-carpenter. "true--his teeth chattered, and his heart seemed to sink; and he bolted as if he'd been shot at," slowly summed up the man in the chimney-corner. "i didn't notice it," remarked the hangman. "we were all a-wondering what made him run off in such a fright," faltered one of the women against the wall, "and now 'tis explained!" the firing of the alarm-gun went on at intervals, low and sullenly, and their suspicions became a certainty. the sinister gentleman in cinder-gray roused himself. "is there a constable here?" he asked, in thick tones. "if so, let him step forward." the engaged man of fifty stepped quavering out from the wall, his betrothed beginning to sob on the back of the chair. "you are a sworn constable?" "i be, sir." "then pursue the criminal at once, with assistance, and bring him back here. he can't have gone far." "i will, sir, i will--when i've got my staff. i'll go home and get it, and come sharp here, and start in a body." "staff!--never mind your staff; the man'll be gone!" "but i can't do nothing without my staff--can i, william, and john, and charles jake? no; for there's the king's royal crown a-painted on en in yaller and gold, and the lion and the unicorn, so as when i raise en up and hit my prisoner, 'tis made a lawful blow thereby. i wouldn't 'tempt to take up a man without my staff--no, not i. if i hadn't the law to gie me courage, why, instead o' my taking up him he might take up me!" "now, i'm a king's man myself, and can give you authority enough for this," said the formidable officer in gray. "now then, all of ye, be ready. have ye any lanterns?" "yes--have ye any lanterns?--i demand it!" said the constable. "and the rest of you able-bodied--" "able-bodied men--yes--the rest of ye!" said the constable. "have you some good stout staves and pitchforks--" "staves and pitchforks--in the name o' the law! and take 'em in yer hands and go in quest, and do as we in authority tell ye!" thus aroused, the men prepared to give chase. the evidence was, indeed, though circumstantial, so convincing, that but little argument was needed to show the shepherd's guests that after what they had seen it would look very much like connivance if they did not instantly pursue the unhappy third stranger, who could not as yet have gone more than a few hundred yards over such uneven country. a shepherd is always well provided with lanterns; and, lighting these hastily, and with hurdle-staves in their hands, they poured out of the door, taking a direction along the crest of the hill, away from the town, the rain having fortunately a little abated. disturbed by the noise, or possibly by unpleasant dreams of her baptism, the child who had been christened began to cry heart-brokenly in the room overhead. these notes of grief came down through the chinks of the floor to the ears of the women below, who jumped up one by one, and seemed glad of the excuse to ascend and comfort the baby, for the incidents of the last half-hour greatly oppressed them. thus in the space of two or three minutes the room on the ground-floor was deserted quite. but it was not for long. hardly had the sound of footsteps died away when a man returned round the corner of the house from the direction the pursuers had taken. peeping in at the door, and seeing nobody there, he entered leisurely. it was the stranger of the chimney-corner, who had gone out with the rest. the motive of his return was shown by his helping himself to a cut piece of skimmer-cake that lay on a ledge beside where he had sat, and which he had apparently forgotten to take with him. he also poured out half a cup more mead from the quantity that remained, ravenously eating and drinking these as he stood. he had not finished when another figure came in just as quietly--his friend in cinder-gray. "o--you here?" said the latter, smiling. "i thought you had gone to help in the capture." and this speaker also revealed the object of his return by looking solicitously round for the fascinating mug of old mead. "and i thought you had gone," said the other, continuing his skimmer-cake with some effort. "well, on second thoughts, i felt there were enough without me," said the first confidentially, "and such a night as it is, too. besides, 'tis the business o' the government to take care of its criminals--not mine." "true; so it is. and i felt as you did, that there were enough without me." "i don't want to break my limbs running over the humps and hollows of this wild country." "nor i neither, between you and me." "these shepherd-people are used to it--simple-minded souls, you know, stirred up to anything in a moment. they'll have him ready for me before the morning, and no trouble to me at all." "they'll have him, and we shall have saved ourselves all labor in the matter." "true, true. well, my way is to casterbridge; and 'tis as much as my legs will do to take me that far. going the same way?" "no, i am sorry to say! i have to get home over there" (he nodded indefinitely to the right), "and i feel as you do, that it is quite enough for my legs to do before bedtime." the other had by this time finished the mead in the mug, after which, shaking hands heartily at the door, and wishing each other well, they went their several ways. in the meantime the company of pursuers had reached the end of the hog's-back elevation which dominated this part of the down. they had decided on no particular plan of action; and, finding that the man of the baleful trade was no longer in their company, they seemed quite unable to form any such plan now. they descended in all directions down the hill, and straightway several of the party fell into the snare set by nature for all misguided midnight ramblers over this part of the cretaceous formation. the "lanchets," or flint slopes, which belted the escarpment at intervals of a dozen yards, took the less cautious ones unawares, and losing their footing on the rubbly steep they slid sharply downward, the lanterns rolling from their hands to the bottom, and there lying on their sides till the horn was scorched through. when they had again gathered themselves together, the shepherd, as the man who knew the country best, took the lead, and guided them round these treacherous inclines. the lanterns, which seemed rather to dazzle their eyes and warn the fugitive than to assist them in the exploration, were extinguished, due silence was observed; and in this more rational order they plunged into the vale. it was a grassy, briery, moist defile, affording some shelter to any person who had sought it; but the party perambulated it in vain, and ascended on the other side. here they wandered apart, and after an interval closed together again to report progress. at the second time of closing in they found themselves near a lonely ash, the single tree on this part of the coomb, probably sown there by a passing bird some fifty years before. and here, standing a little to one side of the trunk, as motionless as the trunk itself, appeared the man they were in quest of, his outline being well defined against the sky beyond. the band noiselessly drew up and faced him. "your money or your life!" said the constable sternly to the still figure. "no, no," whispered john pitcher. "'tisn't our side ought to say that. that's the doctrine of vagabonds like him, and we be on the side of the law." "well, well," replied the constable, impatiently; "i must say something, mustn't i? and if you had all the weight o' this undertaking upon your mind, perhaps you'd say the wrong thing, too!--prisoner at the bar, surrender, in the name of the father--the crown, i mane!" the man under the tree seemed now to notice them for the first time, and, giving them no opportunity whatever for exhibiting their courage, he strolled slowly toward them. he was, indeed, the little man, the third stranger; but his trepidation had in a great measure gone. "well, travellers," he said, "did i hear you speak to me?" "you did; you've got to come and be our prisoner at once!" said the constable. "we arrest 'ee on the charge of not biding in casterbridge jail in a decent proper manner to be hung to-morrow morning. neighbors, do your duty, and seize the culpet!" on hearing the charge, the man seemed enlightened, and, saying not another word, resigned himself with preternatural civility to the search-party, who, with their staves in their hands, surrounded him on all sides, and marched him back toward the shepherd's cottage. it was eleven o'clock by the time they arrived. the light shining from the open door, a sound of men's voices within, proclaimed to them as they approached the house that some new events had arisen in their absence. on entering they discovered the shepherd's living-room to be invaded by two officers from casterbridge jail, and a well-known magistrate who lived at the nearest country-seat, intelligence of the escape having become generally circulated. "gentlemen," said the constable, "i have brought back your man--not without risk and danger; but every one must do his duty! he is inside this circle of able-bodied persons, who have lent me useful aid, considering their ignorance of crown work. men, bring forward your prisoner!" and the third stranger was led to the light. "who is this?" said one of the officials. "the man," said the constable. "certainly not," said the turnkey; and the first corroborated his statement. "but how can it be otherwise?" asked the constable. "or why was he so terrified at sight o' the singing instrument of the law who sat there?" here he related the strange behavior of the third stranger on entering the house during the hangman's song. "can't understand it," said the officer coolly. "all i know is that it is not the condemned man. he's quite a different character from this one; a gauntish fellow, with dark hair and eyes, rather good-looking, and with a musical bass voice that if you heard it once you'd never mistake as long as you lived." "why, souls--'twas the man in the chimney-corner!" "hey--what?" said the magistrate, coming forward after inquiring particulars from the shepherd in the background. "haven't you got the man after all?" "well, sir," said the constable, "he's the man we were in search of, that's true; and yet he's not the man we were in search of. for the man we were in search of was not the man we wanted, sir, if you understand my every-day way; for 'twas the man in the chimney-corner!" "a pretty kettle of fish altogether!" said the magistrate. "you had better start for the other man at once." the prisoner now spoke for the first time. the mention of the man in the chimney-corner seemed to have moved him as nothing else could do. "sir," he said, stepping forward to the magistrate, "take no more trouble about me. the time is come when i may as well speak. i have done nothing; my crime is that the condemned man is my brother. early this afternoon i left home at shottsford to tramp it all the way to casterbridge jail to bid him farewell. i was benighted, and called here to rest and ask the way. when i opened the door i saw before me the very man, my brother, that i thought to see in the condemned cell at casterbridge. he was in this chimney-corner; and jammed close to him, so that he could not have got out if he had tried, was the executioner who'd come to take his life, singing a song about it and not knowing that it was his victim who was close by, joining in to save appearances. my brother looked a glance of agony at me, and i know he meant, 'don't reveal what you see; my life depends on it.' i was so terror-struck that i could hardly stand, and, not knowing what i did, i turned and hurried away." the narrator's manner and tone had the stamp of truth, and his story made a great impression on all around. "and do you know where your brother is at the present time?" asked the magistrate. "i do not. i have never seen him since i closed this door." "i can testify to that, for we've been between ye ever since." said the constable. "where does he think to fly to?--what is his occupation?" "he's a watch-and-clock-maker, sir." "'a said 'a was a wheelwright--a wicked rogue," said the constable. "the wheels of clocks and watches he meant, no doubt," said shepherd fennel. "i thought his hands were palish for's trade." "well, it appears to me that nothing can be gained by retaining this poor man in custody," said the magistrate; "your business lies with the other, unquestionably." and so the little man was released off-hand; but he looked nothing the less sad on that account, it being beyond the power of magistrate or constable to raze out the written troubles in his brain, for they concerned another whom he regarded with more solicitude than himself. when this was done, and the man had gone his way, the night was found to be so far advanced that it was deemed useless to renew the search before the next morning. next day, accordingly, the quest for the clever sheep-stealer became general and keen, to all appearance at least. but the intended punishment was cruelly disproportioned to the transgression, and the sympathy of a great many country-folk in that district was strongly on the side of the fugitive. moreover, his marvellous coolness and daring in hob-and-nobbing with the hangman, under the unprecedented circumstances of the shepherd's party, won their admiration. so that it may be questioned if all those who ostensibly made themselves so busy in exploring woods and fields and lanes were quite so thorough when it came to the private examination of their own lofts and outhouses. stories were afloat of a mysterious figure being occasionally seen in some old overgrown trackway or other, remote from turnpike roads; but when a search was instituted in any of these suspected quarters nobody was found. thus the days and weeks passed without tidings. in brief, the bass-voiced man of the chimney-corner was never recaptured. some said that he went across the sea, others that he did not, but buried himself in the depths of a populous city. at any rate, the gentleman in cinder-gray never did his morning's work at casterbridge, nor met anywhere at all, for business purposes, the genial comrade with whom he had passed an hour of relaxation in the lonely house on the coomb. the grass has long been green on the graves of shepherd fennel and his frugal wife; the guests who made up the christening party have mainly followed their entertainers to the tomb; the baby in whose honor they all had met is a matron in the sere and yellow leaf. but the arrival of the three strangers at the shepherd's that night, and the details connected therewith, is a story as well-known as ever in the country about higher crowstairs. _march_, <UNK> julia <UNK> [footnote <UNK> <UNK> _henry james_ <UNK> i she had walked with her friend to the top of the wide steps of the museum, those that descended from the galleries of painting, and then, after the young man had left her, smiling, looking back, waving all gayly and expressively his hat and stick, had watched him, smiling too, but with a different intensity--had kept him in sight till he passed out of the great door. she might have been waiting to see if he would turn there for a last demonstration; which was exactly what he did, renewing his cordial gesture and with his look of glad devotion, the radiance of his young face, reaching her across the great space, as she felt, in undiminished truth. yes, so she could feel, and she remained a minute even after he was gone; she gazed at the empty air as if he had filled it still, asking herself what more she wanted and what, if it didn't signify glad devotion, his whole air could have represented. she was at present so anxious that she could wonder if he stepped and smiled like that for mere relief at separation; yet if he desired in that degree to break the spell and escape the danger why did he keep coming back to her, and why, for that matter, had she felt safe a moment before in letting him go? she felt safe, felt almost reckless--that was the proof--so long as he was with her; but the chill came as soon as he had gone, when she took the measure, instantly, of all she yet missed. she might now have been taking it afresh, by the testimony of her charming clouded eyes and of the rigor that had already replaced her beautiful play of expression. her radiance, for the minute, had "carried" as far as his, travelling on the light wings of her brilliant prettiness--he, on his side, not being facially handsome, but only sensitive, clean and eager. then, with its extinction, the sustaining wings dropped and hung. she wheeled about, however, full of a purpose; she passed back through the pictured rooms, for it pleased her, this idea of a talk with mr. pitman--as much, that is, as anything could please a young person so troubled. it happened indeed that when she saw him rise at sight of her from the settee where he had told her five minutes before that she would find him, it was just with her nervousness that his presence seemed, as through an odd suggestion of help, to connect itself. nothing truly would be quite so odd for her case as aid proceeding from mr. pitman; unless perhaps the oddity would be even greater for himself--the oddity of her having taken into her head an appeal to him. she had had to feel alone with a vengeance--inwardly alone and miserably alarmed--to be ready to "meet," that way, at the first sign from him, the successor to her dim father in her dim father's lifetime, the second of her mother's two divorced husbands. it made a queer relation for her; a relation that struck her at this moment as less edifying, less natural and graceful than it would have been even for her remarkable mother--and still in spite of this parent's third marriage, her union with mr. connery, from whom she was informally separated. it was at the back of julia's head as she approached mr. pitman, or it was at least somewhere deep within her soul, that if this last of mrs. connery's withdrawals from the matrimonial yoke had received the sanction of the court (julia had always heard, from far back, so much about the "court") she herself, as after a fashion, in that event, a party to it, would not have had the cheek to make up--which was how she inwardly phrased what she was doing--to the long, lean, loose, slightly cadaverous gentleman who was a memory, for her, of the period from her twelfth to her seventeenth year. she had got on with him, perversely, much better than her mother had, and the bulging misfit of his duck waistcoat, with his trick of swinging his eye-glass, at the end of an extraordinarily long string, far over the scene, came back to her as positive features of the image of her remoter youth. her present age--for her later time had seen so many things happen--gave her a perspective. fifty things came up as she stood there before him, some of them floating in from the past, others hovering with freshness: how she used to dodge the rotary movement made by his pince-nez while he always awkwardly, and kindly, and often funnily, talked--it had once hit her rather badly in the eye; how she used to pull down and straighten his waistcoat, making it set a little better, a thing of a sort her mother never did; how friendly and familiar she must have been with him for that, or else a forward little minx; how she felt almost capable of doing it again now, just to sound the right note, and how sure she was of the way he would take it if she did; how much nicer he had clearly been, all the while, poor dear man, than his wife and the court had made it possible for him publicly to appear; how much younger, too, he now looked, in spite of his rather melancholy, his mildly jaundiced, humorously determined sallowness and his careless assumption, everywhere, from his forehead to his exposed and relaxed blue socks, almost sky-blue, as in past days, of creases and folds and furrows that would have been perhaps tragic if they hadn't seemed rather to show, like his whimsical black eyebrows, the vague, interrogative arch. of course he wasn't wretched if he wasn't more sure of his wretchedness than that! julia bride would have been sure--had she been through what she supposed _he_ had! with his thick, loose black hair, in any case, untouched by a thread of gray, and his kept gift of a certain big-boyish awkwardness--that of his taking their encounter, for instance, so amusedly, so crudely, though, as she was not unaware, so eagerly too--he could by no means have been so little his wife's junior as it had been that lady's habit, after the divorce, to represent him. julia had remembered him as old, since she had so constantly thought of her mother as old; which mrs. connery was indeed now--for her daughter--with her dozen years of actual seniority to mr. pitman and her exquisite hair, the densest, the finest tangle of arranged silver tendrils that had ever enhanced the effect of a preserved complexion. something in the girl's vision of her quondam stepfather as still comparatively young--with the confusion, the immense element of rectification, not to say of rank disproof, that it introduced into mrs. connery's favorite picture of her own injured past--all this worked, even at the moment, to quicken once more the clearness and harshness of judgment, the retrospective disgust, as she might have called it, that had of late grown up in her, the sense of all the folly and vanity and vulgarity, the lies, the perversities, the falsification of all life in the interest of who could say what wretched frivolity, what preposterous policy; amid which she had been condemned so ignorantly, so pitifully to sit, to walk, to grope, to flounder, from the very dawn of her consciousness. didn't poor mr. pitman just touch the sensitive nerve of it when, taking her in with his facetious, cautious eyes, he spoke to her, right out, of the old, old story, the everlasting little wonder of her beauty? "why, you know, you've grown up so lovely--you're the prettiest girl i've ever seen!" of course she was the prettiest girl he had ever seen; she was the prettiest girl people much more privileged than he had ever seen; since when hadn't she been passing for the prettiest girl any one had ever seen? she had lived in that, from far back, from year to year, from day to day and from hour to hour--she had lived for it and literally _by_ it, as who should say; but mr. pitman was somehow more illuminating than he knew, with the present lurid light that he cast upon old dates, old pleas, old values, and old mysteries, not to call them old abysses: it had rolled over her in a swift wave, with the very sight of him, that her mother couldn't possibly have been right about him--as about what in the world had she ever been right?--so that in fact he was simply offered her there as one more of mrs. connery's lies. she might have thought she knew them all by this time; but he represented for her, coming in just as he did, a fresh discovery, and it was this contribution of freshness that made her somehow feel she liked him. it was she herself who, for so long, with her retained impression, had been right about him; and the rectification he represented had _all_ shone out of him, ten minutes before, on his catching her eye while she moved through the room with mr. french. she had never doubted of his probable faults--which her mother had vividly depicted as the basest of vices; since some of them, and the most obvious (not the vices, but the faults) were written on him as he stood there: notably, for instance, the exasperating "business slackness" of which mrs. connery had, before the tribunal, made so pathetically much. it might have been, for that matter, the very business slackness that affected julia as presenting its friendly breast, in the form of a cool loose sociability, to her own actual tension; though it was also true for her, after they had exchanged fifty words, that he had as well his inward fever and that, if he was perhaps wondering what was so particularly the matter with her, she could make out not less that something was the matter with _him_. it had been vague, yet it had been intense, the mute reflection, "yes, i'm going to like him, and he's going somehow to help me!" that had directed her steps so straight to him. she was sure even then of this, that he wouldn't put to her a query about his former wife, that he took to-day no grain of interest in mrs. connery; that his interest, such as it was--and he couldn't look _quite_ like that, to julia bride's expert perception, without something in the nature of a new one--would be a thousand times different. it was as a value of _disproof_ that his worth meanwhile so rapidly grew: the good sight of him, the good sound and sense of him, such as they were, demolished at a stroke so blessedly much of the horrid inconvenience of the past that she thought of him; she clutched at him, for a _general_ saving use, an application as sanative, as redemptive as some universal healing wash, precious even to the point of perjury if perjury should be required. that was the terrible thing, that had been the inward pang with which she watched basil french recede: perjury would have to come in somehow and somewhere--oh so quite certainly!--before the so strange, so rare young man, truly smitten though she believed him, could be made to rise to the occasion, before her measureless prize could be assured. it was present to her, it had been present a hundred times, that if there had only been some one to (as it were) "deny everything" the situation might yet be saved. she so needed some one to lie for her--ah, she so need some one to lie! her mother's version of everything, her mother's version of anything, had been at the best, as they said, discounted; and she herself could but show, of course, for an interested party, however much she might claim to be none the less a decent girl--to whatever point, that is, after all that had both remotely and recently happened, presumptions of anything to be called decency could come in. after what had recently happened--the two or three indirect but so worrying questions mr. french had put to her--it would only be some thoroughly detached friend or witness who might effectively testify. an odd form of detachment certainly would reside, for mr. pitman's evidential character, in her mother's having so publicly and so brilliantly--though, thank the powers, all off in north dakota!--severed their connection with him; and yet mightn't it do _her_ some good, even if the harm it might do her mother were so little ambiguous? the more her mother had got divorced--with her dreadful cheap-and-easy second performance in that line and her present extremity of alienation from mr. connery, which enfolded beyond doubt the germ of a third petition on one side or the other--the more her mother had distinguished herself in the field of folly the worse for her own prospect with the frenches, whose minds she had guessed to be accessible, and with such an effect of dissimulated suddenness, to some insidious poison. it was very unmistakable, in other words, that the more dismissed and detached mr. pitman should have come to appear, the more as divorced, or at least as divorcing, his before-time wife would by the same stroke figure--so that it was here poor julia could but lose herself. the crazy divorces only, or the half-dozen successive and still crazier engagements only--gathered fruit, bitter fruit, of her own incredibly allowed, her own insanely fostered frivolity--either of these two groups of skeletons at the banquet might singly be dealt with; but the combination, the fact of each party's having been so mixed-up with whatever was least presentable for the other, the fact of their having so shockingly amused themselves together, made all present steering resemble the classic middle course between scylla and charybdis. it was not, however, that she felt wholly a fool in having obeyed this impulse to pick up again her kind old friend. _she_ at least had never divorced him, and her horrid little filial evidence in court had been but the chatter of a parrakeet, of precocious plumage and croak, repeating words earnestly taught her, and that she could scarce even pronounce. therefore, as far as steering went, he _must_ for the hour take a hand. she might actually have wished in fact that he shouldn't now have seemed so tremendously struck with her; since it was an extraordinary situation for a girl, this crisis of her fortune, this positive wrong that the flagrancy, what she would have been ready to call the very vulgarity, of her good looks might do her at a moment when it was vital she should hang as straight as a picture on the wall. had it ever yet befallen any young woman in the world to wish with secret intensity that she might have been, for her convenience, a shade less inordinately pretty? she had come to that, to this view of the bane, the primal curse, of their lavish physical outfit, which had included everything and as to which she lumped herself resentfully with her mother. the only thing was that her mother was, thank goodness, still so much prettier, still so assertively, so publicly, so trashily, so ruinously pretty. wonderful the small grimness with which julia bride put off on this parent the middle-aged maximum of their case and the responsibility of their defect. it cost her so little to recognize in mrs. connery at forty-seven, and in spite, or perhaps indeed just by reason, of the arranged silver tendrils which were so like some rare bird's-nest in a morning frost, a facile supremacy for the dazzling effect--it cost her so little that her view even rather exaggerated the lustre of the different maternal items. she would have put it _all_ off if possible, all off on other shoulders and on other graces and other morals than her own, the burden of physical charm that had made so easy a ground, such a native favoring air, for the aberrations which, apparently inevitable and without far consequences at the time, had yet at this juncture so much better not have been. she could have worked it out at her leisure, to the last link of the chain, the way their prettiness had set them trap after trap, all along--had foredoomed them to awful ineptitude. when you were as pretty as that you could, by the whole idiotic consensus, be nothing _but_ pretty; and when you were nothing "but" pretty you could get into nothing but tight places, out of which you could then scramble by nothing but masses of fibs. and there was no one, all the while, who wasn't eager to egg you on, eager to make you pay to the last cent the price of your beauty. what creature would ever for a moment help you to behave as if something that dragged in its wake a bit less of a lumbering train would, on the whole, have been better for you? the consequences of being plain were only negative--you failed of this and that; but the consequences of being as _they_ were, what were these but endless? though indeed, as far as failing went, your beauty too could let you in for enough of it. who, at all events, would ever for a moment credit you, in the luxuriance of that beauty, with the study, on your own side, of such truths as these? julia bride could, at the point she had reached, positively ask herself this even while lucidly conscious of the inimitable, the triumphant and attested projection, all round her, of her exquisite image. it was only basil french who had at last, in his doubtless dry, but all distinguished way--the way surely, as it was borne in upon her, of all the blood of all the frenches--stepped out of the vulgar rank. it was only he who, by the trouble she discerned in him, had made her see certain things. it was only for him--and not a bit ridiculously, but just beautifully, almost sublimely--that their being "nice," her mother and she between them, had _not_ seemed to profit by their being so furiously handsome. this had, ever so grossly and ever so tiresomely, satisfied every one else; since every one had thrust upon them, had imposed upon them, as by a great cruel conspiracy, their silliest possibilities; fencing them in to these, and so not only shutting them out from others, but mounting guard at the fence, walking round and round outside it, to see they didn't escape, and admiring them, talking to them, through the rails, in mere terms of chaff, terms of chucked cakes and apples--as if they had been antelopes or zebras, or even some superior sort of performing, of dancing, bear. it had been reserved for basil french to strike her as willing to let go, so to speak, a pound or two of this fatal treasure if he might only have got in exchange for it an ounce or so more of their so much less obvious and jess published personal history. yes, it described him to say that, in addition to all the rest of him, and of _his_ personal history, and of his family, and of theirs, in addition to their social posture, as that of a serried phalanx, and to their notoriously enormous wealth and crushing respectability, she might have been ever so much less lovely for him if she had been only--well, a little prepared to answer questions. and it wasn't as if quiet, cultivated, earnest, public-spirited, brought up in germany, infinitely travelled, awfully like a high-caste englishman, and all the other pleasant things, it wasn't as if he didn't love to be with her, to look at her, just as she was; for he loved it exactly as much, so far as that footing simply went, as any free and foolish youth who had ever made the last demonstration of it. it was that marriage was, for him--and for them all, the serried frenches--a great matter, a goal to which a man of intelligence, a real shy, beautiful man of the world, didn't hop on one foot, didn't skip and jump, as if he were playing an urchins' game, but toward which he proceeded with a deep and anxious, a noble and highly just deliberation. for it was one thing to stare at a girl till she was bored with it, it was one thing to take her to the horse show and the opera, and to send her flowers by the stack, and chocolates by the ton, and "great" novels, the very latest and greatest, by the dozen; but something quite other to hold open for her, with eyes attached to eyes, the gate, moving on such stiff silver hinges, of the grand square forecourt of the palace of wedlock. the state of being "engaged" represented to him the introduction to this precinct of some young woman with whom his outside parley would have had the duration, distinctly, of his own convenience. that might be cold-blooded if one chose to think so; but nothing of another sort would equal the high ceremony and dignity and decency, above all the grand gallantry and finality, of their then passing in. poor julia could have blushed red, before that view, with the memory of the way the forecourt, as she now imagined it, had been dishonored by her younger romps. she had tumbled over the wall with this, that, and the other raw playmate, and had played "tag" and leap-frog, as she might say, from corner to corner. that would be the "history" with which, in case of definite demand, she should be able to supply mr. french: that she had already, again and again, any occasion offering, chattered and scuffled over ground provided, according to his idea, for walking the gravest of minuets. if that then had been all their _kind_ of history, hers and her mother's, at least there was plenty of it: it was the superstructure raised on the other group of facts, those of the order of their having been always so perfectly pink and white, so perfectly possessed of clothes, so perfectly splendid, so perfectly idiotic. these things had been the "points" of antelope and zebra; putting mrs. connery for the zebra, as the more remarkably striped or spotted. such were the _data_ basil french's inquiry would elicit: her own six engagements and her mother's three nullified marriages--nine nice distinct little horrors in all. what on earth was to be done about them? it was notable, she was afterward to recognize, that there had been nothing of the famous business slackness in the positive pounce with which mr. pitman put it to her that, as soon as he had made her out "for sure," identified her there as old julia grown-up and gallivanting with a new admirer, a smarter young fellow than ever yet, he had had the inspiration of her being exactly the good girl to help him. she certainly found him strike the hour again, with these vulgarities of tone--forms of speech that her mother had anciently described as by themselves, once he had opened the whole battery, sufficient ground for putting him away. full, however, of the use she should have for him, she wasn't going to mind trifles. what she really gasped at was that, so oddly, he was ahead of her at the start. "yes, i want something of you, julia, and i want it right now: you can do me a turn, and i'm blest if my luck--which has once or twice been pretty good, you know--hasn't sent you to me." she knew the luck he meant--that of her mother's having so enabled him to get rid of her; but it was the nearest allusion of the merely invidious kind that he would make. it had thus come to our young woman on the spot and by divination: the service he desired of her matched with remarkable closeness what she had so promptly taken into her head to name to himself--to name in her own interest, though deterred as yet from having brought it right out. she had been prevented by his speaking, the first thing, in that way, as if he had known mr. french--which surprised her till he explained that every one in new york knew by appearance a young man of his so-quoted wealth ("what did she take them all in new york then _for_?") and of whose marked attention to her he had moreover, for himself, round at clubs and places, lately heard. this had accompanied the inevitable free question "was she engaged to _him_ now?"--which she had in fact almost welcomed as holding out to her the perch of opportunity. she was waiting to deal with it properly, but meanwhile he had gone on, and to such effect that it took them but three minutes to turn out, on either side, like a pair of pickpockets comparing, under shelter, their day's booty, the treasures of design concealed about their persons. "i want you to tell the truth for me--as you only can. i want you to say that i was really all right--as right as you know; and that i simply acted like an angel in a story-book, gave myself away to have it over." "why, my dear man," julia cried, "you take the wind straight out of my sails! what i'm here to ask of _you_ is that you'll confess to having been even a worse fiend than you were shown up for; to having made it impossible mother should _not_ take proceedings." there!--she had brought it out, and with the sense of their situation turning to high excitement for her in the teeth of his droll stare, his strange grin, his characteristic "lordy, lordy! what good will that do you?" she was prepared with her clear statement of reasons for her appeal, and feared so he might have better ones for his own that all her story came in a flash. "well, mr. pitman, i want to get married this time, by way of a change; but you see we've been such fools that, when something really good at last comes up, it's too dreadfully awkward. the fools we were capable of being--well, you know better than any one: unless perhaps not quite so well as mr. connery. it has got to be denied," said julia ardently--"it has got to be denied flat. but i can't get hold of mr. connery--mr. connery has gone to china. besides, if he were here," she had ruefully to confess, "he'd be no good--on the contrary. he wouldn't deny anything--he'd only tell more. so thank heaven he's away--there's _that_ amount of good! i'm not engaged yet," she went on--but he had already taken her up. "you're not engaged to mr. french?" it was all, clearly, a wondrous show for him, but his immediate surprise, oddly, might have been greatest for that. "no, not to any one--for the seventh time!" she spoke as with her head held well up both over the shame and the pride. "yes, the next time i'm engaged i want something to happen. but he's afraid; he's afraid of what may be told him. he's dying to find out, and yet he'd die if he did! he wants to be talked to, but he has got to be talked to right. you could talk to him right, mr. pitman--if you only _would_! he can't get over mother--that i feel: he loathes and scorns divorces, and we've had first and last too many. so if he could hear from you that you just made her life a hell--why," julia concluded, "it would be too lovely. if she _had_ to go in for another--after having already, when i was little, divorced father--it would 'sort of' make, don't you see? one less. you'd do the high-toned thing by her: you'd say what a wretch you then were, and that she had had to save her life. in that way he mayn't mind it. don't you see, you sweet man?" poor julia pleaded. "oh," she wound up as if his fancy lagged or his scruple looked out, "of course i want you to _lie_ for me!" it did indeed sufficiently stagger him. "it's a lovely idea for the moment when i was just saying to myself--as soon as i saw you--that you'd speak the truth for _me_!" "ah, what's the matter with 'you'?" julia sighed with an impatience not sensibly less sharp for her having so quickly scented some lion in her path. "why, do you think there's no one in the world but you who has seen the cup of promised affection, of something really to be depended on, only, at the last moment, by the horrid jostle of your elbow, spilled all over you? i want to provide for my future too as it happens; and my good friend who's to help me to that--the most charming of women this time--disapproves of divorce quite as much as mr. french. don't you see," mr. pitman candidly asked, "what that by itself must have done toward attaching me to her? _she_ has got to be talked to--to be told how little i could help it." "oh, lordy, lordy!" the girl emulously groaned. it was such a relieving cry. "well, _i_ won't talk to her!" she declared. "you _won't_, julia?" he pitifully echoed. "and yet you ask of _me_--!" his pang, she felt, was sincere; and even more than she had guessed, for the previous quarter of an hour he had been building up his hope, building it with her aid for a foundation. yet was he going to see how their testimony, on each side, would, if offered, _have_ to conflict? if he was to prove himself for her sake--or, more queerly still, for that of basil french's high conservatism--a person whom there had been no other way of dealing with, how could she prove him, in this other and so different interest, a mere gentle sacrifice to his wife's perversity? she had, before him there, on the instant, all acutely, a sense of rising sickness--a wan glimmer of foresight as to the end of the fond dream. everything else was against her, everything in her dreadful past--just as if she had been a person represented by some "emotional actress," some desperate erring lady "hunted down" in a play; but was that going to be the case too with her own very decency, the fierce little residuum deep within her, for which she was counting, when she came to think, on so little glory or even credit? was this also going to turn against her and trip her up--just to show she was really, under the touch and the test, as decent as any one; and with no one but herself the wiser for it meanwhile, and no proof to show but that, as a consequence, she should be unmarried to the end? she put it to mr. pitman quite with resentment: "do you mean to say you're going to be married--?" "oh, my dear, i too must get engaged first!"--he spoke with his inimitable grin. "but that, you see, is where you come in. i've told her about you. she wants awfully to meet you. the way it happens is too lovely--that i find you just in this place. she's coming," said mr. pitman--and as in all the good faith of his eagerness now; "she's coming in about three minutes." "coming here?" "yes, julia--right here. it's where we usually meet"; and he was wreathed again, this time as if for life, in his large slow smile. "she loves this place--she's awfully keen on art. like _you_, julia, if you haven't changed--i remember how you did love art." he looked at her quite tenderly, as to keep her up to it. "you must still of course--from the way you're here. just let her _feel_ that," the poor man fantastically urged. and then with his kind eyes on her and his good ugly mouth stretched as for delicate emphasis from ear to ear: "every little helps!" he made her wonder for him, ask herself, and with a certain intensity, questions she yet hated the trouble of; as whether he were still as moneyless as in the other time--which was certain indeed, for any fortune he ever would have made. his slackness, on that ground, stuck out of him almost as much as if he had been of rusty or "seedy" aspect--which, luckily for him, he wasn't at all: he looked, in his way, like some pleasant eccentric, ridiculous, but real gentleman, whose taste might be of the queerest, but his credit with his tailor none the less of the best. she wouldn't have been the least ashamed, had their connection lasted, of going about with him: so that what a fool, again, her mother had been--since mr. connery, sorry as one might be for him, was irrepressibly vulgar. julia's quickness was, for the minute, charged with all this; but she had none the less her feeling of the right thing to say and the right way to say it. if he was after a future financially assured, even as she herself so frantically was, she wouldn't cast the stone. but if he had talked about her to strange women she couldn't be less than a little majestic. "who then is the person in question for you--?" "why, such a dear thing, julia--mrs. david e. drack. have you heard of her?" he almost fluted. new york was vast, and she had not had that advantage. "she's a widow--?" "oh yes: she's not--" he caught himself up in time. "she's a real one." it was as near as he came. but it was as if he had been looking at her now so pathetically hard. "julia, she has millions." hard, at any rate--whether pathetic or not--was the look she gave him back. "well, so has--or so _will_ have--basil french. and more of them than mrs. drack, i guess," julia quavered. "oh, i know what _they've_ got!" he took it from her--with the effect of a vague stir, in his long person, of unwelcome embarrassment. but was she going to give up because he was embarrassed? he should know at least what he was costing her. it came home to her own spirit more than ever, but meanwhile he had found his footing. "i don't see how your mother matters. it isn't a question of his marrying _her_." "no; but, constantly together as we've always been, it's a question of there being so disgustingly much to get over. if we had, for people like them, but the one ugly spot and the one weak side; if we had made, between us, but the one vulgar _kind_ of mistake: well, i don't say!" she reflected with a wistfulness of note that was in itself a touching eloquence. "to have our reward in this world we've had too sweet a time. we've had it all right down here!" said julia bride. "i should have taken the precaution to have about a dozen fewer lovers." "ah, my dear, 'lovers'--!" he ever so comically attenuated. "well they _were_!" she quite flared up. "when you've had a ring from each (three diamonds, two pearls, and a rather bad sapphire: i've kept them all, and they tell my story!) what are you to call them?" "oh, rings--!" mr. pitman didn't call rings anything. "i've given mrs. drack a ring." julia stared. "then aren't you her lover?" "that, dear child," he humorously wailed, "is what i want you to find out! but i'll handle your rings all right," he more lucidly added. "you'll 'handle' them?" "i'll fix your lovers. i'll lie about _them_, if that's all you want." "oh, about 'them'--!" she turned away with a sombre drop, seeing so little in it. "that wouldn't count--from _you_!" she saw the great shining room, with its mockery of art and "style" and security, all the things she was vainly after, and its few scattered visitors who had left them, mr. pitman and herself, in their ample corner, so conveniently at ease. there was only a lady in one of the far doorways, of whom she took vague note and who seemed to be looking at them. "they'd have to lie for themselves!" "do you mean he's capable of putting it to them?" mr. pitman's tone threw discredit on that possibility, but she knew perfectly well what she meant. "not of getting at them directly, not, as mother says, of nosing round himself; but of listening--and small blame to him!--to the horrible things other people say of me." "but what other people?" "why, mrs. george maule, to begin with--who intensely loathes us, and who talks to his sisters, so that they may talk to _him_: which they do, all the while, i'm morally sure (hating me as they also must). but it's she who's the real reason--i mean of his holding off. she poisons the air he breathes." "oh well," said mr. pitman, with easy optimism, "if mrs. george maule's a cat--!" "if she's a cat she has kittens--four little spotlessly white ones, among whom she'd give her head that mr. french should make his pick. he could do it with his eyes shut--you can't tell them apart. but she has every name, every date, as you may say, for my dark 'record'--as of course they all call it: she'll be able to give him, if he brings himself to ask her, every fact in its order. and all the while, don't you see? there's no one to speak _for_ me." it would have touched a harder heart than her loose friend's to note the final flush of clairvoyance witnessing this assertion and under which her eyes shone as with the rush of quick tears. he stared at her, and at what this did for the deep charm of her prettiness, as in almost witless admiration. "but can't you--lovely as you are, you beautiful thing!--speak for yourself?" "do you mean can't i tell the lies? no, then, i can't--and i wouldn't if i could. i don't lie myself, you know--as it happens; and it could represent to him then about the only thing, the only bad one, i don't do. i _did_--'lovely as i am'!--have my regular time; i wasn't so hideous that i couldn't! besides, do you imagine he'd come and ask me?" "gad, i wish he would, julia!" said mr. pitman, with his kind eyes on her. "well then, i'd tell him!" and she held her head again high. "but he won't." it fairly distressed her companion. "doesn't he want, then, to know--?" "he wants _not_ to know. he wants to be told without asking--told, i mean, that each of the stories, those that have come to him, is a fraud and a libel. _qui s'excuse s'accuse_, don't they say?--so that do you see me breaking out to him, unprovoked, with four or five what-do-you-call-'ems, the things mother used to have to prove in court, a set of neat little 'alibis' in a row? how can i get hold of so _many_ precious gentlemen, to turn them on? how can _they_ want everything fished up?" she paused for her climax, in the intensity of these considerations; which gave mr. pitman a chance to express his honest faith. "why, my sweet child, they'd be just glad--!" it determined in her loveliness almost a sudden glare. "glad to swear they never had anything to do with such a creature? then _i'd_ be glad to swear they had lots!" his persuasive smile, though confessing to bewilderment, insisted. "why, my love, they've got to swear either one thing or the other." "they've got to keep out of the way--that's _their_ view of it, i guess," said julia. "where _are_ they, please--now that they _may_ be wanted? if you'd like to hunt them up for me you're very welcome." with which, for the moment, over the difficult case, they faced each other helplessly enough. and she added to it now the sharpest ache of her despair. "he knows about murray brush. the others"--and her pretty white-gloved hands and charming pink shoulders gave them up--"may go hang!" "murray brush--?" it had opened mr. pitman's eyes. "yes--yes; i do mind _him_." "then what's the matter with his at least rallying--?" "the matter is that, being ashamed of himself, as he well might, he left the country as soon as he could and has stayed away. the matter is that he's in paris or somewhere, and that if you expect him to come home for me--!" she had already dropped, however, as at mr. pitman's look. "why, you foolish thing, murray brush is in new york!" it had quite brightened him up. "he has come back--?" "why, sure! i saw him--when was it? tuesday!--on the jersey boat." mr. pitman rejoiced in his news. "_he's_ your man!" julia too had been affected by it; it had brought, in a rich wave, her hot color back. but she gave the strangest dim smile. "he _was_!" "then get hold of him, and--if he's a gentleman--he'll prove for you, to the hilt, that he wasn't." it lighted in her face, the kindled train of this particular sudden suggestion, a glow, a sharpness of interest, that had deepened the next moment, while she gave a slow and sad head-shake, to a greater strangeness yet. "he isn't a gentleman." "ah, lordy, lordy!" mr. pitman again sighed. he struggled out of it but only into the vague. "oh, then, if he's a pig--!" "you see there are only a few gentlemen--not enough to go round--and that makes them count so!" it had thrust the girl herself, for that matter, into depths; but whether most of memory or of roused purpose he had no time to judge--aware as he suddenly was of a shadow (since he mightn't perhaps too quickly call it a light) across the heaving surface of their question. it fell upon julia's face, fell with the sound of the voice he so well knew, but which could only be odd to her for all it immediately assumed. "there are indeed very few--and one mustn't try _them_ too much!" mrs. drack, who had supervened while they talked, stood, in monstrous magnitude--at least to julia's reimpressed eyes--between them: she was the lady our young woman had descried across the room, and she had drawn near while the interest of their issue so held them. we have seen the act of observation and that of reflection alike swift in julia--once her subject was within range--and she had now, with all her perceptions at the acutest, taken in, by a single stare, the strange presence to a happy connection with which mr. pitman aspired and which had thus sailed, with placid majesty, into their troubled waters. she was clearly not shy, mrs. david e. drack, yet neither was she ominously bold; she was bland and "good," julia made sure at a glance, and of a large complacency, as the good and the bland are apt to be--a large complacency, a large sentimentality, a large innocent, elephantine archness: she fairly rioted in that dimension of size. habited in an extraordinary quantity of stiff and lustrous black brocade, with enhancements, of every description, that twinkled and tinkled, that rustled and rumbled with her least movement, she presented a huge, hideous, pleasant face, a featureless desert in a remote quarter of which the disproportionately small eyes might have figured a pair of rash adventurers all but buried in the sand. they reduced themselves when she smiled to barely discernible points--a couple of mere tiny emergent heads--though the foreground of the scene, as if to make up for it, gaped with a vast benevolence. in a word julia saw--and as if she had needed nothing more; saw mr. pitman's opportunity, saw her own, saw the exact nature both of mrs. drack's circumspection and of mrs. drack's sensibility, saw even, glittering there in letters of gold and as a part of the whole metallic coruscation, the large figure of her income, largest of all her attributes, and (though perhaps a little more as a luminous blur beside all this) the mingled ecstasy and agony of mr. pitman's hope and mr. pitman's fear. he was introducing them, with his pathetic belief in the virtue for every occasion, in the solvent for every trouble, of an extravagant, genial, professional humor; he was naming her to mrs. drack as the charming young friend he had told her so much about and who had been as an angel to him in a weary time; he was saying that the loveliest chance in the world, this accident of a meeting in those promiscuous halls, had placed within his reach the pleasure of bringing them together. it didn't indeed matter, julia felt, what he was saying: he conveyed everything, as far as she was concerned, by a moral pressure as unmistakable as if, for a symbol of it, he had thrown himself on her neck. above all, meanwhile, this high consciousness prevailed--that the good lady herself, however huge she loomed, had entered, by the end of a minute, into a condition as of suspended weight and arrested mass, stilled to artless awe by the fact of her vision. julia had practised almost to lassitude the art of tracing in the people who looked at her the impression promptly sequent; but it was a striking point that if, in irritation, in depression, she felt that the lightest eyes of men, stupid at their clearest, had given her pretty well all she should ever care for, she could still gather a freshness from the tribute of her own sex, still care to see her reflection in the faces of women. never, probably, never would that sweet be tasteless--with such a straight grim spoon was it mostly administered, and so flavored and strengthened by the competence of their eyes. women knew so much best _how_ a woman surpassed--how and where and why, with no touch or torment of it lost on them; so that as it produced mainly and primarily the instinct of aversion, the sense of extracting the recognition, of gouging out the homage, was on the whole the highest crown one's felicity could wear. once in a way, however, the grimness beautifully dropped, the jealousy failed: the admiration was all there and the poor plain sister handsomely paid it. it had never been so paid, she was presently certain, as by this great generous object of mr., pitman's flame, who without optical aid, it well might have seemed, nevertheless entirely grasped her--might in fact, all benevolently, have been groping her over as by some huge mild proboscis. she gave mrs. brack pleasure in short; and who could say of what other pleasures the poor lady hadn't been cheated? it was somehow a muddled world in which one of her conceivable joys, at this time of day, would be to marry mr. pitman--to say nothing of a state of things in which this gentleman's own fancy could invest such a union with rapture. that, however, was their own mystery, and julia, with each instant, was more and more clear about hers: so remarkably primed in fact, at the end of three minutes, that though her friend, and though _his_ friend, were both saying things, many things and perhaps quite wonderful things, she had no free attention for them and was only rising and soaring. she was rising to her value, she was soaring _with_ it--the value mr. pitman almost convulsively imputed to her, the value that consisted for her of being so unmistakably the most dazzling image mrs. brack had ever beheld. these were the uses, for julia, in fine, of adversity; the range of mrs. brack's experience might have been as small as the measure of her presence was large: julia was at any rate herself in face of the occasion of her life, and, after all her late repudiations and reactions, had perhaps never yet known the quality of this moment's success. she hadn't an idea of what, on either side, had been uttered--beyond mr. pitman's allusion to her having befriended him of old: she simply held his companion with her radiance and knew she might be, for her effect, as irrelevant as she chose. it was relevant to do what he wanted--it was relevant to dish herself. she did it now with a kind of passion, to say nothing of her knowing, with it, that every word of it added to her beauty. she gave him away in short, up to the hilt, for any use of her own, and should have nothing to clutch at now but the possibility of murray brush. "he says i was good to him, mrs. drack; and i'm sure i hope i was, since i should be ashamed to be anything else. if i could be good to him now i should be glad--that's just what, a while ago, i rushed up to him here, after so long, to give myself the pleasure of saying. i saw him years ago very particularly, very miserably tried--and i saw the way he took it. i did see it, you dear man," she sublimely went on--"i saw it for all you may protest, for all you may hate me to talk about you! i saw you behave like a gentleman--since mrs. drack agrees with me, so charmingly, that there are not many to be met. i don't know whether you care, mrs. drack"--she abounded, she revelled in the name--"but i've always remembered it of him: that under the most extraordinary provocation he was decent and patient and brave. no appearance of anything different matters, for i speak of what i _know_. of course i'm nothing and nobody; i'm only a poor frivolous girl, but i was very close to him at the time. that's all my little story--if it _should_ interest you at all." she measured every beat of her wing, she knew how high she was going and paused only when it was quite vertiginous. here she hung a moment as in the glare of the upper blue; which was but the glare--what else could it be?--of the vast and magnificent attention of both her auditors, hushed, on their side, in the splendor she emitted. she had at last to steady herself, and she scarce knew afterward at what rate or in what way she had still inimitably come down--her own eyes fixed all the while on the very figure of her achievement. she had sacrificed her mother on the altar--proclaimed her as false and cruel: and if that didn't "fix" mr. pitman, as he would have said--well, it was all she could do. but the cost of her action already somehow came back to her with increase; the dear gaunt man fairly wavered, to her sight, in the glory of it, as if signalling at her, with wild gleeful arms, from some mount of safety, while the massive lady just spread and spread like a rich fluid a bit helplessly spilt. it was really the outflow of the poor woman's honest response, into which she seemed to melt, and julia scarce distinguished the two apart even for her taking gracious leave of each. "good-bye, mrs. drack; i'm awfully happy to have met you"--like as not it was for this she had grasped mr. pitman's hand. and then to him or to her, it didn't matter which, "good-bye, dear good mr. pitman--hasn't it been nice after so long?" ii julia floated even to her own sense swan-like away--she left in her wake their fairly stupefied submission: it was as if she had, by an exquisite authority, now _placed_ them, each for each, and they would have nothing to do but be happy together. never had she so exulted as on this ridiculous occasion in the noted items of her beauty. _le compte y était_, as they used to say in paris--every one of them, for her immediate employment, was there; and there was something in it after all. it didn't necessarily, this sum of thumping little figures, imply charm--especially for "refined" people: nobody knew better than julia that inexpressible charm and quotable "charms" (quotable like prices, rates, shares, or whatever, the things they dealt in down-town) are two distinct categories; the safest thing for the latter being, on the whole, that it might include the former, and the great strength of the former being that it might perfectly dispense with the latter. mrs. drack was not refined, not the least little bit; but what would be the case with murray brush now--after his three years of europe? he had done so what he liked with her--which had seemed so then just the meaning, hadn't it? of their being "engaged"--that he had made her not see, while the absurdity lasted (the absurdity of their pretending to believe they could marry without a cent), how little he was of metal without alloy: this had come up for her, remarkably, but afterward--come up for her as she looked back. then she had drawn her conclusion, which was one of the many that basil french had made her draw. it was a queer service basil was going to have rendered her, this having made everything she had ever done impossible, if he wasn't going to give her a new chance. if he was it was doubtless right enough. on the other hand, murray might have improved, if such a quantity of alloy, as she called it, _were_, in any man, reducible, and if paris were the place all happily to reduce it. she had her doubts--anxious and aching on the spot, and had expressed them to mr. pitman: certainly, of old, he had been more open to the quotable than to the inexpressible, to charms than to charm. if she could try the quotable, however, and with such a grand result, on mrs. drack, she couldn't now on murray--in respect to whom everything had changed. so that if he hadn't a sense for the subtler appeal, the appeal appreciable by people _not_ vulgar, on which alone she could depend, what on earth would become of her? she could but yearningly hope, at any rate, as she made up her mind to write to him immediately at his club. it was a question of the right sensibility in him. perhaps he would have acquired it in europe. two days later indeed--for he had promptly and charmingly replied, keeping with alacrity the appointment she had judged best to propose for a morning hour in a sequestered alley of the park--two days later she was to be struck well-nigh to alarm by everything he had acquired: so much it seemed to make that it threatened somehow a complication, and her plan, so far as she had arrived at one, dwelt in the desire above all to simplify. she wanted no grain more of extravagance or excess of anything--risking as she had done, none the less, a recall of ancient license in proposing to murray such a place of meeting. she had her reasons--she wished intensely to discriminate: basil french had several times waited on her at her mother's habitation, their horrible flat which was so much too far up and too near the east side; he had dined there and lunched there and gone with her thence to other places, notably to see pictures, and had in particular adjourned with her twice to the metropolitan museum, in which he took a great interest, in which she professed a delight, and their second visit to which had wound up in her encounter with mr. pitman, after her companion had yielded, at her urgent instance, to an exceptional need of keeping a business engagement. she mightn't, in delicacy, in decency, entertain murray brush where she had entertained mr. french--she was given over now to these exquisite perceptions and proprieties and bent on devoutly observing them; and mr. french, by good-luck, had never been with her in the park: partly because he had never pressed it, and partly because she would have held off if he had, so haunted were those devious paths and favoring shades by the general echo of her untrammelled past. if he had never suggested their taking a turn there this was because, quite divinably, he held it would commit him further than he had yet gone; and if she on her side had practised a like reserve it was because the place reeked for her, as she inwardly said, with old associations. it reeked with nothing so much perhaps as with the memories evoked by the young man who now awaited her in the nook she had been so competent to indicate; but in what corner of the town, should she look for them, wouldn't those footsteps creak back into muffled life, and to what expedient would she be reduced should she attempt to avoid all such tracks? the museum was full of tracks, tracks by the hundred--the way really she had knocked about!--but she had to see people somewhere, and she couldn't pretend to dodge every ghost. all she could do was not to make confusion, make mixtures, of the living; though she asked herself enough what mixture she mightn't find herself to have prepared if mr. french should, not so very impossibly, for a restless, roaming man--_her_ effect on him!--happen to pass while she sat there with the mustachioed personage round whose name mrs. maule would probably have caused detrimental anecdote most thickly to cluster. there existed, she was sure, a mass of luxuriant legend about the "lengths" her engagement with murray brush had gone; she could herself fairly feel them in the air, these streamers of evil, black flags flown as in warning, the vast redundancy of so cheap and so dingy social bunting, in fine, that flapped over the stations she had successively moved away from and which were empty now, for such an ado, even to grotesqueness. the vivacity of that conviction was what had at present determined her, while it was the way he listened after she had quickly broken ground, while it was the special character of the interested look in his handsome face, handsomer than ever yet, that represented for her the civilization he had somehow taken on. just so it was the quantity of that gain, in its turn, that had at the end of ten minutes begun to affect her as holding up a light to the wide reach of her step. "there was never anything the least serious between us, not a sign or a scrap, do you mind? of anything beyond the merest pleasant friendly acquaintance; and if you're not ready to go to the stake on it for me you may as well know in time what it is you'll probably cost me." she had immediately plunged, measuring her effect and having thought it well over; and what corresponded to her question of his having become a better person to appeal to was the appearance of interest she had so easily created in him. she felt on the spot the difference that made--it was indeed his form of being more civilized: it was the sense in which europe in general and paris in particular had made him develop. by every calculation--and her calculations, based on the intimacy of her knowledge, had been many and deep--he would help her the better the more intelligent he should have become; yet she was to recognize later on that the first chill of foreseen disaster had been caught by her as, at a given moment, this greater refinement of his attention seemed to exhale it. it was just what she had wanted--"if i can only get him interested--!" so that, this proving quite vividly possible, why did the light it lifted strike her as lurid? was it partly by reason of his inordinate romantic good looks, those of a gallant, genial conqueror, but which, involving so glossy a brownness of eye, so manly a crispness of curl, so red-lipped a radiance of smile, so natural a bravery of port, prescribed to any response he might facially, might expressively, make a sort of florid, disproportionate amplitude? the explanation, in any case, didn't matter; he was going to mean well--that she could feel, and also that he had meant better in the past, presumably, than he had managed to convince her of his doing at the time: the oddity she hadn't now reckoned with was this fact that from the moment he did advertise an interest it should show almost as what she would have called weird. it made a change in him that didn't go with the rest--as if he had broken his nose or put on spectacles, lost his handsome hair or sacrificed his splendid mustache: her conception, her necessity, as she saw, had been that something should be added to him for her use, but nothing for his own alteration. he had affirmed himself, and his character, and his temper, and his health, and his appetite, and his ignorance, and his obstinacy, and his whole charming, coarse, heartless personality, during their engagement, by twenty forms of natural emphasis, but never by emphasis of interest. how in fact could you feel interest unless you should know, within you, some dim stir of imagination? there was nothing in the world of which murray brush was less capable than of such a dim stir, because you only began to imagine when you felt some approach to a need to understand. _he_ had never felt it; for hadn't he been born, to his personal vision, with that perfect intuition of everything which reduces all the suggested preliminaries of judgment to the impertinence--when it's a question of your entering your house--of a dumpage of bricks at your door? he had had, in short, neither to imagine nor to perceive, because he had, from the first pulse of his intelligence, simply and supremely known: so that, at this hour, face to face with him, it came over her that she had, in their old relation, dispensed with any such convenience of comprehension on his part even to a degree she had not measured at the time. what therefore must he not have seemed to her as a form of life, a form of avidity and activity, blatantly successful in its own conceit, that he could have dazzled her so against the interest of her very faculties and functions? strangely and richly historic all that backward mystery, and only leaving for her mind the wonder of such a mixture of possession and detachment as they would clearly to-day both know. for each to be so little at last to the other when, during months together, the idea of all abundance, all quantity, had been, for each, drawn from the other and addressed to the other--what was it monstrously like but some fantastic act of getting rid of a person by going to lock yourself up in the _sanctum sanctorum_ of that person's house, amid every evidence of that person's habits and nature? what was going to happen, at any rate, was that murray would show himself as beautifully and consciously understanding--and it would be prodigious that europe should have inoculated him with that delicacy. yes, he wouldn't claim to know now till she had told him--an aid to performance he had surely never before waited for, or been indebted to, from any one; and then, so knowing, he would charmingly endeavor to "meet," to oblige and to gratify. he would find it, her case, ever so worthy of his benevolence, and would be literally inspired to reflect that he must hear about it first. she let him hear then everything, in spite of feeling herself slip, while she did so, to some doom as yet incalculable; she went on very much as she had done for mr. pitman and mrs. drack, with the rage of desperation and, as she was afterward to call it to herself, the fascination of the abyss. she didn't know, couldn't have said at the time, _why_ his projected benevolence should have had most so the virtue to scare her: he would patronize her, as an effect of her vividness, if not of her charm, and would do this with all high intention, finding her case, or rather _their_ case, their funny old case, taking on of a sudden such refreshing and edifying life, to the last degree curious and even important; but there were gaps of connection between this and the intensity of the perception here overtaking her that she shouldn't be able to move in _any_ direction without dishing herself. that she couldn't afford it where she had got to--couldn't afford the deplorable vulgarity of having been so many times informally affianced and contracted (putting it only at that, at its being by the new lights and fashions so unpardonably vulgar): he took this from her without turning, as she might have said, a hair; except just to indicate, with his new superiority, that he felt the distinguished appeal and notably the pathos of it. he still took it from her that she hoped nothing, as it were, from any other _alibi_--the people to drag into court being too many and too scattered; but that, as it was with him, murray brush, she had been _most_ vulgar, most everything she had better not have been, so she depended on him for the innocence it was actually vital she should establish. he flushed or frowned or winced no more at that than he did when she once more fairly emptied her satchel and, quite as if they had been nancy and the artful dodger, or some nefarious pair of that sort, talking things over in the manner of _oliver twist_, revealed to him the fondness of her view that, could she but have produced a cleaner slate, she might by this time have pulled it off with mr. french. yes, he let her in that way sacrifice her honorable connection with him--all the more honorable for being so completely at an end--to the crudity of her plan for not missing another connection, so much more brilliant than what he offered, and for bringing another man, with whom she so invidiously and unflatteringly compared him, into her greedy life. there was only a moment during which, by a particular lustrous look she had never had from him before, he just made her wonder which turn he was going to take; she felt, however, as safe as was consistent with her sense of having probably but added to her danger, when he brought out, the next instant: "don't you seem to take the ground that we were guilty--that _you_ were ever guilty--of something we shouldn't have been? what did we ever do that was secret, or underhand, or any way not to be acknowledged? what did we do but exchange our young vows with the best faith in the world--publicly, rejoicingly, with the full assent of every one connected with us? i mean of course," he said with his grave kind smile, "till we broke off so completely because we found that--practically, financially, on the hard worldly basis--we couldn't work it. what harm, in the sight of god or man, julia," he asked in his fine rich way, "did we ever do?" she gave him back his look, turning pale. "am i talking of _that_? am i talking of what _we_ know? i'm talking of what others feel--of what they _have_ to feel; of what it's just enough for them to know not to be able to get over it, once they do really know it. how do they know what _didn't_ pass between us, with all the opportunities we had? that's none of their business--if we were idiots enough, on the top of everything! what you may or mayn't have done doesn't count, for _you_; but there are people for whom it's loathsome that a girl should have gone on like that from one person to another and still pretend to be--well, all that a nice girl is supposed to be. it's as if we had but just waked up, mother and i, to such a remarkable prejudice; and now we have it--when we could do so well without it!--staring us in the face. that mother should have insanely _let_ me, should so vulgarly have taken it for my natural, my social career--_that's_ the disgusting, humiliating thing: with the lovely account it gives of both of us! but mother's view of a delicacy in things!" she went on with scathing grimness; "mother's measure of anything, with her grand 'gained cases' (there'll be another yet, she finds them so easy!) of which she's so publicly proud! you see i've no margin," said julia; letting him take it from her flushed face as much as he would that her mother hadn't left her an inch. it was that he should make use of the spade with her for the restoration of a bit of a margin just wide enough to perch on till the tide of peril should have ebbed a little, it was that he should give her _that_ lift--! well, it was all there from him after these last words; it was before her that he really took hold. "oh, my dear child, i can see! of course there are people--ideas change in our society so fast!--who are not in sympathy with the old american freedom and who read, i dare say, all sorts of uncanny things into it. naturally you must take them as they are--from the moment," said murray brush, who had lighted, by her leave, a cigarette, "your life-path does, for weal or for woe, cross with theirs." he had every now and then such an elegant phrase. "awfully interesting, certainly, your case. it's enough for me that it _is_ yours--i make it my own. i put myself absolutely in your place; you'll understand from me, without professions, won't you? that i do. command me in every way! what i do like is the sympathy with which you've inspired _him_. i don't, i'm sorry to say, happen to know him personally,"--he smoked away, looking off; "but of course one knows all about him generally, and i'm sure he's right for you, i'm sure it would be charming, if you yourself think so. therefore trust me and even--what shall i say?--leave it to me a little, won't you?" he had been watching, as in his fumes, the fine growth of his possibilities; and with this he turned on her the large warmth of his charity. it was like a subscription of a half-a-million. "i'll take care of you." she found herself for a moment looking up at him from as far below as the point from which the school-child, with round eyes raised to the wall, gazes at the parti-colored map of the world. yes, it was a warmth, it was a special benignity, that had never yet dropped on her from any one; and she wouldn't for the first few moments have known how to describe it or even quite what to do with it. then, as it still rested, his fine improved expression aiding, the sense of what had happened came over her with a rush. she was being, yes, patronized; and that was really as new to her--the freeborn american girl who might, if she had wished, have got engaged and disengaged not six times but sixty--as it would have been to be crowned or crucified. the frenches themselves didn't do it--the frenches themselves didn't dare it. it was as strange as one would: she recognized it when it came, but anything might have come rather--and it was coming by (of all people in the world) murray brush! it overwhelmed her; still she could speak, with however faint a quaver and however sick a smile. "you'll lie for me like a gentleman?" "as far as that goes till i'm black in the face!" and then while he glowed at her and she wondered if he would pointedly look his lies that way, and if, in fine, his florid, gallant, knowing, almost winking intelligence, _common_ as she had never seen the common vivified, would represent his notion of "blackness": "see here, julia; i'll do more." "'more'--?" "everything. i'll take it right in hand. i'll fling over you--" "fling over me--?" she continued to echo as he fascinatingly fixed her. "well, the biggest _kind_ of rose-colored mantle!" and this time, oh, he did wink: it _would_ be the way he was going to wink (and in the grandest good faith in the world) when indignantly denying, under inquisition, that there had been "a sign or a scrap" between them. but there was more to come; he decided she should have it all. "julia, you've got to know now." he hung fire but an instant more. "julia, i'm going to be married." his "julias" were somehow death to her; she could feel that even _through_ all the rest. "julia, i announce my engagement." "oh, lordy, lordy!" she wailed: it might have been addressed to mr. pitman. the force of it had brought her to her feet, but he sat there smiling up as at the natural tribute of her interest. "i tell you before any one else; it's not to be 'out' for a day or two yet. but we want you to know; _she_ said that as soon as i mentioned to her that i had heard from you. i mention to her everything, you see!"--and he almost simpered while, still in his seat, he held the end of his cigarette, all delicately and as for a form of gentle emphasis, with the tips of his fine fingers. "you've not met her, mary lindeck, i think: she tells me she hasn't the pleasure of knowing you, but she desires it so much--particularly longs for it. she'll take an interest too," he went on; "you must let me immediately bring her to you. she has heard so much about you and she really wants to see you." "oh mercy _me_!" poor julia gasped again--so strangely did history repeat itself and so did this appear the echo, on murray brush's lips, and quite to drollery, of that sympathetic curiosity of mrs. drack's which mr. pitman had, as they said, voiced. well, there had played before her the vision of a ledge of safety in face of a rising tide; but this deepened quickly to a sense more forlorn, the cold swish of waters already up to her waist and that would soon be up to her chin. it came really but from the air of her friend, from the perfect benevolence and high unconsciousness with which he kept his posture--as if to show he could patronize her from below upward quite as well as from above down. and as she took it all in, as it spread to a flood, with the great lumps and masses of truth it was floating, she knew inevitable submission, not to say submersion, as she had never known it in her life; going down and down before it, not even putting out her hands to resist or cling by the way, only reading into the young man's very face an immense fatality and, for all his bright nobleness his absence of rancor or of protesting pride, the great gray blankness of her doom. it was as if the earnest miss lindeck, tall and mild, high and lean, with eye-glasses and a big nose, but "marked" in a noticeable way, elegant and distinguished and refined, as you could see from a mile off, and as graceful, for common despair of imitation, as the curves of the "copy" set of old by one's writing-master--it was as if this stately well-wisher, whom indeed she had never exchanged a word with, but whom she had recognized and placed and winced at as soon as he spoke of her, figured there beside him now as also in portentous charge of her case. he had ushered her into it in that way as if his mere right word sufficed; and julia could see them throne together, beautifully at one in all the interests they now shared, and regard her as an object of almost tender solicitude. it was positively as if they had become engaged for her good--in such a happy light as it shed. that was the way people you had known, known a bit intimately, looked at you as soon as they took on the high matrimonial propriety that sponged over the more or less wild past to which you belonged, and of which, all of a sudden, they were aware only through some suggestion it made them for reminding you definitely that you still had a place. on her having had a day or two before to meet mrs. drack and to rise to her expectation she had seen and felt herself act, had above all admired herself, and had at any rate known what she said, even though losing, at her altitude, any distinctness in the others. she could have repeated later on the detail of her performance--if she hadn't preferred to keep it with her as a mere locked-up, a mere unhandled treasure. at present, however, as everything was for her at first deadened and vague, true to the general effect of sounds and motions in water, she couldn't have said afterward what words she spoke, what face she showed, what impression she made--at least till she had pulled herself round to precautions. she only knew she had turned away, and that this movement must have sooner or later determined his rising to join her, his deciding to accept it, gracefully and condoningly--condoningly in respect to her natural emotion, her inevitable little pang--for an intimation that they would be better on their feet. they trod then afresh their ancient paths; and though it pressed upon her hatefully that he must have taken her abruptness for a smothered shock, the flare-up of her old feeling at the breath of his news, she had still to see herself condemned to allow him this, condemned really to encourage him in the mistake of believing her suspicious of feminine spite and doubtful of miss lindeck's zeal. she was so far from doubtful that she was but too appalled at it and at the officious mass in which it loomed, and this instinct of dread, before their walk was over, before she had guided him round to one of the smaller gates, there to slip off again by herself, was positively to find on the bosom of her flood a plank by the aid of which she kept in a manner and for the time afloat. she took ten minutes to pant, to blow gently, to paddle disguisedly, to accommodate herself, in a word, to the elements she had let loose; but as a reward of her effort at least she then saw how her determined vision accounted for everything. beside her friend on the bench she had truly felt all his cables cut, truly swallowed down the fact that if he still perceived she was pretty--and _how_ pretty!--it had ceased appreciably to matter to him. it had lighted the folly of her preliminary fear, the fear of his even yet to some effect of confusion or other inconvenience for her, proving more alive to the quotable in her, as she had called it, than to the inexpressible. she had reckoned with the awkwardness of that possible failure of his measure of her charm, by which his renewed apprehension of her grosser ornaments, those with which he had most affinity, might too much profit; but she need have concerned herself as little for his sensibility on one head as on the other. she had ceased personally, ceased materially--in respect, as who should say, to any optical or tactile advantage--to exist for him, and the whole office of his manner had been the more piously and gallantly to dress the dead presence with flowers. this was all to his credit and his honor, but what it clearly certified was that their case was at last not even one of spirit reaching out to spirit. _he_ had plenty of spirit--had all the spirit required for his having engaged himself to miss lindeck, into which result, once she had got her head well up again, she read, as they proceeded, one sharp meaning after another. it was therefore toward the subtler essence of that mature young woman alone that he was occupied in stretching; what was definite to him about julia bride being merely, being entirely--which was indeed thereby quite enough--that she _might_ end by scaling her worldly height. they would push, they would shove, they would "boost," they would arch both their straight backs as pedestals for her tiptoe; and at the same time, by some sweet prodigy of mechanics, she would pull them up and up with her. wondrous things hovered before her in the course of this walk; her consciousness had become, by an extraordinary turn, a music-box in which, its lid well down, the most remarkable tunes were sounding. it played for her ear alone, and the lid, as she might have figured, was her firm plan of holding out till she got home, of not betraying--to her companion at least--the extent to which she was demoralized. to see him think her demoralized by mistrust of the sincerity of the service to be meddlesomely rendered her by his future wife--she would have hurled herself publicly into the lake there at their side, would have splashed, in her beautiful clothes, among the frightened swans, rather than invite him to that ineptitude. oh, her sincerity, mary lindeck's--she would be drenched with her sincerity, and she would be drenched, yes, with _his_; so that, from inward convulsion to convulsion, she had, before they reached their gate, pulled up in the path. there was something her head had been full of these three or four minutes, the intensest little tune of the music-box, and it made its way to her lips now; belonging--for all the good it could do her!--to the two or three sorts of solicitude she might properly express. "i hope _she_ has a fortune, if you don't mind my speaking of it: i mean some of the money we didn't in _our_ time have--and that we missed, after all, in our poor way and for what we then wanted of it, so quite dreadfully." she had been able to wreathe it in a grace quite equal to any he himself had employed; and it was to be said for him also that he kept up, on this, the standard. "oh, she's not, thank goodness, at all badly off, poor dear. we shall do very well. how sweet of you to have thought of it! may i tell her that too?" he splendidly glared. yes, he glared--how couldn't he, with what his mind was really full of? but, all the same, he came just here, by her vision, nearer than at any other point to being a gentleman. he came quite within an ace of it--with his taking from her thus the prescription of humility of service, his consenting to act in the interest of her avidity, his letting her mount that way, on his bowed shoulders, to the success in which he could suppose she still believed. he couldn't know, he would never know, that she had then and there ceased to believe in it--that she saw as clear as the sun in the sky the exact manner in which, between them, before they had done, the murray brushes, all zeal and sincerity, all interest in her interesting case, would dish, would ruin, would utterly destroy her. he wouldn't have needed to go on, for the force and truth of this; but he did go on--he was as crashingly consistent as a motorcar without a brake. he was visibly in love with the idea of what they might do for her and of the rare "social" opportunity that they would, by the same stroke, embrace. how he had been offhand with it, how he had made it parenthetic, that he didn't happen "personally" to know basil french--as if it would have been at all likely he _should_ know him, even _im_ personally, and as if he could conceal from her the fact that, since she had made him her overture, this gentleman's name supremely baited her hook! oh, they would help julia bride if they could--they would do their remarkable best; but they would at any rate have made his acquaintance over it, and she might indeed leave the rest to their thoroughness. he would already have known, he would already have heard; her appeal, she was more and more sure, wouldn't have come to him as a revelation. he had already talked it over with _her_, with miss lindeck, to whom the frenches, in their fortress, had never been accessible, and his whole attitude bristled, to julia's eyes, with the betrayal of her hand, her voice, her pressure, her calculation. his tone, in fact, as he talked, fairly thrust these things into her face. "but you must see her for yourself. you'll judge her. you'll love her. my dear child"--he brought it all out, and if he spoke of children he might, in his candor, have been himself infantine--"my dear child, she's the person to do it for you. make it over to her; but," he laughed, "of course see her first! couldn't you," he wound up--for they were now near their gate, where she was to leave him--"couldn't you just simply make us meet him, at tea say, informally; just _us_ alone, as pleasant old friends of whom you'd have so naturally and frankly spoken to him: and then see what we'd _make_ of that?" it was all in his expression; he couldn't keep it out of that, and his shining good looks couldn't: ah, he was so fatally much too handsome for her! so the gap showed just there, in his admirable mask and his admirable eagerness; the yawning little chasm showed where the gentleman fell short. but she took this in, she took everything in, she felt herself do it, she heard herself say, while they paused before separation, that she quite saw the point of the meeting, as he suggested, at her tea. she would propose it to mr. french and would let them know; and he must assuredly bring miss lindeck, bring her "right away," bring her soon, bring _them_, his fiancée and her, together somehow, and as quickly as possible--so that they _should_ be old friends before the tea. she would propose it to mr. french, propose it to mr. french: that hummed in her ears as she went--after she had really got away; hummed as if she were repeating it over, giving it out to the passers, to the pavement, to the sky, and all as in wild discord with the intense little concert of her music-box. the extraordinary thing too was that she quite believed she should do it, and fully meant to; desperately, fantastically passive--since she almost reeled with it as she proceeded--she was capable of proposing anything to any one: capable too of thinking it likely mr. french would come, for he had never on her previous proposals declined anything. yes, she would keep it up to the end, this pretence of owing them salvation, and might even live to take comfort in having done for them what they wanted. what they wanted _couldn't_ but be to get at the frenches, and what miss lindeck above all wanted, baffled of it otherwise, with so many others of the baffled, was to get at mr. french--for all mr. french would want of either of them!--still more than murray did. it was not till after she had got home, got straight into her own room and flung herself on her face, that she yielded to the full taste of the bitterness of missing a connection, missing the man himself, with power to create such a social appetite, such a grab at what might be gained by them. he could make people, even people like these two and whom there were still other people to envy, he could make them push and snatch and scramble like that--and then remain as incapable of taking her from the hands of such patrons as of receiving her straight, say, from those of mrs. drack. it was a high note, too, of julia's wonderful composition that, even in the long, lonely moan of her conviction of her now certain ruin, all this grim lucidity, the perfect clearance of passion, but made her supremely proud of him. a lodging for the night _robert louis stevenson_ <UNK> it was late in november <UNK> the snow fell over paris with rigorous, relentless persistence; sometimes the wind made a sally and scattered it in flying vortices; sometimes there was a lull, and flake after flake descended out of the black night air, silent, circuitous, interminable. to poor people, looking up under moist eyebrows, it seemed a wonder where it all came from. master francis villon had propounded an alternative that afternoon, at a tavern window: was it only pagan jupiter plucking geese upon olympus, or were the holy angels moulting? he was only a poor master of arts, he went on; and as the question somewhat touched upon divinity, he durst not venture to conclude. a silly old priest from montargis, who was among the company, treated the young rascal to a bottle of wine in honor of the jest and the grimaces with which it was accompanied, and swore on his own white beard that he had been just such another irreverent dog when he was villon's age. the air was raw and pointed, but not far below freezing; and the flakes were large, damp, and adhesive. the whole city was sheeted up. an army might have marched from end to end and not a footfall given the alarm. if there were any belated birds in heaven, they saw the island like a large white patch, and the bridges like slim white spars, on the black ground of the river. high up overhead the snow settled among the tracery of the cathedral towers. many a niche was drifted full; many a statue wore a long white bonnet on its grotesque or sainted head. the gargoyles had been transformed into great false noses, drooping toward the point. the crockets were like upright pillows swollen on one side. in the intervals of the wind there was a dull sound of dripping about the precincts of the church. the cemetery of st. john had taken its own share of the snow. all the graves were decently covered; tall, white housetops stood around in grave array; worthy burghers were long ago in bed, benightcapped like their domiciles; there was no light in all the neighborhood but a little peep from a lamp that hung swinging in the church choir, and tossed the shadows to and fro in time to its oscillations. the clock was hard on ten when the patrol went by with halberds and a lantern, beating their hands; and they saw nothing suspicious about the cemetery of st. john. yet there was a small house, backed up against the cemetery wall, which was still awake, and awake to evil purpose, in that snoring district. there was not much to betray it from without; only a stream of warm vapor from the chimney-top, a patch where the snow melted on the roof, and a few half-obliterated footprints at the door. but within, behind the shuttered windows, master francis villon, the poet, and some of the thievish crew with whom he consorted, were keeping the night alive and passing round the bottle. a great pile of living embers diffused a strong and ruddy glow from the arched chimney. before this straddled dom nicolas, the picardy monk, with his skirts picked up and his fat legs bared to the comfortable warmth. his dilated shadow cut the room in half; and the firelight only escaped on either side of his broad person, and in a little pool between his outspread feet. his face had the beery, bruised appearance of the continual drinker's; it was covered with a network of congested veins, purple in ordinary circumstances, but now pale violet, for even with his back to the fire the cold pinched him on the other side. his cowl had half fallen back, and made a strange excrescence on either side of his bull neck. so he straddled, grumbling, and cut the room in half with the shadow of his portly frame. on the right, villon and guy tabary were huddled together over a scrap of parchment; villon making a ballade which he was to call the _ballade of roast fish_, and tabary spluttering admiration at his shoulder. the poet was a rag of a man, dark, little, and lean, with hollow cheeks and thin black locks. he carried his four-and-twenty years with feverish animation. greed had made folds about his eyes, evil smiles had puckered his mouth. the wolf and pig struggled together in his face. it was an eloquent, sharp, ugly, earthly countenance. his hands were small and prehensile, with fingers knotted like a cord; and they were continually flickering in front of him in violent and expressive pantomime. as for tabary, a broad, complacent, admiring imbecility breathed from his squash nose and slobbering lips: he had become a thief, just as he might have become the most decent of burgesses, by the imperious chance that rules the lives of human geese and human donkeys. at the monk's other hand, montigny and thevenin pensete played a game of chance. about the first there clung some flavor of good birth and training, as about a fallen angel; something long, lithe, and courtly in the person; something aquiline and darkling in the face. thevenin, poor soul, was in great feather: he had done a good stroke of knavery that afternoon in the faubourg st. jacques, and all night he had been gaining from montigny. a flat smile illuminated his face; his bald head shone rosily in a garland of red curls; his little protuberant stomach shook with silent chucklings as he swept in his gains. "doubles or quits?" said thevenin. montigny nodded grimly. "_some may prefer to dine in state_" wrote villon, "_on bread and cheese on silver plate_. or--or--help me out, guido!" tabary giggled. "_or parsley on a silver dish_" scribbled the poet. the wind was freshening without; it drove the snow before it, and sometimes raised its voice in a victorious whoop, and made sepulchral grumblings in the chimney. the cold was growing sharper as the night went on. villon, protruding his lips, imitated the gust with something between a whistle and a groan. it was an eerie, uncomfortable talent of the poet's, much detested by the picardy monk. "can't you hear it rattle in the gibbet?" said villon. "they are all dancing the devil's jig on nothing, up there. you may dance, my gallants, you'll be none the warmer! whew, what a gust! down went somebody just now! a medlar the fewer on the three-legged medlar-tree!--i say, dom nicolas, it'll be cold to-night on the st. denis road?" he asked. dom nicolas winked both his big eyes, and seemed to choke upon his adam's apple. montfaucon, the great grisly paris gibbet, stood hard by the st. denis road, and the pleasantry touched him on the raw. as for tabary, he laughed immoderately over the medlars; he had never heard anything more light-hearted; and he held his sides and crowed. villon fetched him a fillip on the nose, which turned his mirth into an attack of coughing. "oh, stop that row," said villon, "and think of rhymes to 'fish.'" "doubles or quits," said montigny doggedly. "with all my heart," quoth thevenin. "is there any more in that bottle?" asked the monk. "open another," said villon. "how do you ever hope to fill that big hogshead, your body, with little things like bottles? and how do you expect to get to heaven? how many angels, do you fancy, can be spared to carry up a single monk from picardy? or do you think yourself another elias--and they'll send the coach for you?" "_hominibus impossibile_" replied the monk, as he filled his glass. tabary was in ecstasies. villon filliped his nose again. "laugh at my jokes, if you like," he said. "it was very good," objected tabary. villon made a face at him. "think of rhymes to 'fish,'" he said. "what have you to do with latin? you'll wish you knew none of it at the great assizes, when the devil calls for guido tabary, clericus--the devil with the humpback and red-hot finger-nails. talking of the devil," he added, in a whisper, "look at montigny!" all three peered covertly at the gamester. he did not seem to be enjoying his luck. his mouth was a little to a side; one nostril nearly shut, and the other much inflated. the black dog was on his back, as people say, in terrifying nursery metaphor; and he breathed hard under the gruesome burden. "he looks as if he could knife him," whispered tabary, with round eyes. the monk shuddered, and turned his face and spread his open hands to the red embers. it was the cold that thus affected dom nicolas, and not any excess of moral sensibility. "come now," said villon--"about this ballade. how does it run so far?" and beating time with his hand, he read it aloud to tabary. they were interrupted at the fourth rhyme by a brief and fatal movement among the gamesters. the round was completed, and thevenin was just opening his mouth to claim another victory, when montigny leaped up, swift as an adder, and stabbed him to the heart. the blow took effect before he had time to utter a cry, before he had time to move. a tremor or two convulsed his frame; his hands opened and shut, his heels rattled on the floor; then his head rolled backward over one shoulder with the eyes open, and thevenin pensete's spirit had returned to him who made it. everyone sprang to his feet; but the business was over in two twos. the four living fellows looked at each other in rather a ghastly fashion; the dead man contemplating a corner of the roof with a singular and ugly leer. "my god!" said tabary, and he began to pray in latin. villon broke out into hysterical laughter. he came a step forward and clucked a ridiculous bow at thevenin, and laughed still louder. then he sat down suddenly, all of a heap, upon a stool, and continued laughing bitterly as though he would shake himself to pieces. montigny recovered his composure first. "let's see what he has about him," he remarked; and he picked the dead man's pockets with a practised hand, and divided the money into four equal portions on the table. "there's for you," he said. the monk received his share with a deep sigh, and a single stealthy glance at the dead thevenin, who was beginning to sink into himself and topple sideways off the chair. "we're all in for it," cried villon, swallowing his mirth. "it's a hanging job for every man jack of us that's here--not to speak of those who aren't." he made a shocking gesture in the air with his raised right hand, and put out his tongue and threw his head on one side, so as to counterfeit the appearance of one who has been hanged. then he pocketed his share of the spoil, and executed a shuffle with his feet as if to restore the circulation. tabary was the last to help himself; he made a dash at the money, and retired to the other end of the apartment. montigny stuck thevenin upright in the chair, and drew out the dagger, which was followed by a jet of blood. "you fellows had better be moving," he said, as he wiped the blade on his victim's doublet. "i think we had," returned villon with a gulp. "damn his fat head!" he broke out. "it sticks in my throat like phlegm. what right has a man to have red hair when he is dead?" and he fell all of a heap again upon the stool, and fairly covered his face with his hands. montigny and dom nicolas laughed aloud, even tabary feebly chiming in. "cry baby," said the monk. "i always said he was a woman," added montigny with a sneer. "sit up, can't you?" he went on, giving another shake to the murdered body. "tread out that fire, nick." but nick was better employed; he was quietly taking villon's purse, as the poet sat, limp and trembling, on the stool where he had been making a ballade not three minutes before. montigny and tabary dumbly demanded a share of the booty, which the monk silently promised as he passed the little bag into the bosom of his gown. in many ways an artistic nature unfits a man for practical existence. no sooner had the theft been accomplished than villon shook himself, jumped to his feet, and began helping to scatter and extinguish the embers. meanwhile montigny opened the door and cautiously peered into the street. the coast was clear; there was no meddlesome patrol in sight. still it was judged wiser to slip out severally; and as villon was himself in a hurry to escape from the neighborhood of the dead thevenin, and the rest were in a still greater hurry to get rid of him before he should discover the loss of his money, he was the first by general consent to issue forth into the street. the wind had triumphed and swept all the clouds from heaven. only a few vapors, as thin as moonlight, fleeted rapidly across the stars. it was bitter cold; and by a common optical effect, things seemed almost more definite than in the broadest daylight. the sleeping city was absolutely still: a company of white hoods, a field full of little alps, below the twinkling stars. villon cursed his fortune. would it were still snowing! now, wherever he went he left an indelible trail behind him on the glittering streets; wherever he went he was still tethered to the house by the cemetery of st. john; wherever he went he must weave, with his own plodding feet, the rope that bound him to the crime and would bind him to the gallows. the leer of the dead man came back to him with a new significance. he snapped his fingers as if to pluck up his own spirits, and choosing a street at random, stepped boldly forward in the snow. two things preoccupied him as he went: the aspect of the gallows at montfaucon in this bright windy phase of the night's existence, for one; and for another, the look of the dead man with his bald head and garland of red curls. both struck cold upon his heart, and he kept quickening his pace as if he could escape from unpleasant thoughts by mere fleetness of foot. sometimes he looked back over his shoulder with a sudden nervous jerk; but he was the only moving thing in the white streets, except when the wind swooped round a corner and threw up the snow, which was beginning to freeze, in spouts of glittering dust. suddenly he saw, a long way before him, a black clump and a couple of lanterns. the clump was in motion, and the lanterns swung as though carried by men walking. it was a patrol. and though it was merely crossing his line of march, he judged it wiser to get out of eyeshot as speedily as he could. he was not in the humor to be challenged, and he was conscious of making a very conspicuous mark upon the snow. just on his left hand there stood a great hotel, with some turrets and a large porch before the door; it was half-ruinous, he remembered, and had long stood empty; and so he made three steps of it and jumped inside the shelter of the porch. it was pretty dark inside, after the glimmer of the snowy streets, and he was groping forward with outspread hands, when he stumbled over some substance which offered an indescribable mixture of resistances, hard and soft, firm and loose. his heart gave a leap, and he sprang two steps back and stared dreadfully at the obstacle. then he gave a little laugh of relief. it was only a woman, and she dead. he knelt beside her to make sure upon this latter point. she was freezing cold, and rigid like a stick. a little ragged finery fluttered in the wind about her hair, and her cheeks had been heavily rouged that same afternoon. her pockets were quite empty; but in her stocking, underneath the garter, villon found two of the small coins that went by the name of whites. it was little enough; but it was always something; and the poet was moved with a deep sense of pathos that she should have died before she had spent her money. that seemed to him a dark and pitiable mystery; and he looked from the coins in his hand to the dead woman, and back again to the coins, shaking his head over the riddle of man's life. henry v. of england, dying at vincennes just after he had conquered france, and this poor jade cut off by a cold draught in a great man's doorway, before she had time to spend her couple of whites--it seemed a cruel way to carry on the world. two whites would have taken such a little while to squander; and yet it would have been one more good taste in the mouth, one more smack of the lips, before the devil got the soul, and the body was left to birds and vermin. he would like to use all his tallow before the light was blown out and the lantern broken. while these thoughts were passing through his mind, he was feeling, half-mechanically, for his purse. suddenly his heart stopped beating; a feeling of cold scales passed up the back of his legs, and a cold blow seemed to fall upon his scalp. he stood petrified for a moment; then he felt again with one feverish movement; and then his loss burst upon him, and he was covered with perspiration. to spendthrifts money is so living and actual--it is such a thin veil between them and their pleasures! there is only one limit to their fortune--that of time; and a spendthrift with only a few crowns is the emperor of rome until they are spent. for such a person to lose his money is to suffer the most shocking reverse, and fall from heaven to hell, from all to nothing, in a breath. and all the more if he has put his head in the halter for it; if he may be hanged to-morrow for that same purse, so dearly earned, so foolishly departed. villon stood and cursed; he threw the two whites into the street; he shook his fist at heaven; he stamped, and was not horrified to find himself trampling the poor corpse. then he began rapidly to retrace his steps toward the house beside the cemetery. he had forgotten all fear of the patrol, which was long gone by at any rate, and had no idea but that of his lost purse. it was in vain that he looked right and left upon the snow; nothing was to be seen. he had not dropped it in the streets. had it fallen in the house? he would have liked dearly to go in and see; but the idea of the grisly occupant unmanned him. and he saw besides, as he drew near, that their efforts to put out the fire had been unsuccessful; on the contrary, it had broken into a blaze, and a changeful light played in the chinks of the door and window, and revived his terror for the authorities and paris gibbet. he returned to the hotel with the porch, and groped about upon the snow for the money he had thrown away in his childish passion. but he could only find one white; the other had probably struck sideways and sunk deeply in. with a single white in his pocket, all his projects for a rousing night in some wild tavern vanished utterly away. and it was not only pleasure that fled laughing from his grasp; positive discomfort, positive pain, attacked him as he stood ruefully before the porch. his perspiration had dried upon him; and though the wind had now fallen, a binding frost was setting in stronger with every hour, and he felt benumbed and sick at heart. what was to be done? late as was the hour, improbable as was success, he would try the house of his adopted father, the chaplain of st. benoit. he ran there all the way, and knocked timidly. there was no answer. he knocked again and again, taking heart with every stroke; and at last steps were heard approaching from within. a barred wicket fell open in the iron-studded door, and emitted a gush of yellow light. "hold up your face to the wicket," said the chaplain from within. "it's only me," whimpered villon. "oh, it's only you, is it?" returned the chaplain; and he cursed him with foul unpriestly oaths for disturbing him at such an hour, and bade him be off to hell, where he came from. "my hands are blue to the wrists," pleaded villon; "my feet are dead and full of twinges; my nose aches with the sharp air; the cold lies at my heart. i may be dead before morning. only this once, father, and before god i will never ask again." "you should have come earlier," said the ecclesiastic, coolly. "young men require a lesson now and then." he shut the wicket and retired deliberately into the interior of the house. villon was beside himself; he beat upon the door with his hands and feet, and shouted hoarsely after the chaplain. "wormy old fox," he cried. "if i had my hand under your twist, i would send you flying headlong into the bottomless pit." a door shut in the interior, faintly audible to the poet down long passages. he passed his hand over his mouth with an oath. and then the humor of the situation struck him, and he laughed and looked lightly up to heaven, where the stars seemed to be winking over his discomfiture. what was to be done? it looked very like a night in the frosty streets. the idea of the dead woman popped into his imagination, and gave him a hearty fright; what had happened to her in the early night might very well happen to him before morning. and he so young! and with such immense possibilities of disorderly amusement before him! he felt quite pathetic over the notion of his own fate, as if it had been some one else's, and made a little imaginative vignette of the scene in the morning when they should find his body. he passed all his chances under review, turning the white between his thumb and forefinger. unfortunately he was on bad terms with some old friends who would once have taken pity on him in such a plight. he had lampooned them in verses, he had beaten and cheated them; and yet now, when he was in so close a pinch, he thought there was at least one who might perhaps relent. it was a chance. it was worth trying at least, and he would go and see. on the way, two little accidents happened to him which colored his musings in a very different manner. for, first, he fell in with the track of a patrol, and walked in it for some yards, although it lay out of his direction. and this spirited him up; at least he had confused his trail; for he was still possessed with the idea of people tracking him all about paris over the snow, and collaring him next morning before he was awake. the other matter affected him very differently. he passed a street corner, where, not so long before, a woman and her child had been devoured by wolves. this was just the kind of weather, he reflected, when wolves might take it into their heads to enter paris again; and a lone man in these deserted streets would run the chance of something worse than a mere scare. he stopped and looked upon the place with unpleasant interest--it was a centre where several lanes intersected each other; and he looked down them all one after another, and held his breath to listen, lest he should detect some galloping black things on the snow or hear the sound of howling between him and the river. he remembered his mother telling him the story and pointing out the spot, while he was yet a child. his mother! if he only knew where she lived, he might make sure at least of shelter. he determined he would inquire upon the morrow: nay, he would go and see her, too, poor old girl! so thinking, he arrived at his destination--his last hope for the night. the house was quite dark, like its neighbors, and yet after a few taps, he heard a movement overhead, a door opening, and a cautious voice asking who was there. the poet named himself in a loud whisper, and waited, not without some trepidation, the result. nor had he to wait long. a window was suddenly opened, and a pailful of slops splashed down upon the doorstep. villon had not been unprepared for something of the sort, and had put himself as much in shelter as the nature of the porch admitted; but for all that, he was deplorably drenched below the waist. his hose began to freeze almost at once. death from cold and exposure stared him in the face; he remembered he was of phthisical tendency, and began coughing tentatively. but the gravity of the danger steadied his nerves. he stopped a few hundred yards from the door where he had been so rudely used, and reflected with his finger to his nose. he could only see one way of getting a lodging, and that was to take it. he had noticed a house not far away which looked as if it might be easily broken into, and thither he betook himself promptly, entertaining himself on the way with the idea of a room still hot, with a table still loaded with the remains of supper, where he might pass the rest of the black hours, and whence he should issue, on the morrow, with an armful of valuable plate. he even considered on what viands and what wines he should prefer; and as he was calling the roll of his favorite dainties, roast fish presented itself to his mind with an odd mixture of amusement and horror. "i shall never finish that ballade," he thought to himself; and then, with another shudder at the recollection, "oh, damn his fat head!" he repeated fervently, and spat upon the snow. the house in question looked dark at first sight; but as villon made a preliminary inspection in search of the handiest point of attack, a little twinkle of light caught his eye from behind a curtained window. "the devil!" he thought. "people awake! some student or some saint, confound the crew! can't they get drunk and lie in bed snoring like their neighbors! what's the good of curfew, and poor devils of bell-ringers jumping at a rope's-end in bell-towers? what's the use of day, if people sit up all night? the gripes to them!" he grinned as he saw where his logic was leading him. "every man to his business, after all," added he, "and if they're awake, by the lord, i may come by a supper honestly for this once, and cheat the devil." he went boldly to the door, and knocked with an assured hand. on both previous occasions he had knocked timidly and with some dread of attracting notice; but now, when he had just discarded the thought of a burglarious entry, knocking at a door seemed a mighty simple and innocent proceeding. the sound of his blows echoed through the house with thin, phantasmal reverberations, as though it were quite empty; but these had scarcely died away before a measured tread drew near, a couple of bolts were withdrawn, and one wing was opened broadly, as though no guile or fear of guile were known to those within. a tall figure of a man, muscular and spare, but a little bent, confronted villon. the head was massive in bulk, but finely sculptured; the nose blunt at the bottom but refining upward to where it joined a pair of strong and honest eyebrows; the mouth and eyes surrounded with delicate markings, and the whole face based upon a thick white beard, boldly and squarely trimmed. seen as it was by the light of a flickering hand-lamp, it looked perhaps nobler than it had a right to do; but it was a fine face, honorable rather than intelligent, strong, simple, and righteous. "you knock late, sir," said the old man in resonant, courteous tones. villon cringed, and brought up many servile words of apology; at a crisis of this sort, the beggar was uppermost in him, and the man of genius hid his head with confusion. "you are cold," repeated the old man, "and hungry? well, step in." and he ordered him into the house with a noble enough gesture. "some great seigneur," thought villon, as his host, setting down the lamp on the flagged pavement of the entry, shot the bolts once more into their places. "you will pardon me if i go in front," he said, when this was done; and he preceded the poet up-stairs into a large apartment, warmed with a pan of charcoal and lit by a great lamp hanging from the roof. it was very bare of furniture; only some gold plate on a sideboard; some folios; and a stand of armor between the windows. some smart tapestry hung upon the walls, representing the crucifixion of our lord in one piece, and in another a scene of shepherds and shepherdesses by a running stream. over the chimney was a shield of arms. "will you seat yourself," said the old man, "and forgive me if i leave you? i am alone in my house to-night, and if you are to eat i must forage for you myself." no sooner was his host gone than villon leaped from the chair on which he just seated himself, and began examining the room, with the stealth and passion of a cat. he weighed the gold flagons in his hand, opened all the folios, and investigated the arms upon the shield, and the stuff with which the seats were lined. he raised the window-curtains, and saw that the windows were set with rich stained glass in figures, so far as he could see, of martial import. then he stood in the middle of the room, drew a long breath, and retaining it with puffed cheeks, looked round and round him, turning on his heels, as if to impress every feature of the apartment on his memory. "seven pieces of plate," he said. "if there had been ten i would have risked it. a fine house, and a fine old master, so help me all the saints." and just then, hearing the old man's tread returning along the corridor, he stole back to his chair, and began toasting his wet legs before the charcoal pan. his entertainer had a plate of meat in one hand and a jug of wine in the other. he set down the plate upon the table, motioning villon to draw in his chair, and going to the sideboard, brought back two goblets, which he filled. "i drink to your better fortune," he said, gravely touching villon's cup with his own. "to our better acquaintance," said the poet, growing bold. a mere man of the people would have been awed by the courtesy of the old seigneur, but villon was hardened in that matter; he had made mirth for great lords before now, and found them as black rascals as himself. and so he devoted himself to the viands with a ravenous gusto, while the old man, leaning backward, watched him with steady, curious eyes. "you have blood on your shoulder, my man," he said. montigny must have laid his wet right hand upon him as he left the house. he cursed montigny in his heart. "it was none of my shedding," he stammered. "i had not supposed so," returned his host quietly. "a brawl?" "well, something of that sort," villon admitted with a quaver. "perhaps a fellow murdered?" "oh, no, not murdered," said the poet, more and more confused. "it was all fair play--murdered by accident. i had no hand in it, god strike me dead!" he added fervently. "one rogue the fewer, i dare say," observed the master of the house. "you may dare to say that," agreed villon, infinitely relieved. "as big a rogue as there is between here and jerusalem. he turned up his toes like a lamb. but it was a nasty thing to look at. i dare say you've seen dead men in your time, my lord?" he added, glancing at the armor. "many," said the old man. "i have followed the wars, as you imagine." villon laid down his knife and fork, which he had just taken up again. "were any of them bald?" he asked. "oh, yes, and with hair as white as mine." "i don't think i would mind the white so much," said villon. "his was red." and he had a return of his shuddering and tendency to laughter, which he drowned with a great draught of wine. "i'm a little put out when i think of it," he went on. "i knew him--damn him! and the cold gives a man fancies--or the fancies give a man cold, i don't know which." "have you any money?" asked the old man. "i have one white," returned the poet, laughing. "i got it out of a dead jade's stocking in a porch. she was as dead as caesar, poor wench, and as cold as a church, with bits of ribbon sticking in her hair. this is a hard world in winter for wolves and wenches and poor rogues like me." "i," said the old man, "am enguerrand de la feuillee, seigneur de brisetout, bailly du patatrac. who and what may you be?" villon rose and made a suitable reverence. "i am called francis villon," he said, "a poor master of arts of this university. i know some latin, and a deal of vice. i can make chansons, ballades, lais, virelais, and roundels, and i am very fond of wine. i was born in a garret, and i shall not improbably die upon the gallows. i may add, my lord, that from this night forward i am your lordship's very obsequious servant to command." "no servant of mine," said the knight; "my guest for this evening, and no more." "a very grateful guest," said villon, politely; and he drank in dumb show to his entertainer. "you are shrewd," began the old man, tapping his forehead, "very shrewd; you have learning; you are a clerk; and yet you take a small piece of money off a dead woman in the street. is it not a kind of theft?" "it is a kind of theft much practised in the wars, my lord." "the wars are the field of honor," returned the old man proudly. "there a man plays his life upon the cast; he fights in the name of his lord the king, his lord god, and all their lordships the holy saints and angels." "put it," said villon, "that i were really a thief, should i not play my life also, and against heavier odds?" "for gain, and not for honor." "gain?" repeated villon with a shrug. "gain! the poor fellow wants supper, and takes it. so does the soldier in a campaign. why, what are all these requisitions we hear so much about? if they are not gain to those who take them, they are loss enough to the others. the men-at-arms drink by a good fire, while the burgher bites his nails to buy them wine and wood. i have seen a good many ploughmen swinging on trees about the country; ay, i have seen thirty on one elm, and a very poor figure they made; and when i asked some one how all these came to be hanged, i was told it was because they could not scrape together enough crowns to satisfy the men-at-arms." "these things are a necessity of war, which the low-born must endure with constancy. it is true that some captains drive overhard; there are spirits in every rank not easily moved by pity; and, indeed, many follow arms who are no better than brigands." "you see," said the poet, "you cannot separate the soldier from the brigand; and what is a thief but an isolated brigand with circumspect manners? i steal a couple of mutton chops, without so much as disturbing the farmer's sheep; the farmer grumbles a bit, but sups none the less wholesomely on what remains. you come up blowing gloriously on a trumpet, take away the whole sheep, and beat the farmer pitifully into the bargain. i have no trumpet; i am only tom, dick, or harry; i am a rogue and a dog, and hanging's too good for me--with all my heart--but just you ask the farmer which of us he prefers, just find out which of us he lies awake to curse on cold nights." "look at us two," said his lordship. "i am old, strong, and honored. if i were turned from my house to-morrow, hundreds would be proud to shelter me. poor people would go out and pass the night in the streets with their children, if i merely hinted that i wished to be alone. and i find you up, wandering homeless, and picking farthings off dead women by the wayside! i fear no man and nothing; i have seen you tremble and lose countenance at a word. i wait god's summons contentedly in my own house, or, if it please the king to call me out again, upon the field of battle. you look for the gallows; a rough, swift death, without hope or honor. is there no difference between these two?" "as far as to the moon," villon acquiesced. "but if i had been born lord of brisetout, and you had been the poor scholar francis, would the difference have been any the less? should not i have been warming my knees at this charcoal pan, and would not you have been groping for farthings in the snow? should not i have been the soldier, and you the thief?" "a thief!" cried the old man. "i a thief! if you understood your words, you would repent them." villon turned out his hands with a gesture of inimitable impudence. "if your lordship had done me the honor to follow my argument!" he said. "i do you too much honor in submitting to your presence," said the knight. "learn to curb your tongue when you speak with old and honorable men, or some one hastier than i may reprove you in a sharper fashion." and he rose and paced the lower end of the apartment, struggling with anger and antipathy. villon surreptitiously refilled his cup, and settled himself more comfortably in the chair, crossing his knees and leaning his head upon one hand and the elbow against the back of the chair. he was now replete and warm; and he was in nowise frightened for his host, having gauged him as justly as was possible between two such different characters. the night was far spent, and in a very comfortable fashion after all; and he felt morally certain of a safe departure on the morrow. "tell me one thing," said the old man, pausing in his walk. "are you really a thief?" "i claim the sacred rights of hospitality," returned the poet. "my lord, i am." "you are very young," the knight continued. "i should never have been so old," replied villon; showing his fingers, "if i had not helped myself with these ten talents. they have been my nursing mothers and my nursing fathers." "you may still repent and change." "i repent daily," said the poet. "there are few people more given to repentance than poor francis. as for change, let somebody change my circumstances. a man must continue to eat, if it were only that he may continue to repent." "the change must begin in the heart," returned the old man solemnly. "my dear lord," answered villon, "do you really fancy that i steal for pleasure? i hate stealing, like any other piece of work or danger. my teeth chatter when i see a gallows. but i must eat, i must drink, i must mix in society of some sort. what the devil! man is not a solitary animal--_cui deus foeminam tradit_. make me king's pantler--make me abbot of st. denis; make me bailly of the patatrac; and then i shall be changed indeed. but as long as you leave me the poor scholar francis villon, without a farthing, why, of course, i remain the same." "the grace of god is all-powerful." "i should be a heretic to question it," said francis. "it has made you lord of brisetout, and bailly of the patatrac; it has given me nothing but the quick wits under my hat and these ten toes upon my hands. may i help myself to wine? i thank you respectfully. by god's grace, you have a very superior vintage." the lord of brisetout walked to and fro with his hands behind his back. perhaps he was not yet quite settled in his mind about the parallel between thieves and soldiers; perhaps villon had interested him by some cross-thread of sympathy; perhaps his wits were simply muddled by so much unfamiliar reasoning; but whatever the cause, he somehow yearned to convert the young man to a better way of thinking, and could not make up his mind to drive him forth again into the street. "there is something more than i can understand in this," he said, at length. "your mouth is full of subtleties, and the devil has led you very far astray; but the devil is only a very weak spirit before god's truth, and all his subtleties vanish at a word of true honor, like darkness at morning. listen to me once more. i learned long ago that a gentleman should live chivalrously and lovingly to god, and the king, and his lady; and though i have seen many strange things done, i have still striven to command my ways upon that rule. it is not only written in all noble histories, but in every man's heart, if he will take care to read. you speak of food and wine, and i know very well that hunger is a difficult trial to endure; but you do not speak of other wants; you say nothing of honor, of faith to god and other men, of courtesy, of love without reproach. it may be that i am not very wise--and yet i think i am--but you seem to me like one who has lost his way and made a great error in life. you are attending to the little wants, and you have totally forgotten the great and only real ones, like a man who should be doctoring a toothache on the judgment day. for such things as honor and love and faith are not only nobler than food and drink, but, indeed, i think that we desire them more, and suffer more sharply for their absence. i speak to you as i think you will most easily understand me. are you not, while careful to fill your belly, disregarding another appetite in your heart, which spoils the pleasure of your life and keeps you continually wretched?" villon was sensibly nettled under all this sermonizing. "you think i have no sense of honor!" he cried. "i'm poor enough, god knows! it's hard to see rich people with their gloves, and you blowing your hands. an empty belly is a bitter thing, although you speak so lightly of it. if you had had as many as i, perhaps you would change your tune. anyway, i'm a thief--make the most of that--but i'm not a devil from hell, god strike me dead. i would have you to know i've an honor of my own, as good as yours, though i don't prate about it all day long, as if it were a god's miracle to have any. it seems quite natural to me; i keep it in its box till it's wanted. why now, look you here, how long have i been in this room with you? did you not tell me you were alone in the house? look at your gold plate! you're strong, if you like, but you're old and unarmed, and i have my knife. what did i want but a jerk of the elbow, and here would have been you with the cold steel in your bowels, and there would have been me, linking in the streets, with an armful of gold cups! did you suppose i hadn't wit enough to see that? and i scorned the action. there are your damned goblets, as safe as in a church; there are you, with your heart ticking as good as new; and here am i, ready to go out again as poor as i came in, with my one white that you threw in my teeth! and you think i have no sense of honor--god strike me dead!" the old man stretched out his right arm. "i will tell you what you are," he said. "you are a rogue, my man, an impudent and a black-hearted rogue and vagabond. i have passed an hour with you. oh! believe me, i feel myself disgraced! and you have eaten and drank at my table. but now i am sick at your presence; the day has come, and the night-bird should be off to his roost. will you go before, or after?" "which you please," returned the poet, rising. "i believe you to be strictly honorable." he thoughtfully emptied his cup. "i wish i could add you were intelligent," he went on, knocking on his head with his knuckles. "age, age! the brains stiff and rheumatic." the old man preceded him from a point of self-respect; villon followed, whistling, with his thumbs in his girdle. "god pity you," said the lord of brisetout at the door. "good-bye, papa," returned villon, with a yawn. "many thanks for the cold mutton." the door closed behind him. the dawn was breaking over the white roofs. a chill, uncomfortable morning ushered in the day. villon stood and heartily stretched himself in the middle of the road.

the imperishable ghost introduction ghosts are the true immortals, and the dead grow more alive all the time. wraiths have a greater vitality to-day than ever before. they are far more numerous than at any time in the past, and people are more interested in them. there are persons that claim to be acquainted with specific spirits, to speak with them, to carry on correspondence with them, and even some who insist that they are private secretaries to the dead. others of us mortals, more reserved, are content to keep such distance as we may from even the shadow of a shade. but there's no getting away from ghosts nowadays, for even if you shut your eyes to them in actual life, you stumble over them in the books you read, you see them on the stage and on the screen, and you hear them on the lecture platform. even a lodge in any vast wilderness would have the company of spirits. man's love for the supernatural, which is one of the most natural things about him, was never more marked than at present. you may go a-ghosting in any company to-day, and all aspects of literature, novels, short stories, poetry, and drama alike, reflect the shadeless spirit. the latest census of the haunting world shows a vast increase in population, which might be explained on various grounds. life is so inconveniently complex nowadays, what with income taxes and other visitations of government, that it is hard for us to have the added risk of wraiths, but there's no escaping. many persons of to-day are in the same mental state as one mr. boggs, told of in a magazine story, a rural gentleman who was agitated over spectral visitants. he had once talked at a séance with a speaker who claimed to be the spirit of his brother, wesley boggs, but who conversed only on blue suspenders, a subject not of vital interest to wesley in the flesh. "still," mr. boggs reflected, "i'm not so darn sure!" in answer to a suggestion regarding subliminal consciousness and dual personality as explanation of the strange things that come bolting into life, he said, "it's crawly any way you look at it. ghosts inside you are as bad as ghosts outside you." there are others to-day who are "not so darn sure!" one may conjecture divers reasons for this multitude of ghosts in late literature. perhaps spooks are like small boys that rush to fires, unwilling to miss anything, and craving new sensations. and we mortals read about them to get vicarious thrills through the safe _medium_ of fiction. the war made sensationalists of us all, and the drab everydayness of mortal life bores us. man's imagination, always bigger than his environment, overleaps the barriers of time and space and claims all worlds as eminent domain, so that literature, which he has the power to create, as he cannot create his material surroundings, possesses a dramatic intensity, an epic sweep, unknown in actuality. in the last analysis, man is as great as his daydreams--or his nightmares! ghosts have always haunted literature, and doubtless always will. specters seem never to wear out or to die, but renew their tissue both of person and of raiment, in marvelous fashion, so that their number increases with a malthusian relentlessness. we of to-day have the ghosts that haunted our ancestors, as well as our own modern revenants, and there's no earthly use trying to banish or exorcise them by such a simple thing as disbelief in them. schopenhauer asserts that a belief in ghosts is born with man, that it is found in all ages and in all lands, and that no one is free from it. since accounts vary, and our earliest antecedents were poor diarists, it is difficult to establish the apostolic succession of spooks in actual life, but in literature, the line reaches back as far as the primeval picture writing. a study of animism in primitive culture shows many interesting links between the past and the present in this matter. and anyhow, since man knows that whether or not he has seen a ghost, presently he'll be one, he's fascinated with the subject. and he creates ghosts, not merely in his own image, but according to his dreams of power. the more man knows of natural laws, the keener he is about the supernatural. he may claim to have laid aside superstition, but he isn't to be believed in that. though he has discarded witchcraft and alchemy, it is only that he may have more time for psychical research; true, he no longer dabbles with ancient magic, but that is because the modern types, as the ouija board, entertain him more. he dearly loves to traffic with that other world of which he knows so little and concerning which he is so curious. perhaps the war, or possibly an increase in class consciousness, or unionization of spirits, or whatever, has greatly energized the ghost in our day and given him both ambition and strength to do more things than ever. maybe "pep tablets" have been discovered on the other side as well! no longer is the ghost content to be seen and not heard, to slink around in shadowy corners as apologetically as poor relations. wraiths now have a rambunctious vitality and self-assurance that are astonishing. even the ghosts of folks dead so long they have forgotten about themselves are yawning, stretching their skeletons, and starting out to do a little haunting. spooky creatures in such a wide diversity are abroad to-day that one is sometimes at a loss to know what to do "gin a body meet a body." ghosts are entering all sorts of activities now, so that mortals had better look alive, else they'll be crowded out of their place in the shade. the dead are too much with us! modern ghosts are less simple and primitive than their ancestors, and are developing complexes of various kinds. they are more democratic than of old, and have more of a diversity of interests, so that mortals have scarcely the ghost of a chance with them. they employ all the agencies and mechanisms known to mortals, and have in addition their own methods of transit and communication. whereas in the past a ghost had to stalk or glide to his haunts, now he limousines or airplanes, so that naturally he can get in more work than before. he uses the wireless to send his messages, and is expert in all manner of scientific lines. in fact, his infernal efficiency and knowledge of science constitute the worst terror of the current specter. who can combat a ghost that knows all about a chemical laboratory, that can add electricity to his other shocks, and can employ all mortal and immortal agencies as his own? science itself is supernatural, as we see when we look at it properly. modern literature, especially the most recent, shows a revival of old types of ghosts, together with the innovations of the new. there are specters that take a real part in the plot complication, and those that merely cast threatening looks at the living, or at least, are content to speak a piece and depart. some spirits are dumb, while others are highly elocutionary. ghosts vary in many respects. some are like the pallid shades of the past, altogether unlike the living and with an unmistakable spectral form--or lack of it. they sweep like mist through the air, or flutter like dead leaves in the gale--a gale always accompanying them as part of the stock furnishings. on the other hand, some revenants are so successfully made up that one doesn't believe them when they pridefully announce that they are wraiths. some of them are, in fact, so alive that they don't themselves know they're dead. it's going to be a great shock to some of them one of these days to wake up and find out they're demised! ghosts are more gregarious than in the past. formerly a shade slunk off by himself, as if ashamed of his profession, as if aware of the lack of cordiality with which he would be received, knowing that mortals shunned and feared him, and chary even of associating with his fellow-shades. he wraithed all by himself. the specters of the past--save in scenes of the lower world,--were usually solitary creatures, driven to haunt mortals from very lonesomeness. now we have a chance to study the mob psychology of ghosts, for they come in madding crowds whenever they like. ghosts at present are showing an active interest not only in public affairs, but in the arts as well. at least, we now have pictures and writing attributed to them. perhaps annoyed by some of the inaccuracies published concerning them--for authors have in the past taken advantage of the belief that ghosts couldn't write back--they have recently developed itching pens. they use all manner of utensils for expression now. there's the magic typewriter that spooks for john kendrick bangs, the boardwalk that patience worth executes for mrs. curran, and innumerable other specters that commandeer fountain pens and pencils and brushes to give their versions of infinity. there's a passion on the part of ghosts for being interviewed just now. at present book-reviewers, for instance, had better be careful, lest the wraiths take their own method of answering criticism. it isn't safe to speak or write with anything but respect of ghosts now. _de mortuis nil nisi bonum_, indeed! one should never make light of a shade. modern ghosts have a more pronounced personality than the specters of the past. they have more strength, of mind as well as of body, than the colorless revenants of earlier literature, and they produce a more vivid effect on the beholder and the reader. they know more surely what they wish to do, and they advance relentlessly and with economy of effort to the effecting of their purpose, whether it be of pure horror, of beauty, or pathos of humor. we have now many spirits in fiction that are pathetic without frightfulness, many that move us with a sense of poetic beauty rather than of curdling horror, who touch the heart as well as the spine of the reader. and the humorous ghost is a distinctive shade of to-day, with his quips and pranks and haunting grin. whatever a modern ghost wishes to do or to be, he is or does, with confidence and success. the spirit of to-day is terrifyingly visible or invisible at will. the dreadful presence of a ghost that one cannot see is more unbearable than the specter that one can locate and attempt to escape from. the invisible haunting is represented in this volume by fitz-james o'brien's _what was it?_ one of the very best of the type, and one that has strongly influenced others. o'brien's story preceded guy de maupassant's _le horla_ by several years, and must surely have suggested to maupassant as to bierce, in his _the damned thing_, the power of evil that can be felt but not seen. the wraith of the present carries with him more vital energy than his predecessors, is more athletic in his struggles with the unlucky wights he visits, and can coerce mortals to do his will by the laying on of hands as well as by the look or word. he speaks with more emphasis and authority, as well as with more human naturalness, than the earlier ghosts. he has not only all the force he possessed in life, but in many instances has an access of power, which makes man a poor protagonist for him. algernon blackwood's spirits of evil, for example, have a more awful potentiality than any living person could have, and their will to harm has been increased immeasurably by the accident of death. if the facts bear out the fear that such is the case in life as in fiction, some of our social customs will be reversed. a man will strive by all means to keep his deadly enemy alive, lest death may endow him with tenfold power to hurt. dark discarnate passions, disembodied hates, work evil where a simple ghost might be helpless and abashed. algernon blackwood has command over the spirits of air and fire and wave, so that his pages thrill with beauty and terror. he has handled almost all known aspects of the supernatural, and from his many stories he has selected for this volume _the willows_ as the best example of his ghostly art. apparitions are more readily recognizable at present than in the past, for they carry into eternity all the disfigurements or physical peculiarities that the living bodies possessed--a fact discouraging to all persons not conspicuous for good looks. freckles and warts, long noses and missing limbs distinguish the ghosts and aid in crucial identification. the thrill of horror in ambrose bierce's story, _the middle toe of the right foot_, is intensified by the fact that the dead woman who comes back in revenge to haunt her murderer, has one toe lacking as in life. and in a recent story a surgeon whose desire to experiment has caused him needlessly to sacrifice a man's life on the operating table, is haunted to death by the dismembered arm. fiction shows us various ghosts with half faces, and at least one notable spook that comes in half. such ability, it will be granted, must necessarily increase the haunting power, for if a ghost may send a foot or an arm or a leg to harry one person, he can dispatch his back-bone or his liver or his heart to upset other human beings simultaneously in a sectional haunting at once economically efficient and terrifying. _the beast with five fingers_, for instance, has a loathsome horror that a complete skeleton or conventionally equipped wraith could not achieve. who can doubt that a bodiless hand leaping around on its errands of evil has a menace that a complete six-foot frame could not duplicate? yet, in quiller-couch's _a pair of hands_, what pathos and beauty in the thought of the child hands coming back to serve others in homely tasks! surely no housewife in these helpless days would object to being haunted in such delicate fashion. ghosts of to-day have an originality that antique specters lacked. for instance, what story of the past has the awful thrill in andreyev's _lazarus_, that story of the man who came back from the grave, living, yet dead, with the horror of the unknown so manifest in his face that those who looked into his deep eyes met their doom? present-day writers skillfully combine various elements of awe with the supernatural, as madness with the ghostly, adding to the chill of fear which each concept gives. wilbur daniel steele's _the woman at seven brothers_ is an instance of that method. poe's _ligeia_, one of the best stories in any language, reveals the unrelenting will of the dead to effect its desire,--the dead wife triumphantly coming back to life through the second wife's body. olivia howard dunbar's _the shell of sense_ is another instance of jealousy reaching beyond the grave. _the messenger_, one of robert w. chambers's early stories and an admirable example of the supernatural, has various thrills, with its river of blood, its death's head moth, and the ancient but very active skull of the black priest who was shot as a traitor to his country, but lived on as an energetic and curseful ghost. _the shadows on the wall_, by mary e. wilkins freeman,--which one prominent librarian considers the best ghost story ever written,--is original in the method of its horrific manifestation. isn't it more devastating to one's sanity to see the shadow of a revenge ghost cast on the wall,--to know that a vindictive spirit is beside one but invisible--than to see the specter himself? under such circumstances, the sight of a skeleton or a sheeted phantom would be downright comforting. _the mass of shadows_, by anatole france, is an example of the modern tendency to show phantoms in groups, as contrasted with the solitary habits of ancient specters. here the spirits of those who had sinned for love could meet and celebrate mass together in one evening of the year. the delicate beauty of many of the modern ghostly stories is apparent in _the haunted orchard_, by richard le gallienne, for this prose poem has an appeal of tenderness rather than of terror. and everybody who has had affection for a dog will appreciate the pathos of the little sketch, by myla j. closser, _at the gate_. the dog appears more frequently as a ghost than does any other animal, perhaps because man feels that he is nearer the human,--though the horse is as intelligent and as much beloved. there is an innate pathos about a dog somehow, that makes his appearance in ghostly form more credible and sympathetic, while the ghost of any other animal would tend to have a comic connotation. other animals in fiction have power of magic--notably the cat--but they don't appear as spirits. but the dog is seen as a pathetic symbol of faithfulness, as a tragic sufferer, or as a terrible revenge ghost. dogs may come singly or in groups--edith wharton has five of different sorts in _kerfol_--or in packs, as in eden phillpotts's _another little heath hound_. an illuminating instance of the power of fiction over human faith is furnished by the case of arthur machen's _the bowmen_, included here. this story it is which started the whole tissue of legendry concerning supernatural aid given the allied armies during the war. this purely fictitious account of an angel army that saved the day at mons was so vivid that its readers accepted it as truth and obstinately clung to that idea in the face of mr. machen's persistent and bewildered explanations that he had invented the whole thing. editors wrote leading articles about it, ministers preached sermons on it, and the general public preferred to believe in the mons angels rather than in arthur machen. mr. machen has shown himself an artist in the supernatural, one whom his generation has not been discerning enough to appreciate. some of his material is painfully morbid, but his pen is magic and his inkwell holds many dark secrets. in this collection i have attempted to include specimens of a few of the distinctive types of modern ghosts, as well as to show the art of individual stories. examples of the humorous ghosts are omitted here, as a number of them will be brought together in _humorous ghost stories_, the companion volume to this. the ghost lover who reads these pages will think of others that he would like to see included--for i believe that readers are more passionately attached to their own favorite ghost tales than to any other form of literature. but critics will admit the manifest impossibility of bringing together in one volume all the famous examples of the art. some of the well-known tales, particularly the older ones on which copyright has expired, have been reprinted so often as to be almost hackneyed, while others have been of necessity omitted because of the limitations of space. d.s. new york, march, <UNK> contents introduction: the imperishable ghost the willows by algernon blackwood the shadows on the wall by

in america by e.p. dutton, and in england by everleigh nash, ltd. by permission of the publishers and algernon blackwood. i after leaving vienna, and long before you come to buda-pesth, the danube enters a region of singular loneliness and desolation, where its waters spread away on all sides regardless of a main channel, and the country becomes a swamp for miles upon miles, covered by a vast sea of low willow-bushes. on the big maps this deserted area is painted in a fluffy blue, growing fainter in color as it leaves the banks, and across it may be seen in large straggling letters the word _sümpfe_, meaning marshes. in high flood this great acreage of sand, shingle-beds, and willow-grown islands is almost topped by the water, but in normal seasons the bushes bend and rustle in the free winds, showing their silver leaves to the sunshine in an ever-moving plain of bewildering beauty. these willows never attain to the dignity of trees; they have no rigid trunks; they remain humble bushes, with rounded tops and soft outline, swaying on slender stems that answer to the least pressure of the wind; supple as grasses, and so continually shifting that they somehow give the impression that the entire plain is moving and _alive_. for the wind sends waves rising and falling over the whole surface, waves of leaves instead of waves of water, green swells like the sea, too, until the branches turn and lift, and then silvery white as their under-side turns to the sun. happy to slip beyond the control of stern banks, the danube here wanders about at will among the intricate network of channels intersecting the islands everywhere with broad avenues down which the waters pour with a shouting sound; making whirlpools, eddies, and foaming rapids; tearing at the sandy banks; carrying away masses of shore and willow-clumps; and forming new islands innumerable which shift daily in size and shape and possess at best an impermanent life, since the flood-time obliterates their very existence. properly speaking, this fascinating part of the river's life begins soon after leaving pressburg, and we, in our canadian canoe, with gipsy tent and frying-pan on board, reached it on the crest of a rising flood about mid-july. that very same morning, when the sky was reddening before sunrise, we had slipped swiftly through still-sleeping vienna, leaving it a couple of hours later a mere patch of smoke against the blue hills of the wienerwald on the horizon; we had breakfasted below fischeramend under a grove of birch trees roaring in the wind; and had then swept on the tearing current past orth, hainburg, petronell (the old roman carnuntum of marcus aurelius), and so under the frowning heights of theben on a spur of the carpathians, where the march steals in quietly from the left and the frontier is crossed between austria and hungary. racing along at twelve kilometers an hour soon took us well into hungary, and the muddy waters--sure sign of flood--sent us aground on many a shingle-bed, and twisted us like a cork in many a sudden belching whirlpool before the towers of pressburg (hungarian, poszóny) showed against the sky; and then the canoe, leaping like a spirited horse, flew at top speed under the gray walls, negotiated safely the sunken chain of the fliegende brücke ferry, turned the corner sharply to the left, and plunged on yellow foam into the wilderness of islands, sand-banks, and swamp-land beyond--the land of the willows. the change came suddenly, as when a series of bioscope pictures snaps down on the streets of a town and shifts without warning into the scenery of lake and forest. we entered the land of desolation on wings, and in less than half an hour there was neither boat nor fishing-hut nor red roof, nor any single sign of human habitation and civilization within sight. the sense of remoteness from the world of human kind, the utter isolation, the fascination of this singular world of willows, winds, and waters, instantly laid its spell upon us both, so that we allowed laughingly to one another that we ought by rights to have held some special kind of passport to admit us, and that we had, somewhat audaciously, come without asking leave into a separate little kingdom of wonder and magic--a kingdom that was reserved for the use of others who had a right to it, with everywhere unwritten warnings to trespassers for those who had the imagination to discover them. though still early in the afternoon, the ceaseless buffetings of a most tempestuous wind made us feel weary, and we at once began casting about for a suitable camping-ground for the night. but the bewildering character of the islands made landing difficult; the swirling flood carried us in-shore and then swept us out again; the willow branches tore our hands as we seized them to stop the canoe, and we pulled many a yard of sandy bank into the water before at length we shot with a great sideways blow from the wind into a backwater and managed to beach the bows in a cloud of spray. then we lay panting and laughing after our exertions on hot yellow sand, sheltered from the wind, and in the full blaze of a scorching sun, a cloudless blue sky above, and an immense army of dancing, shouting willow bushes, closing in from all sides, shining with spray and clapping their thousand little hands as though to applaud the success of our efforts. "what a river!" i said to my companion, thinking of all the way we had traveled from the source in the black forest, and how we had often been obliged to wade and push in the upper shallows at the beginning of june. "won't stand much nonsense now, will it?" he said, pulling the canoe a little farther into safety up the sand, and then composing himself for a nap. i lay by his side, happy and peaceful in the bath of the elements--water, wind, sand, and the great fire of the sun--thinking of the long journey that lay behind us, and of the great stretch before us to the black sea, and how lucky i was to have such a delightful and charming traveling companion as my friend, the swede. we had made many similar journeys together, but the danube, more than any other river i knew, impressed us from the very beginning with its _aliveness_. from its tiny bubbling entry into the world among the pinewood gardens of donaueschingen, until this moment when it began to play the great river-game of losing itself among the deserted swamps, unobserved, unrestrained, it had seemed to us like following the growth of some living creature. sleepy at first, but later developing violent desires as it became conscious of its deep soul, it rolled, like some huge fluid being, through all the countries we had passed, holding our little craft on its mighty shoulders, playing roughly with us sometimes, yet always friendly and well-meaning, till at length we had come inevitably to regard it as a great personage. how, indeed, could it be otherwise, since it told us so much of its secret life? at night we heard it singing to the moon as we lay in our tent, uttering that odd sibilant note peculiar to itself and said to be caused by the rapid tearing of the pebbles along its bed, so great is its hurrying speed. we knew, too, the voice of its gurgling whirlpools, suddenly bubbling up on a surface previously quite calm; the roar of its shallows and swift rapids; its constant steady thundering below all mere surface sounds; and that ceaseless tearing of its icy waters at the banks. how it stood up and shouted when the rains fell flat upon its face! and how its laughter roared out when the wind blew upstream and tried to stop its growing speed! we knew all its sounds and voices, its tumblings and foamings, its unnecessary splashing against the bridges; that self-conscious chatter when there were hills to look on; the affected dignity of its speech when it passed through the little towns, far too important to laugh; and all these faint, sweet whisperings when the sun caught it fairly in some slow curve and poured down upon it till the steam rose. it was full of tricks, too, in its early life before the great world knew it. there were places in the upper reaches among the swabian forests, when yet the first whispers of its destiny had not reached it, where it elected to disappear through holes in the ground, to appear again on the other side of the porous limestone hills and start a new river with another name; leaving, too, so little water in its own bed that we had to climb out and wade and push the canoe through miles of shallows! and a chief pleasure, in those early days of its irresponsible youth, was to lie low, like brer fox, just before the little turbulent tributaries came to join it from the alps, and to refuse to acknowledge them when in, but to run for miles side by side, the dividing line well marked, the very levels different, the danube utterly declining to recognize the new-comer. below passau, however, it gave up this particular trick, for there the inn comes in with a thundering power impossible to ignore, and so pushes and incommodes the parent river that there is hardly room for them in the long twisting gorge that follows, and the danube is shoved this way and that against the cliffs, and forced to hurry itself with great waves and much dashing to and fro in order to get through in time. and during the fight our canoe slipped down from its shoulder to its breast, and had the time of its life among the struggling waves. but the inn taught the old river a lesson, and after passau it no longer pretended to ignore new arrivals. this was many days back, of course, and since then we had come to know other aspects of the great creature, and across the bavarian wheat plain of straubing she wandered so slowly under the blazing june sun that we could well imagine only the surface inches were water, while below there moved, concealed as by a silken mantle, a whole army of undines, passing silently and unseen down to the sea, and very leisurely too, lest they be discovered. much, too, we forgave her because of her friendliness to the birds and animals that haunted the shores. cormorants lined the banks in lonely places in rows like short black palings; gray crows crowded the shingle-beds; storks stood fishing in the vistas of shallower water that opened up between the islands, and hawks, swans, and marsh birds of all sorts filled the air with glinting wings and singing, petulant cries. it was impossible to feel annoyed with the river's vagaries after seeing a deer leap with a splash into the water at sunrise and swim past the bows of the canoe; and often we saw fawns peering at us from the underbrush, or looked straight into the brown eyes of a stag as we charged full tilt round a corner and entered another reach of the river. foxes, too, everywhere haunted the banks, tripping daintily among the driftwood and disappearing so suddenly that it was impossible to see how they managed it. but now, after leaving pressburg, everything changed a little, and the danube became more serious. it ceased trifling. it was halfway to the black sea, within scenting distance almost of other, stranger countries where no tricks would be permitted or understood. it became suddenly grown-up, and claimed our respect and even our awe. it broke out into three arms, for one thing, that only met again a hundred kilometers farther down, and for a canoe there were no indications which one was intended to be followed. "if you take a side channel," said the hungarian officer we met in the pressburg shop while buying provisions, "you may find yourselves, when the flood subsides, forty miles from anywhere, high and dry, and you may easily starve. there are no people, no farms, no fishermen. i warn you not to continue. the river, too, is still rising, and this wind will increase." the rising river did not alarm us in the least, but the matter of being left high and dry by a sudden subsidence of the waters might be serious, and we had consequently laid in an extra stock of provisions. for the rest, the officer's prophecy held true, and the wind, blowing down a perfectly clear sky, increased steadily till it reached the dignity of a westerly gale. it was earlier than usual when we camped, for the sun was a good hour or two from the horizon, and leaving my friend still asleep on the hot sand, i wandered about in desultory examination of our hotel. the island, i found, was less than an acre in extent, a mere sandy bank standing some two or three feet above the level of the river. the far end, pointing into the sunset, was covered with flying spray which the tremendous wind drove off the crests of the broken waves. it was triangular in shape, with the apex upstream. i stood there for several minutes, watching the impetuous crimson flood bearing down with a shouting roar, dashing in waves against the bank as though to sweep it bodily away, and then swirling by in two foaming streams on either side. the ground seemed to shake with the shock and rush while the furious movement of the willow bushes as the wind poured over them increased the curious illusion that the island itself actually moved. above, for a mile or two, i could see the great river descending upon me: it was like looking up the slope of a sliding hill, white with foam, and leaping up everywhere to show itself to the sun. the rest of the island was too thickly grown with willows to make walking pleasant, but i made the tour, nevertheless. from the lower end the light, of course, changed, and the river looked dark and angry. only the backs of the flying waves were visible, streaked with foam, and pushed forcibly by the great puffs of wind that fell upon them from behind. for a short mile it was visible, pouring in and out among the islands, and then disappearing with a huge sweep into the willows, which closed about it like a herd of monstrous antediluvian creatures crowding down to drink. they made me think of gigantic sponge-like growths that sucked the river up into themselves. they caused it to vanish from sight. they herded there together in such overpowering numbers. altogether it was an impressive scene, with its utter loneliness, its bizarre suggestion; and as i gazed, long and curiously, a singular emotion began stir somewhere in the depths of me. midway in my delight of the wild beauty, there crept unbidden and unexplained, a curious feeling of disquietude, almost of alarm. a rising river, perhaps, always suggests something of the ominous: many of the little islands i saw before me would probably have been swept away by the morning; this resistless, thundering flood of water touched the sense of awe. yet i was aware that my uneasiness lay deeper far than the emotions of awe and wonder. it was not that i felt. nor had it directly to do with the power of the driving wind--this shouting hurricane that might almost carry up a few acres of willows into the air and scatter them like so much chaff over the landscape. the wind was simply enjoying itself, for nothing rose out of the flat landscape to stop it, and i was conscious of sharing its great game with a kind of pleasurable excitement. yet this novel emotion had nothing to do with the wind. indeed, so vague was the sense of distress i experienced, that it was impossible to trace it to its source and deal with it accordingly, though i was aware somehow that it had to do with my realization of our utter insignificance before this unrestrained power of the elements about me. the huge-grown river had something to do with it too--a vague, unpleasant idea that we had somehow trifled with these great elemental forces in whose power we lay helpless every hour of the day and night. for here, indeed, they were gigantically at play together, and the sight appealed to the imagination. but my emotion, so far as i could understand it, seemed to attach itself more particularly to the willow bushes, to these acres and acres of willows, crowding, so thickly growing there, swarming everywhere the eye could reach, pressing upon the river as though to suffocate it, standing in dense array mile after mile beneath the sky, watching, waiting, listening. and, apart quite from the elements, the willows connected themselves subtly with my malaise, attacking the mind insidiously somehow by reason of their vast numbers, and contriving in some way or other to represent to the imagination a new and mighty power, a power, moreover, not altogether friendly to us. great revelations of nature, of course, never fail to impress in one way or another, and i was no stranger to moods of the kind. mountains overawe and oceans terrify, while the mystery of great forests exercises a spell peculiarly its own. but all these, at one point or another, somewhere link on intimately with human life and human experience. they stir comprehensible, even if alarming, emotions. they tend on the whole to exalt. with this multitude of willows, however, it was something far different, i felt. some essence emanated from them that besieged the heart. a sense of awe awakened, true, but of awe touched somewhere by a vague terror. their serried ranks growing everywhere darker about me as the shadows deepened, moving furiously yet softly in the wind, woke in me the curious and unwelcome suggestion that we had trespassed here upon the borders of an alien world, a world where we were intruders, a world where we were not wanted or invited to remain--where we ran grave risks perhaps! the feeling, however, though it refused to yield its meaning entirely to analysis, did not at the time trouble me by passing into menace. yet it never left me quite, even during the very practical business of putting up the tent in a hurricane of wind and building a fire for the stew-pot. it remained, just enough to bother and perplex, and to rob a most delightful camping-ground of a good portion of its charm. to my companion, however, i said nothing, for he was a man i considered devoid of imagination. in the first place, i could never have explained to him what i meant, and in the second, he would have laughed stupidly at me if i had. there was a slight depression in the center of the island, and here we pitched the tent. the surrounding willows broke the wind a bit. "a poor camp," observed the imperturbable swede when at last the tent stood upright; "no stones and precious little firewood. i'm for moving on early to-morrow--eh? this sand won't hold anything." but the experience of a collapsing tent at midnight had taught us many devices, and we made the cosy gipsy house as safe as possible, and then set about collecting a store of wood to last till bedtime. willow bushes drop no branches, and driftwood was our only source of supply. we hunted the shores pretty thoroughly. everywhere the banks were crumbling as the rising flood tore at them and carried away great portions with a splash and a gurgle. "the island's much smaller than when we landed," said the accurate swede. "it won't last long at this rate. we'd better drag the canoe close to the tent, and be ready to start at a moment's notice. _i_ shall sleep in my clothes." he was a little distance off, climbing along the bank, and i heard his rather jolly laugh as he spoke. "by jove!" i heard him call, a moment later, and turned to see what had caused his exclamation; but for the moment he was hidden by the willows, and i could not find him. "what in the world's this?" i heard him cry again, and this time his voice had become serious. i ran up quickly and joined him on the bank. he was looking over the river, pointing at something in the water. "good heavens, it's a man's body!" he cried excitedly. "look!" a black thing, turning over and over in the foaming waves, swept rapidly past. it kept disappearing and coming up to the surface again. it was about twenty feet from the shore, and just as it was opposite to where we stood it lurched round and looked straight at us. we saw its eyes reflecting the sunset, and gleaming an odd yellow as the body turned over. then it gave a swift, gulping plunge, and dived out of sight in a flash. "an otter, by gad!" we exclaimed in the same breath, laughing. it _was_ an otter, alive, and out on the hunt; yet it had looked exactly like the body of a drowned man turning helplessly in the current. far below it came to the surface once again, and we saw its black skin, wet and shining in the sunlight. then, too, just as we turned back, our arms full of driftwood, another thing happened to recall us to the river bank. this time it really was a man, and what was more, a man in a boat. now a small boat on the danube was an unusual sight at any time, but here in this deserted region, and at flood time, it was so unexpected as to constitute a real event. we stood and stared. whether it was due to the slanting sunlight, or the refraction from the wonderfully illumined water, i cannot say, but, whatever the cause, i found it difficult to focus my sight properly upon the flying apparition. it seemed, however, to be a man standing upright in a sort of flat-bottomed boat, steering with a long oar, and being carried down the opposite shore at a tremendous pace. he apparently was looking across in our direction, but the distance was too great and the light too uncertain for us to make out very plainly what he was about. it seemed to me that he was gesticulating and making signs at us. his voice came across the water to us shouting something furiously but the wind drowned it so that no single word was audible. there was something curious about the whole appearance--man, boat, signs, voice--that made an impression on me out of all proportion to its cause. "he's crossing himself!" i cried. "look, he's making the sign of the cross!" "i believe you're right," the swede said, shading his eyes with his hand and watching the man out of sight. he seemed to be gone in a moment, melting away down there into the sea of willows where the sun caught them in the bend of the river and turned them into a great crimson wall of beauty. mist, too, had begun to rise, so that the air was hazy. "but what in the world is he doing at nightfall on this flooded river?" i said, half to myself. "where is he going at such a time, and what did he mean by his signs and shouting? d'you think he wished to warn us about something?" "he saw our smoke, and thought we were spirits probably," laughed my companion. "these hungarians believe in all sorts of rubbish: you remember the shopwoman at pressburg warning us that no one ever landed here because it belonged to some sort of beings outside man's world! i suppose they believe in fairies and elementals, possibly demons too. that peasant in the boat saw people on the islands for the first time in his life," he added, after a slight pause, "and it scared him, that's all." the swede's tone of voice was not convincing, and his manner lacked something that was usually there. i noted the change instantly while he talked, though without being able to label it precisely. "if they had enough imagination," i laughed loudly--i remember trying to make as much _noise_ as i could--"they might well people a place like this with the old gods of antiquity. the romans must have haunted all this region more or less with their shrines and sacred groves and elemental deities." the subject dropped and we returned to our stew-pot, for my friend was not given to imaginative conversation as a rule. moreover, just then i remember feeling distinctly glad that he was not imaginative; his stolid, practical nature suddenly seemed to me welcome and comforting. it was an admirable temperament, i felt: he could steer down rapids like a red indian, shoot dangerous bridges and whirlpools better than any white man i ever saw in a canoe. he was a grand fellow for an adventurous trip, a tower of strength when untoward things happened. i looked at his strong face and light curly hair as he staggered along under his pile of driftwood (twice the size of mine!), and i experienced a feeling of relief. yes, i was distinctly glad just then that the swede was--what he was, and that he never made remarks that suggested more than they said. "the river's still rising, though," he added, as if following out some thoughts of his own, and dropping his load with a gasp. "this island will be under water in two days if it goes on." "i wish the _wind_ would go down," i said. "i don't care a fig for the river." the flood, indeed, had no terrors for us; we could get off at ten minutes' notice, and the more water the better we liked it. it meant an increasing current and the obliteration of the treacherous shingle-beds that so often threatened to tear the bottom out of our canoe. contrary to our expectations, the wind did not go down with the sun. it seemed to increase with the darkness, howling overhead and shaking the willows round us like straws. curious sounds accompanied it sometimes, like the explosion of heavy guns, and it fell upon the water and the island in great flat blows of immense power. it made me think of the sounds a planet must make, could we only hear it, driving along through space. but the sky kept wholly clear of clouds, and soon after supper the full moon rose up in the east and covered the river and the plain of shouting willows with a light like the day. we lay on the sandy patch beside the fire, smoking, listening to the noises of the night round us, and talking happily of the journey we had already made, and of our plans ahead. the map lay spread in the door of the tent, but the high wind made it hard to study, and presently we lowered the curtain and extinguished the lantern. the firelight was enough to smoke and see each other's faces by, and the sparks flew about overhead like fireworks. a few yards beyond, the river gurgled and hissed, and from time to time a heavy splash announced the falling away of further portions of the bank. our talk, i noticed, had to do with the far-away scenes and incidents of our first camps in the black forest, or of other subjects altogether remote from the present setting, for neither of us spoke of the actual moment more than was necessary--almost as though we had agreed tacitly to avoid discussion of the camp and its incidents. neither the otter nor the boatman, for instance, received the honor of a single mention, though ordinarily these would have furnished discussion for the greater part of the evening. they were, of course, distinct events in such a place. the scarcity of wood made it a business to keep the fire going, for the wind, that drove the smoke in our faces wherever we sat, helped at the same time to make a forced draught. we took it in turn to make foraging expeditions into the darkness, and the quantity the swede brought back always made me feel that he took an absurdly long time finding it; for the fact was i did not care much about being left alone, and yet it always seemed to be my turn to grub about among the bushes or scramble along the slippery banks in the moonlight. the long day's battle with wind and water--such wind and such water!--had tired us both, and an early bed was the obvious program. yet neither of us made the move for the tent. we lay there, tending the fire, talking in desultory fashion, peering about us into the dense willow bushes, and listening to the thunder of wind and river. the loneliness of the place had entered our very bones, and silence seemed natural, for after a bit the sound of our voices became a trifle unreal and forced; whispering would have been the fitting mode of communication, i felt, and the human voice, always rather absurd amid the roar of the elements, now carried with it something almost illegitimate. it was like talking out loud in church, or in some place where it was not lawful, perhaps not quite _safe_, to be overheard. the eeriness of this lonely island, set among a million willows, swept by a hurricane, and surrounded by hurrying deep waters, touched us both, i fancy. untrodden by man, almost unknown to man, it lay there beneath the moon, remote from human influence, on the frontier of another world, an alien world, a world tenanted by willows only and the souls of willows. and we, in our rashness, had dared to invade it, even to make use of it! something more than the power of its mystery stirred in me as i lay on the sand, feet to fire, and peered up through the leaves at the stars. for the last time i rose to get firewood. "when this has burnt up," i said firmly, "i shall turn in," and my companion watched me lazily as i moved off into the surrounding shadows. for an unimaginative man i thought he seemed unusually receptive that night, unusually open to suggestion of things other than sensory. he too was touched by the beauty and loneliness of the place. i was not altogether pleased, i remember, to recognize this slight change in him, and instead of immediately collecting sticks, i made my way to the far point of the island where the moonlight on plain and river could be seen to better advantage. the desire to be alone had come suddenly upon me; my former dread returned in force; there was a vague feeling in me i wished to face and probe to the bottom. when i reached the point of sand jutting out among the waves, the spell of the place descended upon me with a positive shock. no mere "scenery" could have produced such an effect. there was something more here, something to alarm. i gazed across the waste of wild waters; i watched the whispering willows; i heard the ceaseless beating of the tireless wind; and, one and all, each in its own way, stirred in me this sensation of a strange distress. but the _willows_ especially: for ever they went on chattering and talking among themselves, laughing a little, shrilly crying out, sometimes sighing--but what it was they made so much to-do about belonged to the secret life of the great plain they inhabited. and it was utterly alien to the world i knew, or to that of the wild yet kindly elements. they made me think of a host of beings from another plane of life, another evolution altogether, perhaps, all discussing a mystery known only to themselves. i watched them moving busily together, oddly shaking their big bushy heads, twirling their myriad leaves even when there was no wind. they moved of their own will as though alive, and they touched, by some incalculable method, my own keen sense of the _horrible_. there they stood in the moonlight, like a vast army surrounding our camp, shaking their innumerable silver spears defiantly, formed all ready for an attack. the psychology of places, for some imaginations at least, is very vivid; for the wanderer, especially, camps have their "note" either of welcome or rejection. at first it may not always be apparent, because the busy preparations of tent and cooking prevent, but with the first pause--after supper usually--it comes and announces itself. and the note of this willow-camp now became unmistakably plain to me: we were interlopers, trespassers, we were not welcomed. the sense of unfamiliarity grew upon me as i stood there watching. we touched the frontier of a region where our presence was resented. for a night's lodging we might perhaps be tolerated; but for a prolonged and inquisitive stay--no! by all the gods of the trees and the wilderness, no! we were the first human influences upon this island, and we were not wanted. _the willows were against us_. strange thoughts like these, bizarre fancies, borne i know not whence, found lodgment in my mind as i stood listening. what, i thought, if, after all, these crouching willows proved to be alive; if suddenly they should rise up, like a swarm of living creatures, marshaled by the gods whose territory we had invaded, sweep towards us off the vast swamps, booming overhead in the night--and then _settle down_! as i looked it was so easy to imagine they actually moved, crept nearer, retreated a little, huddled together in masses, hostile, waiting for the great wind that should finally start them a-running. i could have sworn their aspect changed a little, and their ranks deepened and pressed more closely together. the melancholy shrill cry of a night bird sounded overhead, and suddenly i nearly lost my balance as the piece of bank i stood upon fell with a great splash into the river, undermined by the flood. i stepped back just in time, and went on hunting for firewood again, half laughing at the odd fancies that crowded so thickly into my mind and cast their spell upon me. i recall the swede's remark about moving on next day, and i was just thinking that i fully agreed with him, when i turned with a start and saw the subject of my thoughts standing immediately in front of me. he was quite close. the roar of the elements had covered his approach. "you've been gone so long," he shouted above the wind, "i thought something must have happened to you." but there was that in his tone, and a certain look in his face as well, that conveyed to me more than his actual words, and in a flash i understood the real reason for his coming. it was because the spell of the place had entered his soul too, and he did not like being alone. "river still rising," he cried, pointing to the flood in the moonlight, "and the wind's simply awful." he always said the same things, but it was the cry for companionship that gave the real importance to his words. "lucky," i cried back, "our tent's in the hollow. i think it'll hold all right." i added something about the difficulty of finding wood, in order to explain my absence, but the wind caught my words and flung them across the river, so that he did not hear, but just looked at me through the branches, nodding his head. "lucky if we get away without disaster!" he shouted, or words to that effect; and i remember feeling half angry with him for putting the thought into words, for it was exactly what i felt myself. there was disaster impending somewhere, and the sense of presentiment lay unpleasantly upon me. we went back to the fire and made a final blaze, poking it up with our feet. we took a last look round. but for the wind the heat would have been unpleasant. i put this thought into words, and i remember my friend's reply struck me oddly: that he would rather have the heat, the ordinary july weather, than this "diabolical wind." everything was snug for the night; the canoe lying turned over beside the tent, with both yellow paddles beneath her; the provision sack hanging from a willow stem, and the washed-up dishes removed to a safe distance from the fire, all ready for the morning meal. we smothered the embers of the fire with sand, and then turned in. the flap of the tent door was up, and i saw the branches and the stars and the white moonlight. the shaking willows and the heavy buffetings of the wind against our taut little house were the last things i remembered as sleep came down and covered all with its soft and delicious forgetfulness. ii suddenly i found myself lying awake, peering from my sandy mattress through the door of the tent. i looked at my watch pinned against the canvas, and saw by the bright moonlight that it was past twelve o'clock--the threshold of a new day--and i had therefore slept a couple of hours. the swede was asleep still beside me; the wind howled as before something plucked at my heart and made me feel afraid. there was a sense of disturbance in my immediate neighborhood. i sat up quickly and looked out. the trees were swaying violently to and fro as the gusts smote them, but our little bit of green canvas lay snugly safe in the hollow, for the wind passed over it without meeting enough resistance to make it vicious. the feeling of disquietude did not pass however, and i crawled quietly out of the tent to see if our belongings were safe. i moved carefully so as not to waken my companion. a curious excitement was on me. i was halfway out, kneeling on all fours, when my eye first took in that the tops of the bushes opposite, with their moving tracery of leaves, made shapes against the sky. i sat back on my haunches and stared. it was incredible, surely, but there, opposite and slightly above me, were shapes of some indeterminate sort among the willows, and as the branches swayed in the wind they seemed to group themselves about these shapes, forming a series of monstrous outlines that shifted rapidly beneath the moon. close, about fifty feet in front of me, i saw these things. my first instinct was to waken my companion that he too might see them, but something made me hesitate--the sudden realization, probably, that i should not welcome corroboration; and meanwhile i crouched there staring in amazement with smarting eyes. i was wide awake. i remember saying to myself that i was _not_ dreaming. they first became properly visible, these huge figures, just within the tops of the bushes--immense bronze-colored, moving, and wholly independent of the swaying of the branches. i saw them plainly and noted, now i came to examine them more calmly, that they were very much larger than human, and indeed that something in their appearance proclaimed them to be _not human_ at all. certainly they were not merely the moving tracery of the branches against the moonlight. they shifted independently. they rose upwards in a continuous stream from earth to sky, vanishing utterly as soon as they reached the dark of the sky. they were interlaced one with another, making a great column, and i saw their limbs and huge bodies melting in and out of each other, forming this serpentine line that bent and swayed and twisted spirally with the contortions of the wind-tossed trees. they were nude, fluid shapes, passing up the bushes, _within_ the leaves almost--rising up in a living column into the heavens. their faces i never could see. unceasingly they poured upwards, swaying in great bending curves, with a hue of dull bronze upon their skins. i stared, trying to force every atom of vision from my eyes. for a long time i thought they _must_ every moment disappear and resolve themselves into the movements of the branches and prove to be an optical illusion. i searched everywhere for a proof of reality, when all the while i understood quite well that the standard of reality had changed. for the longer i looked the more certain i became that these figures were real and living, though perhaps not according to the standards that the camera and the biologist would insist upon. far from feeling fear, i was possessed with a sense of awe and wonder such as i have never known. i seemed to be gazing at the personified elemental forces of this haunted and primeval region. our intrusion had stirred the powers of the place into activity. it was we who were the cause of the disturbance, and my brain filled to bursting with stories and legends of the spirits and deities of places that have been acknowledged and worshiped by men in all ages of the world's history. but, before i could arrive at any possible explanation, something impelled me to go farther out, and i crept forward on to the sand and stood upright. i felt the ground still warm under my bare feet; the wind tore at my hair and face; and the sound of the river burst upon my ears with a sudden roar. these things, i knew, were real, and proved that my senses were acting normally. yet the figures still rose from earth to heaven, silent, majestically, in a great spiral of grace and strength that overwhelmed me at length with a genuine deep emotion of worship. i felt that i must fall down and worship--absolutely worship. perhaps in another minute i might have done so, when a gust of wind swept against me with such force that it blew me sideways, and i nearly stumbled and fell. it seemed to shake the dream violently out of me. at least it gave me another point of view somehow. the figures still remained, still ascended into heaven from the heart of the night, but my reason at last began to assert itself. it must be a subjective experience, i argued--none the less real for that, but still subjective. the moonlight and the branches combined to work out these pictures upon the mirror of my imagination, and for some reason i projected them outwards and made them appear objective. i knew this must be the case, of course. i was the subject of a vivid and interesting hallucination. i took courage, and began to move forward across the open patches of sand. by jove, though, was it all hallucination? was it merely subjective? did not my reason argue in the old futile way from the little standard of the known? i only know that great column of figures ascended darkly into the sky for what seemed a very long period of time, and with a very complete measure of reality as most men are accustomed to gauge reality. then suddenly they were gone! and, once they were gone and the immediate wonder of their great presence had passed, fear came down upon me with a cold rush. the esoteric meaning of this lonely and haunted region suddenly flamed up within me and i began to tremble dreadfully. i took a quick look round--a look of horror that came near to panic--calculating vainly ways of escape; and then, realizing how helpless i was to achieve anything really effective, i crept back silently into the tent and lay down again upon my sandy mattress, first lowering the door-curtain to shut out the sight of the willows in the moonlight, and then burying my head as deeply as possible beneath the blankets to deaden the sound of the terrifying wind. iii as though further to convince me that i had not been dreaming, i remember that it was a long time before i fell again into a troubled and restless sleep; and even then only the upper crust of me slept, and underneath there was something that never quite lost consciousness, but lay alert and on the watch. but this second time i jumped up with a genuine start of terror. it was neither the wind nor the river that woke me, but the slow approach of something that caused the sleeping portion of me to grow smaller and smaller till at last it vanished altogether, and i found myself sitting bolt upright--listening. outside there was a sound of multitudinous little patterings. they had been coming, i was aware, for a long time, and in my sleep they had first become audible. i sat there nervously wide awake as though i had not slept at all. it seemed to me that my breathing came with difficulty, and that there was a great weight upon the surface of my body. in spite of the hot night, i felt clammy with cold and shivered. something surely was pressing steadily against the sides of the tent and weighing down upon it from above. was it the body of the wind? was this the pattering rain, the dripping of the leaves? the spray blown from the river by the wind and gathering in big drops? i thought quickly of a dozen things. then suddenly the explanation leaped into my mind: a bough from the poplar, the only large tree on the island, had fallen with the wind. still half caught by the other branches, it would fall with the next gust and crush us, and meanwhile its leaves brushed and tapped upon the tight canvas surface of the tent. i raised the loose flap and rushed out, calling to the swede to follow. but when i got out and stood upright i saw that the tent was free. there was no hanging bough; there was no rain or spray; nothing approached. a cold, gray light filtered down through the bushes and lay on the faintly gleaming sand. stars still crowded the sky directly overhead, and the wind howled magnificently, but the fire no longer gave out any glow, and i saw the east reddening in streaks through the trees. several hours must have passed since i stood there before, watching the ascending figures, and the memory of it now came back to me horribly, like an evil dream. oh, how tired it made me feel, that ceaseless raging wind! yet, though the deep lassitude of a sleepless night was on me, my nerves were tingling with the activity of an equally tireless apprehension, and all idea of repose was out of the question. the river i saw had risen further. its thunder filled the air, and a fine spray made itself felt through my thin sleeping shirt. yet nowhere did i discover the slightest evidences of anything to cause alarm. this deep, prolonged disturbance in my heart remained wholly unaccounted for. my companion had not stirred when i called him, and there was no need to waken him now. i looked about me carefully, noting everything: the turned-over canoe; the yellow paddles--two of them, i'm certain; the provision sack and the extra lantern hanging together from the tree; and, crowding everywhere about me, enveloping all, the willows, those endless, shaking willows. a bird uttered its morning cry, and a string of duck passed with whirring flight overhead in the twilight. the sand whirled, dry and stinging, about my bare feet in the wind. i walked round the tent and then went out a little way into the bush, so that i could see across the river to the farther landscape, and the same profound yet indefinable emotion of distress seized upon me again as i saw the interminable sea of bushes stretching to the horizon, looking ghostly and unreal in the wan light of dawn. i walked softly here and there, still puzzling over that odd sound of infinite pattering, and of that pressure upon the tent that had wakened me. it _must_ have been the wind, i reflected--the wind beating upon the loose, hot sand, driving the dry particles smartly against the taut canvas--the wind dropping heavily upon our fragile roof. yet all the time my nervousness and malaise increased appreciably. i crossed over to the farther shore and noted how the coast line had altered in the night, and what masses of sand the river had torn away. i dipped my hands and feet into the cool current, and bathed my forehead. already there was a glow of sunrise in the sky and the exquisite freshness of coming day. on my way back i passed purposely beneath the very bushes where i had seen the column of figures rising into the air, and midway among the clumps i suddenly found myself overtaken by a sense of vast terror. from the shadows a large figure went swiftly by. some one passed me, as sure as ever man did.... it was a great staggering blow from the wind that helped me forward again, and once out in the more open space, the sense of terror diminished strangely. the winds were about and walking, i remember saying to myself; for the winds often move like great presences under the trees. and altogether the fear that hovered about me was such an unknown and immense kind of fear, so unlike anything i had ever felt before, that it woke a sense of awe and wonder in me that did much to counteract its worst effects; and when i reached a high point in the middle of the island from which i could see the wide stretch of river, crimson in the sunrise, the whole magical beauty of it all was so overpowering that a sort of wild yearning woke in me and almost brought a cry up into the throat. but this cry found no expression, for as my eyes wandered from the plain beyond to the island round me and noted our little tent half hidden among the willows, a dreadful discovery leaped out at me, compared to which my terror of the walking winds seemed as nothing at all. for a change, i thought, had somehow come about in the arrangement of the landscape. it was not that my point of vantage gave me a different view, but that an alteration had apparently been effected in the relation of the tent to the willows, and of the willows to the tent. surely the bushes now crowded much closer--unnecessarily, unpleasantly close. _they had moved nearer_. creeping with silent feet over the shifting sands, drawing imperceptibly nearer by soft, unhurried movements, the willows had come closer during the night. but had the wind moved them, or had they moved of themselves? i recalled the sound of infinite small patterings and the pressure upon the tent and upon my own heart that caused me to wake in terror. i swayed for a moment in the wind like a tree, finding it hard to keep my upright position on the sandy hillock. there was a suggestion here of personal agency, of deliberate intention, of aggressive hostility, and it terrified me into a sort of rigidity. then the reaction followed quickly. the idea was so bizarre, so absurd, that i felt inclined to laugh. but the laughter came no more readily than the cry, for the knowledge that my mind was so receptive to such dangerous imaginings brought the additional terror that it was through our minds and not through our physical bodies that the attack would come, and was coming. the wind buffeted me about, and, very quickly it seemed, the sun came up over the horizon, for it was after four o'clock, and i must have stood on that little pinnacle of sand longer than i knew, afraid to come down at close quarters with the willows. i returned quietly, creepily, to the tent, first taking another exhaustive look round and--yes, i confess it--making a few measurements. i paced out on the warm sand the distances between the willows and the tent, making a note of the shortest distance particularly. i crawled stealthily into my blankets. my companion, to all appearances, still slept soundly, and i was glad that this was so. provided my experiences were not corroborated, i could find strength somehow to deny them, perhaps. with the daylight i could persuade myself that it was all a subjective hallucination, a fantasy of the night, a projection of the excited imagination. nothing further came to disturb me, and i fell asleep almost at once, utterly exhausted, yet still in dread of hearing again that weird sound of multitudinous pattering, or of feeling the pressure upon my heart that had made it difficult to breathe. iv the sun was high in the heavens when my companion woke me from a heavy sleep and announced that the porridge was cooked and there was just time to bathe. the grateful smell of frizzling bacon entered the tent door. "river still rising," he said, "and several islands out in midstream have disappeared altogether. our own island's much smaller." "any wood left?" i asked sleepily. "the wood and the island will finish to-morrow in a dead heat," he laughed, "but there's enough to last us till then." i plunged in from the point of the island, which had indeed altered a lot in size and shape during the night, and was swept down in a moment to the landing place opposite the tent. the water was icy, and the banks flew by like the country from an express train. bathing under such conditions was an exhilarating operation, and the terror of the night seemed cleansed out of me by a process of evaporation in the brain. the sun was blazing hot; not a cloud showed itself anywhere; the wind, however, had not abated one little jot. quite suddenly then the implied meaning of the swede's words flashed across me, showing that he no longer wished to leave posthaste, and had changed his mind. "enough to last till to-morrow"--he assumed we should stay on the island another night. it struck me as odd. the night before he was so positive the other way. how had the change come about? great crumblings of the banks occurred at breakfast, with heavy splashings and clouds of spray which the wind brought into our frying-pan, and my fellow-traveler talked incessantly about the difficulty the vienna-pesth steamers must have to find the channel in flood. but the state of his mind interested and impressed me far more than the state of the river or the difficulties of the steamers. he had changed somehow since the evening before. his manner was different--a trifle excited, a trifle shy, with a sort of suspicion about his voice and gestures. i hardly know how to describe it now in cold blood, but at the time i remember being quite certain of one thing, viz., that he had become frightened! he ate very little breakfast, and for once omitted to smoke his pipe. he had the map spread open beside him, and kept studying its markings. "we'd better get off sharp in an hour," i said presently, feeling for an opening that must bring him indirectly to a partial confession at any rate. and his answer puzzled me uncomfortably: "rather! if they'll let us." "who'll let us? the elements?" i asked quickly, with affected indifference. "the powers of this awful place, whoever they are," he replied, keeping his eyes on the map. "the gods are here, if they are anywhere at all in the world." "the elements are always the true immortals," i replied, laughing as naturally as i could manage, yet knowing quite well that my face reflected my true feelings when he looked up gravely at me and spoke across the smoke: "we shall be fortunate if we get away without further disaster." this was exactly what i had dreaded, and i screwed myself up to the point of the direct question. it was like agreeing to allow the dentist to extract the tooth; it _had_ to come anyhow in the long run, and the rest was all pretense. "further disaster! why, what's happened?" "for one thing--the steering paddle's gone," he said quietly. "the steering paddle gone!" i repeated, greatly excited, for this was our rudder, and the danube in flood without a rudder was suicide. "but what----" "and there's a tear in the bottom of the canoe," he added, with a genuine little tremor in his voice. i continued staring at him, able only to repeat the words in his face somewhat foolishly. there, in the heat of the sun, and on this burning sand, i was aware of a freezing atmosphere descending round us. i got up to follow him, for he merely nodded his head gravely and led the way towards the tent a few yards on the other side of the fireplace. the canoe still lay there as i had last seen her in the night, ribs uppermost, the paddles, or rather, _the_ paddle, on the sand beside her. "there's only one," he said, stooping to pick it up. "and here's the rent in the base-board." it was on the tip of my tongue to tell him that i had clearly noticed _two_ paddles a few hours before, but a second impulse made me think better of it, and i said nothing. i approached to see. there was a long, finely made tear in the bottom of the canoe where a little slither of wood had been neatly taken clean out; it looked as if the tooth of a sharp rock or snag had eaten down her length, and investigation showed that the hole went through. had we launched out in her without observing it we must inevitably have foundered. at first the water would have made the wood swell so as to close the hole, but once out in midstream the water must have poured in, and the canoe, never more than two inches above the surface, would have filled and sunk very rapidly. "there, you see, an attempt to prepare a victim for the sacrifice," i heard him saying, more to himself than to me, "two victims rather," he added as he bent over and ran his fingers along the slit. i began to whistle--a thing i always do unconsciously when utterly nonplused--and purposely paid no attention to his words. i was determined to consider them foolish. "it wasn't there last night," he said presently, straightening up from his examination and looking anywhere but at me. "we must have scratched her in landing, of course," i stopped whistling to say, "the stones are very sharp----" i stopped abruptly, for at that moment he turned round and met my eye squarely. i knew just as well as he did how impossible my explanation was. there were no stones, to begin with. "and then there's this to explain too," he added quietly, handing me the paddle and pointing to the blade. a new and curious emotion spread freezingly over me as i took and examined it. the blade was scraped down all over, beautifully scraped, as though someone had sand-papered it with care, making it so thin that the first vigorous stroke must have snapped it off at the elbow. "one of us walked in his sleep and did this thing," i said feebly, "or--or it has been filed by the constant stream of sand particles blown against it by the wind, perhaps." "ah," said the swede, turning away, laughing a little, "you can explain everything!" "the same wind that caught the steering paddle and flung it so near the bank that it fell in with the next lump that crumbled," i called out after him, absolutely determined to find an explanation for everything he showed me. "i see," he shouted back, turning his head to look at me before disappearing among the willow bushes. once alone with these perplexing evidences of personal agency, i think my first thought took the form of "one of us must have done this thing, and it certainly was not i." but my second thought decided how impossible it was to suppose, under all the circumstances, that either of us had done it. that my companion, the trusted friend of a dozen similar expeditions, could have knowingly had a hand in it, was a suggestion not to be entertained for a moment. equally absurd seemed the explanation that this imperturbable and densely practical nature had suddenly become insane and was busied with insane purposes. yet the fact remained that what disturbed me most, and kept my fear actively alive even in this blaze of sunshine and wild beauty, was the clear certainty that some curious alteration had come about in his _mind_--that he was nervous, timid, suspicious, aware of goings on he did not speak about, watching a series of secret and hitherto unmentionable events--waiting, in a word, for a climax that he expected, and, i thought, expected very soon. this grew up in my mind intuitively--i hardly knew how. i made a hurried examination of the tent and its surroundings, but the measurements of the night remained the same. there were deep hollows formed in the sand, i now noticed for the first time, basin-shaped and of various depths and sizes, varying from that of a teacup to a large bowl. the wind, no doubt, was responsible for these miniature craters, just as it was for lifting the paddle and tossing it towards the water. the rent in the canoe was the only thing that seemed quite inexplicable; and, after all, it _was_ conceivable that a sharp point had caught it when we landed. the examination i made of the shore did not assist this theory, but all the same i clung to it with that diminishing portion of my intelligence which i called my "reason." an explanation of some kind was an absolute necessity, just as some working explanation of the universe is necessary--however absurd--to the happiness of every individual who seeks to do his duty in the world and face the problems of life. the simile seemed to me at the time an exact parallel. i at once set the pitch melting, and presently the swede joined me at the work, though under the best conditions in the world the canoe could not be safe for traveling till the following day. i drew his attention casually to the hollows in the sand. "yes," he said, "i know. they're all over the island. but _you_ can explain them, no doubt!" "wind, of course," i answered without hesitation. "have you never watched those little whirlwinds in the street that twist and twirl everything into a circle? this sand's loose enough to yield, that's all." he made no reply, and we worked on in silence for a bit. i watched him surreptitiously all the time, and i had an idea he was watching me. he seemed, too, to be always listening attentively to something i could not hear, or perhaps for something that he expected to hear, for he kept turning about and staring into the bushes, and up into the sky, and out across the water where it was visible through the openings among the willows. sometimes he even put his hand to his ear and held it there for several minutes. he said nothing to me, however, about it, and i asked no questions. and meanwhile, as he mended that torn canoe with the skill and address of a red indian, i was glad to notice his absorption in the work, for there was a vague dread in my heart that he would speak of the changed aspect of the willows. and, if he had noticed _that_, my imagination could no longer be held a sufficient explanation of it. at length, after a long pause, he began to talk. "queer thing," he added in a hurried sort of voice, as though he wanted to say something and get it over. "queer thing, i mean, about that otter last night." i had expected something so totally different that he caught me with surprise, and i looked up sharply. "shows how lonely this place is. otters are awfully shy things--" "i don't mean that, of course," he interrupted. "i mean--do you think--did you think it really was an otter?" "what else, in the name of heaven, what else?" "you know, i saw it before you did, and at first it seemed--so _much_ bigger than an otter." "the sunset as you looked upstream magnified it, or something," i replied. he looked at me absently a moment, as though his mind were busy with other thoughts. "it had such extraordinary yellow eyes," he went on half to himself. "that was the sun too," i laughed, a trifle boisterously. "i suppose you'll wonder next if that fellow in the boat----" i suddenly decided not to finish the sentence. he was in the act again of listening, turning his head to the wind, and something in the expression of his face made me halt. the subject dropped, and we went on with our caulking. apparently he had not noticed my unfinished sentence. five minutes later, however, he looked at me across the canoe, the smoking pitch in his hand, his face exceedingly grave. "i _did_ rather wonder, if you want to know," he said slowly, "what that thing in the boat was. i remember thinking at the time it was not a man. the whole business seemed to rise quite suddenly out of the water." i laughed again boisterously in his face, but this time there was impatience and a strain of anger too, in my feeling. "look here now," i cried, "this place is quite queer enough without going out of our way to imagine things! that boat was an ordinary boat, and the man in it was an ordinary man, and they were both going downstream as fast as they could lick. and that otter _was_ an otter, so don't let's play the fool about it!" he looked steadily at me with the same grave expression. he was not in the least annoyed. i took courage from his silence. "and for heaven's sake," i went on, "don't keep pretending you hear things, because it only gives me the jumps, and there's nothing to hear but the river and this cursed old thundering wind." "you _fool_!" he answered in a low, shocked voice, "you utter fool. that's just the way all victims talk. as if you didn't understand just as well as i do!" he sneered with scorn in his voice, and a sort of resignation. "the best thing you can do is to keep quiet and try to hold your mind as firm as possible. this feeble attempt at self-deception only makes the truth harder when you're forced to meet it." my little effort was over, and i found nothing more to say, for i knew quite well his words were true, and that i was the fool, not _he_. up to a certain stage in the adventure he kept ahead of me easily, and i think i felt annoyed to be out of it, to be thus proved less psychic, less sensitive than himself to these extraordinary happenings, and half ignorant all the time of what was going on under my very nose. _he knew_ from the very beginning, apparently. but at the moment i wholly missed the point of his words about the necessity of there being a victim, and that we ourselves were destined to satisfy the want. i dropped all pretense thenceforward, but thenceforward likewise my fear increased steadily to the climax. "but you're quite right about one thing," he added, before the subject passed, "and that is that we're wiser not to talk about it, or even to think about it, because what one _thinks_ finds expression in words, and what one _says_, happens." that afternoon, while the canoe dried and hardened, we spent trying to fish, testing the leak, collecting wood, and watching the enormous flood of rising water. masses of driftwood swept near our shores sometimes, and we fished for them with long willow branches. the island grew perceptibly smaller as the banks were torn away with great gulps and splashes. the weather kept brilliantly fine till about four o'clock, and then for the first time for three days the wind showed signs of abating. clouds began to gather in the southwest, spreading thence slowly over the sky. this lessening of the wind came as a great relief, for the incessant roaring, banging, and thundering had irritated our nerves. yet the silence that came about five o'clock with its sudden cessation was in a manner quite as oppressive. the booming of the river had everything its own way then: it filled the air with deep murmurs, more musical than the wind noises, but infinitely more monotonous. the wind held many notes, rising, falling, always beating out some sort of great elemental tune; whereas the river's song lay between three notes at most--dull pedal notes, that held a lugubrious quality foreign to the wind, and somehow seemed to me, in my then nervous state, to sound wonderfully well the music of doom. it was extraordinary, too, how the withdrawal suddenly of bright sunlight took everything out of the landscape that made for cheerfulness; and since this particular landscape had already managed to convey the suggestion of something sinister, the change of course was all the more unwelcome and noticeable. for me, i know, the darkening outlook became distinctly more alarming, and i found myself more than once calculating how soon after sunset the full moon would get up in the east, and whether the gathering clouds would greatly interfere with her lighting of the little island. with this general hush of the wind--though it still indulged in occasional brief gusts--the river seemed to me to grow blacker, the willows to stand more densely together. the latter, too, kept up a sort of independent movement of their own, rustling among themselves when no wind stirred, and shaking oddly from the roots upwards. when common objects in this way become charged with the suggestion of horror, they stimulate the imagination far more than things of unusual appearance; and these bushes, crowding huddled about us, assumed for me in the darkness a bizarre _grotesquerie_ of appearance that lent to them somehow the aspect of purposeful and living creatures. their very ordinariness, i felt, masked what was malignant and hostile to us. the forces of the region drew nearer with the coming of night. they were focusing upon our island, and more particularly upon ourselves. for thus, somehow, in the terms of the imagination, did my really indescribable sensations in this extraordinary place present themselves. i had slept a good deal in the early afternoon, and had thus recovered somewhat from the exhaustion of a disturbed night, but this only served apparently to render me more susceptible than before to the obsessing spell of the haunting. i fought against it, laughing at my feelings as absurd and childish, with very obvious physiological explanations, yet, in spite of every effort, they gained in strength upon me so that i dreaded the night as a child lost in a forest must dread the approach of darkness. the canoe we had carefully covered with a waterproof sheet during the day, and the one remaining paddle had been securely tied by the swede to the base of a tree, lest the wind should rob us of that too. from five o'clock onwards i busied myself with the stew-pot and preparations for dinner, it being my turn to cook that night. we had potatoes, onions, bits of bacon fat to add flavour, and a general thick residue from former stews at the bottom of the pot; with black bread broken up into it the result was most excellent, and it was followed by a stew of plums with sugar and a brew of strong tea with dried milk. a good pile of wood lay close at hand, and the absence of wind made my duties easy. my companion sat lazily watching me, dividing his attentions between cleaning his pipe and giving useless advice--an admitted privilege of the off-duty man. he had been very quiet all the afternoon, engaged in re-caulking the canoe, strengthening the tent ropes, and fishing for driftwood while i slept. no more talk about undesirable things had passed between us, and i think his only remarks had to do with the gradual destruction of the island, which he declared was now fully a third smaller than when we first landed. the pot had just begun to bubble when i heard his voice calling to me from the bank, where he had wandered away without my noticing. i ran up. "come and listen," he said, "and see what you make of it." he held his hand cupwise to his ear, as so often before. "_now_ do you hear anything?" he asked, watching me curiously. we stood there, listening attentively together. at first i heard only the deep note of the water and the hissings rising from its turbulent surface. the willows, for once, were motionless and silent. then a sound began to reach my ears faintly, a peculiar sound--something like the humming of a distant gong. it seemed to come across to us in the darkness from the waste of swamps and willows opposite. it was repeated at regular intervals, but it was certainly neither the sound of a bell nor the hooting of a distant steamer. i can liken it to nothing so much as to the sound of an immense gong, suspended far up in the sky, repeating incessantly its muffled metallic note, soft and musical, as it was repeatedly struck. my heart quickened as i listened. "i've heard it all day," said my companion. "while you slept this afternoon it came all round the island. i hunted it down, but could never get near enough to see--to localize it correctly. sometimes it was overhead, and sometimes it seemed under the water. once or twice, too, i could have sworn it was not outside at all, but _within myself_--you know--the way a sound in the fourth dimension is supposed to come." i was too much puzzled to pay much attention to his words. i listened carefully, striving to associate it with any known familiar sound i could think of, but without success. it changed in direction, too, coming nearer, and then sinking utterly away into remote distance. i cannot say that it was ominous in quality, because to me it seemed distinctly musical, yet i must admit it set going a distressing feeling that made me wish i had never heard it. "the wind blowing in those sand-funnels," i said, determined to find an explanation, "or the bushes rubbing together after the storm perhaps." "it comes off the whole swamp," my friend answered. "it comes from everywhere at once." he ignored my explanations. "it comes from the willow bushes somehow----" "but now the wind has dropped," i objected "the willows can hardly make a noise by themselves, can they?" his answer frightened me, first because i had dreaded it, and secondly, because i knew intuitively it was true. "it is _because_ the wind has dropped we now hear it. it was drowned before. it is the cry, i believe of the----" i dashed back to my fire, warned by a sound of bubbling that the stew was in danger, but determined at the same time to escape from further conversation. i was resolute, if possible, to avoid the exchanging of views. i dreaded, too, that he would begin again about the gods, or the elemental forces, or something else disquieting, and i wanted to keep myself well in hand for what might happen later. there was another night to be faced before we escaped from this distressing place, and there was no knowing yet what it might bring forth. "come and cut up bread for the pot," i called to him, vigorously stirring the appetizing mixture. that stew-pot held sanity for us both, and the thought made me laugh. he came over slowly and took the provision sack from the tree, fumbling in its mysterious depths, and then emptying the entire contents upon the ground-sheet at his feet. "hurry up!" i cried; "it's boiling." the swede burst out into a roar of laughter that startled me. it was forced laughter, not artificial exactly, but mirthless. "there's nothing here!" he shouted, holding his sides. "bread, i mean." "it's gone. there is no bread. they've taken it!" i dropped the long spoon and ran up. everything the sack had contained lay upon the ground-sheet, but there was no loaf. the whole dead weight of my growing fear fell upon me and shook me. then i burst out laughing too. it was the only thing to do: and the sound of my own laughter also made me understand his. the strain of psychical pressure caused it--this explosion of unnatural laughter in both of us; it was an effort of repressed forces to seek relief; it was a temporary safety valve. and with both of us it ceased quite suddenly. "how criminally stupid of me!" i cried, still determined to be consistent and find an explanation. "i clean forgot to buy a loaf at pressburg. that chattering woman put everything out of my head, and i must have left it lying on the counter or----" "the oatmeal, too, is much less than it was this morning," the swede interrupted. why in the world need he draw attention to it? i thought angrily. "there's enough for to-morrow," i said, stirring vigorously, "and we can get lots more at komorn or gran. in twenty-four hours we shall be miles from here." "i hope so--to god," he muttered, putting the things back into the sack, "unless we're claimed first as victims for the sacrifice," he added with a foolish laugh. he dragged the sack into the tent, for safety's sake, i suppose, and i heard him mumbling on to himself, but so indistinctly that it seemed quite natural for me to ignore his words. our meal was beyond question a gloomy one, and we ate it almost in silence, avoiding one another's eyes, and keeping the fire bright. then we washed up and prepared for the night, and, once smoking, our minds unoccupied with any definite duties, the apprehension i had felt all day long became more and more acute. it was not then active fear, i think, but the very vagueness of its origin distressed me far more than if i had been able to ticket and face it squarely. the curious sound i have likened to the note of a gong became now almost incessant, and filled the stillness of the night with a faint, continuous ringing rather than a series of distinct notes. at one time it was behind and at another time in front of us. sometimes i fancied it came from the bushes on our left, and then again from the clumps on our right. more often it hovered directly overhead like the whirring of wings. it was really everywhere at once, behind, in front, at our sides and over our heads, completely surrounding us. the sound really defies description. but nothing within my knowledge is like that ceaseless muffled humming rising off the deserted world of swamps and willows. we sat smoking in comparative silence, the strain growing every minute greater. the worst feature of the situation seemed to me that we did not know what to expect, and could therefore make no sort of preparation by way of defense. we could anticipate nothing. my explanations made in the sunshine, moreover, now came to haunt me with their foolish and wholly unsatisfactory nature, and it was more and more clear to me that some kind of plain talk with my companion was inevitable, whether i liked it or not. after all, we had to spend the night together, and to sleep in the same tent side by side. i saw that i could not get along much longer without the support of his mind, and for that, of course, plain talk was imperative. as long as possible, however, i postponed this little climax, and tried to ignore or laugh at the occasional sentences he flung into the emptiness. some of these sentences, moreover, were confoundedly disquieting to me, coming as they did to corroborate much that i felt myself: corroboration, too--which made it so much more convincing--from a totally different point of view. he composed such curious sentences, and hurled them at me in such an inconsequential sort of way, as though his main line of thought was secret to himself, and these fragments were the bits he found it impossible to digest. he got rid of them by uttering them. speech relieved him. it was like being sick. "there are things about us, i'm sure, that make for disorder, disintegration, destruction, _our_ destruction," he said once, while the fire blazed between us. "we've strayed out of a safe line somewhere." and another time, when the gong sounds had come nearer, ringing much louder than before, and directly over our heads, he said, as though talking to himself: "i don't think a phonograph would show any record of that. the sound doesn't come to me by the ears at all. the vibrations reach me in another manner altogether, and seem to be within me, which is precisely how a fourth dimension sound might be supposed to make itself heard." i purposely made no reply to this, but i sat up a little closer to the fire and peered about me into the darkness. the clouds were massed all over the sky and no trace of moonlight came through. very still, too, everything was, so that the river and the frogs had things all their own way. "it has that about it," he went on, "which is utterly out of common experience. it is _unknown_. only one thing describes it really: it is a non-human sound; i mean a sound outside humanity." having rid himself of this indigestible morsel, he lay quiet for a time; but he had so admirably expressed my own feeling that it was a relief to have the thought out, and to have confined it by the limitation of words from dangerous wandering to and fro in the mind. the solitude of that danube camping-place, can i ever forget it? the feeling of being utterly alone on an empty planet! my thoughts ran incessantly upon cities and the haunts of men. i would have given my soul, as the saying is, for the "feel" of those bavarian villages we had passed through by the score; for the normal, human commonplaces, peasants drinking beer, tables beneath the trees, hot sunshine, and a ruined castle on the rocks behind the red-roofed church. even the tourists would have been welcome. yet what i felt of dread was no ordinary ghostly fear. it was infinitely greater, stranger, and seemed to arise from some dim ancestral sense of terror more profoundly disturbing than anything i had known or dreamed of. we had "strayed," as the swede put it, into some region or some set of conditions where the risks were great, yet unintelligible to us; where the frontiers of some unknown world lay close about us. it was a spot held by the dwellers in some outer space, a sort of peephole whence they could spy upon the earth, themselves unseen, a point where the veil between had worn a little thin. as the final result of too long a sojourn here, we should be carried over the border and deprived of what we called "our lives," yet by mental, not physical, processes. in that sense, as he said, we should be the victims of our adventure--a sacrifice. it took us in different fashion, each according to the measure of his sensitiveness and powers of resistance. i translated it vaguely into a personification of the mightily disturbed elements, investing them with the horror of a deliberate and malefic purpose, resentful of our audacious intrusion into their breeding-place; whereas my friend threw it into the unoriginal form at first of a trespass on some ancient shrine, some place where the old gods still held sway, where the emotional forces of former worshipers still clung, and the ancestral portion of him yielded to the old pagan spell. at any rate, here was a place unpolluted by men, kept clean by the winds from coarsening human influences, a place where spiritual agencies were within reach and aggressive. never, before or since, have i been so attacked by indescribable suggestions of a "beyond region," of another scheme of life, another evolution not parallel to the human. and in the end our minds would succumb under the weight of the awful spell, and we should be drawn across the frontier into _their_ world. small things testified to this amazing influence of the place, and now in the silence round the fire they allowed themselves to be noted by the mind. the very atmosphere had proved itself a magnifying medium to distort every indication: the otter rolling in the current, the hurrying boatman making signs, the shifting willows, one and all had been robbed of its natural character, and revealed in something of its other aspect--as it existed across the border in that other region. and this changed aspect i felt was new not merely to me, but to the race. the whole experience whose verge we touched was unknown to humanity at all. it was a new order of experience, and in the true sense of the word _unearthly_. "it's the deliberate, calculating purpose that reduces one's courage to zero," the swede said suddenly, as if he had been actually following my thoughts. "otherwise imagination might count for much. but the paddle, the canoe, the lessening food----" "haven't i explained all that once?" i interrupted viciously. "you have," he answered dryly; "you have indeed." he made other remarks too, as usual, about what he called the "plain determination to provide a victim"; but, having now arranged my thoughts better, i recognized that this was simply the cry of his frightened soul against the knowledge that he was being attacked in a vital part, and that he would be somehow taken or destroyed. the situation called for a courage and calmness of reasoning that neither of us could compass, and i have never before been so clearly conscious of two persons in me--the one that explained everything, and the other that laughed at such foolish explanations, yet was horribly afraid. meanwhile, in the pitchy night the fire died down and the woodpile grew small. neither of us moved to replenish the stock, and the darkness consequently came up very close to our faces. a few feet beyond the circle of firelight it was inky black. occasionally a stray puff of wind set the billows shivering about us, but apart from this not very welcome sound a deep and depressing silence reigned, broken only by the gurgling of the river and the humming in the air overhead. we both missed, i think, the shouting company of the winds. at length, at a moment when a stray puff prolonged itself as though the wind were about to rise again, i reached the point for me of saturation, the point where it was absolutely necessary to find relief in plain speech, or else to betray myself by some hysterical extravagance that must have been far worse in its effect upon both of us. i kicked the fire into a blaze, and turned to my companion abruptly. he looked up with a start. "i can't disguise it any longer," i said; "i don't like this place, and the darkness, and the noises, and the awful feelings i get. there's something here that beats me utterly. i'm in a blue funk, and that's the plain truth. if the other shore was--different, i swear i'd be inclined to swim for it!" the swede's face turned very white beneath the deep tan of sun and wind. he stared straight at me and answered quietly, but his voice betrayed his huge excitement by its unnatural calmness. for the moment, at any rate, he was the strong man of the two. he was more phlegmatic, for one thing. "it's not a physical condition we can escape from by running away," he replied, in the tone of a doctor diagnosing some grave disease; "we must sit tight and wait. there are forces close here that could kill a herd of elephants in a second as easily as you or i could squash a fly. our only chance is to keep perfectly still. our insignificance perhaps may save us." i put a dozen questions into my expression of face, but found no words. it was precisely like listening to an accurate description of a disease whose symptoms had puzzled me. "i mean that so far, although aware of our disturbing presence, they have not _found_ us--not 'located' us, as the americans say," he went on. "they're blundering about like men hunting for a leak of gas. the paddle and canoe and provisions prove that. i think they _feel_ us, but cannot actually see us. we must keep our minds quiet--it's our minds they feel. we must control our thoughts, or it's all up with us." "death you mean?" i stammered, icy with the horror of his suggestion. "worse--by far," he said. "death, according to one's belief, means either annihilation or release from the limitations of the senses, but it involves no change of character. _you_ don't suddenly alter just because the body's gone. but this means a radical alteration, a complete change, a horrible loss of oneself by substitution--far worse than death, and not even annihilation. we happen to have camped in a spot where their region touches ours where the veil between has worn thin"--horrors! he was using my very own phrase, my actual words--"so that they are aware of our being in their neighborhood." "but _who_ are aware?" i asked. i forgot the shaking of the willows in the windless calm, the humming overhead, everything except that i was waiting for an answer that i dreaded more than i can possibly explain. he lowered his voice at once to reply, leaning forward a little over the fire, an indefinable change in his face that made me avoid his eyes and look down upon the ground. "all my life," he said, "i have been strangely, vividly conscious of another region--not far removed from our own world in one sense, yet wholly different in kind--where great things go on unceasingly, where immense and terrible personalities hurry by, intent on vast purposes compared to which earthly affairs, the rise and fall of nations, the destinies of empires, the fate of armies and continents, are all as dust in the balance; vast purposes, i mean, that deal directly with the soul, and not indirectly with mere expressions of the soul--" "i suggest just now--" i began, seeking to stop him, feeling as though i was face to face with a madman. but he instantly overbore me with his torrent that _had_ to come. "you think," he said, "it is the spirits of the elements, and i thought perhaps it was the old gods. but i tell you now it is--_neither_. these would be comprehensible entities, for they have relations with men, depending upon them for worship or sacrifice, whereas these beings who are now about us have absolutely nothing to do with mankind, and it is mere chance that their space happens just at this spot to touch our own." the mere conception, which his words somehow made so convincing, as i listened to them there in the dark stillness of that lonely island, set me shaking a little all over. i found it impossible to control my movements. "and what do you propose?" i began again. "a sacrifice, a victim, might save us by distracting them until we could get away," he went on, "just as the wolves stop to devour the dogs and give the sleigh another start. but--i see no chance of any other victim now." i stared blankly at him. the gleam in his eyes was dreadful. presently he continued. "it's the willows, of course. the willows _mask_ the others, but the others are feeling about for us. if we let our minds betray our fear, we're lost, lost utterly." he looked at me with an expression so calm, so determined, so sincere, that i no longer had any doubts as to his sanity. he was as sane as any man ever was. "if we can hold out through the night," he added, "we may get off in the daylight unnoticed, or rather, _undiscovered_." "but you really think a sacrifice would----" that gong-like humming came down very close over our heads as i spoke, but it was my friend's scared face that really stopped my mouth. "hush!" he whispered, holding up his hand. "do not mention them more than you can help. do not refer to them _by name_. to name is to reveal: it is the inevitable clue, and our only hope lies in ignoring them, in order that they may ignore us." "even in thought?" he was extraordinarily agitated. "especially in thought. our thoughts make spirals in their world. we must keep them _out of our minds_ at all costs if possible." i raked the fire together to prevent the darkness having everything its own way. i never longed for the sun as i longed for it then in the awful blackness of that summer night. "were you awake all last night?" he went on suddenly. "i slept badly a little after dawn," i replied evasively, trying to follow his instructions, which i knew instinctively were true, "but the wind, of course--" "i know. but the wind won't account for all the noises." "then you heard it too?" "the multiplying countless little footsteps i heard," he said, adding, after a moment's hesitation, "and that other sound--" "you mean above the tent, and the pressing down upon us of something tremendous, gigantic?" he nodded significantly. "it was like the beginning of a sort of inner suffocation?" i said. "partly, yes. it seemed to me that the weight of the atmosphere had been altered--had increased enormously, so that we should be crushed." "and _that_," i went on, determined to have it all out, pointing upwards where the gong-like note hummed ceaselessly, rising and falling like wind. "what do you make of that?" "it's _their_ sound," he whispered gravely. "it's the sound of their world, the humming in their region. the division here is so thin that it leaks through somehow. but, if you listen carefully, you'll find it's not above so much as around us. it's in the willows. it's the willows themselves humming, because here the willows have been made symbols of the forces that are against us." i could not follow exactly what he meant by this, yet the thought and idea in my mind were beyond question the thought and idea in his. i realized what he realized, only with less power of analysis than his. it was on the tip of my tongue to tell him at last about my hallucination of the ascending figures and the moving bushes, when he suddenly thrust his face again close into mine across the firelight and began to speak in a very earnest whisper. he amazed me by his calmness and pluck, his apparent control of the situation. this man i had for years deemed unimaginative, stolid! "now listen," he said. "the only thing for us to do is to go on as though nothing had happened, follow our usual habits, go to bed, and so forth; pretend we feel nothing and notice nothing. it is a question wholly of the mind, and the less we think about them the better our chance of escape. above all, don't _think_, for what you think happens!" "all right," i managed to reply, simply breathless with his words and the strangeness of it all; "all right, i'll try, but tell me one thing more first. tell me what you make of those hollows in the ground all about us, those sand-funnels?" "no!" he cried, forgetting to whisper in his excitement. "i dare not, simply dare not, put the thought into words. if you have not guessed i am glad. don't try to. _they_ have put it into my mind; try your hardest to prevent their putting it into yours." he sank his voice again to a whisper before he finished, and i did not press him to explain. there was already just about as much horror in me as i could hold. the conversation came to an end, and we smoked our pipes busily in silence. then something happened, something unimportant apparently, as the way is when the nerves are in a very great state of tension, and this small thing for a brief space gave me an entirely different point of view. i chanced to look down at my sand-shoe--the sort we used for the canoe--and something to do with the hole at the toe suddenly recalled to me the london shop where i had bought them, the difficulty the man had in fitting me, and other details of the uninteresting but practical operation. at once, in its train, followed a wholesome view of the modern skeptical world i was accustomed to move in at home. i thought of roast beef and ale, motor-cars, policemen, brass bands, and a dozen other things that proclaimed the soul of ordinariness or utility. the effect was immediate and astonishing even to myself. psychologically, i suppose, it was simply a sudden and violent reaction after the strain of living in an atmosphere of things that to the normal consciousness must seem impossible and incredible. but, whatever the cause, it momentarily lifted the spell from my heart, and left me for the short space of a minute feeling free and utterly unafraid. i looked up at my friend opposite. "you damned old pagan!" i cried, laughing aloud in his face. "you imaginative idiot! you superstitious idolator! you----" i stopped in the middle, seized anew by the old horror. i tried to smother the sound of my voice as something sacrilegious. the swede, of course, heard it too--that strange cry overhead in the darkness--and that sudden drop in the air as though something had come nearer. he had turned ashen white under the tan. he stood bolt upright in front of the fire, stiff as a rod, staring at me. "after that," he said in a sort of helpless, frantic way, "we must go! we can't stay now; we must strike camp this very instant and go on--down the river." he was talking, i saw, quite wildly, his words dictated by abject terror--the terror he had resisted so long, but which had caught him at last. "in the dark?" i exclaimed, shaking with fear after my hysterical outburst, but still realizing our position better than he did. "sheer madness! the river's in flood, and we've only got a single paddle. besides, we only go deeper into their country! there's nothing ahead for fifty miles but willows, willows, willows!" he sat down again in a state of semi-collapse. the positions, by one of those kaleidoscopic changes nature loves, were suddenly reversed, and the control of our forces passed over into my hands. his mind at last had reached the point where it was beginning to weaken. "what on earth possessed you to do such a thing?" he whispered, with the awe of genuine terror in his voice and face. i crossed round to his side of the fire. i took both his hands in mine, kneeling down beside him and looking straight into his frightened eyes. "we'll make one more blaze," i said firmly, "and then turn in for the night. at sunrise we'll be off full speed for komorn. now, pull yourself together a bit, and remember your own advice about _not thinking fear_!" he said no more, and i saw that he would agree and obey. in some measure, too, it was a sort of relief to get up and make an excursion into the darkness for more wood. we kept close together, almost touching, groping among the bushes and along the bank. the humming overhead never ceased, but seemed to me to grow louder as we increased our distance from the fire. it was shivery work! we were grubbing away in the middle of a thickish clump of willows where some driftwood from a former flood had caught high among the branches, when my body was seized in a grip that made me half drop upon the sand. it was the swede. he had fallen against me, and was clutching me for support. i heard his breath coming and going in short gasps. "look! by my soul!" he whispered, and for the first time in my experience i knew what it was to hear tears of terror in a human voice. he was pointing to the fire, some fifty feet away. i followed the direction of his finger, and i swear my heart missed a beat. there, in front of the dim glow, _something was moving_. i saw it through a veil that hung before my eyes like the gauze drop-curtain used at the back of a theater--hazily a little. it was neither a human figure nor an animal. to me it gave the strange impression of being as large as several animals grouped together, like horses, two or three, moving slowly. the swede, too, got a similar result, though expressing it differently, for he thought it was shaped and sized like a clump of willow bushes, rounded at the top, and moving all over upon its surface--"coiling upon itself like smoke," he said afterwards. "i watched it settle downwards through the bushes," he sobbed at me. "look, by god! it's coming this way! oh, oh!"--he gave a kind of whistling cry. "_they've found us_." i gave one terrified glance, which just enabled me to see that the shadowy form was swinging towards us through the bushes, and then i collapsed backwards with a crash into the branches. these failed, of course, to support my weight, so that with the swede on the top of me we fell in a struggling heap upon the sand. i really hardly knew what was happening. i was conscious only of a sort of enveloping sensation of icy fear that plucked the nerves out of their fleshly covering, twisted them this way and that, and replaced them quivering. my eyes were tightly shut; something in my throat choked me; a feeling that my consciousness was expanding, extending out into space, swiftly gave way to another feeling that i was losing it altogether, and about to die. an acute spasm of pain passed through me, and i was aware that the swede had hold of me in such a way that he hurt me abominably. it was the way he caught at me in falling. but it was this pain, he declared afterwards, that saved me: it caused me to _forget them_ and think of something else at the very instant when they were about to find me. it concealed my mind from them at the moment of discovery, yet just in time to evade their terrible seizing of me. he himself, he says, actually swooned at the same moment, and that was what saved him. i only know that at a later time, how long or short is impossible to say, i found myself scrambling up out of the slippery network of willow branches, and saw my companion standing in front of me holding out a hand to assist me. i stared at him in a dazed way, rubbing the arm he had twisted for me. nothing came to me to say, somehow. "i lost consciousness for a moment or two," i heard him say. "that's what saved me. it made me stop thinking about them." "you nearly broke my arm in two," i said, uttering my only connected thought at the moment. a numbness came over me. "that's what saved _you_!" he replied. "between us, we've managed to set them off on a false tack somewhere. the humming has ceased. it's gone--for the moment at any rate!" a wave of hysterical laughter seized me again, and this time spread to my friend too--great healing gusts of shaking laughter that brought a tremendous sense of relief in their train. we made our way back to the fire and put the wood on so that it blazed at once. then we saw that the tent had fallen over and lay in a tangled heap upon the ground. we picked it up, and during the process tripped more than once and caught our feet in sand. "it's those sand-funnels," exclaimed the swede, when the tent was up again and the firelight lit up the ground for several yards about us. "and look at the size of them!" all round the tent and about the fireplace where we had seen the moving shadows there were deep funnel-shaped hollows in the sand, exactly similar to the ones we had already found over the island, only far bigger and deeper, beautifully formed, and wide enough in some instances to admit the whole of my foot and leg. neither of us said a word. we both knew that sleep was the safest thing we could do, and to bed we went accordingly without further delay, having first thrown sand on the fire and taken the provision sack and the paddle inside the tent with us. the canoe, too, we propped in such a way at the end of the tent that our feet touched it, and the least motion would disturb and wake us. in case of emergency, too, we again went to bed in our clothes, ready for a sudden start. v it was my firm intention to lie awake all night and watch, but the exhaustion of nerves and body decreed otherwise, and sleep after a while came over me with a welcome blanket of oblivion. the fact that my companion also slept quickened its approach. at first he fidgeted and constantly sat up, asking me if i "heard this" or "heard that." he tossed about on his cork mattress, and said the tent was moving and the river had risen over the point of the island; but each time i went out to look i returned with the report that all was well, and finally he grew calmer and lay still. then at length his breathing became regular and i heard unmistakable sounds of snoring--the first and only time in my life when snoring has been a welcome and calming influence. this, i remember, was the last thought in my mind before dozing off. a difficulty in breathing woke me, and i found the blanket over my face. but something else besides the blanket was pressing upon me, and my first thought was that my companion had rolled off his mattress on to my own in his sleep. i called to him and sat up, and at the same moment it came to me that the tent was _surrounded_. that sound of multitudinous soft pattering was again audible outside, filling the night with horror. i called again to him, louder than before. he did not answer, but i missed the sound of his snoring, and also noticed that the flap of the tent door was down. this was the unpardonable sin. i crawled out in the darkness to hook it back securely, and it was then for the first time i realized positively that the swede was not there. he had gone. i dashed out in a mad run, seized by a dreadful agitation, and the moment i was out i plunged into a sort of torrent of humming that surrounded me completely and came out of every quarter of the heavens at once. it was that same familiar humming--gone mad! a swarm of great invisible bees might have been about me in the air. the sound seemed to thicken the very atmosphere, and i felt that my lungs worked with difficulty. but my friend was in danger, and i could not hesitate. the dawn was just about to break, and a faint whitish light spread upwards over the clouds from a thin strip of clear horizon. no wind stirred. i could just make out the bushes and river beyond, and the pale sandy patches. in my excitement i ran frantically to and fro about the island, calling him by name, shouting at the top of my voice the first words that came into my head. but the willows smothered my voice, and the humming muffled it, so that the sound only traveled a few feet round me. i plunged among the bushes, tripping headlong, tumbling over roots, and scraping my face as i tore this way and that among the preventing branches. then, quite unexpectedly, i came out upon the island's point and saw a dark figure outlined between the water and the sky. it was the swede. and already he had one foot in the river! a moment more and he would have taken the plunge. i threw myself upon him, flinging my arms about his waist and dragging him shorewards with all my strength. of course he struggled furiously, making a noise all the time just like that cursed humming, and using the most outlandish phrases in his anger about "going _inside_ to them," and "taking the way of the water and the wind," and god only knows what more besides, that i tried in vain to recall afterwards, but which turned me sick with horror and amazement as i listened. but in the end i managed to get him into the comparative safety of the tent, and flung him breathless and cursing upon the mattress, where i held him until the fit had passed. i think the suddenness with which it all went and he grew calm, coinciding as it did with the equally abrupt cessation of the humming and pattering outside--i think this was almost the strangest part of the whole business perhaps. for he just opened his eyes and turned his tired face up to me so that the dawn threw a pale light upon it through the doorway, and said, for all the world just like a frightened child: "my life, old man--it's my life i owe you. but it's all over now anyhow. they've found a victim in our place!" then he dropped back upon his blankets and went to sleep literally under my eyes. he simply collapsed, and began to snore again as healthily as though nothing had happened and he had never tried to offer his own life as a sacrifice by drowning. and when the sunlight woke him three hours later--hours of ceaseless vigil for me--it became so clear to me that he remembered absolutely nothing of what he had attempted to do, that i deemed it wise to hold my peace and ask no dangerous questions. he woke naturally and easily, as i have said, when the sun was already high in a windless hot sky, and he at once got up and set about the preparation of the fire for breakfast. i followed him anxiously at bathing, but he did not attempt to plunge in, merely dipping his head and making some remark about the extra coldness of the water. "river's falling at last," he said, "and i'm glad of it." "the humming has stopped too," i said. he looked up at me quietly with his normal expression. evidently he remembered everything except his own attempt at suicide. "everything has stopped," he said, "because----" he hesitated. but i knew some reference to that remark he had made just before he fainted was in his mind, and i was determined to know it. "because 'they've found another victim'?" i said, forcing a little laugh. "exactly," he answered, "exactly! i feel as positive of it as though--as though--i feel quite safe again, i mean," he finished. he began to look curiously about him. the sunlight lay in hot patches on the sand. there was no wind. the willows were motionless. he slowly rose to feet. "come," he said; "i think if we look, we shall find it." he started off on a run, and i followed him. he kept to the banks, poking with a stick among the sandy bays and caves and little back-waters, myself always close on his heels. "ah!" he exclaimed presently, "ah!" the tone of his voice somehow brought back to me a vivid sense of the horror of the last twenty-four hours, and i hurried up to join him. he was pointing with his stick at a large black object that lay half in the water and half on the sand. it appeared to be caught by some twisted willow roots so that the river could not sweep it away. a few hours before the spot must have been under water. "see," he said quietly, "the victim that made our escape possible!" and when i peered across his shoulder i saw that his stick rested on the body of a man. he turned it over. it was the corpse of a peasant, and the face was hidden in the sand. clearly the man had been drowned but a few hours before, and his body must have been swept down upon our island somewhere about the hour of the dawn--_at the very time the fit had passed_. "we must give it a decent burial, you know." "i suppose so," i replied. i shuddered a little in spite of myself, for there was something about the appearance of that poor drowned man that turned me cold. the swede glanced up sharply at me, and began clambering down the bank. i followed him more leisurely. the current, i noticed, had torn away much of the clothing from the body, so that the neck and part of the chest lay bare. halfway down the bank my companion suddenly stopped and held up his hand in warning; but either my foot slipped, or i had gained too much momentum to bring myself quickly to a halt, for i bumped into him and sent him forward with a sort of leap to save himself. we tumbled together on to the hard sand so that our feet splashed into the water. and, before anything could be done, we had collided a little heavily against the corpse. the swede uttered a sharp cry. and i sprang back as if i had been shot. at the moment we touched the body there arose from its surface the loud sound of humming--the sound of several hummings--which passed with a vast commotion as of winged things in the air about us and disappeared upwards into the sky, growing fainter and fainter till they finally ceased in the distance. it was exactly as though we had disturbed some living yet invisible creatures at work. my companion clutched me, and i think i clutched him, but before either of us had time properly to recover from the unexpected shock, we saw that a movement of the current was turning the corpse round so that it became released from the grip of the willow roots. a moment later it had turned completely over, the dead face uppermost, staring at the sky. it lay on the edge of the main stream. in another moment it would be swept away. the swede started to save it, shouting again something i did not catch about a "proper burial" and then abruptly dropped upon his knees on the sand and covered his eyes with his hands. i was beside him in an instant. i saw what he had seen. for just as the body swung round to the current the face and the exposed chest turned full towards us, and showed plainly how the skin and flesh were indented with small hollows, beautifully formed, and exactly similar in shape and kind to the sand-funnels that we had found all over the island. "their mark!" i heard my companion mutter under his breath. "their awful mark!" and when i turned my eyes again from his ghastly face to the river, the current had done its work, and the body had been swept away into midstream and was already beyond our reach and almost out of sight, turning over and over on the waves like an otter. the shadows on the wall by mary e. wilkins freeman from _the wind in the rose-bush_, by mary e. wilkins freeman. copyright by harper and brothers. by permission of the publishers and mary e. wilkins freeman. "henry had words with edward in the study the night before edward died," said caroline glynn. she spoke not with acrimony, but with grave severity. rebecca ann glynn gasped by way of assent. she sat in a wide flounce of black silk in the corner of the sofa, and rolled terrified eyes from her sister caroline to her sister mrs. stephen brigham, who had been emma glynn, the one beauty of the family. the latter was beautiful still, with a large, splendid, full-blown beauty, she filled a great rocking-chair with her superb bulk of femininity, and swayed gently back and forth, her black silks whispering and her black frills fluttering. even the shock of death--for her brother edward lay dead in the house--could not disturb her outward serenity of demeanor. but even her expression of masterly placidity changed before her sister caroline's announcement and her sister rebecca ann's gasp of terror and distress in response. "i think henry might have controlled his temper, when poor edward was so near his end," she said with an asperity which disturbed slightly the roseate curves of her beautiful mouth. "of course he did not _know_," murmured rebecca ann in a faint tone. "of course he did not know it," said caroline quickly. she turned on her sister with a strange, sharp look of suspicion. then she shrank as if from the other's possible answer. rebecca gasped again. the married sister, mrs. emma brigham, was now sitting up straight in her chair; she had ceased rocking, and was eyeing them both intently with a sudden accentuation of family likeness in her face. "what do you mean?" said she impartially to them both. then she, too, seemed to shrink before a possible answer. she even laughed an evasive sort of laugh. "nobody means anything," said caroline firmly. she rose and crossed the room toward the door with grim decisiveness. "where are you going?" asked mrs. brigham. "i have something to see to," replied caroline, and the others at once knew by her tone that she had some solemn and sad duty to perform in the chamber of death. "oh," said mrs. brigham. after the door had closed behind caroline, she turned to rebecca. "did henry have many words with him?" she asked. "they were talking very loud," replied rebecca evasively. mrs. brigham looked at her. she had not resumed rocking. she still sat up straight, with a slight knitting of intensity on her fair forehead, between the pretty rippling curves of her auburn hair. "did you--ever hear anything?" she asked in a low voice with a glance toward the door. "i was just across the hall in the south parlor, and that door was open and this door ajar," replied rebecca with a slight flush. "then you must have----" "i couldn't help it." "everything?" "most of it." "what was it?" "the old story." "i suppose henry was mad, as he always was, because edward was living on here for nothing, when he had wasted all the money father left him." rebecca nodded, with a fearful glance at the door. when emma spoke again her voice was still more hushed. "i know how he felt," said she. "it must have looked to him as if edward was living at his expense, but he wasn't." "no, he wasn't." "and edward had a right here according to the terms of father's will, and henry ought to have remembered it." "yes, he ought." "did he say hard things?" "pretty hard, from what i heard." "what?" "i heard him tell edward that he had no business here at all, and he thought he had better go away." "what did edward say?" "that he would stay here as long as he lived and afterward, too, if he was a mind to, and he would like to see henry get him out; and then----" "what?" "then he laughed." "what did henry say?" "i didn't hear him say anything, but----" "but what?" "i saw him when he came out of this room." "he looked mad?" "you've seen him when he looked so." emma nodded. the expression of horror on her face had deepened. "do you remember that time he killed the cat because she had scratched him?" "yes. don't!" then caroline reentered the room; she went up to the stove, in which a wood fire was burning--it was a cold, gloomy day of fall--and she warmed her hands, which were reddened from recent washing in cold water. mrs. brigham looked at her and hesitated. she glanced at the door, which was still ajar; it did not easily shut, being still swollen with the damp weather of the summer. she rose and pushed it together with a sharp thud, which jarred the house. rebecca started painfully with a half-exclamation. caroline looked at her disapprovingly. "it is time you controlled your nerves, rebecca," she said. mrs. brigham, returning from the closed door, said imperiously that it ought to be fixed, it shut so hard. "it will shrink enough after we have had the fire a few days," replied caroline. "i think henry ought to be ashamed of himself for talking as he did to edward," said mrs. brigham abruptly, but in an almost inaudible voice. "hush," said caroline, with a glance of actual fear at the closed door. "nobody can hear with the door shut. i say again i think henry ought to be ashamed of himself. i shouldn't think he'd ever get over it, having words with poor edward the very night before he died. edward was enough sight better disposition than henry, with all his faults." "i never heard him speak a cross word, unless he spoke cross to henry that last night. i don't know but he did from what rebecca overheard." "not so much cross, as sort of soft, and sweet, and aggravating," sniffed rebecca. "what do you really think ailed edward?" asked emma in hardly more than a whisper. she did not look at her sister. "i know you said that he had terrible pains in his stomach, and had spasms, but what do you think made him have them?" "henry called it gastric trouble. you know edward has always had dyspepsia." mrs. brigham hesitated a moment. "was there any talk of an--examination?" said she. then caroline turned on her fiercely. "no," said she in a terrible voice. "no." the three sisters' souls seemed to meet on one common ground of terrified understanding through their eyes. the old-fashioned latch of the door was heard to rattle, and a push from without made the door shake ineffectually. "it's henry," rebecca sighed rather than whispered. mrs. brigham settled herself, after a noiseless rush across the floor, into her rocking-chair again, and was swaying back and forth with her head comfortably leaning back, when the door at last yielded and henry glynn entered. he cast a covertly sharp, comprehensive glance at mrs. brigham with her elaborate calm; at rebecca quietly huddled in the corner of the sofa with her handkerchief to her face and only one small uncovered reddened ear as attentive as a dog's, and at caroline sitting with a strained composure in her armchair by the stove. she met his eyes quite firmly with a look of inscrutable fear, and defiance of the fear and of him. henry glynn looked more like this sister than the others. both had the same hard delicacy of form and aquilinity of feature. they confronted each other with the pitiless immovability of two statues in whose marble lineaments emotions were fixed for all eternity. then henry glynn smiled and the smile transformed his face. he looked suddenly years younger, and an almost boyish recklessness appeared in his face. he flung himself into a chair with a gesture which was bewildering from its incongruity with his general appearance. he leaned his head back, flung one leg over the other, and looked laughingly at mrs. brigham. "i declare, emma, you grow younger every year," he said. she flushed a little, and her placid mouth widened at the corners. she was susceptible to praise. "our thoughts to-day ought to belong to the one of us who will _never_ grow older," said caroline in a hard voice. henry looked at her, still smiling. "of course, we none of us forget that," said he, in a deep, gentle voice; "but we have to speak to the living, caroline, and i have not seen emma for a long time, and the living are as dear as the dead." "not to me," said caroline. she rose and went abruptly out of the room again. rebecca also rose and hurried after her, sobbing loudly. henry looked slowly after them. "caroline is completely unstrung," said he. mrs. brigham rocked. a confidence in him inspired by his manner was stealing over her. out of that confidence she spoke quite easily and naturally. "his death was very sudden," said she. henry's eyelids quivered slightly but his gaze was unswerving. "yes," said he, "it was very sudden. he was sick only a few hours." "what did you call it?" "gastric." "you did not think of an examination?" "there was no need. i am perfectly certain as to the cause of his death." suddenly mrs. brigham felt a creep as of some live horror over her very soul. her flesh prickled with cold, before an inflection of his voice. she rose, tottering on weak knees. "where are you going?" asked henry in a strange, breathless voice. mrs. brigham said something incoherent about some sewing which she had to do--some black for the funeral--and was out of the room. she went up to the front chamber which she occupied. caroline was there. she went close to her and took her hands, and the two sisters looked at each other. "don't speak, don't, i won't have it!" said caroline finally in an awful whisper. "i won't," replied emma. that afternoon the three sisters were in the study. mrs. brigham was hemming some black material. at last she laid her work on her lap. "it's no use, i cannot see to sew another stitch until we have a light," said she. caroline, who was writing some letters at the table, turned to rebecca, in her usual place on the sofa. "rebecca, you had better get a lamp," she said. rebecca started up; even in the dusk her face showed her agitation. "it doesn't seem to me that we need a lamp quite yet," she said in a piteous, pleading voice like a child's. "yes, we do," returned mrs. brigham peremptorily. "i can't see to sew another stitch." rebecca rose and left the room. presently she entered with a lamp. she set it on the table, an old-fashioned card-table which was placed against the opposite wall from the window. that opposite wall was taken up with three doors; the one small space was occupied by the table. "what have you put that lamp over there for?" asked mrs. brigham, with more of impatience than her voice usually revealed. "why didn't you set it in the hall, and have done with it? neither caroline nor i can see if it is on that table." "i thought perhaps you would move," replied rebecca hoarsely. "if i do move, we can't both sit at that table. caroline has her paper all spread around. why don't you set the lamp on the study table in the middle of the room, then we can both see?" rebecca hesitated. her face was very pale. she looked with an appeal that was fairly agonizing at her sister caroline. "why don't you put the lamp on this table, as she says?" asked caroline, almost fiercely. "why do you act so, rebecca?" rebecca took the lamp and set it on the table in the middle of the room without another word. then she seated herself on the sofa and placed a hand over her eyes as if to shade them, and remained so. "does the light hurt your eyes, and is that the reason why you didn't want the lamp?" asked mrs. brigham kindly. "i always like to sit in the dark," replied rebecca chokingly. then she snatched her handkerchief hastily from her pocket and began to weep. caroline continued to write, mrs. brigham to sew. suddenly mrs. brigham as she sewed glanced at the opposite wall. the glance became a steady stare. she looked intently, her work suspended in her hands. then she looked away again and took a few more stitches, then she looked again, and again turned to her task. at last she laid her work in her lap and stared concentratedly. she looked from the wall round the room, taking note of the various objects. then she turned to her sisters. "what _is_ that?" said she. "what?" asked caroline harshly. "that strange shadow on the wall," replied mrs. brigham. rebecca sat with her face hidden; caroline dipped her pen in the inkstand. "why don't you turn around and look?" asked mrs. brigham in a wondering and somewhat aggrieved way. "i am in a hurry to finish this letter," replied caroline shortly. mrs. brigham rose, her work slipping to the floor, and began walking round the room, moving various articles of furniture, with her eyes on the shadow. then suddenly she shrieked out: "look at this awful shadow! what is it? caroline, look, look! rebecca, look! what is it?" all mrs. brigham's triumphant placidity was gone. her handsome face was livid with horror. she stood stiffly pointing at the shadow. then after a shuddering glance at the wall rebecca burst out in a wild wail. "oh, caroline, there it is again, there it is again!" "caroline glynn, you look!" said mrs. brigham. "look! what is that dreadful shadow?" caroline rose, turned, and stood confronting the wall. "how should i know?" she said. "it has been there every night since he died!" cried rebecca. "every night?" "yes; he died thursday and this is saturday; that makes three nights," said caroline rigidly. she stood as if holding her calm with a vise of concentrated will. "it--it looks like--like--" stammered mrs. brigham in a tone of intense horror. "i know what it looks like well enough," said caroline. "i've got eyes in my head." "it looks like edward," burst out rebecca in a sort of frenzy of fear. "only----" "yes, it does," assented mrs. brigham, whose horror-stricken tone matched her sisters', "only--oh, it is awful! what is it, caroline?" "i ask you again, how should i know?" replied caroline. "i see it there like you. how should i know any more than you?" "it _must_ be something in the room," said mrs. brigham, staring wildly around. "we moved everything in the room the first night it came," said rebecca; "it is not anything in the room." caroline turned upon her with a sort of fury. "of course it is something in the room," said she. "how you act! what do you mean talking so? of course it is something in the room." "of course it is," agreed mrs. brigham, looking at caroline suspiciously. "it must be something in the room." "it is not anything in the room," repeated rebecca with obstinate horror. the door opened suddenly and henry glynn entered. he began to speak, then his eyes followed the direction of the others. he stood staring at the shadow on the wall. "what is that?" he demanded in a strange voice. "it must be due to something in the room," mrs. brigham said faintly. henry glynn stood and stared a moment longer. his face showed a gamut of emotions. horror, conviction, then furious incredulity. suddenly he began hastening hither and thither about the room. he moved the furniture with fierce jerks, turning ever to see the effect upon the shadow on the wall. not a line of its terrible outlines wavered. "it must be something in the room!" he declared in a voice which seemed to snap like a lash. his face changed, the inmost secrecy of his nature seemed evident upon his face, until one almost lost sight of his lineaments. rebecca stood close to her sofa, regarding him with woeful, fascinated eyes. mrs. brigham clutched caroline's hand. they both stood in a corner out of his way. for a few moments he raged about the room like a caged wild animal. he moved every piece of furniture; when the moving of a piece did not affect the shadow he flung it to the floor. then suddenly he desisted. he laughed. "what an absurdity," he said easily. "such a to-do about a shadow." "that's so," assented mrs. brigham, in a scared voice which she tried to make natural. as she spoke she lifted a chair near her. "i think you have broken the chair that edward was fond of," said caroline. terror and wrath were struggling for expression on her face. her mouth was set, her eyes shrinking. henry lifted the chair with a show of anxiety. "just as good as ever," he said pleasantly. he laughed again, looking at his sisters. "did i scare you?" he said. "i should think you might be used to me by this time. you know my way of wanting to leap to the bottom of a mystery, and that shadow does look--queer, like--and i thought if there was any way of accounting for it i would like to without any delay." "you don't seem to have succeeded," remarked caroline dryly, with a slight glance at the wall. henry's eyes followed hers and he quivered perceptibly. "oh, there is no accounting for shadows," he said, and he laughed again. "a man is a fool to try to account for shadows." then the supper bell rang, and they all left the room, but henry kept his back to the wall--as did, indeed, the others. henry led the way with an alert motion like a boy; rebecca brought up the rear. she could scarcely walk, her knees trembled so. "i can't sit in that room again this evening," she whispered to caroline after supper. "very well; we will sit in the south room," replied caroline. "i think we will sit in the south parlor," she said aloud; "it isn't as damp as the study, and i have a cold." so they all sat in the south room with their sewing. henry read the newspaper, his chair drawn close to the lamp on the table. about nine o'clock he rose abruptly and crossed the hall to the study. the three sisters looked at one another. mrs. brigham rose, folded her rustling skirts compactly round her, and began tiptoeing toward the door. "what are you going to do?" inquired rebecca agitatedly. "i am going to see what he is about," replied mrs. brigham cautiously. as she spoke she pointed to the study door across the hall; it was ajar. henry had striven to pull it together behind him, but it had somehow swollen beyond the limit with curious speed. it was still ajar and a streak of light showed from top to bottom. mrs. brigham folded her skirts so tightly that her bulk with its swelling curves was revealed in a black silk sheath, and she went with a slow toddle across the hall to the study door. she stood there, her eye at the crack. in the south room rebecca stopped sewing and sat watching with dilated eyes. caroline sewed steadily. what mrs. brigham, standing at the crack in the study door, saw was this: henry glynn, evidently reasoning that the source of the strange shadow must be between the table on which the lamp stood and the wall, was making systematic passes and thrusts with an old sword which had belonged to his father all over and through the intervening space. not an inch was left unpierced. he seemed to have divided the space into mathematical sections. he brandished the sword with a sort of cold fury and calculation; the blade gave out flashes of light, the shadow remained unmoved. mrs. brigham, watching, felt herself cold with horror. finally henry ceased and stood with the sword in hand and raised as if to strike, surveying the shadow on the wall threateningly. mrs. brigham toddled back across the hall and shut the south room door behind her before she related what she had seen. "he looked like a demon," she said again. "have you got any of that old wine in the house, caroline? i don't feel as if i could stand much more." "yes, there's plenty," said caroline; "you can have some when you go to bed." "i think we had all better take some," said mrs. brigham. "oh, caroline, what----" "don't ask; don't speak," said caroline. "no, i'm not going to," replied mrs. brigham; "but----" soon the three sisters went to their chambers and the south parlor was deserted. caroline called to henry in the study to put out the light before he came upstairs. they had been gone about an hour when he came into the room bringing the lamp which had stood in the study. he set it on the table, and waited a few minutes, pacing up and down. his face was terrible, his fair complexion showed livid, and his blue eyes seemed dark blanks of awful reflections. then he took up the lamp and returned to the library. he set the lamp on the center table and the shadow sprang out on the wall. again he studied the furniture and moved it about, but deliberately, with none of his former frenzy. nothing affected the shadow. then he returned to the south room with the lamp and again waited. again he returned to the study and placed the lamp on the table, and the shadow sprang out upon the wall. it was midnight before he went upstairs. mrs. brigham and the other sisters, who could not sleep, heard him. the next day was the funeral. that evening the family sat in the south room. some relatives were with them. nobody entered the study until henry carried a lamp in there after the others had retired for the night. he saw again the shadow on the wall leap to an awful life before the light. the next morning at breakfast henry glynn announced that he had to go to the city for three days. the sisters looked at him with surprise. he very seldom left home, and just now his practice had been neglected on account of edward's death. "how can you leave your patients now?" asked mrs. brigham wonderingly. "i don't know how to, but there is no other way," replied henry easily. "i have had a telegram from dr. mitford." "consultation?" inquired mrs. brigham. "i have business," replied henry. doctor mitford was an old classmate of his who lived in a neighboring city and who occasionally called upon him in the case of a consultation. after he had gone, mrs. brigham said to caroline that, after all, henry had not said that he was going to consult with doctor mitford, and she thought it very strange. "everything is very strange," said rebecca with a shudder. "what do you mean?" inquired caroline. "nothing," replied rebecca. nobody entered the study that day, nor the next. the third day henry was expected home, but he did not arrive and the last train from the city had come. "i call it pretty queer work," said mrs. brigham. "the idea of a doctor leaving his patients at such a time as this, and the idea of a consultation lasting three days! there is no sense in it, and _now_ he has not come. i don't understand it, for my part." "i don't either," said rebecca. they were all in the south parlor. there was no light in the study; the door was ajar. presently mrs. brigham rose--she could not have told why; something seemed to impel her--some will outside her own. she went out of the room, again wrapping her rustling skirts round that she might pass noiselessly, and began pushing at the swollen door of the study. "she has not got any lamp," said rebecca in a shaking voice. caroline, who was writing letters, rose again, took the only remaining lamp in the room, and followed her sister. rebecca had risen, but she stood trembling, not venturing to follow. the doorbell rang, but the others did not hear it; it was on the south door on the other side of the house from the study. rebecca, after hesitating until the bell rang the second time, went to the door; she remembered that the servant was out. caroline and her sister emma entered the study. caroline set the lamp on the table. they looked at the wall, and there were two shadows. the sisters stood clutching each other, staring at the awful things on the wall. then rebecca came in, staggering, with a telegram in her hand. "here is--a telegram," she gasped. "henry is--dead." the messenger by robert w. chambers little gray messenger, robed like painted death, your robe is dust. whom do you seek among lilies and closed buds at dusk? among lilies and closed buds at dusk, whom do you seek, little gray messenger, robed in the awful panoply of painted death? r.w.c. from _the mystery of choice_, by robert w. chambers. published, <UNK> by d. appleton and company. copyright by robert w. chambers. by permission of robert w. chambers. all-wise, hast thou seen all there is to see with thy two eyes? dost thou know all there is to know, and so, omniscient, darest thou still to say thy brother lies? r.w.c. i "the bullet entered here," said max fortin, and he placed his middle finger over a smooth hole exactly in the center of the forehead. i sat down upon a mound of dry seaweed and unslung my fowling piece. the little chemist cautiously felt the edges of the shot-hole, first with his middle finger, and then with his thumb. "let me see the skull again," said i. max fortin picked it up from the sod. "it's like all the others," he repeated, wiping his glasses on his handkerchief. "i thought you might care to see one of the skulls, so i brought this over from the gravel pit. the men from bannalec are digging yet. they ought to stop." "how many skulls are there altogether?" i inquired. "they found thirty-eight skulls; there are thirty-nine noted in the list. they lie piled up in the gravel pit on the edge of le bihan's wheat field. the men are at work yet. le bihan is going to stop them." "let's go over," said i; and i picked up my gun and started across the cliffs, portin on one side, môme on the other. "who has the list?" i asked, lighting my pipe. "you say there is a list?" "the list was found rolled up in a brass cylinder," said the chemist. he added: "you should not smoke here. you know that if a single spark drifted into the wheat--" "ah, but i have a cover to my pipe," said i, smiling. fortin watched me as i closed the pepper-box arrangement over the glowing bowl of the pipe. then he continued: "the list was made out on thick yellow paper; the brass tube has preserved it. it is as fresh to-day as it was in <UNK> you shall see it." "is that the date?" "the list is dated 'april, <UNK> the brigadier durand has it. it is not written in french." "not written in french!" i exclaimed. "no," replied fortin solemnly, "it is written in breton." "but," i protested, "the breton language was never written or printed in <UNK> "except by priests," said the chemist. "i have heard of but one priest who ever wrote the breton language," i began. fortin stole a glance at my face. "you mean--the black priest?" he asked. i nodded. fortin opened his mouth to speak again, hesitated, and finally shut his teeth obstinately over the wheat stem that he was chewing. "and the black priest?" i suggested encouragingly. but i knew it was useless; for it is easier to move the stars from their courses than to make an obstinate breton talk. we walked on for a minute or two in silence. "where is the brigadier durand?" i asked, motioning môme to come out of the wheat, which he was trampling as though it were heather. as i spoke we came in sight of the farther edge of the wheat field and the dark, wet mass of cliffs beyond. "durand is down there--you can see him; he stands just behind the mayor of st. gildas." "i see," said i; and we struck straight down, following a sun-baked cattle path across the heather. when we reached the edge of the wheat field, le bihan, the mayor of st. gildas, called to me, and i tucked my gun under my arm and skirted the wheat to where he stood. "thirty-eight skulls," he said in his thin, high-pitched voice; "there is but one more, and i am opposed to further search. i suppose fortin told you?" i shook hands with him, and returned the salute of the brigadier durand. "i am opposed to further search," repeated le bihan, nervously picking at the mass of silver buttons which covered the front of his velvet and broadcloth jacket like a breastplate of scale armor. durand pursed up his lips, twisted his tremendous mustache, and hooked his thumbs in his saber belt. "as for me," he said, "i am in favor of further search." "further search for what--for the thirty-ninth skull?" i asked. le bihan nodded. durand frowned at the sunlit sea, rocking like a bowl of molten gold from the cliffs to the horizon. i followed his eyes. on the dark glistening cliffs, silhouetted against the glare of the sea, sat a cormorant, black, motionless, its horrible head raised toward heaven. "where is that list, durand?" i asked. the gendarme rummaged in his despatch pouch and produced a brass cylinder about a foot long. very gravely he unscrewed the head and dumped out a scroll of thick yellow paper closely covered with writing on both sides. at a nod from le bihan he handed me the scroll. but i could make nothing of the coarse writing, now faded to a dull brown. "come, come, le bihan," i said impatiently, "translate it, won't you? you and max fortin make a lot of mystery out of nothing, it seems." le bihan went to the edge of the pit where the three bannalec men were digging, gave an order or two in breton, and turned to me. as i came to the edge of the pit the bannalec men were removing a square piece of sailcloth from what appeared to be a pile of cobblestones. "look!" said le bihan shrilly. i looked. the pile below was a heap of skulls. after a moment i clambered down the gravel sides of the pit and walked over to the men of bannalec. they saluted me gravely, leaning on their picks and shovels, and wiping their sweating faces with sunburned hands. "how many?" said i in breton. "thirty-eight," they replied. i glanced around. beyond the heap of skulls lay two piles of human bones. beside these was a mound of broken, rusted bits of iron and steel. looking closer, i saw that this mound was composed of rusty bayonets, saber blades, scythe blades, with here and there a tarnished buckle attached to a bit of leather hard as iron. i picked up a couple of buttons and a belt plate. the buttons bore the royal arms of england; the belt plate was emblazoned with the english arms and also with the number <UNK> "i have heard my grandfather speak of the terrible english regiment, the <UNK> foot, which landed and stormed the fort up there," said one of the bannalec men. "oh!" said i; "then these are the bones of english soldiers?" "yes," said the men of bannalec. le bihan was calling to me from the edge of the pit above, and i handed the belt plate and buttons to the men and climbed the side of the excavation. "well," said i, trying to prevent môme from leaping up and licking my face as i emerged from the pit, "i suppose you know what these bones are. what are you going to do with them?" "there was a man," said le bihan angrily, "an englishman, who passed here in a dog-cart on his way to quimper about an hour ago, and what do you suppose he wished to do?" "buy the relics?" i asked, smiling. "exactly--the pig!" piped the mayor of st. gildas. "jean marie tregunc, who found the bones, was standing there where max fortin stands, and do you know what he answered? he spat upon the ground, and said: 'pig of an englishman, do you take me for a desecrator of graves?'" i knew tregunc, a sober, blue-eyed breton, who lived from one year's end to the other without being able to afford a single bit of meat for a meal. "how much did the englishman offer tregunc?" i asked. "two hundred francs for the skulls alone." i thought of the relic hunters and the relic buyers on the battlefields of our civil war. "seventeen hundred and sixty is long ago," i said. "respect for the dead can never die," said fortin. "and the english soldiers came here to kill your fathers and burn your homes," i continued. "they were murderers and thieves, but--they are dead," said tregunc, coming up from the beach below, his long sea rake balanced on his dripping jersey. "how much do you earn every year, jean marie?" i asked, turning to shake hands with him. "two hundred and twenty francs, monsieur." "forty-five dollars a year," i said. "bah! you are worth more, jean. will you take care of my garden for me? my wife wished me to ask you. i think it would be worth one hundred francs a month to you and to me. come on, le bihan--come along, fortin--and you, durand. i want somebody to translate that list into french for me." tregunc stood gazing at me, his blue eyes dilated. "you may begin at once," i said, smiling, "if the salary suits you?" "it suits," said tregunc, fumbling for his pipe in a silly way that annoyed le bihan. "then go and begin your work," cried the mayor impatiently; and tregunc started across the moors toward st. gildas, taking off his velvet-ribboned cap to me and gripping his sea rake very hard. "you offer him more than my salary," said the mayor, after a moment's contemplation of his silver buttons. "pooh!" said i, "what do you do for your salary except play dominoes with max portin at the groix inn?" le bihan turned red, but durand rattled his saber and winked at max fortin, and i slipped my arm through the arm of the sulky magistrate, laughing. "there's a shady spot under the cliff," i said; "come on, le bihan, and read me what is in the scroll." in a few moments we reached the shadow of the cliff, and i threw myself upon the turf, chin on hand, to listen. the gendarme, durand, also sat down, twisting his mustache into needlelike points. fortin leaned against the cliff, polishing his glasses and examining us with vague, near-sighted eyes; and le bihan, the mayor, planted himself in our midst, rolling up the scroll and tucking it under his arm. "first of all," he began in a shrill voice, "i am going to light my pipe, and while lighting it i shall tell you what i have heard about the attack on the fort yonder. my father told me; his father told him." he jerked his head in the direction of the ruined fort, a small, square stone structure on the sea cliff, now nothing but crumbling walls. then he slowly produced a tobacco pouch, a bit of flint and tinder, and a long-stemmed pipe fitted with a microscopical bowl of baked clay. to fill such a pipe requires ten minutes' close attention. to smoke it to a finish takes but four puffs. it is very breton, this breton pipe. it is the crystallization of everything breton. "go on," said i, lighting a cigarette. "the fort," said the mayor, "was built by louis xiv, and was dismantled twice by the english. louis xv restored it in <UNK> in <UNK> it was carried by assault by the english. they came across from the island of groix--three shiploads, and they stormed the fort and sacked st. julien yonder, and they started to burn st. gildas--you can see the marks of their bullets on my house yet; but the men of bannalec and the men of lorient fell upon them with pike and scythe and blunderbuss, and those who did not run away lie there below in the gravel pit now--thirty-eight of them." "and the thirty-ninth skull?" i asked, finishing my cigarette. the mayor had succeeded in filling his pipe, and now he began to put his tobacco pouch away. "the thirty-ninth skull," he mumbled, holding the pipe stem between his defective teeth--"the thirty-ninth skull is no business of mine. i have told the bannalec men to cease digging." "but what is--whose is the missing skull?" i persisted curiously. the mayor was busy trying to strike a spark to his tinder. presently he set it aglow, applied it to his pipe, took the prescribed four puffs, knocked the ashes out of the bowl, and gravely replaced the pipe in his pocket. "the missing skull?" he asked. "yes," said i, impatiently. the mayor slowly unrolled the scroll and began to read, translating from the breton into french. and this is what he read: "on the cliffs of st. gildas, april <UNK> <UNK> "on this day, by order of the count of soisic, general in chief of the breton forces now lying in kerselec forest, the bodies of thirty-eight english soldiers of the <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> regiments of foot were buried in this spot, together with their arms and equipments." the mayor paused and glanced at me reflectively. "go on, le bihan," i said. "with them," continued the mayor, turning the scroll and reading on the other side, "was buried the body of that vile traitor who betrayed the fort to the english. the manner of his death was as follows: by order of the most noble count of soisic, the traitor was first branded upon the forehead with the brand of an arrowhead. the iron burned through the flesh and was pressed heavily so that the brand should even burn into the bone of the skull. the traitor was then led out and bidden to kneel. he admitted having guided the english from the island of groix. although a priest and a frenchman, he had violated his priestly office to aid him in discovering the password to the fort. this password he extorted during confession from a young breton girl who was in the habit of rowing across from the island of groix to visit her husband in the fort. when the fort fell, this young girl, crazed by the death of her husband, sought the count of soisic and told how the priest had forced her to confess to him all she knew about the fort. the priest was arrested at st. gildas as he was about to cross the river to lorient. when arrested he cursed the girl, marie trevec----" "what!" i exclaimed, "marie trevec!" "marie trevec," repeated le bihan; "the priest cursed marie trevec, and all her family and descendants. he was shot as he knelt, having a mask of leather over his face, because the bretons who composed the squad of execution refused to fire at a priest unless his face was concealed. the priest was l'abbé sorgue, commonly known as the black priest on account of his dark face and swarthy eyebrows. he was buried with a stake through his heart." le bihan paused, hesitated, looked at me, and handed the manuscript back to durand. the gendarme took it and slipped it into the brass cylinder. "so," said i, "the thirty-ninth skull is the skull of the black priest." "yes," said fortin. "i hope they won't find it." "i have forbidden them to proceed," said the mayor querulously. "you heard me, max fortin." i rose and picked up my gun. môme came and pushed his head into my hand. "that's a fine dog," observed durand, also rising. "why don't you wish to find his skull?" i asked le bihan. "it would be curious to see whether the arrow brand really burned into the bone." "there is something in that scroll that i didn't read to you," said the mayor grimly. "do you wish to know what it is?" "of course," i replied in surprise. "give me the scroll again, durand," he said; then he read from the bottom: "i, l'abbé sorgue, forced to write the above by my executioners, have written it in my own blood; and with it i leave my curse. my curse on st. gildas, on marie trevec, and on her descendants. i will come back to st. gildas when my remains are disturbed. woe to that englishman whom my branded skull shall touch!" "what rot!" i said. "do you believe it was really written in his own blood?" "i am going to test it," said fortin, "at the request of monsieur le maire. i am not anxious for the job, however." "see," said le bihan, holding out the scroll to me, "it is signed, 'l'abbé sorgue.'" i glanced curiously over the paper. "it must be the black priest," i said. "he was the only man who wrote in the breton language. this is a wonderfully interesting discovery, for now, at last, the mystery of the black priest's disappearance is cleared up. you will, of course, send this scroll to paris, le bihan?" "no," said the mayor obstinately, "it shall be buried in the pit below where the rest of the black priest lies." i looked at him and recognized that argument would be useless. but still i said, "it will be a loss to history, monsieur le bihan." "all the worse for history, then," said the enlightened mayor of st. gildas. we had sauntered back to the gravel pit while speaking. the men of bannalec were carrying the bones of the english soldiers toward the st. gildas cemetery, on the cliffs to the east, where already a knot of white-coiffed women stood in attitudes of prayer; and i saw the somber robe of a priest among the crosses of the little graveyard. "they were thieves and assassins; they are dead now," muttered max fortin. "respect the dead," repeated the mayor of st. gildas, looking after the bannalec men. "it was written in that scroll that marie trevec, of groix island, was cursed by the priest--she and her descendants," i said, touching le bihan on the arm. "there was a marie trevec who married an yves trevec of st. gildas----" "it is the same," said le bihan, looking at me obliquely. "oh!" said i; "then they were ancestors of my wife." "do you fear the curse?" asked le bihan. "what?" i laughed. "there was the case of the purple emperor," said max fortin timidly. startled for a moment, i faced him, then shrugged my shoulders and kicked at a smooth bit of rock which lay near the edge of the pit, almost embedded in gravel. "do you suppose the purple-emperor drank himself crazy because he was descended from marie trevec?" i asked contemptuously. "of course not," said max fortin hastily. "of course not," piped the mayor. "i only--hellow! what's that you're kicking?" "what?" said i, glancing down, at the same time involuntarily giving another kick. the smooth bit of rock dislodged itself and rolled out of the loosened gravel at my feet. "the thirty-ninth skull!" i exclaimed. "by jingo, it's the noddle of the black priest! see! there is the arrowhead branded on the front!" the mayor stepped back. max fortin also retreated. there was a pause, during which i looked at them, and they looked anywhere but at me. "i don't like it," said the mayor at last, in a husky, high voice. "i don't like it! the scroll says he will come back to st. gildas when his remains are disturbed. i--i don't like it, monsieur darrel--" "bosh!" said i; "the poor wicked devil is where he can't get out. for heaven's sake, le bihan, what is this stuff you are talking in the year of grace <UNK> the mayor gave me a look. "and he says 'englishman.' you are an englishman, monsieur darrel," he announced. "you know better. you know i'm an american." "it's all the same," said the mayor of st. gildas, obstinately. "no, it isn't!" i answered, much exasperated, and deliberately pushed the skull till it rolled into the bottom of the gravel pit below. "cover it up," said i; "bury the scroll with it too, if you insist, but i think you ought to send it to paris. don't look so gloomy, fortin, unless you believe in werewolves and ghosts. hey! what the--what the devil's the matter with you, anyway? what are you staring at, le bihan?" "come, come," muttered the mayor in a low, tremulous voice, "it's time we got out of this. did you see? did you see, fortin?" "i saw," whispered max fortin, pallid with fright. the two men were almost running across the sunny pasture now, and i hastened after them, demanding to know what was the matter. "matter!" chattered the mayor, gasping with exasperation and terror. "the skull is rolling up hill again," and he burst into a terrified gallop, max fortin followed close behind. i watched them stampeding across the pasture, then turned toward the gravel pit, mystified, incredulous. the skull was lying on the edge of the pit, exactly where it had been before i pushed it over the edge. for a second i stared at it; a singular chilly feeling crept up my spinal column, and i turned and walked away, sweat starting from the root of every hair on my head. before i had gone twenty paces the absurdity of the whole thing struck me. i halted, hot with shame and annoyance, and retraced my steps. there lay the skull. "i rolled a stone down instead of the skull," i muttered to myself. then with the butt of my gun i pushed the skull over the edge of the pit and watched it roll to the bottom; and as it struck the bottom of the pit, môme, my dog, suddenly whipped his tail between his legs, whimpered, and made off across the moor. "môme!" i shouted, angry and astonished; but the dog only fled the faster, and i ceased calling from sheer surprise. "what the mischief is the matter with that dog!" i thought. he had never before played me such a trick. mechanically i glanced into the pit, but i could not see the skull. i looked down. the skull lay at my feet again, touching them. "good heavens!" i stammered, and struck at it blindly with my gunstock. the ghastly thing flew into the air, whirling over and over, and rolled again down the sides of the pit to the bottom. breathlessly i stared at it, then, confused and scarcely comprehending, i stepped back from the pit, still facing it, one, ten, twenty paces, my eyes almost starting from my head, as though i expected to see the thing roll up from the bottom of the pit under my very gaze. at last i turned my back to the pit and strode out across the gorse-covered moorland toward my home. as i reached the road that winds from st. gildas to st. julien i gave one hasty glance at the pit over my shoulder. the sun shone hot on the sod about the excavation. there was something white and bare and round on the turf at the edge of the pit. it might have been a stone; there were plenty of them lying about. ii when i entered my garden i saw môme sprawling on the stone doorstep. he eyed me sideways and flopped his tail. "are you not mortified, you idiot dog?" i said, looking about the upper windows for lys. môme rolled over on his back and raised one deprecating forepaw, as though to ward off calamity. "don't act as though i was in the habit of beating you to death," i said, disgusted. i had never in my life raised whip to the brute. "but you are a fool dog," i continued. "no, you needn't come to be babied and wept over; lys can do that, if she insists, but i am ashamed of you, and you can go to the devil." môme slunk off into the house, and i followed, mounting directly to my wife's boudoir. it was empty. "where has she gone?" i said, looking hard at môme, who had followed me. "oh! i see you don't know. don't pretend you do. come off that lounge! do you think lys wants tan-colored hairs all over her lounge?" i rang the bell for catherine and fine, but they didn't know where "madame" had gone; so i went into my room, bathed, exchanged my somewhat grimy shooting clothes for a suit of warm, soft knickerbockers, and, after lingering some extra moments over my toilet--for i was particular, now that i had married lys--i went down to the garden and took a chair out under the fig-trees. "where can she be?" i wondered, môme came sneaking out to be comforted, and i forgave him for lys's sake, whereupon he frisked. "you bounding cur," said i, "now what on earth started you off across the moor? if you do it again i'll push you along with a charge of dust shot." as yet i had scarcely dared think about the ghastly hallucination of which i had been a victim, but now i faced it squarely, flushing a little with mortification at the thought of my hasty retreat from the gravel pit. "to think," i said aloud, "that those old woman's tales of max fortin and le bihan should have actually made me see what didn't exist at all! i lost my nerve like a schoolboy in a dark bedroom." for i knew now that i had mistaken a round stone for a skull each time, and had pushed a couple of big pebbles into the pit instead of the skull itself. "by jingo!" said i, "i'm nervous; my liver must be in a devil of a condition if i see such things when i'm awake! lys will know what to give me." i felt mortified and irritated and sulky, and thought disgustedly of le bihan and max fortin. but after a while i ceased speculating, dismissed the mayor, the chemist, and the skull from my mind, and smoked pensively, watching the sun low dipping in the western ocean. as the twilight fell for a moment over ocean and moorland, a wistful, restless happiness filled my heart, the happiness that all men know--all men who have loved. slowly the purple mist crept out over the sea; the cliffs darkened; the forest was shrouded. suddenly the sky above burned with the afterglow, and the world was alight again. cloud after cloud caught the rose dye; the cliffs were tinted with it; moor and pasture, heather and forest burned and pulsated with the gentle flush. i saw the gulls turning and tossing above the sand bar, their snowy wings tipped with pink; i saw the sea swallows sheering the surface of the still river, stained to its placid depths with warm reflections of the clouds. the twitter of drowsy hedge birds broke out in the stillness; a salmon rolled its shining side above tidewater. the interminable monotone of the ocean intensified the silence. i sat motionless, holding my breath as one who listens to the first low rumor of an organ. all at once the pure whistle of a nightingale cut the silence, and the first moonbeam silvered the wastes of mist-hung waters. i raised my head. lys stood before me in the garden. when we had kissed each other, we linked arms and moved up and down the gravel walks, watching the moonbeams sparkle on the sand bar as the tide ebbed and ebbed. the broad beds of white pinks about us were atremble with hovering white moths; the october roses hung all abloom, perfuming the salt wind. "sweetheart," i said, "where is yvonne? has she promised to spend christmas with us?" "yes, dick; she drove me down from plougat this afternoon. she sent her love to you. i am not jealous. what did you shoot?" "a hare and four partridges. they are in the gun room. i told catherine not to touch them until you had seen them." now i suppose i knew that lys could not be particularly enthusiastic over game or guns; but she pretended she was, and always scornfully denied that it was for my sake and not for the pure love of sport. so she dragged me off to inspect the rather meager game bag, and she paid me pretty compliments, and gave a little cry of delight and pity as i lifted the enormous hare out of the sack by his ears. "he'll eat no more of our lettuce," i said attempting to justify the assassination. "unhappy little bunny--and what a beauty! o dick, you are a splendid shot, are you not?" i evaded the question and hauled out a partridge. "poor little dead things'" said lys in a whisper; "it seems a pity--doesn't it, dick? but then you are so clever----" "we'll have them broiled," i said guardedly, "tell catherine." catherine came in to take away the game, and presently 'fine lelocard, lys's maid, announced dinner, and lys tripped away to her boudoir. i stood an instant contemplating her blissfully, thinking, "my boy, you're the happiest fellow in the world--you're in love with your wife'" i walked into the dining-room, beamed at the plates, walked out again; met tregunc in the hallway, beamed on him; glanced into the kitchen, beamed at catherine, and went up stairs, still beaming. before i could knock at lys's door it opened, and lys came hastily out. when she saw me she gave a little cry of relief, and nestled close to my breast. "there is something peering in at my window," she said. "what!" i cried angrily. "a man, i think, disguised as a priest, and he has a mask on. he must have climbed up by the bay tree." i was down the stairs and out of doors in no time. the moonlit garden was absolutely deserted. tregunc came up, and together we searched the hedge and shrubbery around the house and out to the road. "jean marie," said i at length, "loose my bulldog--he knows you--and take your supper on the porch where you can watch. my wife says the fellow is disguised as a priest, and wears a mask." tregunc showed his white teeth in a smile. "he will not care to venture in here again, i think, monsieur darrel." i went back and found lys seated quietly at the table. "the soup is ready, dear," she said. "don't worry; it was only some foolish lout from bannalec. no one in st. gildas or st. julien would do such a thing." i was too much exasperated to reply at first, but lys treated it as a stupid joke, and after a while i began to look at it in that light. lys told me about yvonne, and reminded me of my promise to have herbert stuart down to meet her. "you wicked diplomat!" i protested. "herbert is in paris, and hard at work for the salon." "don't you think he might spare a week to flirt with the prettiest girl in finistere?" inquired lys innocently. "prettiest girl! not much!" i said. "who is, then?" urged lys. i laughed a trifle sheepishly. "i suppose you mean me, dick," said lys, coloring up. "now i bore you, don't i?" "bore me? ah, no, dick." after coffee and cigarettes were served i spoke about tregunc, and lys approved. "poor jean! he will be glad, won't he? what a dear fellow you are!" "nonsense," said i; "we need a gardener; you said so yourself, lys." but lys leaned over and kissed me, and then bent down and hugged môme--who whistled through his nose in sentimental appreciation. "i am a very happy woman," said lys. "môme was a very bad dog to-day," i observed. "poor môme!" said lys, smiling. when dinner was over and môme lay snoring before the blaze--for the october nights are often chilly in finistere--lys curled up in the chimney corner with her embroidery, and gave me a swift glance from under her dropping lashes. "you look like a schoolgirl, lys," i said teasingly. "i don't believe you are sixteen yet." she pushed back her heavy burnished hair thoughtfully. her wrist was as white as surf foam. "have we been married four years? i don't believe it," i said. she gave me another swift glance and touched the embroidery on her knee, smiling faintly. "i see," said i, also smiling at the embroidered garment. "do you think it will fit?" "fit?" repeated lys. then she laughed "and," i persisted, "are you perfectly sure that you--er--we shall need it?" "perfectly," said lys. a delicate color touched her cheeks and neck. she held up the little garment, all fluffy with misty lace and wrought with quaint embroidery. "it is very gorgeous," said i; "don't use your eyes too much, dearest. may i smoke a pipe?" "of course," she said selecting a skein of pale blue silk. for a while i sat and smoked in silence, watching her slender fingers among the tinted silks and thread of gold. presently she spoke: "what did you say your crest is, dick?" "my crest? oh, something or other rampant on a something or other----" "dick!" "dearest?" "don't be flippant." "but i really forget. it's an ordinary crest; everybody in new york has them. no family should be without 'em." "you are disagreeable, dick. send josephine upstairs for my album." "are you going to put that crest on the--the--whatever it is?" "i am; and my own crest, too." i thought of the purple emperor and wondered a little. "you didn't know i had one, did you?" she smiled. "what is it?" i replied evasively. "you shall see. ring for josephine." i rang, and, when 'fine appeared, lys gave her some orders in a low voice, and josephine trotted away, bobbing her white-coiffed head with a "bien, madame!" after a few minutes she returned, bearing a tattered, musty volume, from which the gold and blue had mostly disappeared. i took the book in my hands and examined the ancient emblazoned covers. "lilies!" i exclaimed. "fleur-de-lis," said my wife demurely. "oh!" said i, astonished, and opened the book. "you have never before seen this book?" asked lys, with a touch of malice in her eyes. "you know i haven't. hello! what's this? oho! so there should be a de before trevec? lys de trevec? then why in the world did the purple emperor----" "dick!" cried lys. "all right," said i. "shall i read about the sieur de trevec who rode to saladin's tent alone to seek for medicine for st. louise? or shall i read about--what is it? oh, here it is, all down in black and white--about the marquis de trevec who drowned himself before alva's eyes rather than surrender the banner of the fleur-de-lis to spain? it's all written here. but, dear, how about that soldier named trevec who was killed in the old fort on the cliff yonder?" "he dropped the de, and the trevecs since then have been republicans," said lys--"all except me." "that's quite right," said i; "it is time that we republicans should agree upon some feudal system. my dear, i drink to the king!" and i raised my wine glass and looked at lys. "to the king," said lys, flushing. she smoothed out the tiny garment on her knees; she touched the glass with her lips; her eyes were very sweet. i drained the glass to the king. after a silence i said: "i will tell the king stories. his majesty shall be amused." "his majesty," repeated lys softly. "or hers," i laughed. "who knows?" "who knows?" murmured lys; with a gentle sigh. "i know some stories about jack the giant-killer," i announced. "do you, lys?" "i? no, not about a giant-killer, but i know all about the werewolf, and jeanne-la-flamme, and the man in purple tatters, and--o dear me, i know lots more." "you are very wise," said i. "i shall teach his majesty, english." "and i breton," cried lys jealously. "i shall bring playthings to the king," said i--"big green lizards from the gorse, little gray mullets to swim in glass globes, baby rabbits from the forest of kerselec----" "and i," said lys, "will bring the first primrose, the first branch of aubepine, the first jonquil, to the king--my king." "our king," said i; and there was peace in finistere. i lay back, idly turning the leaves of the curious old volume. "i am looking," said i, "for the crest." "the crest, dear? it is a priest's head with an arrow-shaped mark on the forehead, on a field----" i sat up and stared at my wife. "dick, whatever is the matter?" she smiled. "the story is there in that book. do you care to read it? no? shall i tell it to you? well, then: it happened in the third crusade. there was a monk whom men called the black priest. he turned apostate, and sold himself to the enemies of christ. a sieur de trevec burst into the saracen camp, at the head of only one hundred lances, and carried the black priest away out of the very midst of their army." "so that is how you come by the crest," i said quietly; but i thought of the branded skull in the gravel pit, and wondered. "yes," said lys. "the sieur de trevec cut the black priest's head off, but first he branded him with an arrow mark on the forehead. the book says it was a pious action, and the sieur de trevec got great merit by it. but i think it was cruel, the branding," she sighed. "did you ever hear of any other black priest?" "yes. there was one in the last century, here in st. gildas. he cast a white shadow in the sun. he wrote in the breton language. chronicles, too, i believe. i never saw them. his name was the same as that of the old chronicler, and of the other priest, jacques sorgue. some said he was a lineal descendant of the traitor. of course the first black priest was bad enough for anything. but if he did have a child, it need not have been the ancestor of the last jacques sorgue. they say he was so good he was not allowed to die, but was caught up to heaven one day," added lys, with believing eyes. i smiled. "but he disappeared," persisted lys. "i'm afraid his journey was in another direction," i said jestingly, and thoughtlessly told her the story of the morning. i had utterly forgotten the masked man at her window, but before i finished i remembered him fast enough, and realized what i had done as i saw her face whiten. "lys," i urged tenderly, "that was only some clumsy clown's trick. you said so yourself. you are not superstitious, my dear?" her eyes were on mine. she slowly drew the little gold cross from her bosom and kissed it. but her lips trembled as they pressed the symbol of faith. iii about nine o'clock the next morning i walked into the groix inn and sat down at the long discolored oaken table, nodding good-day to marianne bruyere, who in turn bobbed her white coiffe at me. "my clever bannalec maid," said i, "what is good for a stirrup-cup at the groix inn?" "schist?" she inquired in breton. "with a dash of red wine, then," i replied. she brought the delicious quimperle cider, and i poured a little bordeaux into it. marianne watched me with laughing black eyes. "what makes your cheeks so red, marianne?" i asked. "has jean marie been here?" "we are to be married, monsieur darrel," she laughed. "ah! since when has jean marie tregunc lost his head?" "his head? oh, monsieur darrel--his heart, you mean!" "so i do," said i. "jean marie is a practical fellow." "it is all due to your kindness--" began the girl, but i raised my hand and held up the glass. "it's due to himself. to your happiness, marianne"; and i took a hearty draught of the schist. "now," said i, "tell me where i can find le bihan and max fortin." "monsieur le bihan and monsieur fortin are above in the broad room. i believe they are examining the red admiral's effects." "to send them to paris? oh, i know. may i go up, marianne?" "and god go with you," smiled the girl. when i knocked at the door of the broad room above little max fortin opened it. dust covered his spectacles and nose; his hat, with the tiny velvet ribbons fluttering, was all awry. "come in, monsieur darrel," he said; "the mayor and i are packing up the effects of the purple emperor and of the poor red admiral." "the collections?" i asked, entering the room. "you must be very careful in packing those butterfly cases; the slightest jar might break wings and antennas, you know." le bihan shook hands with me and pointed to the great pile of boxes. "they're all cork lined," he said, "but fortin and i are putting felt around each box. the entomological society of paris pays the freight." the combined collection of the red admiral and the purple emperor made a magnificent display. i lifted and inspected case after case set with gorgeous butterflies and moths, each specimen carefully labelled with the name in latin. there were cases filled with crimson tiger moths all aflame with color; cases devoted to the common yellow butterflies; symphonies in orange and pale yellow; cases of soft gray and dun-colored sphinx moths; and cases of grayish nettle-bed butterflies of the numerous family of vanessa. all alone in a great case by itself was pinned the purple emperor, the apatura iris, that fatal specimen that had given the purple emperor his name and quietus. i remembered the butterfly, and stood looking at it with bent eyebrows. le bihan glanced up from the floor where he was nailing down the lid of a box full of cases. "it is settled, then," said he, "that madame, your wife, gives the purple emperor's entire collection to the city of paris?" i nodded. "without accepting anything for it?" "it is a gift," i said. "including the purple emperor there in the case? that butterfly is worth a great deal of money," persisted le bihan. "you don't suppose that we would wish to sell that specimen, do you?" i answered a trifle sharply. "if i were you i should destroy it," said the mayor in his high-pitched voice. "that would be nonsense," said i, "like your burying the brass cylinder and scroll yesterday." "it was not nonsense," said le bihan doggedly, "and i should prefer not to discuss the subject of the scroll." i looked at max portin, who immediately avoided my eyes. "you are a pair of superstitious old women," said i, digging my hands into my pockets; "you swallow every nursery tale that is invented." "what of it?" said le bihan sulkily; "there's more truth than lies in most of 'em." "oh!" i sneered, "does the mayor of st. gildas and st. julien believe in the loup-garou?" "no, not in the loup-garou." "in what, then--jeanne-la-flamme?" "that," said le bihan with conviction, "is history." "the devil it is!" said i; "and perhaps, monsieur the mayor, your faith in giants is unimpaired?" "there were giants--everybody knows it," growled max fortin. "and you a chemist!" i observed scornfully. "listen, monsieur darrel," squeaked le bihan; "you know yourself that the purple emperor was a scientific man. now suppose i should tell you that he always refused to include in his collection a death's messenger?" "a what?" i exclaimed. "you know what i mean--that moth that flies by night; some call it the death's head, but in st. gildas we call it 'death's messenger.'" "oh!" said i, "you mean that big sphinx moth that is commonly known as the 'death's-head moth.' why the mischief should the people here call it death's messenger?" "for hundreds of years it has been known as death's messenger in st. gildas," said max fortin. "even froissart speaks of it in his commentaries on jacques sorgue's _chronicles_. the book is in your library." "sorgue? and who was jacques sorgue? i never read his book." "jacques sorgue [transcriber's note: the original reads "sorque"] was the son of some unfrocked priest--i forget. it was during the crusades." "good heavens!" i burst out, "i've been hearing of nothing but crusades and priests and death and sorcery ever since i kicked that skull into the gravel pit, and i am tired of it, i tell you frankly. one would think we lived in the dark ages. do you know what year of our lord it is, le bihan?" "eighteen hundred and ninety-six," replied the mayor. "and yet you two hulking men are afraid of a death's-head moth." "i don't care to have one fly into the window," said max fortin; "it means evil to the house and the people in it." "god alone knows why he marked one of his creatures with a yellow death's head on the back," observed le bihan piously, "but i take it that he meant it as a warning; and i propose to profit by it," he added triumphantly. "see here, le bihan," i said; "by a stretch of imagination one can make out a skull on the thorax of a certain big sphinx moth. what of it?" "it is a bad thing to touch," said the mayor wagging his head. "it squeaks when handled," added max fortin. "some creatures squeak all the time," i observed, looking hard at le bihan. "pigs," added the mayor. "yes, and asses," i replied. "listen, le bihan: do you mean to tell me that you saw that skull roll uphill yesterday?" the mayor shut his mouth tightly and picked up his hammer. "don't be obstinate," i said; "i asked you a question." "and i refuse to answer," snapped le bihan. "fortin saw what i saw; let him talk about it." i looked searchingly at the little chemist. "i don't say that i saw it actually roll up out of the pit, all by itself," said fortin with a shiver, "but--but then, how did it come up out of the pit, if it didn't roll up all by itself?" "it didn't come up at all; that was a yellow cobblestone that you mistook for the skull again," i replied. "you were nervous, max." "a--a very curious cobblestone, monsieur darrel," said fortin. "i also was a victim to the same hallucination," i continued, "and i regret to say that i took the trouble to roll two innocent cobblestones into the gravel pit, imagining each time that it was the skull i was rolling." "it was," observed le bihan with a morose shrug. "it just shows," said i, ignoring the mayor's remark, "how easy it is to fix up a train of coincidences so that the result seems to savor of the supernatural. now, last night my wife imagined that she saw a priest in a mask peer in at her window----" fortin and le bihan scrambled hastily from their knees, dropping hammer and nails. "w-h-a-t--what's that?" demanded the mayor. i repeated what i had said. max fortin turned livid. "my god!" muttered le bihan, "the black priest is in st. gildas!" "d-don't you--you know the old prophecy?" stammered fortin; "froissart quotes it from jacques sorgue: "'when the black priest rises from the dead, st. gildas folk shall shriek in bed; when the black priest rises from his grave, may the good god st. gildas save!'" "aristide le bihan," i said angrily, "and you, max fortin, i've got enough of this nonsense! some foolish lout from bannalec has been in st. gildas playing tricks to frighten old fools like you. if you have nothing better to talk about than nursery legends i'll wait until you come to your senses. good-morning." and i walked out, more disturbed than i cared to acknowledge to myself. the day had become misty and overcast. heavy, wet clouds hung in the east. i heard the surf thundering against the cliffs, and the gray gulls squealed as they tossed and turned high in the sky. the tide was creeping across the river sands, higher, higher, and i saw the seaweed floating on the beach, and the lancons springing from the foam, silvery threadlike flashes in the gloom. curlew were flying up the river in twos and threes; the timid sea swallows skimmed across the moors toward some quiet, lonely pool, safe from the coming tempest. in every hedge field birds were gathering, huddling together, twittering restlessly. when i reached the cliffs i sat down, resting my chin on my clenched hands. already a vast curtain of rain, sweeping across the ocean miles away, hid the island of groix. to the east, behind the white semaphore on the hills, black clouds crowded up over the horizon. after a little the thunder boomed, dull, distant, and slender skeins of lightning unraveled across the crest of the coming storm. under the cliff at my feet the surf rushed foaming over the shore, and the lancons jumped and skipped and quivered until they seemed to be but the reflections of the meshed lightning. i turned to the east. it was raining over groix, it was raining at sainte barbe, it was raining now at the semaphore. high in the storm whirl a few gulls pitched; a nearer cloud trailed veils of rain in its wake; the sky was spattered with lightning; the thunder boomed. as i rose to go, a cold raindrop fell upon the back of my hand, and another, and yet another on my face. i gave a last glance at the sea, where the waves were bursting into strange white shapes that seemed to fling out menacing arms toward me. then something moved on the cliff, something black as the black rock it clutched--a filthy cormorant, craning its hideous head at the sky. slowly i plodded homeward across the somber moorland, where the gorse stems glimmered with a dull metallic green, and the heather, no longer violet and purple, hung drenched and dun-colored among the dreary rocks. the wet turf creaked under my heavy boots, the black-thorn scraped and grated against knee and elbow. over all lay a strange light, pallid, ghastly, where the sea spray whirled across the landscape and drove into my face until it grew numb with the cold. in broad bands, rank after rank, billow on billow, the rain burst out across the endless moors, and yet there was no wind to drive it at such a pace. lys stood at the door as i turned into the garden, motioning me to hasten; and then for the first time i became conscious that i was soaked to the skin. "however in the world did you come to stay out when such a storm threatened?" she said. "oh, you are dripping! go quickly and change; i have laid your warm underwear on the bed, dick." i kissed my wife, and went upstairs to change my dripping clothes for something more comfortable. when i returned to the morning room there was a driftwood fire on the hearth, and lys sat in the chimney corner embroidering. "catherine tells me that the fishing fleet from lorient is out. do you think they are in danger, dear?" asked lys, raising her blue eyes to mine as i entered. "there is no wind, and there will be no sea," said i, looking out of the window. far across the moor i could see the black cliffs looming in the mist. "how it rains!" murmured lys; "come to the fire, dick." i threw myself on the fur rug, my hands in my pockets, my head on lys's knees. "tell me a story," i said. "i feel like a boy of ten." lys raised a finger to her scarlet lips. i always waited for her to do that. "will you be very still, then?" she said. "still as death." "death," echoed a voice, very softly. "did you speak, lys?" i asked, turning so that i could see her face. "no; did you, dick?" "who said 'death'?" i asked, startled. "death," echoed a voice, softly. i sprang up and looked about. lys rose too, her needles and embroidery falling to the floor. she seemed about to faint, leaning heavily on me, and i led her to the window and opened it a little way to give her air. as i did so the chain lightning split the zenith, the thunder crashed, and a sheet of rain swept into the room, driving with it something that fluttered--something that flapped, and squeaked, and beat upon the rug with soft, moist wings. we bent over it together, lys clinging to me, and we saw that it was a death's-head moth drenched with rain. the dark day passed slowly as we sat beside the fire, hand in hand, her head against my breast, speaking of sorrow and mystery and death. for lys believed that there were things on earth that none might understand, things that must be nameless forever and ever, until god rolls up the scroll of life and all is ended. we spoke of hope and fear and faith, and the mystery of the saints; we spoke of the beginning and the end, of the shadow of sin, of omens, and of love. the moth still lay on the floor quivering its somber wings in the warmth of the fire, the skull and ribs clearly etched upon its neck and body. "if it is a messenger of death to this house," i said, "why should we fear, lys?" "death should be welcome to those who love god," murmured lys, and she drew the cross from her breast and kissed it. "the moth might die if i threw it out into the storm," i said after a silence. "let it remain," sighed lys. late that night my wife lay sleeping, and i sat beside her bed and read in the chronicle of jacques sorgue. i shaded the candle, but lys grew restless, and finally i took the book down into the morning room, where the ashes of the fire rustled and whitened on the hearth. the death's-head moth lay on the rug before the fire where i had left it. at first i thought it was dead, but when i looked closer i saw a lambent fire in its amber eyes. the straight white shadow it cast across the floor wavered as the candle flickered. the pages of the chronicle of jacques sorgue were damp and sticky; the illuminated gold and blue initials left flakes of azure and gilt where my hand brushed them. "it is not paper at all; it is thin parchment," i said to myself; and i held the discolored page close to the candle flame and read, translating laboriously: "i, jacques sorgue, saw all these things. and i saw the black mass celebrated in the chapel of st. gildas-on-the-cliff. and it was said by the abbé sorgue, my kinsman: for which deadly sin the apostate priest was seized by the most noble marquis of plougastel and by him condemned to be burned with hot irons, until his seared soul quit its body and fly to its master the devil. but when the black priest lay in the crypt of plougastel, his master satan came at night and set him free, and carried him across land and sea to mahmoud, which is soldan or saladin. and i, jacques sorgue, traveling afterward by sea, beheld with my own eyes my kinsman, the black priest of st. gildas, borne along in the air upon a vast black wing, which was the wing of his master satan. and this was seen also by two men of the crew." i turned the page. the wings of the moth on the floor began to quiver. i read on and on, my eyes blurring under the shifting candle flame. i read of battles and of saints, and i learned how the great soldan made his pact with satan, and then i came to the sieur de trevec, and read how he seized the black priest in the midst of saladin's tents and carried him away and cut off his head first branding him on the forehead. "and before he suffered," said the chronicle, "he cursed the sieur de trevec and his descendants, and he said he would surely return to st. gildas. 'for the violence you do to me, i will do violence to you. for the evil i suffer at your hands, i will work evil on you and your descendants. woe to your children, sieur de trevec!'" there was a whirr, a beating of strong wings, and my candle flashed up as in a sudden breeze. a humming filled the room; the great moth darted hither and thither, beating, buzzing, on ceiling and wall. i flung down my book and stepped forward. now it lay fluttering upon the window sill, and for a moment i had it under my hand, but the thing squeaked and i shrank back. then suddenly it darted across the candle flame; the light flared and went out, and at the same moment a shadow moved in the darkness outside. i raised my eyes to the window. a masked face was peering in at me. quick as thought i whipped out my revolver and fired every cartridge, but the face advanced beyond the window, the glass melting away before it like mist, and through the smoke of my revolver i saw something creep swiftly into the room. then i tried to cry out, but the thing was at my throat, and i fell backward among the ashes of the hearth. * * * * * when my eyes unclosed i was lying on the hearth, my head among the cold ashes. slowly i got on my knees, rose painfully, and groped my way to a chair. on the floor lay my revolver, shining in the pale light of early morning. my mind clearing by degrees, i looked, shuddering, at the window. the glass was unbroken. i stooped stiffly, picked up my revolver and opened the cylinder. every cartridge had been fired. mechanically i closed the cylinder and placed the revolver in my pocket. the book, the chronicles of jacques sorgue, lay on the table beside me, and as i started to close it i glanced at the page. it was all splashed with rain, and the lettering had run, so that the page was merely a confused blur of gold and red and black. as i stumbled toward the door i cast a fearful glance over my shoulder. the death's-head moth crawled shivering on the rug. iv the sun was about three hours high. i must have slept, for i was aroused by the sudden gallop of horses under our window. people were shouting and calling in the road. i sprang up and opened the sash. le bihan was there, an image of helplessness, and max fortin stood beside him polishing his glasses. some gendarmes had just arrived from quimperle, and i could hear them around the corner of the house, stamping, and rattling their sabres and carbines, as they led their horses into my stable. lys sat up, murmuring half-sleepy, half-anxious questions. "i don't know," i answered. "i am going out to see what it means." "it is like the day they came to arrest you," lys said, giving me a troubled look. but i kissed her and laughed at her until she smiled too. then i flung on coat and cap and hurried down the stairs. the first person i saw standing in the road was the brigadier durand. "hello!" said i, "have you come to arrest me again? what the devil is all this fuss about, anyway?" "we were telegraphed for an hour ago," said durand briskly, "and for a sufficient reason, i think. look there, monsieur darrel!" he pointed to the ground almost under my feet. "good heavens!" i cried, "where did that puddle of blood come from?" "that's what i want to know, monsieur darrel. max fortin found it at daybreak. see, it's splashed all over the grass, too. a trail of it leads into your garden, across the flower beds to your very window, the one that opens from the morning room. there is another trail leading from this spot across the road to the cliffs, then to the gravel pit, and thence across the moor to the forest of kerselec. we are going to mount in a minute and search the bosquets. will you join us? bon dieu! but the fellow bled like an ox. max fortin says it's human blood, or i should not have believed it." the little chemist of quimperle came up at that moment, rubbing his glasses with a colored handkerchief. "yes, it is human blood," he said, "but one thing puzzles me: the corpuscles are yellow. i never saw any human blood before with yellow corpuscles. but your english doctor thompson asserts that he has----" "well, it's human blood, anyway--isn't it?" insisted durand, impatiently. "ye-es," admitted max fortin. "then it's my business to trail it," said the big gendarme, and he called his men and gave the order to mount. "did you hear anything last night?" asked durand of me. "i heard the rain. i wonder the rain did not wash away these traces." "they must have come after the rain ceased. see this thick splash, how it lies over and weighs down the wet grass blades. pah!" it was a heavy, evil-looking clot, and i stepped back from it, my throat closing in disgust. "my theory," said the brigadier, "is this: some of those biribi fishermen, probably the icelanders, got an extra glass of cognac into their hides and quarreled on the road. some of them were slashed, and staggered to your house. but there is only one trail, and yet--and yet, how could all that blood come from only one person? well, the wounded man, let us say, staggered first to your house and then back here, and he wandered off, drunk and dying, god knows where. that's my theory." "a very good one," said i calmly. "and you are going to trail him?" "yes." "when?" "at once. will you come?" "not now. i'll gallop over by-and-bye. you are going to the edge of the kerselec forest?" "yes; you will hear us calling. are you coming, max fortin? and you, le bihan? good; take the dog-cart." the big gendarme tramped around the corner to the stable and presently returned mounted on a strong gray horse, his sabre shone on his saddle; his pale yellow and white facings were spotless. the little crowd of white-coiffed women with their children fell back as durand touched spurs and clattered away followed by his two troopers. soon after le bihan and max fortin also departed in the mayor's dingy dog-cart. "are you coming?" piped le bihan shrilly. "in a quarter of an hour," i replied, and went back to the house. when i opened the door of the morning room the death's-head moth was beating its strong wings against the window. for a second i hesitated, then walked over and opened the sash. the creature fluttered out, whirred over the flower beds a moment, then darted across the moorland toward the sea. i called the servants together and questioned them. josephine, catherine, jean marie tregunc, not one of them had heard the slightest disturbance during the night. then i told jean marie to saddle my horse, and while i was speaking lys came down. "dearest," i began, going to her. "you must tell me everything you know, dick," she interrupted, looking me earnestly in the face. "but there is nothing to tell--only a drunken brawl, and some one wounded." "and you are going to ride--where, dick?" "well, over to the edge of kerselec forest. durand and the mayor, and max fortin, have gone on, following a--a trail." "what trail?" "some blood." "where did they find it?" "out in the road there." lys crossed herself. "does it come near our house?" "yes." "how near?" "it comes up to the morning room window," said i, giving in. her hand on my arm grew heavy. "i dreamed last night----" "so did i--" but i thought of the empty cartridges in my revolver, and stopped. "i dreamed that you were in great danger, and i could not move hand or foot to save you; but you had your revolver, and i called out to you to fire----" "i did fire!" i cried excitedly. "you--you fired?" i took her in my arms. "my darling," i said "something strange has happened--something that i cannot understand as yet. but, of course, there is an explanation. last night i thought i fired at the black priest." "ah!" gasped lys. "is that what you dreamed?" "yes, yes, that was it! i begged you to fire----" "and i did." her heart was beating against my breast. i held her close in silence. "dick," she said at length, "perhaps you killed the--the thing." "if it was human i did not miss," i answered grimly. "and it was human," i went on, pulling myself together, ashamed of having so nearly gone to pieces. "of course it was human! the whole affair is plain enough. not a drunken brawl, as durand thinks; it was a drunken lout's practical joke, for which he has suffered. i suppose i must have filled him pretty full of bullets, and he has crawled away to die in kerselec forest. it's a terrible affair; i'm sorry i fired so hastily; but that idiot le bihan and max fortin have been working on my nerves till i am as hysterical as a schoolgirl," i ended angrily. "you fired--but the window glass was not shattered," said lys in a low voice. "well, the window was open, then. and as for the--the rest--i've got nervous indigestion, and a doctor will settle the black priest for me, lys." i glanced out of the window at tregunc waiting with my horse at the gate. "dearest, i think i had better go to join durand and the others." "i will go, too." "oh, no!" "yes, dick." "don't, lys." "i shall suffer every moment you are away." "the ride is too fatiguing, and we can't tell what unpleasant sight you may come upon. lys, you don't really think there is anything supernatural in this affair?" "dick," she answered gently, "i am a bretonne." with both arms around my neck, my wife said, "death is the gift of god. i do not fear it when we are together. but alone--oh, my husband, i should fear a god who could take you away from me!" we kissed each other soberly, simply, like two children. then lys hurried away to change her gown, and i paced up and down the garden waiting for her. she came, drawing on her slender gauntlets. i swung her into the saddle, gave a hasty order to jean marie, and mounted. now, to quail under thoughts of terror on a morning like this, with lys in the saddle beside me, no matter what had happened or might happen was impossible. moreover, môme came sneaking after us. i asked tregunc to catch him, for i was afraid he might be brained by our horses' hoofs if he followed, but the wily puppy dodged and bolted after lys, who was trotting along the highroad. "never mind," i thought; "if he's hit he'll live, for he has no brains to lose." lys was waiting for me in the road beside the shrine of our lady of st. gildas when i joined her. she crossed herself, i doffed my cap, then we shook out our bridles and galloped toward the forest of kerselec. we said very little as we rode. i always loved to watch lys in the saddle. her exquisite figure and lovely face were the incarnation of youth and grace; her curling hair glistened like threaded gold. out of the corner of my eye i saw the spoiled puppy môme come bounding cheerfully alongside, oblivious of our horses' heels. our road swung close to the cliffs. a filthy cormorant rose from the black rocks and flapped heavily across our path. lys's horse reared, but she pulled him down, and pointed at the bird with her riding crop. "i see," said i; "it seems to be going our way. curious to see a cormorant in a forest, isn't it?" "it is a bad sign," said lys. "you know the morbihan proverb: 'when the cormorant turns from the sea, death laughs in the forest, and wise woodsmen build boats.'" "i wish," said i sincerely, "that there were fewer proverbs in brittany." we were in sight of the forest now; across the gorse i could see the sparkle of gendarmes' trappings, and the glitter of le bihan's silver-buttoned jacket. the hedge was low and we took it without difficulty, and trotted across the moor to where le bihan and durand stood gesticulating. they bowed ceremoniously to lys as we rode up. "the trail is horrible--it is a river," said the mayor in his squeaky voice. "monsieur darrel, i think perhaps madame would scarcely care to come any nearer." lys drew bridle and looked at me. "it is horrible!" said durand, walking up beside me; "it looks as though a bleeding regiment had passed this way. the trail winds and winds about here in the thickets; we lose it at times, but we always find it again. i can't understand how one man--no, nor twenty--could bleed like that!" a halloo, answered by another, sounded from the depths of the forest. "it's my men; they are following the trail," muttered the brigadier. "god alone knows what is at the end!" "shall we gallop back, lys?" i asked. "no; let us ride along the western edge of the woods and dismount. the sun is so hot now, and i should like to rest for a moment," she said. "the western forest is clear of anything disagreeable," said durand. "very well," i answered; "call me, le bihan, if you find anything." lys wheeled her mare, and i followed across the springy heather, môme trotting cheerfully in the rear. we entered the sunny woods about a quarter of a kilometer from where we left durand. i took lys from her horse, flung both bridles over a limb, and, giving my wife my arm, aided her to a flat mossy rock which overhung a shallow brook gurgling among the beech trees. lys sat down and drew off her gauntlets. môme pushed his head into her lap, received an undeserved caress, and came doubtfully toward me. i was weak enough to condone his offense, but i made him lie down at my feet, greatly to his disgust. i rested my head on lys's knees, looking up at the sky through the crossed branches of the trees. "i suppose i have killed him," i said. "it shocks me terribly, lys." "you could not have known, dear. he may have been a robber, and--if--not--did--have you ever fired your revolver since that day four years ago when the red admiral's son tried to kill you? but i know you have not." "no," said i, wondering. "it's a fact, i have not. why?" "and don't you remember that i asked you to let me load it for you the day when yves went off, swearing to kill you and his father?" "yes, i do remember. well?" "well, i--i took the cartridges first to st. gildas chapel and dipped them in holy water. you must not laugh, dick," said lys gently, laying her cool hands on my lips. "laugh, my darling!" overhead the october sky was pale amethyst, and the sunlight burned like orange flame through the yellow leaves of beech and oak. gnats and midges danced and wavered overhead; a spider dropped from a twig halfway to the ground and hung suspended on the end of his gossamer thread. "are you sleepy, dear?" asked lys, bending over me. "i am--a little; i scarcely slept two hours last night," i answered. "you may sleep, if you wish," said lys, and touched my eyes caressingly. "is my head heavy on your knees?" "no, dick." i was already in a half doze; still i heard the brook babbling under the beeches and the humming of forest flies overhead. presently even these were stilled. the next thing i knew i was sitting bolt upright, my ears ringing with a scream, and i saw lys cowering beside me, covering her white face with both hands. as i sprang to my feet she cried again and clung to my knees. i saw my dog rush growling into a thicket, then i heard him whimper, and he came backing out, whining, ears flat, tail down. i stooped and disengaged lys's hand. "don't go, dick!" she cried. "o god, it's the black priest!" in a moment i had leaped across the brook and pushed my way into the thicket. it was empty. i stared about me; i scanned every tree trunk, every bush. suddenly i saw him. he was seated on a fallen log, his head resting in his hands, his rusty black robe gathered around him. for a moment my hair stirred under my cap; sweat started on forehead and cheek bone; then i recovered my reason, and understood that the man was human and was probably wounded to death. ay, to death; for there at my feet, lay the wet trail of blood, over leaves and stones, down into the little hollow, across to the figure in black resting silently under the trees. i saw that he could not escape even if he had the strength, for before him, almost at his very feet, lay a deep, shining swamp. as i stepped forward my foot broke a twig. at the sound the figure started a little, then its head fell forward again. its face was masked. walking up to the man, i bade him tell where he was wounded. durand and the others broke through the thicket at the same moment and hurried to my side. "who are you who hide a masked face in a priest's robe?" said the gendarme loudly. there was no answer. "see--see the stiff blood all over his robe," muttered le bihan to fortin. "he will not speak," said i. "he may be too badly wounded," whispered le bihan. "i saw him raise his head," i said, "my wife saw him creep up here." durand stepped forward and touched the figure. "speak!" he said. "speak!" quavered fortin. durand waited a moment, then with a sudden upward movement he stripped off the mask and threw back the man's head. we were looking into the eye sockets of a skull. durand stood rigid; the mayor shrieked. the skeleton burst out from its rotting robes and collapsed on the ground before us. from between the staring ribs and the grinning teeth spurted a torrent of black blood, showering the shrinking grasses; then the thing shuddered, and fell over into the black ooze of the bog. little bubbles of iridescent air appeared from the mud; the bones were slowly engulfed, and, as the last fragments sank out of sight, up from the depths and along the bank crept a creature, shiny, shivering, quivering its wings. it was a death's-head moth. * * * * * i wish i had time to tell you how lys outgrew superstitions--for she never knew the truth about the affair, and she never will know, since she has promised not to read this book. i wish i might tell you about the king and his coronation, and how the coronation robe fitted. i wish that i were able to write how yvonne and herbert stuart rode to a boar hunt in quimperle, and how the hounds raced the quarry right through the town, overturning three gendarmes, the notary, and an old woman. but i am becoming garrulous and lys is calling me to come and hear the king say that he is sleepy. and his highness shall not be kept waiting. the king's cradle song seal with a seal of gold the scroll of a life unrolled; swathe him deep in his purple stole; ashes of diamonds, crystalled coal, drops of gold in each scented fold. crimson wings of the little death, stir his hair with your silken breath; flaming wings of sins to be, splendid pinions of prophecy, smother his eyes with hues and dyes, while the white moon spins and the winds arise, and the stars drip through the skies. wave, o wings of the little death! seal his sight and stifle his breath, cover his breast with the gemmed shroud pressed; from north to north, from west to west, wave, o wings of the little death! till the white moon reels in the cracking skies, and the ghosts of god arise. lazarus by leonid andreyev translated by abraham yarmolinsky from _lazarus and the gentleman from san francisco_. published by the stratford company. by permission of the publishers. i when lazarus left the grave, where, for three days and three nights he had been under the enigmatical sway of death, and returned alive to his dwelling, for a long time no one noticed in him those sinister oddities, which, as time went on, made his very name a terror. gladdened unspeakably by the sight of him who had been returned to life, those near to him caressed him unceasingly, and satiated their burning desire to serve him, in solicitude for his food and drink and garments. and they dressed him gorgeously, in bright colors of hope and laughter, and when, like to a bridegroom in his bridal vestures, he sat again among them at the table, and again ate and drank, they wept, overwhelmed with tenderness. and they summoned the neighbors to look at him who had risen miraculously from the dead. these came and shared the serene joy of the hosts. strangers from far-off towns and hamlets came and adored the miracle in tempestuous words. like to a beehive was the house of mary and martha. whatever was found new in lazarus' face and gestures was thought to be some trace of a grave illness and of the shocks recently experienced. evidently, the destruction wrought by death on the corpse was only arrested by the miraculous power, but its effects were still apparent; and what death had succeeded in doing with lazarus' face and body, was like an artist's unfinished sketch seen under thin glass. on lazarus' temples, under his eyes, and in the hollows of his cheeks, lay a deep and cadaverous blueness; cadaverously blue also were his long fingers, and around his fingernails, grown long in the grave, the blue had become purple and dark. on his lips the skin, swollen in the grave, had burst in places, and thin, reddish cracks were formed, shining as though covered with transparent mica. and he had grown stout. his body, puffed up in the grave, retained its monstrous size and showed those frightful swellings, in which one sensed the presence of the rank liquid of decomposition. but the heavy corpse-like odor which penetrated lazarus' graveclothes and, it seemed, his very body, soon entirely disappeared, the blue spots on his face and hands grew paler, and the reddish cracks closed up, although they never disappeared altogether. that is how lazarus looked when he appeared before people, in his second life, but his face looked natural to those who had seen him in the coffin. in addition to the changes in his appearance, lazarus' temper seemed to have undergone a transformation, but this circumstance startled no one and attracted no attention. before his death lazarus had always been cheerful and carefree, fond of laughter and a merry joke. it was because of this brightness and cheerfulness, with not a touch of malice and darkness, that the master had grown so fond of him. but now lazarus had grown grave and taciturn, he never jested, himself, nor responded with laughter to other people's jokes; and the words which he uttered, very infrequently, were the plainest, most ordinary, and necessary words, as deprived of depth and significance, as those sounds with which animals express pain and pleasure, thirst and hunger. they were the words that one can say all one's life, and yet they give no indication of what pains and gladdens the depths of the soul. thus, with the face of a corpse which for three days had been under the heavy sway of death, dark and taciturn, already appallingly transformed, but still unrecognized by anyone in his new self, he was sitting at the feasting table, among friends and relatives, and his gorgeous nuptial garments glittered with yellow gold and bloody scarlet. broad waves of jubilation, now soft, now tempestuously sonorous surged around him; warm glances of love were reaching out for his face, still cold with the coldness of the grave; and a friend's warm palm caressed his blue, heavy hand. and music played the tympanum and the pipe, the cithara and the harp. it was as though bees hummed, grasshoppers chirped and birds warbled over the happy house of mary and martha. ii one of the guests incautiously lifted the veil. by a thoughtless word he broke the serene charm and uncovered the truth in all its naked ugliness. ere the thought formed itself in his mind, his lips uttered with a smile: "why dost thou not tell us what happened yonder?" and all grew silent, startled by the question. it was as if it occurred to them only now that for three days lazarus had been dead, and they looked at him, anxiously awaiting his answer. but lazarus kept silence. "thou dost not wish to tell us,"--wondered the man, "is it so terrible yonder?" and again his thought came after his words. had it been otherwise, he would not have asked this question, which at that very moment oppressed his heart with its insufferable horror. uneasiness seized all present, and with a feeling of heavy weariness they awaited lazarus' words, but he was silent, sternly and coldly, and his eyes were lowered. and as if for the first time, they noticed the frightful blueness of his face and his repulsive obesity. on the table, as though forgotten by lazarus, rested his bluish-purple wrist, and to this all eyes turned, as if it were from it that the awaited answer was to come. the musicians were still playing, but now the silence reached them too, and even as water extinguishes scattered embers, so were their merry tunes extinguished in the silence. the pipe grew silent; the voices of the sonorous tympanum and the murmuring harp died away; and as if the strings had burst, the cithara answered with a tremulous, broken note. silence. "thou dost not wish to say?" repeated the guest, unable to check his chattering tongue. but the stillness remained unbroken, and the bluish-purple hand rested motionless. and then he stirred slightly and everyone felt relieved. he lifted up his eyes, and lo! straightway embracing everything in one heavy glance, fraught with weariness and horror, he looked at them,--lazarus who had arisen from the dead. it was the third day since lazarus had left the grave. ever since then many had experienced the pernicious power of his eye, but neither those who were crushed by it forever, nor those who found the strength to resist in it the primordial sources of life,--which is as mysterious as death,--never could they explain the horror which lay motionless in the depth of his black pupils. lazarus looked calmly and simply with no desire to conceal anything, but also with no intention to say anything; he looked coldly, as he who is infinitely indifferent to those alive. many carefree people came close to him without noticing him, and only later did they learn with astonishment and fear who that calm stout man was, that walked slowly by, almost touching them with his gorgeous and dazzling garments. the sun did not cease shining, when he was looking, nor did the fountain hush its murmur, and the sky overhead remained cloudless and blue. but the man under the spell of his enigmatical look heard no more the fountain and saw not the sky overhead. sometimes, he wept bitterly, sometimes he tore his hair and in frenzy called for help; but more often it came to pass that apathetically and quietly he began to die, and so he languished many years, before everybody's very eyes, wasted away, colorless, flabby, dull, like a tree, silently drying up in a stony soil. and of those who gazed at him, the ones who wept madly, sometimes felt again the stir of life; the others never. "so thou dost not wish to tell us what thou hast seen yonder?" repeated the man. but now his voice was impassive and dull, and deadly gray weariness showed in lazarus' eyes. and deadly gray weariness covered like dust all the faces, and with dull amazement the guests stared at each other and did not understand wherefore they had gathered here and sat at the rich table. the talk ceased. they thought it was time to go home, but could not overcome the flaccid lazy weariness which glued their muscles, and they kept on sitting there, yet apart and torn away from each other, like pale fires scattered over a dark field. but the musicians were paid to play and again they took their instruments and again tunes full of studied mirth and studied sorrow began to flow and to rise. they unfolded the customary melody but the guests hearkened in dull amazement. already they knew not wherefore is it necessary, and why is it well, that people should pluck strings, inflate their cheeks, blow in thin pipes, and produce a bizarre, many-voiced noise. "what bad music," said someone. the musicians took offense and left. following them, the guests left one after another, for night was already come. and when placid darkness encircled them and they began to breathe with more ease, suddenly lazarus' image loomed up before each one in formidable radiance: the blue face of a corpse, grave-clothes gorgeous and resplendent, a cold look, in the depths of which lay motionless an unknown horror. as though petrified, they were standing far apart, and darkness enveloped them, but in the darkness blazed brighter and brighter the supernatural vision of him who for three days had been under the enigmatical sway of death. for three days had he been dead: thrice had the sun risen and set, but he had been dead; children had played, streams murmured over pebbles, the wayfarer had lifted up hot dust in the highroad,--but he had been dead. and now he is again among them,--touches them,--looks at them,--looks at them! and through the black discs of his pupils, as through darkened glass, stares the unknowable yonder. iii no one was taking care of lazarus, for no friends no relatives were left to him, and the great desert which encircled the holy city, came near the very threshold of his dwelling. and the desert entered his house, and stretched on his couch, like a wife and extinguished the fires. no one was taking care of lazarus. one after the other, his sisters--mary and martha--forsook him. for a long while martha was loath to abandon him, for she knew not who would feed him and pity him, she wept and prayed. but one night, when the wind was roaming in the desert and with a hissing sound the cypresses were bending over the roof, she dressed noiselessly and secretly left the house. lazarus probably heard the door slam; it banged against the side-post under the gusts of the desert wind, but he did not rise to go out and to look at her that was abandoning him. all the night long the cypresses hissed over his head and plaintively thumped the door, letting in the cold, greedy desert. like a leper he was shunned by everyone, and it was proposed to tie a bell to his neck, as is done with lepers, to warn people against sudden meetings. but someone remarked, growing frightfully pale, that it would be too horrible if by night the moaning of lazarus' bell were suddenly heard under the windows,--and so the project was abandoned. and since he did not take care of himself, he would probably have starved to death, had not the neighbors brought him food in fear of something that they sensed but vaguely. the food was brought to him by children; they were not afraid of lazarus, nor did they mock him with naive cruelty, as children are wont to do with the wretched and miserable. they were indifferent to him, and lazarus answered them with the same coldness; he had no desire to caress the black little curls, and to look into their innocent shining eyes. given to time and to the desert, his house was crumbling down, and long since had his famishing, lowing goats wandered away to the neighboring pastures. and his bridal garments became threadbare. ever since that happy day, when the musicians played, he had worn them unaware of the difference of the new and the worn. the bright colors grew dull and faded; vicious dogs and the sharp thorn of the desert turned the tender fabric into rags. by day, when the merciless sun slew all things alive, and even scorpions sought shelter under stones and writhed there in a mad desire to sting, he sat motionless under the sunrays, his blue face and the uncouth, bushy beard lifted up, bathing in the fiery flood. when people still talked to him, he was once asked: "poor lazarus, does it please thee to sit thus and to stare at the sun?" and he had answered: "yes, it does." so strong, it seemed, was the cold of his three days' grave, so deep the darkness, that there was no heat on earth to warm lazarus, nor a splendor that could brighten the darkness of his eyes. that is what came to the mind of those who spoke to lazarus, and with a sigh they left him. and when the scarlet, flattened globe would lower, lazarus would set out for the desert and walk straight toward the sun, as though striving to reach it. he always walked straight toward the sun and those who tried to follow him and to spy upon what he was doing at night in the desert, retained in their memory the black silhouette of a tall stout man against the red background of an enormous flattened disc. night pursued them with her horrors, and so they did not learn of lazarus' doings in the desert, but the vision of the black on red was forever branded on their brain. just as a beast with a splinter in its eye furiously rubs its muzzle with its paws, so they too foolishly rubbed their eyes, but what lazarus had given was indelible, and death alone could efface it. but there were people who lived far away, who never saw lazarus and knew of him only by report. with daring curiosity, which is stronger than fear and feeds upon it, with hidden mockery, they would come to lazarus who was sitting in the sun and enter into conversation with him. by this time lazarus' appearance had changed for the better and was not so terrible. the first minute they snapped their fingers and thought of how stupid the inhabitants of the holy city were; but when the short talk was over and they started homeward, their looks were such that the inhabitants of the holy city recognized them at once and said: "look, there is one more fool on whom lazarus has set his eye,"--and they shook their heads regretfully, and lifted up their arms. there came brave, intrepid warriors, with tinkling weapons; happy youths came with laughter and song; busy tradesmen, jingling their money, ran in for a moment, and haughty priests leaned their crosiers against lazarus' door, and they were all strangely changed, as they came back. the same terrible shadow swooped down upon their souls and gave a new appearance to the old familiar world. those who still had the desire to speak, expressed their feelings thus: "all things tangible and visible grew hollow, light, and transparent,--similar to lightsome shadows in the darkness of night; "for, that great darkness, which holds the whole cosmos, was dispersed neither by the sun or by the moon and the stars, but like an immense black shroud enveloped the earth and, like a mother, embraced it; "it penetrated all the bodies, iron and stone,--and the particles of the bodies, having lost their ties, grew lonely; and it penetrated into the depth of the particles, and the particles of particles became lonely; "for that great void, which encircles the cosmos, was not filled by things visible: neither by the sun, nor by the moon and the stars, but reigned unrestrained, penetrating everywhere, severing body from body, particle from particle; "in the void hollow trees spread hollow roots threatening a fantastic fall; temples, palaces, and horses loomed up and they were hollow; and in the void men moved about restlessly but they were light and hollow like shadows; "for, time was no more, and the beginning of all things came near their end: the building was still being built, and builders were still hammering away, and its ruins were already seen and the void in its place; the man was still being born, but already funeral candles were burning at his head, and now they were extinguished, and there was the void in place of the man and of the funeral candles. "and wrapped by void and darkness the man in despair trembled in the face of the horror of the infinite." thus spake the men who had still a desire to speak. but, surely, much more could have told those who wished not to speak, and died in silence. iv at that time there lived in rome a renowned sculptor. in clay, marble, and bronze he wrought bodies of gods and men, and such was their beauty, that people called them immortal. but he himself was discontented and asserted that there was something even more beautiful, that he could not embody either in marble or in bronze. "i have not yet gathered the glimmers of the moon, nor have i my fill of sunshine," he was wont to say, "and there is no soul in my marble, no life in my beautiful bronze." and when on moonlit nights he slowly walked along the road, crossing the black shadows of cypresses, his white tunic glittering in the moonshine, those who met him would laugh in a friendly way and say: "art thou going to gather moonshine, aurelius? why then didst thou not fetch baskets?" and he would answer, laughing and pointing to his eyes: "here are the baskets wherein i gather the sheen of the moon and the glimmer of the sun." and so it was: the moon glimmered in his eyes and the sun sparkled therein. but he could not translate them into marble and therein lay the serene tragedy of his life. he was descended from an ancient patrician race, had a good wife and children, and suffered from no want. when the obscure rumor about lazarus reached him, he consulted his wife and friends and undertook the far journey to judea to see him who had miraculously risen from the dead. he was somewhat weary in those days and he hoped that the road would sharpen his blunted senses. what was said of lazarus did not frighten him: he had pondered much over death, did not like it, but he disliked also those who confused it with life. "in this life,--life and beauty; beyond,--death, the enigmatical"-- thought he, and there is no better thing for a man to do than to delight in life and in the beauty of all things living. he had even a vainglorious desire to convince lazarus of the truth of his own view and restore his soul to life, as his body had been restored. this seemed so much easier because the rumors, shy and strange, did not render the whole truth about lazarus and but vaguely warned against something frightful. lazarus had just risen from the stone in order to follow the sun which was setting in the desert, when a rich roman attended by an armed slave, approached him and addressed him in a sonorous tone of voice: "lazarus!" and lazarus beheld a superb face, lit with glory, and arrayed in fine clothes, and precious stones sparkling in the sun. the red light lent to the roman's face and head the appearance of gleaming bronze--that also lazarus noticed. he resumed obediently his place and lowered his weary eyes. "yes, thou art ugly, my poor lazarus,"--quietly said the roman, playing with his golden chain; "thou art even horrible, my poor friend; and death was not lazy that day when thou didst fall so heedlessly into his hands. but thou art stout, and, as the great cæsar used to say, fat people are not ill-tempered; to tell the truth, i don't understand why men fear thee. permit me to spend the night in thy house; the hour is late, and i have no shelter." never had anyone asked lazarus' hospitality. "i have no bed," said he. "i am somewhat of a soldier and i can sleep sitting," the roman answered. "we shall build a fire." "i have no fire." "then we shall have our talk in the darkness, like two friends. i think thou wilt find a bottle of wine." "i have no wine." the roman laughed. "now i see why thou art so somber and dislikest thy second life. no wine! why, then we shall do without it: there are words that make the head go round better than the falernian." by a sign he dismissed the slave, and they remained all alone. and again the sculptor started speaking, but it was as if, together with the setting sun, life had left his words; and they grew pale and hollow, as if they staggered on unsteady feet, as if they slipped and fell down, drunk with the heavy lees of weariness and despair. and black chasms grew up between the words--like far-off hints of the great void and the great darkness. "now i am thy guest, and thou wilt not be unkind to me, lazarus!"--said he. "hospitality is the duty even of those who for three days were dead. three days, i was told, thou didst rest in the grave. there it must be cold ... and that is whence comes thy ill habit of going without fire and wine. as to me, i like fire; it grows dark here so rapidly.... the lines of thy eyebrows and forehead are quite, quite interesting: they are like ruins of strange palaces, buried in ashes after an earthquake. but why dost thou wear such ugly and queer garments? i have seen bridegrooms in thy country, and they wear such clothes--are they not funny--and terrible.... but art thou a bridegroom?" the sun had already disappeared, a monstrous black shadow came running from the east--it was as if gigantic bare feet began rumbling on the sand, and the wind sent a cold wave along the backbone. "in the darkness thou seemest still larger, lazarus, as if thou hast grown stouter in these moments. dost thou feed on darkness, lazarus? i would fain have a little fire--at least a little fire, a little fire. i feel somewhat chilly, your nights are so barbarously cold.... were it not so dark, i should say that thou wert looking at me, lazarus. yes, it seems to me, thou art looking.... why, thou art looking at me, i feel it,--but there thou art smiling." night came, and filled the air with heavy blackness. "how well it will be, when the sun will rise to-morrow anew.... i am a great sculptor, thou knowest; that is how my friends call me. i create. yes, that is the word ... but i need daylight. i give life to the cold marble, i melt sonorous bronze in fire, in bright hot fire.... why didst thou touch me with thy hand?" "come"--said lazarus--"thou art my guest." and they went to the house. and a long night enveloped the earth. the slave, seeing that his master did not come, went to seek him, when the sun was already high in the sky. and he beheld his master side by side with lazarus: in profound silence were they sitting right under the dazzling and scorching sunrays and looking upward. the slave began to weep and cried out: "my master, what has befallen thee, master?" the very same day the sculptor left for rome. on the way aurelius was pensive and taciturn, staring attentively at everything--the men, the ship, the sea, as though trying to retain something. on the high sea a storm burst upon them, and all through it aurelius stayed on the deck and eagerly scanned the seas looming near and sinking with a thud. at home his friends were frightened at the change which had taken place in aurelius, but he calmed them, saying meaningly: "i have found it." and without changing the dusty clothes he wore on his journey, he fell to work, and the marble obediently resounded under his sonorous hammer. long and eagerly worked he, admitting no one, until one morning he announced that the work was ready and ordered his friends to be summoned, severe critics and connoisseurs of art. and to meet them he put on bright and gorgeous garments, that glittered with yellow gold--and--scarlet byssus. "here is my work," said he thoughtfully. his friends glanced and a shadow of profound sorrow covered their faces. it was something monstrous, deprived of all the lines and shapes familiar to the eye, but not without a hint at some new, strange image. on a thin, crooked twig, or rather on an ugly likeness of a twig rested askew a blind, ugly, shapeless, outspread mass of something utterly and inconceivably distorted, a mad leap of wild and bizarre fragments, all feebly and vainly striving to part from one another. and, as if by chance, beneath one of the wildly-rent salients a butterfly was chiseled with divine skill, all airy loveliness, delicacy, and beauty, with transparent wings, which seemed to tremble with an impotent desire to take flight. "wherefore this wonderful butterfly, aurelius?" said somebody falteringly. "i know not"--was the sculptor's answer. but it was necessary to tell the truth, and one of his friends who loved him best said firmly: "this is ugly, my poor friend. it must be destroyed. give me the hammer." and with two strokes he broke the monstrous man into pieces, leaving only the infinitely delicate butterfly untouched. from that time on aurelius created nothing. with profound indifference he looked at marble and bronze, and on his former divine works, where everlasting beauty rested. with the purpose of arousing his former fervent passion for work and, awakening his deadened soul, his friends took him to see other artists' beautiful works,--but he remained indifferent as before, and the smile did not warm up his tightened lips. and only after listening to lengthy talks about beauty, he would retort wearily and indolently: "but all this is a lie." and by the day, when the sun was shining, he went into his magnificent, skilfully built garden and having found a place without shadow, he exposed his bare head to the glare and heat. red and white butterflies fluttered around; from the crooked lips of a drunken satyr, water streamed down with a splash into a marble cistern, but he sat motionless and silent,--like a pallid reflection of him who, in the far-off distance, at the very gates of the stony desert, sat under the fiery sun. v and now it came to pass that the great, deified augustus himself summoned lazarus. the imperial messengers dressed him gorgeously, in solemn nuptial clothes, as if time had legalized them, and he was to remain until his very death the bridegroom of an unknown bride. it was as though an old, rotting coffin had been gilt and furnished with new, gay tassels. and men, all in trim and bright attire, rode after him, as if in bridal procession indeed, and those foremost trumpeted loudly, bidding people to clear the way for the emperor's messengers. but lazarus' way was deserted: his native land cursed the hateful name of him who had miraculously risen from the dead, and people scattered at the very news of his appalling approach. the solitary voice of the brass trumpets sounded in the motionless air, and the wilderness alone responded with its languid echo. then lazarus went by sea. and his was the most magnificently arrayed and the most mournful ship that ever mirrored itself in the azure waves of the mediterranean sea. many were the travelers aboard, but like a tomb was the ship, all silence and stillness, and the despairing water sobbed at the steep, proudly curved prow. all alone sat lazarus exposing his head to the blaze of the sun, silently listening to the murmur and splash of the wavelets, and afar seamen and messengers were sitting, a vague group of weary shadows. had the thunder burst and the wind attacked the red sails, the ships would probably have perished, for none of those aboard had either the will or the strength to struggle for life. with a supreme effort some mariners would reach the board and eagerly scan the blue, transparent deep, hoping to see a naiad's pink shoulder flash in the hollow of an azure wave, or a drunken gay centaur dash along and in frenzy splash the wave with his hoof. but the sea was like a wilderness, and the deep was dumb and deserted. with utter indifference did lazarus set his feet on the street of the eternal city. as though all her wealth, all the magnificence of her palaces built by giants, all the resplendence, beauty, and music of her refined life were but the echo of the wind in the wilderness, the reflection of the desert quicksand. chariots were dashing, and along the streets were moving crowds of strong, fair, proud builders of the eternal city and haughty participants in her life; a song sounded; fountains and women laughed a pearly laughter; drunken philosophers harangued, and the sober listened to them with a smile; hoofs struck the stone pavements. and surrounded by cheerful noise, a stout, heavy man was moving, a cold spot of silence and despair, and on his way he sowed disgust, anger, and vague, gnawing weariness. who dares to be sad in rome, wondered indignantly the citizens, and frowned. in two days the entire city already knew all about him who had miraculously risen from the dead, and shunned him shyly. but some daring people there were, who wanted to test their strength, and lazarus obeyed their imprudent summons. kept busy by state affairs, the emperor constantly delayed the reception, and seven days did he who had risen from the dead go about visiting others. and lazarus came to a cheerful epicurean, and the host met him with laughter on his lips: "drink, lazarus, drink!"--shouted he. "would not augustus laugh to see thee drunk!" and half-naked drunken women laughed, and rose petals fell on lazarus' blue hands. but then the epicurean looked into lazarus' eyes, and his gaiety ended forever. drunkard remained he for the rest of his life; never did he drink, yet forever was he drunk. but instead of the gay reverie which wine brings with it, frightful dreams began to haunt him, the sole food of his stricken spirit. day and night he lived in the poisonous vapors of his nightmares, and death itself was not more frightful than her raving, monstrous forerunners. and lazarus came to a youth and his beloved, who loved each other and were most beautiful in their passions. proudly and strongly embracing his love, the youth said with serene regret: "look at us, lazarus, and share our joy. is there anything stronger than love?" and lazarus looked. and for the rest of their life they kept on loving each other, but their passion grew gloomy and joyless, like those funeral cypresses whose roots feed on the decay of the graves and whose black summits in a still evening hour seek in vain to reach the sky. thrown by the unknown forces of life into each other's embraces, they mingled tears with kisses, voluptuous pleasures with pain, and they felt themselves doubly slaves, obedient slaves to life, and patient servants of the silent nothingness. ever united, ever severed, they blazed like sparks and like sparks lost themselves in the boundless dark. and lazarus came to a haughty sage, and the sage said to him: "i know all the horrors thou canst reveal to me. is there anything thou canst frighten me with?" but before long the sage felt that the knowledge of horror was far from being the horror itself, and that the vision of death, was not death. and he felt that wisdom and folly are equal before the face of infinity, for infinity knows them not. and it vanished, the dividing-line between knowledge and ignorance, truth and falsehood, top and bottom, and the shapeless thought hung suspended in the void. then the sage clutched his gray head and cried out frantically: "i cannot think! i cannot think!" thus under the indifferent glance for him, who miraculously had risen from the dead, perished everything that asserts life, its significance and joys. and it was suggested that it was dangerous to let him see the emperor, that it was better to kill him and, having buried him secretly, to tell the emperor that he had disappeared no one knew whither. already swords were being whetted and youths devoted to the public welfare prepared for the murder, when augustus ordered lazarus to be brought before him next morning, thus destroying the cruel plans. if there was no way of getting rid of lazarus, at least it was possible to soften the terrible impression his face produced. with this in view, skillful painters, barbers, and artists were summoned, and all night long they were busy over lazarus' head. they cropped his beard, curled it, and gave it a tidy, agreeable appearance. by means of paints they concealed the corpse-like blueness of his hands and face. repulsive were the wrinkles of suffering that furrowed his old face, and they were puttied, painted, and smoothed; then, over the smooth background, wrinkles of good-tempered laughter and pleasant, carefree mirth were skillfully painted with fine brushes. lazarus submitted indifferently to everything that was done to him. soon he was turned into a becomingly stout, venerable old man, into a quiet and kind grandfather of numerous offspring. it seemed that the smile, with which only a while ago he was spinning funny yarns, was still lingering on his lips, and that in the corner of his eye serene tenderness was hiding, the companion of old age. but people did not dare change his nuptial garments, and they could not change his eyes, two dark and frightful glasses through which looked at men, the unknowable yonder. vi lazarus was not moved by the magnificence of the imperial palace. it was as though he saw no difference between the crumbling house, closely pressed by the desert, and the stone palace, solid and fair, and indifferently he passed into it. and the hard marble of the floors under his feet grew similar to the quicksand of the desert, and the multitude of richly dressed and haughty men became like void air under his glance. no one looked into his face, as lazarus passed by, fearing to fall under the appalling influence of his eyes; but when the sound of his heavy footsteps had sufficiently died down, the courtiers raised their heads and with fearful curiosity examined the figure of a stout, tall, slightly bent old man, who was slowly penetrating into the very heart of the imperial palace. were death itself passing, it would be faced with no greater fear: for until then the dead alone knew death, and those alive knew life only--and there was no bridge between them. but this extraordinary man, although alive, knew death, and enigmatical, appalling, was his cursed knowledge. "woe," people thought, "he will take the life of our great, deified augustus," and they sent curses after lazarus, who meanwhile kept on advancing into the interior of the palace. already did the emperor know who lazarus was, and prepared to meet him. but the monarch was a brave man, and felt his own tremendous, unconquerable power, and in his fatal duel with him who had miraculously risen from the dead he wanted not to invoke human help. and so he met lazarus face to face: "lift not thine eyes upon me, lazarus," he ordered. "i heard thy face is like that of medusa and turns into stone whomsoever thou lookest at. now, i wish to see thee and to have a talk with thee, before i turn into stone,"--added he in a tone of kingly jesting, not devoid of fear. coming close to him, he carefully examined lazarus' face and his strange festal garments. and although he had a keen eye, he was deceived by his appearance. "so. thou dost not appear terrible, my venerable old man. but the worse for us, if horror assumes such a respectable and pleasant air. now let us have a talk." augustus sat, and questioning lazarus with his eye as much as with words, started the conversation: "why didst thou not greet me as thou enteredst?" lazarus answered indifferent: "i knew not it was necessary." "art thou a christian?" "no." augustus approvingly shook his head. "that is good. i do not like christians. they shake the tree of life before it is covered with fruit, and disperse its odorous bloom to the winds. but who art thou?" with a visible effort lazarus answered: "i was dead." "i had heard that. but who art thou now?" lazarus was silent, but at last repeated in a tone of weary apathy: "i was dead." "listen to me, stranger," said the emperor, distinctly and severely giving utterance to the thought that had come to him at the beginning, "my realm is the realm of life, my people are of the living, not of the dead. thou art here one too many. i know not who thou art and what thou sawest there; but, if thou liest, i hate thy lies, and if thou tellst the truth, i hate thy truth. in my bosom i feel the throb of life; i feel strength in my arm, and my proud thoughts, like eagles, pierce the space. and yonder in the shelter of my rule, under the protection of laws created by me, people live and toil and rejoice. dost thou hear the battle-cry, the challenge men throw into the face of the future?" augustus, as in prayer, stretched forth his arms and exclaimed solemnly: "be blessed, o great and divine life!" lazarus was silent, and with growing sternness the emperor went on: "thou art not wanted here, miserable remnant, snatched from under death's teeth, thou inspirest weariness and disgust with life; like a caterpillar in the fields, thou gloatest on the rich ear of joy and belchest out the drivel of despair and sorrow. thy truth is like a rusty sword in the hands of a nightly murderer,--and as a murderer thou shalt be executed. but before that, let me look into thine eyes. perchance, only cowards are afraid of them, but in the brave they awake the thirst for strife and victory; then thou shalt be rewarded, not executed.... now, look at me, lazarus." at first it appeared to the deified augustus that a friend was looking at him,--so soft, so tenderly fascinating was lazarus' glance. it promised not horror, but sweet rest and the infinite seemed to him a tender mistress, a compassionate sister, a mother. but stronger and stronger grew its embraces, and already the mouth, greedy of hissing kisses, interfered with the monarch's breathing, and already to the surface of the soft tissues of the body came the iron of the bones and tightened its merciless circle,--and unknown fangs, blunt and cold, touched his heart and sank into it with slow indolence. "it pains," said the deified augustus, growing pale. "but look at me, lazarus, look." it was as though some heavy gates, ever closed, were slowly moving apart, and through the growing interstice the appalling horror of the infinite poured in slowly and steadily. like two shadows there entered the shoreless void and the unfathomable darkness; they extinguished the sun, ravished the earth from under the feet, and the roof from over the head. no more did the frozen heart ache. "look, look, lazarus," ordered augustus tottering. time stood still, and the beginning of each thing grew frightfully near to its end. augustus' throne just erected, crumbled down, and the void was already in the place of the throne and of augustus. noiselessly did rome crumble down, and a new city stood on its site and it too was swallowed by the void. like fantastic giants, cities, states, and countries fell down and vanished in the void darkness--and with uttermost indifference did the insatiable black womb of the infinite swallow them. "halt!"--ordered the emperor. in his voice sounded already a note of indifference, his hands dropped in languor, and in the vain struggle with the onrushing darkness his fiery eyes now blazed up, and now went out. "my life thou hast taken from me, lazarus,"--said he in a spiritless, feeble voice. and these words of hopelessness saved him. he remembered his people, whose shield he was destined to be, and keen salutary pain pierced his deadened heart. "they are doomed to death," he thought wearily. "serene shadows in the darkness of the infinite," thought he, and horror grew upon him. "frail vessels with living seething blood with a heart that knows sorrow and also great joy," said he in his heart, and tenderness pervaded it. thus pondering and oscillating between the poles of life and death, he slowly came back to life, to find in its suffering and in its joys a shield against the darkness of the void and the horror of the infinite. "no, thou hast not murdered me, lazarus," said he firmly, "but i will take thy life. be gone." that evening the deified augustus partook of his meats and drinks with particular joy. now and then his lifted hand remained suspended in the air, and a dull glimmer replaced the bright sheen of his fiery eye. it was the cold wave of horror that surged at his feet. defeated, but not undone, ever awaiting its hour, that horror stood at the emperor's bedside, like a black shadow all through his life; it swayed his nights, but yielded the days to the sorrows and joys of life. the following day, the hangman with a hot iron burned out lazarus' eyes. then he was sent home. the deified augustus dared not kill him. * * * * * lazarus returned to the desert, and the wilderness met him with hissing gusts of wind and the heat of the blazing sun. again he was sitting on a stone, his rough, bushy beard lifted up; and the two black holes in place of his eyes looked at the sky with an expression of dull terror. afar-off the holy city stirred noisily and restlessly, but around him everything was deserted and dumb. no one approached the place where lived he who had miraculously risen from the dead, and long since his neighbors had forsaken their houses. driven by the hot iron into the depth of his skull, his cursed knowledge hid there in an ambush. as though leaping out from an ambush it plunged its thousand invisible eyes into the man,--and no one dared look at lazarus. and in the evening, when the sun, reddening and growing wider, would come nearer and nearer the western horizon, the blind lazarus would slowly follow it. he would stumble against stones and fall, stout and weak as he was; would rise heavily to his feet and walk on again; and on the red screen of the sunset his black body and outspread hands would form a monstrous likeness of a cross. and it came to pass that once he went out and did not come back. thus seemingly ended the second life of him who for three days had been under the enigmatical sway of death, and rose miraculously from the dead. the beast with five fingers by w.f. harvey from _the new decameron_, by various hands. copyright, <UNK> by robert m. mcbride and company. by permission of the publishers. when i was a little boy i once went with my father to call on adrian borlsover. i played on the floor with a black spaniel while my father appealed for a subscription. just before we left my father said, "mr. borlsover, may my son here shake hands with you? it will be a thing to look back upon with pride when he grows to be a man." i came up to the bed on which the old man was lying and put my hand in his, awed by the still beauty of his face. he spoke to me kindly, and hoped that i should always try to please my father. then he placed his right hand on my head and asked for a blessing to rest upon me. "amen!" said my father, and i followed him out of the room, feeling as if i wanted to cry. but my father was in excellent spirits. "that old gentleman, jim," said he, "is the most wonderful man in the whole town. for ten years he has been quite blind." "but i saw his eyes," i said. "they were ever so black and shiny; they weren't shut up like nora's puppies. can't he see at all?" and so i learnt for the first time that a man might have eyes that looked dark and beautiful and shining without being able to see. "just like mrs. tomlinson has big ears," i said, "and can't hear at all except when mr. tomlinson shouts." "jim," said my father, "it's not right to talk about a lady's ears. remember what mr. borlsover said about pleasing me and being a good boy." that was the only time i saw adrian borlsover. i soon forgot about him and the hand which he laid in blessing on my head. but for a week i prayed that those dark tender eyes might see. "his spaniel may have puppies," i said in my prayers, "and he will never be able to know how funny they look with their eyes all closed up. please let old mr. borlsover see." * * * * * adrian borlsover, as my father had said, was a wonderful man. he came of an eccentric family. borlsovers' sons, for some reason, always seemed to marry very ordinary women, which perhaps accounted for the fact that no borlsover had been a genius, and only one borlsover had been mad. but they were great champions of little causes, generous patrons of odd sciences, founders of querulous sects, trustworthy guides to the bypath meadows of erudition. adrian was an authority on the fertilization of orchids. he had held at one time the family living at borlsover conyers, until a congenital weakness of the lungs obliged him to seek a less rigorous climate in the sunny south coast watering-place where i had seen him. occasionally he would relieve one or other of the local clergy. my father described him as a fine preacher, who gave long and inspiring sermons from what many men would have considered unprofitable texts. "an excellent proof," he would add, "of the truth of the doctrine of direct verbal inspiration." adrian borlsover was exceedingly clever with his hands. his penmanship was exquisite. he illustrated all his scientific papers, made his own woodcuts, and carved the reredos that is at present the chief feature of interest in the church at borlsover conyers. he had an exceedingly clever knack in cutting silhouettes for young ladies and paper pigs and cows for little children, and made more than one complicated wind instrument of his own devising. when he was fifty years old adrian borlsover lost his sight. in a wonderfully short time he had adapted himself to the new conditions of life. he quickly learned to read braille. so marvelous indeed was his sense of touch that he was still able to maintain his interest in botany. the mere passing of his long supple fingers over a flower was sufficient means for its identification, though occasionally he would use his lips. i have found several letters of his among my father's correspondence. in no case was there anything to show that he was afflicted with blindness and this in spite of the fact that he exercised undue economy in the spacing of lines. towards the close of his life the old man was credited with powers of touch that seemed almost uncanny: it has been said that he could tell at once the color of a ribbon placed between his fingers. my father would neither confirm nor deny the story. i adrian borlsover was a bachelor. his elder brother george had married late in life, leaving one son, eustace, who lived in the gloomy georgian mansion at borlsover conyers, where he could work undisturbed in collecting material for his great book on heredity. like his uncle, he was a remarkable man. the borlsovers had always been born naturalists, but eustace possessed in a special degree the power of systematizing his knowledge. he had received his university education in germany, and then, after post-graduate work in vienna and naples, had traveled for four years in south america and the east, getting together a huge store of material for a new study into the processes of variation. he lived alone at borlsover conyers with saunders his secretary, a man who bore a somewhat dubious reputation in the district, but whose powers as a mathematician, combined with his business abilities, were invaluable to eustace. uncle and nephew saw little of each other. the visits of eustace were confined to a week in the summer or autumn: long weeks, that dragged almost as slowly as the bath-chair in which the old man was drawn along the sunny sea front. in their way the two men were fond of each other, though their intimacy would doubtless have been greater had they shared the same religious views. adrian held to the old-fashioned evangelical dogmas of his early manhood; his nephew for many years had been thinking of embracing buddhism. both men possessed, too, the reticence the borlsovers had always shown, and which their enemies sometimes called hypocrisy. with adrian it was a reticence as to the things he had left undone; but with eustace it seemed that the curtain which he was so careful to leave undrawn hid something more than a half-empty chamber. * * * * * two years before his death adrian borlsover developed, unknown to himself, the not uncommon power of automatic writing. eustace made the discovery by accident. adrian was sitting reading in bed, the forefinger of his left hand tracing the braille characters, when his nephew noticed that a pencil the old man held in his right hand was moving slowly along the opposite page. he left his seat in the window and sat down beside the bed. the right hand continued to move, and now he could see plainly that they were letters and words which it was forming. "adrian borlsover," wrote the hand, "eustace borlsover, george borlsover, francis borlsover sigismund borlsover, adrian borlsover, eustace borlsover, saville borlsover. b, for borlsover. honesty is the best policy. beautiful belinda borlsover." "what curious nonsense!" said eustace to himself. "king george the third ascended the throne in <UNK> wrote the hand. "crowd, a noun of multitude; a collection of individuals--adrian borlsover, eustace borlsover." "it seems to me," said his uncle, closing the book, "that you had much better make the most of the afternoon sunshine and take your walk now." "i think perhaps i will," eustace answered as he picked up the volume. "i won't go far, and when i come back i can read to you those articles in _nature_ about which we were speaking." he went along the promenade, but stopped at the first shelter, and seating himself in the corner best protected from the wind, he examined the book at leisure. nearly every page was scored with a meaningless jungle of pencil marks: rows of capital letters, short words, long words, complete sentences, copy-book tags. the whole thing, in fact, had the appearance of a copy-book, and on a more careful scrutiny eustace thought that there was ample evidence to show that the handwriting at the beginning of the book, good though it was was not nearly so good as the handwriting at the end. he left his uncle at the end of october, with a promise to return early in december. it seemed to him quite clear that the old man's power of automatic writing was developing rapidly, and for the first time he looked forward to a visit that combined duty with interest. but on his return he was at first disappointed. his uncle, he thought, looked older. he was listless too, preferring others to read to him and dictating nearly all his letters. not until the day before he left had eustace an opportunity of observing adrian borlsover's new-found faculty. the old man, propped up in bed with pillows, had sunk into a light sleep. his two hands lay on the coverlet, his left hand tightly clasping his right. eustace took an empty manuscript book and placed a pencil within reach of the fingers of the right hand. they snatched at it eagerly; then dropped the pencil to unloose the left hand from its restraining grasp. "perhaps to prevent interference i had better hold that hand," said eustace to himself, as he watched the pencil. almost immediately it began to write. "blundering borlsovers, unnecessarily unnatural, extraordinarily eccentric, culpably curious." "who are you?" asked eustace, in a low voice. "never you mind," wrote the hand of adrian. "is it my uncle who is writing?" "oh, my prophetic soul, mine uncle." "is it anyone i know?" "silly eustace, you'll see me very soon." "when shall i see you?" "when poor old adrian's dead." "where shall i see you?" "where shall you not?" instead of speaking his next question, borlsover wrote it. "what is the time?" the fingers dropped the pencil and moved three or four times across the paper. then, picking up the pencil, they wrote: "ten minutes before four. put your book away, eustace. adrian mustn't find us working at this sort of thing. he doesn't know what to make of it, and i won't have poor old adrian disturbed. _au revoir_." adrian borlsover awoke with a start. "i've been dreaming again," he said; "such queer dreams of leaguered cities and forgotten towns. you were mixed up in this one, eustace, though i can't remember how. eustace, i want to warn you. don't walk in doubtful paths. choose your friends well. your poor grandfather----" a fit of coughing put an end to what he was saying, but eustace saw that the hand was still writing. he managed unnoticed to draw the book away. "i'll light the gas," he said, "and ring for tea." on the other side of the bed curtain he saw the last sentences that had been written. "it's too late, adrian," he read. "we're friends already; aren't we, eustace borlsover?" on the following day eustace borlsover left. he thought his uncle looked ill when he said good-by, and the old man spoke despondently of the failure his life had been. "nonsense, uncle!" said his nephew. "you have got over your difficulties in a way not one in a hundred thousand would have done. every one marvels at your splendid perseverance in teaching your hand to take the place of your lost sight. to me it's been a revelation of the possibilities of education." "education," said his uncle dreamily, as if the word had started a new train of thought, "education is good so long as you know to whom and for what purpose you give it. but with the lower orders of men, the base and more sordid spirits, i have grave doubts as to its results. well, good-by, eustace, i may not see you again. you are a true borlsover, with all the borlsover faults. marry, eustace. marry some good, sensible girl. and if by any chance i don't see you again, my will is at my solicitor's. i've not left you any legacy, because i know you're well provided for, but i thought you might like to have my books. oh, and there's just one other thing. you know, before the end people often lose control over themselves and make absurd requests. don't pay any attention to them, eustace. good-by!" and he held out his hand. eustace took it. it remained in his a fraction of a second longer than he had expected, and gripped him with a virility that was surprising. there was, too, in its touch a subtle sense of intimacy. "why, uncle!" he said, "i shall see you alive and well for many long years to come." two months later adrian borlsover died. ii eustace borlsover was in naples at the time. he read the obituary notice in the _morning post_ on the day announced for the funeral. "poor old fellow!" he said. "i wonder where i shall find room for all his books." the question occurred to him again with greater force when three days later he found himself standing in the library at borlsover conyers, a huge room built for use, and not for beauty, in the year of waterloo by a borlsover who was an ardent admirer of the great napoleon. it was arranged on the plan of many college libraries, with tall, projecting bookcases forming deep recesses of dusty silence, fit graves for the old hates of forgotten controversy, the dead passions of forgotten lives. at the end of the room, behind the bust of some unknown eighteenth-century divine, an ugly iron corkscrew stair led to a shelf-lined gallery. nearly every shelf was full. "i must talk to saunders about it," said eustace. "i suppose that it will be necessary to have the billiard-room fitted up with book cases." the two men met for the first time after many weeks in the dining-room that evening. "hullo!" said eustace, standing before the fire with his hands in his pockets. "how goes the world, saunders? why these dress togs?" he himself was wearing an old shooting-jacket. he did not believe in mourning, as he had told his uncle on his last visit; and though he usually went in for quiet-colored ties, he wore this evening one of an ugly red, in order to shock morton the butler, and to make them thrash out the whole question of mourning for themselves in the servants' hall. eustace was a true borlsover. "the world," said saunders, "goes the same as usual, confoundedly slow. the dress togs are accounted for by an invitation from captain lockwood to bridge." "how are you getting there?" "i've told your coachman to drive me in your carriage. any objection?" "oh, dear me, no! we've had all things in common for far too many years for me to raise objections at this hour of the day." "you'll find your correspondence in the library," went on saunders. "most of it i've seen to. there are a few private letters i haven't opened. there's also a box with a rat, or something, inside it that came by the evening post. very likely it's the six-toed albino. i didn't look, because i didn't want to mess up my things but i should gather from the way it's jumping about that it's pretty hungry." "oh, i'll see to it," said eustace, "while you and the captain earn an honest penny." dinner over and saunders gone, eustace went into the library. though the fire had been lit the room was by no means cheerful. "we'll have all the lights on at any rate," he said, as he turned the switches. "and, morton," he added, when the butler brought the coffee, "get me a screwdriver or something to undo this box. whatever the animal is, he's kicking up the deuce of a row. what is it? why are you dawdling?" "if you please, sir, when the postman brought it he told me that they'd bored the holes in the lid at the post-office. there were no breathin' holes in the lid, sir, and they didn't want the animal to die. that is all, sir." "it's culpably careless of the man, whoever he was," said eustace, as he removed the screws, "packing an animal like this in a wooden box with no means of getting air. confound it all! i meant to ask morton to bring me a cage to put it in. now i suppose i shall have to get one myself." he placed a heavy book on the lid from which the screws had been removed, and went into the billiard-room. as he came back into the library with an empty cage in his hand he heard the sound of something falling, and then of something scuttling along the floor. "bother it! the beast's got out. how in the world am i to find it again in this library!" to search for it did indeed seem hopeless. he tried to follow the sound of the scuttling in one of the recesses where the animal seemed to be running behind the books in the shelves, but it was impossible to locate it. eustace resolved to go on quietly reading. very likely the animal might gain confidence and show itself. saunders seemed to have dealt in his usual methodical manner with most of the correspondence. there were still the private letters. what was that? two sharp clicks and the lights in the hideous candelabra that hung from the ceiling suddenly went out. "i wonder if something has gone wrong with the fuse," said eustace, as he went to the switches by the door. then he stopped. there was a noise at the other end of the room, as if something was crawling up the iron corkscrew stair. "if it's gone into the gallery," he said, "well and good." he hastily turned on the lights, crossed the room, and climbed up the stair. but he could see nothing. his grandfather had placed a little gate at the top of the stair, so that children could run and romp in the gallery without fear of accident. this eustace closed, and having considerably narrowed the circle of his search, returned to his desk by the fire. how gloomy the library was! there was no sense of intimacy about the room. the few busts that an eighteenth-century borlsover had brought back from the grand tour, might have been in keeping in the old library. here they seemed out of place. they made the room feel cold, in spite of the heavy red damask curtains and great gilt cornices. with a crash two heavy books fell from the gallery to the floor; then, as borlsover looked, another and yet another. "very well; you'll starve for this, my beauty!" he said. "we'll do some little experiments on the metabolism of rats deprived of water. go on! chuck them down! i think i've got the upper hand." he turned once again to his correspondence. the letter was from the family solicitor. it spoke of his uncle's death and of the valuable collection of books that had been left to him in the will. "there was one request," he read, "which certainly came as a surprise to me. as you know, mr. adrian borlsover had left instructions that his body was to be buried in as simple a manner as possible at eastbourne. he expressed a desire that there should be neither wreaths nor flowers of any kind, and hoped that his friends and relatives would not consider it necessary to wear mourning. the day before his death we received a letter canceling these instructions. he wished his body to be embalmed (he gave us the address of the man we were to employ--pennifer, ludgate hill), with orders that his right hand was to be sent to you, stating that it was at your special request. the other arrangements as to the funeral remained unaltered." "good lord!" said eustace; "what in the world was the old boy driving at? and what in the name of all that's holy is that?" someone was in the gallery. someone had pulled the cord attached to one of the blinds, and it had rolled up with a snap. someone must be in the gallery, for a second blind did the same. someone must be walking round the gallery, for one after the other the blinds sprang up, letting in the moonlight. "i haven't got to the bottom of this yet," said eustace, "but i will do before the night is very much older," and he hurried up the corkscrew stair. he had just got to the top when the lights went out a second time, and he heard again the scuttling along the floor. quickly he stole on tiptoe in the dim moonshine in the direction of the noise, feeling as he went for one of the switches. his fingers touched the metal knob at last. he turned on the electric light. about ten yards in front of him, crawling along the floor, was a man's hand. eustace stared at it in utter astonishment. it was moving quickly, in the manner of a geometer caterpillar, the fingers humped up one moment, flattened out the next; the thumb appeared to give a crab-like motion to the whole. while he was looking, too surprised to stir, the hand disappeared round the corner. eustace ran forward. he no longer saw it, but he could hear it as it squeezed its way behind the books on one of the shelves. a heavy volume had been displaced. there was a gap in the row of books where it had got in. in his fear lest it should escape him again, he seized the first book that came to his hand and plugged it into the hole. then, emptying two shelves of their contents, he took the wooden boards and propped them up in front to make his barrier doubly sure. "i wish saunders was back," he said; "one can't tackle this sort of thing alone." it was after eleven, and there seemed little likelihood of saunders returning before twelve. he did not dare to leave the shelf unwatched, even to run downstairs to ring the bell. morton the butler often used to come round about eleven to see that the windows were fastened, but he might not come. eustace was thoroughly unstrung. at last he heard steps down below. "morton!" he shouted; "morton!" "sir?" "has mr. saunders got back yet?" "not yet, sir." "well, bring me some brandy, and hurry up about it. i'm up here in the gallery, you duffer." "thanks," said eustace, as he emptied the glass. "don't go to bed yet, morton. there are a lot of books that have fallen down by accident; bring them up and put them back in their shelves." morton had never seen borlsover in so talkative a mood as on that night. "here," said eustace, when the books had been put back and dusted, "you might hold up these boards for me, morton. that beast in the box got out, and i've been chasing it all over the place." "i think i can hear it chawing at the books, sir. they're not valuable, i hope? i think that's the carriage, sir; i'll go and call mr. saunders." it seemed to eustace that he was away for five minutes, but it could hardly have been more than one when he returned with saunders. "all right, morton, you can go now. i'm up here, saunders." "what's all the row?" asked saunders, as he lounged forward with his hands in his pockets. the luck had been with him all the evening. he was completely satisfied, both with himself and with captain lockwood's taste in wines. "what's the matter? you look to me to be in an absolute blue funk." "that old devil of an uncle of mine," began eustace--"oh, i can't explain it all. it's his hand that's been playing old harry all the evening. but i've got it cornered behind these books. you've got to help me catch it." "what's up with you, eustace? what's the game?" "it's no game, you silly idiot! if you don't believe me take out one of those books and put your hand in and feel." "all right," said saunders; "but wait till i've rolled up my sleeve. the accumulated dust of centuries, eh?" he took off his coat, knelt down, and thrust his arm along the shelf. "there's something there right enough," he said. "it's got a funny stumpy end to it, whatever it is, and nips like a crab. ah, no, you don't!" he pulled his hand out in a flash. "shove in a book quickly. now it can't get out." "what was it?" asked eustace. "it was something that wanted very much to get hold of me. i felt what seemed like a thumb and forefinger. give me some brandy." "how are we to get it out of there?" "what about a landing net?" "no good. it would be too smart for us. i tell you, saunders, it can cover the ground far faster than i can walk. but i think i see how we can manage it. the two books at the end of the shelf are big ones that go right back against the wall. the others are very thin. i'll take out one at a time, and you slide the rest along until we have it squashed between the end two." it certainly seemed to be the best plan. one by one, as they took out the books, the space behind grew smaller and smaller. there was something in it that was certainly very much alive. once they caught sight of fingers pressing outward for a way of escape. at last they had it pressed between the two big books. "there's muscle there, if there isn't flesh and blood," said saunders, as he held them together. "it seems to be a hand right enough, too. i suppose this is a sort of infectious hallucination. i've read about such cases before." "infectious fiddlesticks!" said eustace, his face white with anger; "bring the thing downstairs. we'll get it back into the box." it was not altogether easy, but they were successful at last. "drive in the screws," said eustace, "we won't run any risks. put the box in this old desk of mine. there's nothing in it that i want. here's the key. thank goodness, there's nothing wrong with the lock." "quite a lively evening," said saunders. "now let's hear more about your uncle." they sat up together until early morning. saunders had no desire for sleep. eustace was trying to explain and to forget: to conceal from himself a fear that he had never felt before--the fear of walking alone down the long corridor to his bedroom. iii "whatever it was," said eustace to saunders on the following morning, "i propose that we drop the subject. there's nothing to keep us here for the next ten days. we'll motor up to the lakes and get some climbing." "and see nobody all day, and sit bored to death with each other every night. not for me thanks. why not run up to town? run's the exact word in this case, isn't it? we're both in such a blessed funk. pull yourself together eustace, and let's have another look at the hand." "as you like," said eustace; "there's the key." they went into the library and opened the desk. the box was as they had left it on the previous night. "what are you waiting for?" asked eustace. "i am waiting for you to volunteer to open the lid. however, since you seem to funk it, allow me. there doesn't seem to be the likelihood of any rumpus this morning, at all events." he opened the lid and picked out the hand. "cold?" asked eustace. "tepid. a bit below blood-heat by the feel. soft and supple too. if it's the embalming, it's a sort of embalming i've never seen before. is it your uncle's hand?" "oh, yes, it's his all right," said eustace. "i should know those long thin fingers anywhere. put it back in the box, saunders. never mind about the screws. i'll lock the desk, so that there'll be no chance of its getting out. we'll compromise by motoring up to town for a week. if we get off soon after lunch we ought to be at grantham or stamford by night." "right," said saunders; "and to-morrow--oh, well, by to-morrow we shall have forgotten all about this beastly thing." if when the morrow came they had not forgotten, it was certainly true that at the end of the week they were able to tell a very vivid ghost story at the little supper eustace gave on hallow e'en. "you don't want us to believe that it's true, mr. borlsover? how perfectly awful!" "i'll take my oath on it, and so would saunders here; wouldn't you, old chap?" "any number of oaths," said saunders. "it was a long thin hand, you know, and it gripped me just like that." "don't mr. saunders! don't! how perfectly horrid! now tell us another one, do. only a really creepy one, please!" * * * * * "here's a pretty mess!" said eustace on the following day as he threw a letter across the table to saunders. "it's your affair, though. mrs. merrit, if i understand it, gives a month's notice." "oh, that's quite absurd on mrs. merrit's part," saunders replied. "she doesn't know what she's talking about. let's see what she says." "dear sir," he read, "this is to let you know that i must give you a month's notice as from tuesday the <UNK> for a long time i've felt the place too big for me, but when jane parfit, and emma laidlaw go off with scarcely as much as an 'if you please,' after frightening the wits out of the other girls, so that they can't turn out a room by themselves or walk alone down the stairs for fear of treading on half-frozen toads or hearing it run along the passages at night, all i can say is that it's no place for me. so i must ask you, mr. borlsover, sir, to find a new housekeeper that has no objection to large and lonely houses, which some people do say, not that i believe them for a minute, my poor mother always having been a wesleyan, are haunted. "yours faithfully, elizabeth merrit. "p.s.--i should be obliged if you would give my respects to mr. saunders. i hope that he won't run no risks with his cold." "saunders," said eustace, "you've always had a wonderful way with you in dealing with servants. you mustn't let poor old merrit go." "of course she shan't go," said saunders. "she's probably only angling for a rise in salary. i'll write to her this morning." "no; there's nothing like a personal interview. we've had enough of town. we'll go back to-morrow, and you must work your cold for all it's worth. don't forget that it's got on to the chest, and will require weeks of feeding up and nursing." "all right. i think i can manage mrs. merrit." but mrs. merrit was more obstinate than he had thought. she was very sorry to hear of mr. saunders's cold, and how he lay awake all night in london coughing; very sorry indeed. she'd change his room for him gladly, and get the south room aired. and wouldn't he have a basin of hot bread and milk last thing at night? but she was afraid that she would have to leave at the end of the month. "try her with an increase of salary," was the advice of eustace. it was no use. mrs. merrit was obdurate, though she knew of a mrs. handyside who had been housekeeper to lord gargrave, who might be glad to come at the salary mentioned. "what's the matter with the servants, morton?" asked eustace that evening when he brought the coffee into the library. "what's all this about mrs. merrit wanting to leave?" "if you please, sir, i was going to mention it myself. i have a confession to make, sir. when i found your note asking me to open that desk and take out the box with the rat, i broke the lock as you told me, and was glad to do it, because i could hear the animal in the box making a great noise, and i thought it wanted food. so i took out the box, sir, and got a cage, and was going to transfer it, when the animal got away." "what in the world are you talking about? i never wrote any such note." "excuse me, sir, it was the note i picked up here on the floor on the day you and mr. saunders left. i have it in my pocket now." it certainly seemed to be in eustace's handwriting. it was written in pencil, and began somewhat abruptly. "get a hammer, morton," he read, "or some other tool, and break open the lock in the old desk in the library. take out the box that is inside. you need not do anything else. the lid is already open. eustace borlsover." "and you opened the desk?" "yes, sir; and as i was getting the cage ready the animal hopped out." "what animal?" "the animal inside the box, sir." "what did it look like?" "well, sir, i couldn't tell you," said morton nervously; "my back was turned, and it was halfway down the room when i looked up." "what was its color?" asked saunders; "black?" "oh, no, sir, a grayish white. it crept along in a very funny way, sir. i don't think it had a tail." "what did you do then?" "i tried to catch it, but it was no use. so i set the rat-traps and kept the library shut. then that girl emma laidlaw left the door open when she was cleaning, and i think it must have escaped." "and you think it was the animal that's been frightening the maids?" "well, no, sir, not quite. they said it was--you'll excuse me, sir--a hand that they saw. emma trod on it once at the bottom of the stairs. she thought then it was a half-frozen toad, only white. and then parfit was washing up the dishes in the scullery. she wasn't thinking about anything in particular. it was close on dusk. she took her hands out of the water and was drying them absent-minded like on the roller towel, when she found that she was drying someone else's hand as well, only colder than hers." "what nonsense!" exclaimed saunders. "exactly, sir; that's what i told her; but we couldn't get her to stop." "you don't believe all this?" said eustace, turning suddenly towards the butler. "me, sir? oh, no, sir! i've not seen anything." "nor heard anything?" "well, sir, if you must know, the bells do ring at odd times, and there's nobody there when we go; and when we go round to draw the blinds of a night, as often as not somebody's been there before us. but as i says to mrs. merrit, a young monkey might do wonderful things, and we all know that mr. borlsover has had some strange animals about the place." "very well, morton, that will do." "what do you make of it?" asked saunders when they were alone. "i mean of the letter he said you wrote." "oh, that's simple enough," said eustace. "see the paper it's written on? i stopped using that years ago, but there were a few odd sheets and envelopes left in the old desk. we never fastened up the lid of the box before locking it in. the hand got out, found a pencil, wrote this note, and shoved it through a crack on to the floor where morton found it. that's plain as daylight." "but the hand couldn't write?" "couldn't it? you've not seen it do the things i've seen," and he told saunders more of what had happened at eastbourne. "well," said saunders, "in that case we have at least an explanation of the legacy. it was the hand which wrote unknown to your uncle that letter to your solicitor, bequeathing itself to you. your uncle had no more to do with that request than i. in fact, it would seem that he had some idea of this automatic writing, and feared it." "then if it's not my uncle, what is it?" "i suppose some people might say that a disembodied spirit had got your uncle to educate and prepare a little body for it. now it's got into that little body and is off on its own." "well, what are we to do?" "we'll keep our eyes open," said saunders, "and try to catch it. if we can't do that, we shall have to wait till the bally clockwork runs down. after all, if it's flesh and blood, it can't live for ever." for two days nothing happened. then saunders saw it sliding down the banister in the hall. he was taken unawares, and lost a full second before he started in pursuit, only to find that the thing had escaped him. three days later, eustace, writing alone in the library at night, saw it sitting on an open book at the other end of the room. the fingers crept over the page, feeling the print as if it were reading; but before he had time to get up from his seat, it had taken the alarm and was pulling itself up the curtains. eustace watched it grimly as it hung on to the cornice with three fingers, flicking thumb and forefinger at him in an expression of scornful derision. "i know what i'll do," he said. "if i only get it into the open i'll set the dogs on to it." he spoke to saunders of the suggestion. "it's jolly good idea," he said; "only we won't wait till we find it out of doors. we'll get the dogs. there are the two terriers and the under-keeper's irish mongrel that's on to rats like a flash. your spaniel has not got spirit enough for this sort of game." they brought the dogs into the house, and the keeper's irish mongrel chewed up the slippers, and the terriers tripped up morton as he waited at table; but all three were welcome. even false security is better than no security at all. for a fortnight nothing happened. then the hand was caught, not by the dogs, but by mrs. merrit's gray parrot. the bird was in the habit of periodically removing the pins that kept its seed and water tins in place, and of escaping through the holes in the side of the cage. when once at liberty peter would show no inclination to return, and would often be about the house for days. now, after six consecutive weeks of captivity, peter had again discovered a new means of unloosing his bolts and was at large, exploring the tapestried forests of the curtains and singing songs in praise of liberty from cornice and picture rail. "it's no use your trying to catch him," said eustace to mrs. merrit, as she came into the study one afternoon towards dusk with a step-ladder. "you'd much better leave peter alone. starve him into surrender, mrs. merrit, and don't leave bananas and seed about for him to peck at when he fancies he's hungry. you're far too softhearted." "well, sir, i see he's right out of reach now on that picture rail, so if you wouldn't mind closing the door, sir, when you leave the room, i'll bring his cage in to-night and put some meat inside it. he's that fond of meat, though it does make him pull out his feathers to suck the quills. they _do_ say that if you cook--" "never mind, mrs. merrit," said eustace, who was busy writing. "that will do; i'll keep an eye on the bird." there was silence in the room, unbroken but for the continuous whisper of his pen. "scratch poor peter," said the bird. "scratch poor old peter!" "be quiet, you beastly bird!" "poor old peter! scratch poor peter, do." "i'm more likely to wring your neck if i get hold of you." he looked up at the picture rail, and there was the hand holding on to a hook with three fingers, and slowly scratching the head of the parrot with the fourth. eustace ran to the bell and pressed it hard; then across to the window, which he closed with a bang. frightened by the noise the parrot shook its wings preparatory to flight, and as it did so the fingers of the hand got hold of it by the throat. there was a shrill scream from peter as he fluttered across the room, wheeling round in circles that ever descended, borne down under the weight that clung to him. the bird dropped at last quite suddenly, and eustace saw fingers and feathers rolled into an inextricable mass on the floor. the struggle abruptly ceased as finger and thumb squeezed the neck; the bird's eyes rolled up to show the whites, and there was a faint, half-choked gurgle. but before the fingers had time to loose their hold, eustace had them in his own. "send mr. saunders here at once," he said to the maid who came in answer to the bell. "tell him i want him immediately." then he went with the hand to the fire. there was a ragged gash across the back where the bird's beak had torn it, but no blood oozed from the wound. he noticed with disgust that the nails had grown long and discolored. "i'll burn the beastly thing," he said. but he could not burn it. he tried to throw it into the flames, but his own hands, as if restrained by some old primitive feeling, would not let him. and so saunders found him pale and irresolute, with the hand still clasped tightly in his fingers. "i've got it at last," he said in a tone of triumph. "good; let's have a look at it." "not when it's loose. get me some nails and a hammer and a board of some sort." "can you hold it all right?" "yes, the thing's quite limp; tired out with throttling poor old peter, i should say." "and now," said saunders when he returned with the things, "what are we going to do?" "drive a nail through it first, so that it can't get away; then we can take our time over examining it." "do it yourself," said saunders. "i don't mind helping you with guinea-pigs occasionally when there's something to be learned; partly because i don't fear a guinea-pig's revenge. this thing's different." "all right, you miserable skunk. i won't forget the way you've stood by me." he took up a nail, and before saunders had realised what he was doing had driven it through the hand, deep into the board. "oh, my aunt," he giggled hysterically, "look at it now," for the hand was writhing in agonized contortions, squirming and wriggling upon the nail like a worm upon the hook. "well," said saunders, "you've done it now. i'll leave you to examine it." "don't go, in heaven's name. cover it up, man, cover it up! shove a cloth over it! here!" and he pulled off the antimacassar from the back of a chair and wrapped the board in it. "now get the keys from my pocket and open the safe. chuck the other things out. oh, lord, it's getting itself into frightful knots! and open it quick!" he threw the thing in and banged the door. "we'll keep it there till it dies," he said. "may i burn in hell if i ever open the door of that safe again." * * * * * mrs. merrit departed at the end of the month. her successor certainly was more successful in the management of the servants. early in her rule she declared that she would stand no nonsense, and gossip soon withered and died. eustace borlsover went back to his old way of life. old habits crept over and covered his new experience. he was, if anything, less morose, and showed a greater inclination to take his natural part in country society. "i shouldn't be surprised if he marries one of these days," said saunders. "well, i'm in no hurry for such an event. i know eustace far too well for the future mrs. borlsover to like me. it will be the same old story again: a long friendship slowly made--marriage--and a long friendship quickly forgotten." iv but eustace borlsover did not follow the advice of his uncle and marry. he was too fond of old slippers and tobacco. the cooking, too, under mrs. handyside's management was excellent, and she seemed, too, to have a heaven-sent faculty in knowing when to stop dusting. little by little the old life resumed its old power. then came the burglary. the men, it was said, broke into the house by way of the conservatory. it was really little more than an attempt, for they only succeeded in carrying away a few pieces of plate from the pantry. the safe in the study was certainly found open and empty, but, as mr. borlsover informed the police inspector, he had kept nothing of value in it during the last six months. "then you're lucky in getting off so easily, sir," the man replied. "by the way they have gone about their business, i should say they were experienced cracksmen. they must have caught the alarm when they were just beginning their evening's work." "yes," said eustace, "i suppose i am lucky." "i've no doubt," said the inspector, "that we shall be able to trace the men. i've said that they must have been old hands at the game. the way they got in and opened the safe shows that. but there's one little thing that puzzles me. one of them was careless enough not to wear gloves, and i'm bothered if i know what he was trying to do. i've traced his finger-marks on the new varnish on the window sashes in every one of the downstairs rooms. they are very distinct ones too." "right hand or left, or both?" asked eustace. "oh, right every time. that's the funny thing. he must have been a foolhardy fellow, and i rather think it was him that wrote that." he took out a slip of paper from his pocket. "that's what he wrote, sir. 'i've got out, eustace borlsover, but i'll be back before long.' some gaol bird just escaped, i suppose. it will make it all the easier for us to trace him. do you know the writing, sir?" "no," said eustace; "it's not the writing of anyone i know." "i'm not going to stay here any longer," said eustace to saunders at luncheon. "i've got on far better during the last six months than ever i expected, but i'm not going to run the risk of seeing that thing again. i shall go up to town this afternoon. get morton to put my things together, and join me with the car at brighton on the day after to-morrow. and bring the proofs of those two papers with you. we'll run over them together." "how long are you going to be away?" "i can't say for certain, but be prepared to stay for some time. we've stuck to work pretty closely through the summer, and i for one need a holiday. i'll engage the rooms at brighton. you'll find it best to break the journey at hitchin. i'll wire to you there at the crown to tell you the brighton address." the house he chose at brighton was in a terrace. he had been there before. it was kept by his old college gyp, a man of discreet silence, who was admirably partnered by an excellent cook. the rooms were on the first floor. the two bedrooms were at the back, and opened out of each other. "saunders can have the smaller one, though it is the only one with a fireplace," he said. "i'll stick to the larger of the two, since it's got a bathroom adjoining. i wonder what time he'll arrive with the car." saunders came about seven, cold and cross and dirty. "we'll light the fire in the dining-room," said eustace, "and get prince to unpack some of the things while we are at dinner. what were the roads like?" "rotten; swimming with mud, and a beastly cold wind against us all day. and this is july. dear old england!" "yes," said eustace, "i think we might do worse than leave dear old england for a few months." they turned in soon after twelve. "you oughtn't to feel cold, saunders," said eustace, "when you can afford to sport a great cat-skin lined coat like this. you do yourself very well, all things considered. look at those gloves, for instance. who could possibly feel cold when wearing them?" "they are far too clumsy though for driving. try them on and see," and he tossed them through the door on to eustace's bed, and went on with his unpacking. a minute later he heard a shrill cry of terror. "oh, lord," he heard, "it's in the glove! quick, saunders, quick!" then came a smacking thud. eustace had thrown it from him. "i've chucked it into the bathroom," he gasped, "it's hit the wall and fallen into the bath. come now if you want to help." saunders, with a lighted candle in his hand, looked over the edge of the bath. there it was, old and maimed, dumb and blind, with a ragged hole in the middle, crawling, staggering, trying to creep up the slippery sides, only to fall back helpless. "stay there," said saunders. "i'll empty a collar box or something, and we'll jam it in. it can't get out while i'm away." "yes, it can," shouted eustace. "it's getting out now. it's climbing up the plug chain. no, you brute, you filthy brute, you don't! come back, saunders, it's getting away from me. i can't hold it; it's all slippery. curse its claw! shut the window, you idiot! the top too, as well as the bottom. you utter idiot! it's got out!" there was the sound of something dropping on to the hard flagstones below, and eustace fell back fainting. * * * * * for a fortnight he was ill. "i don't know what to make of it," the doctor said to saunders. "i can only suppose that mr. borlsover has suffered some great emotional shock. you had better let me send someone to help you nurse him. and by all means indulge that whim of his never to be left alone in the dark. i would keep a light burning all night if i were you. but he _must_ have more fresh air. it's perfectly absurd this hatred of open windows." eustace, however, would have no one with him but saunders. "i don't want the other men," he said. "they'd smuggle it in somehow. i know they would." "don't worry about it, old chap. this sort of thing can't go on indefinitely. you know i saw it this time as well as you. it wasn't half so active. it won't go on living much longer, especially after that fall. i heard it hit the flags myself. as soon as you're a bit stronger we'll leave this place; not bag and baggage, but with only the clothes on our backs, so that it won't be able to hide anywhere. we'll escape it that way. we won't give any address, and we won't have any parcels sent after us. cheer up, eustace! you'll be well enough to leave in a day or two. the doctor says i can take you out in a chair to-morrow." "what have i done?" asked eustace. "why does it come after me? i'm no worse than other men. i'm no worse than you, saunders; you know i'm not. it was you who were at the bottom of that dirty business in san diego, and that was fifteen years ago." "it's not that, of course," said saunders. "we are in the twentieth century, and even the parsons have dropped the idea of your old sins finding you out. before you caught the hand in the library it was filled with pure malevolence--to you and all mankind. after you spiked it through with that nail it naturally forgot about other people, and concentrated its attention on you. it was shut up in the safe, you know, for nearly six months. that gives plenty of time for thinking of revenge." eustace borlsover would not leave his room, but he thought that there might be something in saunders's suggestion to leave brighton without notice. he began rapidly to regain his strength. "we'll go on the first of september," he said. * * * * * the evening of august <UNK> was oppressively warm. though at midday the windows had been wide open, they had been shut an hour or so before dusk. mrs. prince had long since ceased to wonder at the strange habits of the gentlemen on the first floor. soon after their arrival she had been told to take down the heavy window curtains in the two bedrooms, and day by day the rooms had seemed to grow more bare. nothing was left lying about. "mr. borlsover doesn't like to have any place where dirt can collect," saunders had said as an excuse. "he likes to see into all the corners of the room." "couldn't i open the window just a little?" he said to eustace that evening. "we're simply roasting in here, you know." "no, leave well alone. we're not a couple of boarding-school misses fresh from a course of hygiene lectures. get the chessboard out." they sat down and played. at ten o'clock mrs. prince came to the door with a note. "i am sorry i didn't bring it before," she said, "but it was left in the letter-box." "open it, saunders, and see if it wants answering." it was very brief. there was neither address nor signature. "will eleven o'clock to-night be suitable for our last appointment?" "who is it from?" asked borlsover. "it was meant for me," said saunders. "there's no answer, mrs. prince," and he put the paper into his pocket. "a dunning letter from a tailor; i suppose he must have got wind of our leaving." it was a clever lie, and eustace asked no more questions. they went on with their game. on the landing outside saunders could hear the grandfather's clock whispering the seconds, blurting out the quarter-hours. "check!" said eustace. the clock struck eleven. at the same time there was a gentle knocking on the door; it seemed to come from the bottom panel. "who's there?" asked eustace. there was no answer. "mrs. prince, is that you?" "she is up above," said saunders; "i can hear her walking about the room." "then lock the door; bolt it too. your move, saunders." while saunders sat with his eyes on the chessboard, eustace walked over to the window and examined the fastenings. he did the same in saunders's room and the bathroom. there were no doors between the three rooms, or he would have shut and locked them too. "now, saunders," he said, "don't stay all night over your move. i've had time to smoke one cigarette already. it's bad to keep an invalid waiting. there's only one possible thing for you to do. what was that?" "the ivy blowing against the window. there, it's your move now, eustace." "it wasn't the ivy, you idiot. it was someone tapping at the window," and he pulled up the blind. on the outer side of the window, clinging to the sash, was the hand. "what is it that it's holding?" "it's a pocket-knife. it's going to try to open the window by pushing back the fastener with the blade." "well, let it try," said eustace. "those fasteners screw down; they can't be opened that way. anyhow, we'll close the shutters. it's your move, saunders. i've played." but saunders found it impossible to fix his attention on the game. he could not understand eustace, who seemed all at once to have lost his fear. "what do you say to some wine?" he asked. "you seem to be taking things coolly, but i don't mind confessing that i'm in a blessed funk." "you've no need to be. there's nothing supernatural about that hand, saunders. i mean it seems to be governed by the laws of time and space. it's not the sort of thing that vanishes into thin air or slides through oaken doors. and since that's so, i defy it to get in here. we'll leave the place in the morning. i for one have bottomed the depths of fear. fill your glass, man! the windows are all shuttered, the door is locked and bolted. pledge me my uncle adrian! drink, man! what are you waiting for?" saunders was standing with his glass half raised. "it can get in," he said hoarsely; "it can get in! we've forgotten. there's the fireplace in my bedroom. it will come down the chimney." "quick!" said eustace, as he rushed into the other room; "we haven't a minute to lose. what can we do? light the fire, saunders. give me a match, quick!" "they must be all in the other room. i'll get them." "hurry, man, for goodness' sake! look in the bookcase! look in the bathroom! here, come and stand here; i'll look." "be quick!" shouted saunders. "i can hear something!" "then plug a sheet from your bed up the chimney. no, here's a match." he had found one at last that had slipped into a crack in the floor. "is the fire laid? good, but it may not burn. i know--the oil from that old reading-lamp and this cotton-wool. now the match, quick! pull the sheet away, you fool! we don't want it now." there was a great roar from the grate as the flames shot up. saunders had been a fraction of a second too late with the sheet. the oil had fallen on to it. it, too, was burning. "the whole place will be on fire!" cried eustace, as he tried to beat out the flames with a blanket. "it's no good! i can't manage it. you must open the door, saunders, and get help." saunders ran to the door and fumbled with the bolts. the key was stiff in the lock. "hurry!" shouted eustace; "the whole place is ablaze!" the key turned in the lock at last. for half a second saunders stopped to look back. afterwards he could never be quite sure as to what he had seen, but at the time he thought that something black and charred was creeping slowly, very slowly, from the mass of flames towards eustace borlsover. for a moment he thought of returning to his friend, but the noise and the smell of the burning sent him running down the passage crying, "fire! fire!" he rushed to the telephone to summon help, and then back to the bathroom--he should have thought of that before--for water. as he burst open the bedroom door there came a scream of terror which ended suddenly, and then the sound of a heavy fall. the mass of shadows by anatole france from _mother of pearl_, by anatole france. copyright by john lane company. by permission of the publishers. this tale the sacristan of the church of st. eulalie at neuville d'aumont told me, as we sat under the arbor of the white horse, one fine summer evening, drinking a bottle of old wine to the health of the dead man, now very much at his ease, whom that very morning he had borne to the grave with full honors, beneath a pall powdered with smart silver tears. "my poor father who is dead" (it is the sacristan who is speaking,) "was in his lifetime a grave-digger. he was of an agreeable disposition, the result, no doubt, of the calling he followed, for it has often been pointed out that people who work in cemeteries are of a jovial turn. death has no terrors for them; they never give it a thought. i, for instance, monsieur, enter a cemetery at night as little perturbed as though it were the arbor of the white horse. and if by chance i meet with a ghost, i don't disturb myself in the least about it, for i reflect that he may just as likely have business of his own to attend to as i. i know the habits of the dead, and i know their character. indeed, so far as that goes, i know things of which the priests themselves are ignorant. if i were to tell you all i have seen, you would be astounded. but a still tongue makes a wise head, and my father, who, all the same, delighted in spinning a yarn, did not disclose a twentieth part of what he knew. to make up for this he often repeated the same stories, and to my knowledge he told the story of catherine fontaine at least a hundred times. "catherine fontaine was an old maid whom he well remembered having seen when he was a mere child. i should not be surprised if there were still, perhaps, three old fellows in the district who could remember having heard folks speak of her, for she was very well known and of excellent reputation, though poor enough. she lived at the corner of the rue aux nonnes, in the turret which is still to be seen there, and which formed part of an old half-ruined mansion looking on to the garden of the ursuline nuns. on that turret can still be traced certain figures and half-obliterated inscriptions. the late curé of st. eulalie, monsieur levasseur, asserted that there are the words in latin, _love is stronger than death_, 'which is to be understood,' so he would add, 'of divine love.' "catherine fontaine lived by herself in this tiny apartment. she was a lace-maker. you know, of course, that the lace made in our part of the world was formerly held in high esteem. no one knew anything of her relatives or friends. it was reported that when she was eighteen years of age she had loved the young chevalier d'aumont-cléry, and had been secretly affianced to him. but decent folk didn't believe a word of it, and said it was nothing but a tale concocted because catherine fontaine's demeanor was that of a lady rather than that of a working woman, and because, moreover, she possessed beneath her white locks the remains of great beauty. her expression was sorrowful, and on one finger she wore one of those rings fashioned by the goldsmith into the semblance of two tiny hands clasped together. in former days folks were accustomed to exchange such rings at their betrothal ceremony. i am sure you know the sort of thing i mean. "catherine fontaine lived a saintly life. she spent a great deal of time in churches, and every morning, whatever might be the weather, she went to assist at the six o'clock mass at st. eulalie. "now one december night, whilst she was in her little chamber, she was awakened by the sound of bells, and nothing doubting that they were ringing for the first mass, the pious woman dressed herself, and came downstairs and out into the street. the night was so obscure that not even the walls of the houses were visible, and not a ray of light shone from the murky sky. and such was the silence amid this black darkness, that there was not even the sound of a distant dog barking, and a feeling of aloofness from every living creature was perceptible. but catherine fontaine knew well every single stone she stepped on, and, as she could have found her way to the church with her eyes shut, she reached without difficulty the corner of the rue aux nonnes and the rue de la paroisse, where the timbered house stands with the tree of jesse carved on one of its massive beams. when she reached this spot she perceived that the church doors were open, and that a great light was streaming out from the wax tapers. she resumed her journey, and when she had passed through the porch she found herself in the midst of a vast congregation which entirely filled the church. but she did not recognize any of the worshipers and was surprised to observe that all of these people were dressed in velvets and brocades, with feathers in their hats, and that they wore swords in the fashion of days gone by. here were gentlemen who carried tall canes with gold knobs, and ladies with lace caps fastened with coronet-shaped combs. chevaliers of the order of st. louis extended their hands to these ladies, who concealed behind their fans painted faces, of which only the powdered brow and the patch at the corner of the eye were visible! all of them proceeded to take their places without the slightest sound, and as they moved neither the sound of their footsteps on the pavement, nor the rustle of their garments could be heard. the lower places were filled with a crowd of young artisans in brown jackets, dimity breeches, and blue stockings, with their arms round the waists of pretty blushing girls who lowered their eyes. near the holy water stoups peasant women, in scarlet petticoats and laced bodices, sat upon the ground as immovable as domestic animals, whilst young lads, standing up behind them, stared out from wide-open eyes and twirled their hats round and round on their fingers, and all these sorrowful countenances seemed centred irremovably on one and the same thought, at once sweet and sorrowful. on her knees, in her accustomed place, catherine fontaine saw the priest advance toward the altar, preceded by two servers. she recognized neither priest nor clerks. the mass began. it was a silent mass, during which neither the sound of the moving lips nor the tinkle of the bell was audible. catherine fontaine felt that she was under the observation and the influence also of her mysterious neighbor, and when, scarcely turning her head, she stole a glance at him, she recognized the young chevalier d'aumont-cléry, who had once loved her, and who had been dead for five and forty years. she recognized him by a small mark which he had over the left ear, and above all by the shadow which his long black eyelashes cast upon his cheeks. he was dressed in his hunting clothes, scarlet with gold lace, the very clothes he wore that day when he met her in st. leonard's wood, begged of her a drink, and stole a kiss. he had preserved his youth and good looks. when he smiled, he still displayed magnificent teeth. catherine said to him in an undertone: "'monseigneur, you who were my friend, and to whom in days gone by i gave all that a girl holds most dear, may god keep you in his grace! o, that he would at length inspire me with regret for the sin i committed in yielding to you; for it is a fact that, though my hair is white and i approach my end, i have not yet repented of having loved you. but, dear dead friend and noble seigneur, tell me, who are these folk, habited after the antique fashion, who are here assisting at this silent mass?' "the chevalier d'aumont-cléry replied in a voice feebler than a breath, but none the less crystal clear: "'catherine, these men and women are souls from purgatory who have grieved god by sinning as we ourselves sinned through love of the creature, but who are not on that account cast off by god, inasmuch as their sin, like ours, was not deliberate. "'whilst separated from those whom they loved upon earth, they are purified in the cleansing fires of purgatory, they suffer the pangs of absence, which is for them the most cruel of tortures. they are so unhappy that an angel from heaven takes pity upon their love-torment. by the permission of the most high, for one hour in the night, he reunites each year lover to loved in their parish church, where they are permitted to assist at the mass of shadows, hand clasped in hand. these are the facts. if it has been granted to me to see thee before thy death, catherine, it is a boon which is bestowed by god's special permission.' "and catherine fontaine answered him: "'i would die gladly enough, dear, dead lord, if i might recover the beauty that was mine when i gave you to drink in the forest.' "whilst they thus conversed under their breath, a very old canon was taking the collection and proffering to the worshipers a great copper dish, wherein they let fall, each in his turn, ancient coins which have long since ceased to pass current: écus of six livres, florins, ducats and ducatoons, jacobuses and rose-nobles, and the pieces fell silently into the dish. when at length it was placed before the chevalier, he dropped into it a louis which made no more sound than had the other pieces of gold and silver. "then the old canon stopped before catherine fontaine, who fumbled in her pocket without being able to find a farthing. then, being unwilling to allow the dish to pass without an offering from herself, she slipped from her finger the ring which the chevalier had given her the day before his death, and cast it into the copper bowl. as the golden ring fell, a sound like the heavy clang of a bell rang out, and on the stroke of this reverberation the chevalier, the canon, the celebrant, the servers, the ladies and their cavaliers, the whole assembly vanished utterly; the candles guttered out, and catherine fontaine was left alone in the darkness." having concluded his narrative after this fashion, the sacristan drank a long draught of wine, remained pensive for a moment, and then resumed his talk in these words: "i have told you this tale exactly as my father has told it to me over and over again, and i believe that it is authentic, because it agrees in all respects with what i have observed of the manners and customs peculiar to those who have passed away. i have associated a good deal with the dead ever since my childhood, and i know that they are accustomed to return to what they have loved. "it is on this account that the miserly dead wander at night in the neighborhood of the treasures they conceal during their life time. they keep a strict watch over their gold; but the trouble they give themselves, far from being of service to them, turns to their disadvantage; and it is not a rare thing at all to come upon money buried in the ground on digging in a place haunted by a ghost. in the same way deceased husbands come by night to harass their wives who have made a second matrimonial venture, and i could easily name several who have kept a better watch over their wives since death than they ever did while living. "that sort of thing is blameworthy, for in all fairness the dead have no business to stir up jealousies. still i do but tell you what i have observed myself. it is a matter to take into account if one marries a widow. besides, the tale i have told you is vouchsafed for in the manner following: "the morning after that extraordinary night catherine fontaine was discovered dead in her chamber. and the beadle attached to st. eulalie found in the copper bowl used for the collection a gold ring with two clasped hands. besides, i'm not the kind of man to make jokes. suppose we order another bottle of wine?..." what was it? by fitz-james o'brien it is, i confess, with considerable diffidence, that i approach the strange narrative which i am about to relate. the events which i purpose detailing are of so extraordinary a character that i am quite prepared to meet with an unusual amount of incredulity and scorn. i accept all such beforehand. i have, i trust, the literary courage to face unbelief. i have, after mature consideration resolved to narrate, in as simple and straightforward a manner as i can compass, some facts that passed under my observation, in the month of july last, and which, in the annals of the mysteries of physical science, are wholly unparalleled. i live at no. ---- twenty-sixth street, in new york. the house is in some respects a curious one. it has enjoyed for the last two years the reputation of being haunted. it is a large and stately residence, surrounded by what was once a garden, but which is now only a green enclosure used for bleaching clothes. the dry basin of what has been a fountain, and a few fruit trees ragged and unpruned, indicate that this spot in past days was a pleasant, shady retreat, filled with fruits and flowers and the sweet murmur of waters. the house is very spacious. a hall of noble size leads to a large spiral staircase winding through its center, while the various apartments are of imposing dimensions. it was built some fifteen or twenty years since by mr. a----, the well-known new york merchant, who five years ago threw the commercial world into convulsions by a stupendous bank fraud. mr. a----, as everyone knows, escaped to europe, and died not long after, of a broken heart. almost immediately after the news of his decease reached this country and was verified, the report spread in twenty-sixth street that no. ---- was haunted. legal measures had dispossessed the widow of its former owner, and it was inhabited merely by a caretaker and his wife, placed there by the house agent into whose hands it had passed for the purposes of renting or sale. these people declared that they were troubled with unnatural noises. doors were opened without any visible agency. the remnants of furniture scattered through the various rooms were, during the night, piled one upon the other by unknown hands. invisible feet passed up and down the stairs in broad daylight, accompanied by the rustle of unseen silk dresses, and the gliding of viewless hands along the massive balusters. the caretaker and his wife declared they would live there no longer. the house agent laughed, dismissed them, and put others in their place. the noises and supernatural manifestations continued. the neighborhood caught up the story, and the house remained untenanted for three years. several persons negotiated for it; but, somehow, always before the bargain was closed they heard the unpleasant rumors and declined to treat any further. it was in this state of things that my landlady, who at that time kept a boarding-house in bleecker street, and who wished to move further up town, conceived the bold idea of renting no. ---- twenty-sixth street. happening to have in her house rather a plucky and philosophical set of boarders, she laid her scheme before us, stating candidly everything she had heard respecting the ghostly qualities of the establishment to which she wished to remove us. with the exception of two timid persons,--a sea-captain and a returned californian, who immediately gave notice that they would leave,--all of mrs. moffat's guests declared that they would accompany her in her chivalric incursion into the abode of spirits. our removal was effected in the month of may, and we were charmed with our new residence. the portion of twenty-sixth street where our house is situated, between seventh and eighth avenues, is one of the pleasantest localities in new york. the gardens back of the houses, running down nearly to the hudson, form, in the summer time, a perfect avenue of verdure. the air is pure and invigorating, sweeping, as it does, straight across the river from the weehawken heights, and even the ragged garden which surrounded the house, although displaying on washing days rather too much clothesline, still gave us a piece of greensward to look at, and a cool retreat in the summer evenings, where we smoked our cigars in the dusk, and watched the fireflies flashing their dark lanterns in the long grass. of course we had no sooner established ourselves at no. ---- than we began to expect ghosts. we absolutely awaited their advent with eagerness. our dinner conversation was supernatural. one of the boarders, who had purchased mrs. crowe's _night side of nature_ for his own private delectation, was regarded as a public enemy by the entire household for not having bought twenty copies. the man led a life of supreme wretchedness while he was reading this volume. a system of espionage was established, of which he was the victim. if he incautiously laid the book down for an instant and left the room, it was immediately seized and read aloud in secret places to a select few. i found myself a person of immense importance, it having leaked out that i was tolerably well versed in the history of supernaturalism, and had once written a story the foundation of which was a ghost. if a table or a wainscot panel happened to warp when we were assembled in the large drawing-room, there was an instant silence, and everyone was prepared for an immediate clanking of chains and a spectral form. after a month of psychological excitement, it was with the utmost dissatisfaction that we were forced to acknowledge that nothing in the remotest degree approaching the supernatural had manifested itself. once the black butler asseverated that his candle had been blown out by some invisible agency while he was undressing himself for the night; but as i had more than once discovered this colored gentleman in a condition when one candle must have appeared to him like two, thought it possible that, by going a step further in his potations, he might have reversed this phenomenon, and seen no candle at all where he ought to have beheld one. things were in this state when an accident took place so awful and inexplicable in its character that my reason fairly reels at the bare memory of the occurrence. it was the tenth of july. after dinner was over i repaired, with my friend dr. hammond, to the garden to smoke my evening pipe. independent of certain mental sympathies which existed between the doctor and myself, we were linked together by a vice. we both smoked opium. we knew each other's secret, and respected it. we enjoyed together that wonderful expansion of thought, that marvelous intensifying of the perceptive faculties, that boundless feeling of existence when we seem to have points of contact with the whole universe,--in short, that unimaginable spiritual bliss, which i would not surrender for a throne, and which i hope you, reader, will never--never taste. those hours of opium happiness which the doctor and i spent together in secret were regulated with a scientific accuracy. we did not blindly smoke the drug of paradise, and leave our dreams to chance. while smoking, we carefully steered our conversation through the brightest and calmest channels of thought. we talked of the east, and endeavored to recall the magical panorama of its glowing scenery. we criticized the most sensuous poets,--those who painted life ruddy with health, brimming with passion, happy in the possession of youth and strength and beauty. if we talked of shakespeare's _tempest_, we lingered over ariel, and avoided caliban. like the guebers, we turned our faces to the east, and saw only the sunny side of the world. this skillful coloring of our train of thought produced in our subsequent visions a corresponding tone. the splendors of arabian fairyland dyed our dreams. we paced the narrow strip of grass with the tread and port of kings. the song of the _rana arborea_, while he clung to the bark of the ragged plum-tree, sounded like the strains of divine musicians. houses, walls, and streets melted like rain clouds, and vistas of unimaginable glory stretched away before us. it was a rapturous companionship. we enjoyed the vast delight more perfectly because, even in our most ecstatic moments, we were conscious of each other's presence. our pleasures, while individual, were still twin, vibrating and moving in musical accord. on the evening in question, the tenth of july, the doctor and myself drifted into an unusually metaphysical mood. we lit our large meerschaums, filled with fine turkish tobacco, in the core of which burned a little black nut of opium, that, like the nut in the fairy tale, held within its narrow limits wonders beyond the reach of kings; we paced to and fro, conversing. a strange perversity dominated the currents of our thought. they would _not_ flow through the sun-lit channels into which we strove to divert them. for some unaccountable reason, they constantly diverged into dark and lonesome beds, where a continual gloom brooded. it was in vain that, after our old fashion, we flung ourselves on the shores of the east, and talked of its gay bazaars, of the splendors of the time of haroun, of harems and golden palaces. black afreets continually arose from the depths of our talk, and expanded, like the one the fisherman released from the copper vessel, until they blotted everything bright from our vision. insensibly, we yielded to the occult force that swayed us, and indulged in gloomy speculation. we had talked some time upon the proneness of the human mind to mysticism, and the almost universal love of the terrible, when hammond suddenly said to me. "what do you consider to be the greatest element of terror?" the question puzzled me. that many things were terrible, i knew. stumbling over a corpse in the dark; beholding, as i once did, a woman floating down a deep and rapid river, with wildly lifted arms, and awful, upturned face, uttering, as she drifted, shrieks that rent one's heart while we, spectators, stood frozen at a window which overhung the river at a height of sixty feet, unable to make the slightest effort to save her, but dumbly watching her last supreme agony and her disappearance. a shattered wreck, with no life visible, encountered floating listlessly on the ocean, is a terrible object, for it suggests a huge terror, the proportions of which are veiled. but it now struck me, for the first time, that there must be one great and ruling embodiment of fear,--a king of terrors, to which all others must succumb. what might it be? to what train of circumstances would it owe its existence? "i confess, hammond," i replied to my friend, "i never considered the subject before. that there must be one something more terrible than any other thing, i feel. i cannot attempt, however, even the most vague definition." "i am somewhat like you, harry," he answered. "i feel my capacity to experience a terror greater than anything yet conceived by the human mind;--something combining in fearful and unnatural amalgamation hitherto supposed incompatible elements. the calling of the voices in brockden brown's novel of _wieland_ is awful; so is the picture of the dweller of the threshold, in bulwer's _zanoni_; but," he added, shaking his head gloomily, "there is something more horrible still than those." "look here, hammond," i rejoined, "let us drop this kind of talk, for heaven's sake! we shall suffer for it, depend on it." "i don't know what's the matter with me to-night," he replied, "but my brain is running upon all sorts of weird and awful thoughts. i feel as if i could write a story like hoffman, to-night, if i were only master of a literary style." "well, if we are going to be hoffmanesque in our talk, i'm off to bed. opium and nightmares should never be brought together. how sultry it is! good-night, hammond." "good-night, harry. pleasant dreams to you." "to you, gloomy wretch, afreets, ghouls, and enchanters." we parted, and each sought his respective chamber. i undressed quickly and got into bed, taking with me, according to my usual custom, a book, over which i generally read myself to sleep. i opened the volume as soon as i had laid my head upon the pillow, and instantly flung it to the other side of the room. it was goudon's _history of monsters_,--a curious french work, which i had lately imported from paris, but which, in the state of mind i had then reached, was anything but an agreeable companion. i resolved to go to sleep at once; so, turning down my gas until nothing but a little blue point of light glimmered on the top of the tube, i composed myself to rest. the room was in total darkness. the atom of gas that still remained alight did not illuminate a distance of three inches round the burner. i desperately drew my arm across my eyes, as if to shut out even the darkness, and tried to think of nothing. it was in vain. the confounded themes touched on by hammond in the garden kept obtruding themselves on my brain. i battled against them. i erected ramparts of would-be blackness of intellect to keep them out. they still crowded upon me. while i was lying still as a corpse, hoping that by a perfect physical inaction i should hasten mental repose, an awful incident occurred. a something dropped, as it seemed, from the ceiling, plumb upon my chest, and the next instant i felt two bony hands encircling my throat, endeavoring to choke me. i am no coward, and am possessed of considerable physical strength. the suddenness of the attack, instead of stunning me, strung every nerve to its highest tension. my body acted from instinct, before my brain had time to realize the terrors of my position. in an instant i wound two muscular arms around the creature, and squeezed it, with all the strength of despair, against my chest. in a few seconds the bony hands that had fastened on my throat loosened their hold, and i was free to breathe once more. then commenced a struggle of awful intensity. immersed in the most profound darkness, totally ignorant of the nature of the thing by which i was so suddenly attacked, finding my grasp slipping every moment, by reason, it seemed to me, of the entire nakedness of my assailant, bitten with sharp teeth in the shoulder, neck, and chest, having every moment to protect my throat against a pair of sinewy, agile hands, which my utmost efforts could not confine,--these were a combination of circumstances to combat which required all the strength, skill, and courage that i possessed. at last, after a silent, deadly, exhausting struggle, i got my assailant under by a series of incredible efforts of strength. once pinned, with my knee on what i made out to be its chest, i knew that i was victor. i rested for a moment to breathe. i heard the creature beneath me panting in the darkness, and felt the violent throbbing of a heart. it was apparently as exhausted as i was; that was one comfort. at this moment i remembered that i usually placed under my pillow, before going to bed, a large yellow silk pocket handkerchief. i felt for it instantly; it was there. in a few seconds more i had, after a fashion, pinioned the creature's arms. i now felt tolerably secure. there was nothing more to be done but to turn on the gas, and, having first seen what my midnight assailant was like, arouse the household. i will confess to being actuated by a certain pride in not giving the alarm before; i wished to make the capture alone and unaided. never losing my hold for an instant, i slipped from the bed to the floor, dragging my captive with me. i had but a few steps to make to reach the gas-burner; these i made with the greatest caution, holding the creature in a grip like a vice. at last i got within arm's length of the tiny speck of blue light which told me where the gas-burner lay. quick as lightning i released my grasp with one hand and let on the full flood of light. then i turned to look at my captive. i cannot even attempt to give any definition of my sensations the instant after i turned on the gas. i suppose i must have shrieked with terror, for in less than a minute afterward my room was crowded with the inmates of the house. i shudder now as i think of that awful moment. _i saw nothing_! yes; i had one arm firmly clasped round a breathing, panting, corporeal shape, my other hand gripped with all its strength a throat as warm, as apparently fleshy, as my own; and yet, with this living substance in my grasp, with its body pressed against my own, and all in the bright glare of a large jet of gas, i absolutely beheld nothing! not even an outline,--a vapor! i do not, even at this hour, realize the situation in which i found myself. i cannot recall the astounding incident thoroughly. imagination in vain tries to compass the awful paradox. it breathed. i felt its warm breath upon my cheek. it struggled fiercely. it had hands. they clutched me. its skin was smooth, like my own. there it lay, pressed close up against me, solid as stone,--and yet utterly invisible! i wonder that i did not faint or go mad on the instant. some wonderful instinct must have sustained me; for, absolutely, in place of loosening my hold on the terrible enigma, i seemed to gain an additional strength in my moment of horror, and tightened my grasp with such wonderful force that i felt the creature shivering with agony. just then hammond entered my room at the head of the household. as soon as he beheld my face--which, i suppose, must have been an awful sight to look at--he hastened forward, crying, "great heaven, harry! what has happened?" "hammond! hammond!" i cried, "come here. o, this is awful! i have been attacked in bed by something or other, which i have hold of; but i can't see it,--i can't see it!" hammond, doubtless struck by the unfeigned horror expressed in my countenance, made one or two steps forward with an anxious yet puzzled expression. a very audible titter burst from the remainder of my visitors. this suppressed laughter made me furious. to laugh at a human being in my position! it was the worst species of cruelty. _now_, i can understand why the appearance of a man struggling violently, as it would seem, with an airy nothing, and calling for assistance against a vision, should have appeared ludicrous. _then_, so great was my rage against the mocking crowd that had i the power i would have stricken them dead where they stood. "hammond! hammond!" i cried again, despairingly, "for god's sake come to me. i can hold the--the thing but a short while longer. it is overpowering me. help me! help me!" "harry," whispered hammond, approaching me, "you have been smoking too much opium." "i swear to you, hammond, that this is no vision," i answered, in the same low tone. "don't you see how it shakes my whole frame with its struggles? if you don't believe me, convince yourself. feel it,--touch it." hammond advanced and laid his hand in the spot i indicated. a wild cry of horror burst from him. he had felt it! in a moment he had discovered somewhere in my room a long piece of cord, and was the next instant winding it and knotting it about the body of the unseen being that i clasped in my arms. "harry," he said, in a hoarse, agitated voice, for, though he preserved his presence of mind, he was deeply moved, "harry, it's all safe now. you may let go, old fellow, if you're tired. the thing can't move." i was utterly exhausted, and i gladly loosed my hold. hammond stood holding the ends of the cord that bound the invisible, twisted round his hand, while before him, self-supporting as it were, he beheld a rope laced and interlaced, and stretching tightly around a vacant space. i never saw a man look so thoroughly stricken with awe. nevertheless his face expressed all the courage and determination which i knew him to possess. his lips, although white, were set firmly, and one could perceive at a glance that, although stricken with fear, he was not daunted. the confusion that ensued among the guests of the house who were witnesses of this extraordinary scene between hammond and myself,--who beheld the pantomime of binding this struggling something,--who beheld me almost sinking from physical exhaustion when my task of jailer was over,--the confusion and terror that took possession of the bystanders, when they saw all this, was beyond description. the weaker ones fled from the apartment. the few who remained clustered near the door and could not be induced to approach hammond and his charge. still incredulity broke out through their terror. they had not the courage to satisfy themselves, and yet they doubted. it was in vain that i begged of some of the men to come near and convince themselves by touch of the existence in that room of a living being which was invisible. they were incredulous, but did not dare to undeceive themselves. how could a solid, living, breathing body be invisible, they asked. my reply was this. i gave a sign to hammond, and both of us--conquering our fearful repugnance to touch the invisible creature--lifted it from the ground, manacled as it was, and took it to my bed. its weight was about that of a boy of fourteen. "now my friends," i said, as hammond and myself held the creature suspended over the bed, "i can give you self-evident proof that here is a solid, ponderable body, which, nevertheless, you cannot see. be good enough to watch the surface of the bed attentively." i was astonished at my own courage in treating this strange event so calmly; but i had recovered from my first terror, and felt a sort of scientific pride in the affair, which dominated every other feeling. the eyes of the bystanders were immediately fixed on my bed. at a given signal hammond and i let the creature fall. there was a dull sound of a heavy body alighting on a soft mass. the timbers of the bed creaked. a deep impression marked itself distinctly on the pillow, and on the bed itself. the crowd who witnessed this gave a low cry, and rushed from the room. hammond and i were left alone with our mystery. we remained silent for some time, listening to the low, irregular breathing of the creature on the bed, and watching the rustle of the bedclothes as it impotently struggled to free itself from confinement. then hammond spoke. "harry, this is awful." "ay, awful." "but not unaccountable." "not unaccountable! what do you mean? such a thing has never occurred since the birth of the world. i know not what to think, hammond. god grant that i am not mad, and that this is not an insane fantasy!" "let us reason a little, harry. here is a solid body which we touch, but which we cannot see. the fact is so unusual that it strikes us with terror. is there no parallel, though, for such a phenomenon? take a piece of pure glass. it is tangible and transparent. a certain chemical coarseness is all that prevents its being so entirely transparent as to be totally invisible. it is not _theoretically impossible_, mind you, to make a glass which shall not reflect a single ray of light,--a glass so pure and homogeneous in its atoms that the rays from the sun will pass through it as they do through the air, refracted but not reflected. we do not see the air, and yet we feel it." "that's all very well, hammond, but these are inanimate substances. glass does not breathe, air does not breathe. _this_ thing has a heart that palpitates,--a will that moves it,--lungs that play, and inspire and respire." "you forget the phenomena of which we have so often heard of late," answered the doctor, gravely. "at the meetings called 'spirit circles,' invisible hands have been thrust into the hands of those persons round the table,--warm, fleshly hands that seemed to pulsate with mortal life." "what? do you think, then, that this thing is----" "i don't know what it is," was the solemn reply; "but please the gods i will, with your assistance, thoroughly investigate it." we watched together, smoking many pipes, all night long, by the bedside of the unearthly being that tossed and panted until it was apparently wearied out. then we learned by the low, regular breathing that it slept. the next morning the house was all astir. the boarders congregated on the landing outside my room, and hammond and myself were lions. we had to answer a thousand questions as to the state of our extraordinary prisoner, for as yet not one person in the house except ourselves could be induced to set foot in the apartment. the creature was awake. this was evidenced by the convulsive manner in which the bedclothes were moved in its efforts to escape. there was something truly terrible in beholding, as it were, those second-hand indications of the terrible writhings and agonized struggles for liberty which themselves were invisible. hammond and myself had racked our brains during the long night to discover some means by which we might realize the shape and general appearance of the enigma. as well as we could make out by passing our hands over the creature's form, its outlines and lineaments were human. there was a mouth; a round, smooth head without hair; a nose, which, however, was little elevated above the cheeks; and its hands and feet felt like those of a boy. at first we thought of placing the being on a smooth surface and tracing its outlines with chalk, as shoemakers trace the outline of the foot. this plan was given up as being of no value. such an outline would give not the slightest idea of its conformation. a happy thought struck me. we would take a cast of it in plaster of paris. this would give us the solid figure, and satisfy all our wishes. but how to do it? the movements of the creature would disturb the setting of the plastic covering, and distort the mold. another thought. why not give it chloroform? it had respiratory organs,--that was evident by its breathing. once reduced to a state of insensibility, we could do with it what we would. doctor x---- was sent for; and after the worthy physician had recovered from the first shock of amazement, he proceeded to administer the chloroform. in three minutes afterward we were enabled to remove the fetters from the creature's body, and a modeler was busily engaged in covering the invisible form with the moist clay. in five minutes more we had a mold, and before evening a rough facsimile of the mystery. it was shaped like a man--distorted, uncouth, and horrible, but still a man. it was small, not over four feet and some inches in height, and its limbs revealed a muscular development that was unparalleled. its face surpassed in hideousness anything i had ever seen. gustav doré, or callot, or tony johannot, never conceived anything so horrible. there is a face in one of the latter's illustrations to _un voyage où il vous plaira_, which somewhat approaches the countenance of this creature, but does not equal it. it was the physiognomy of what i should fancy a ghoul might be. it looked as if it was capable of feeding on human flesh. having satisfied our curiosity, and bound every one in the house to secrecy, it became a question what was to be done with our enigma? it was impossible that we should keep such a horror in our house; it was equally impossible that such an awful being should be let loose upon the world. i confess that i would have gladly voted for the creature's destruction. but who would shoulder the responsibility? who would undertake the execution of this horrible semblance of a human being? day after day this question was deliberated gravely. the boarders all left the house. mrs. moffat was in despair, and threatened hammond and myself with all sorts of legal penalties if we did not remove the horror. our answer was, "we will go if you like, but we decline taking this creature with us. remove it yourself if you please. it appeared in your house. on you the responsibility rests." to this there was, of course, no answer. mrs. moffat could not obtain for love or money a person who would even approach the mystery. the most singular part of the affair was that we were entirely ignorant of what the creature habitually fed on. everything in the way of nutriment that we could think of was placed before it, but was never touched. it was awful to stand by, day after day, and see the clothes toss, and hear the hard breathing, and know that it was starving. ten, twelve days, a fortnight passed, and it still lived. the pulsations of the heart, however, were daily growing fainter, and had now nearly ceased. it was evident that the creature was dying for want of sustenance. while this terrible life-struggle was going on, i felt miserable. i could not sleep. horrible as the creature was, it was pitiful to think of the pangs it was suffering. at last it died. hammond and i found it cold and stiff one morning in the bed. the heart had ceased to beat, the lungs to inspire. we hastened to bury it in the garden. it was a strange funeral, the dropping of that viewless corpse into the damp hole. the cast of its form i gave to doctor x----, who keeps it in his museum in tenth street. as i am on the eve of a long journey from which i may not return, i have drawn up this narrative of an event the most singular that has ever come to my knowledge. the middle toe of the right foot by ambrose bierce from _can such things be?_ by ambrose bierce. copyright by the neale publishing company. by permission of the publishers. i it is well known that the old manton house is haunted. in all the rural district near about, and even in the town of marshall, a mile away, not one person of unbiased mind entertains a doubt of it; incredulity is confined to those opinionated persons who will be called "cranks" as soon as the useful word shall have penetrated the intellectual demesne of the marshall _advance_. the evidence that the house is haunted is of two kinds; the testimony of disinterested witnesses who have had ocular proof, and that of the house itself. the former may be disregarded and ruled out on any of the various grounds of objection which may be urged against it by the ingenious; but facts within the observation of all are material and controlling. in the first place the manton house has been unoccupied by mortals for more than ten years, and with its outbuildings is slowly falling into decay--a circumstance which in itself the judicious will hardly venture to ignore. it stands a little way off the loneliest reach of the marshall and harriston road, in an opening which was once a farm and is still disfigured with strips of rotting fence and half covered with brambles overrunning a stony and sterile soil long unacquainted with the plow. the house itself is in tolerably good condition, though badly weather-stained and in dire need of attention from the glazier, the smaller male population of the region having attested in the manner of its kind its disapproval of dwelling without dwellers. it is two stories in height, nearly square, its front pierced by a single doorway flanked on each side by a window boarded up to the very top. corresponding windows above, not protected, serve to admit light and rain to the rooms of the upper floor. grass and weeds grow pretty rankly all about, and a few shade trees, somewhat the worse for wind, and leaning all in one direction, seem to be making a concerted effort to run away. in short, as the marshall town humorist explained in the columns of the _advance_, "the proposition that the manton house is badly haunted is the only logical conclusion from the premises." the fact that in this dwelling mr. manton thought it expedient one night some ten years ago to rise and cut the throats of his wife and two small children, removing at once to another part of the country, has no doubt done its share in directing public attention to the fitness of the place for supernatural phenomena. to this house, one summer evening, came four men in a wagon. three of them promptly alighted, and the one who had been driving hitched the team to the only remaining post of what had been a fence. the fourth remained seated in the wagon. "come," said one of his companions, approaching him, while the others moved away in the direction of the dwelling--"this is the place." the man addressed did not move. "by god!" he said harshly, "this is a trick, and it looks to me as if you were in it." "perhaps i am," the other said, looking him straight in the face and speaking in a tone which had something of contempt in it. "you will remember, however, that the choice of place was with your own assent left to the other side. of course if you are afraid of spooks--" "i am afraid of nothing," the man interrupted with another oath, and sprang to the ground. the two then joined the others at the door, which one of them had already opened with some difficulty, caused by rust of lock and hinge. all entered. inside it was dark, but the man who had unlocked the door produced a candle and matches and made a light. he then unlocked a door on their right as they stood in the passage. this gave them entrance to a large, square room that the candle but dimly lighted. the floor had a thick carpeting of dust, which partly muffled their footfalls. cobwebs were in the angles of the walls and depended from the ceiling like strips of rotting lace making undulatory movements in the disturbed air. the room had two windows in adjoining sides, but from neither could anything be seen except the rough inner surfaces of boards a few inches from the glass. there was no fireplace, no furniture; there was nothing: besides the cobwebs and the dust, the four men were the only objects there which were not a part of the structure. strange enough they looked in the yellow light of the candle. the one who had so reluctantly alighted was especially spectacular--he might have been called sensational. he was of middle age, heavily built, deep chested, and broad shouldered. looking at his figure, one would have said that he had a giant's strength; at his features, that he would use it like a giant. he was clean shaven, his hair rather closely cropped and gray. his low forehead was seamed with wrinkles above the eyes, and over the nose these became vertical. the heavy black brows followed the same law, saved from meeting only by an upward turn at what would otherwise have been the point of contact. deeply sunken beneath these, glowed in the obscure light a pair of eyes of uncertain color, but obviously enough too small. there was something forbidding in their expression, which was not bettered by the cruel mouth and wide jaw. the nose was well enough, as noses go; one does not expect much of noses. all that was sinister in the man's face seemed accentuated by an unnatural pallor--he appeared altogether bloodless. the appearance of the other men was sufficiently commonplace; they were such persons as one meets and forgets that he met. all were younger than the man described, between whom and the eldest of the others, who stood apart, there was apparently no kindly feeling. they avoided looking at each other. "gentlemen," said the man holding the candle and keys, "i believe everything is right. are you ready, mr. rosser?" the man standing apart from the group bowed and smiled. "and you, mr. grossmith?" the heavy man bowed and scowled. "you will be pleased to remove your outer clothing." their hats, coats, waistcoats, and neckwear were soon removed and thrown outside the door, in the passage. the man with the candle now nodded, and the fourth man--he who had urged grossmith to leave the wagon--produced from the pocket of his overcoat two long, murderous-looking bowie-knives, which he drew now from their leather scabbards. "they are exactly alike," he said, presenting one to each of the two principals--for by this time the dullest observer would have understood the nature of this meeting. it was to be a duel to the death. each combatant took a knife, examined it critically near the candle and tested the strength of the blade and handle across his lifted knee. their persons were then searched in turn, each by the second of the other. "if it is agreeable to you, mr. grossmith," said the man holding the light, "you will place yourself in that corner." he indicated the angle of the room farthest from the door, whither grossmith retired, his second parting from him with a grasp of the hand which had nothing of cordiality in it. in the angle nearest the door mr. rosser stationed himself, and after a whispered consultation his second left him, joining the other near the door. at that moment the candle was suddenly extinguished, leaving all in profound darkness. this may have been done by a draught from the opened door; whatever the cause, the effect was startling. "gentlemen," said a voice which sounded strangely unfamiliar in the altered condition affecting the relations of the senses--"gentlemen, you will not move until you hear the closing of the outer door." a sound of trampling ensued, then the closing of the inner door; and finally the outer one closed with a concussion which shook the entire building. a few minutes afterward a belated farmer's boy met a light wagon which was being driven furiously toward the town of marshall. he declared that behind the two figures on the front seat stood a third, with its hands upon the bowed shoulders of the others, who appeared to struggle vainly to free themselves from its grasp. this figure, unlike the others, was clad in white, and had undoubtedly boarded the wagon as it passed the haunted house. as the lad could boast a considerable former experience with the supernatural thereabouts his word had the weight justly due to the testimony of an expert. the story (in connection with the next day's events) eventually appeared in the _advance_, with some slight literary embellishments and a concluding intimation that the gentlemen referred to would be allowed the use of the paper's columns for their version of the night's adventure. but the privilege remained without a claimant. ii the events that led up to this "duel in the dark" were simple enough. one evening three young men of the town of marshall were sitting in a quiet corner of the porch of the village hotel, smoking and discussing such matters as three educated young men of a southern village would naturally find interesting. their names were king, sancher, and rosser. at a little distance, within easy hearing, but taking no part in the conversation, sat a fourth. he was a stranger to the others. they merely knew that on his arrival by the stage-coach that afternoon he had written in the hotel register the name of robert grossmith. he had not been observed to speak to anyone except the hotel clerk. he seemed, indeed, singularly fond of his own company--or, as the _personnel_ of the _advance_ expressed it, "grossly addicted to evil associations." but then it should be said in justice to the stranger that the _personnel_ was himself of a too convivial disposition fairly to judge one differently gifted, and had, moreover, experienced a slight rebuff in an effort at an "interview." "i hate any kind of deformity in a woman," said king, "whether natural or--acquired. i have a theory that any physical defect has its correlative mental and moral defect." "i infer, then," said rosser, gravely, "that a lady lacking the moral advantage of a nose would find the struggle to become mrs. king an arduous enterprise." "of course you may put it that way," was the reply; "but, seriously, i once threw over a most charming girl on learning quite accidentally that she had suffered amputation of a toe. my conduct was brutal if you like, but if i had married that girl i should have been miserable for life and should have made her so." "whereas," said sancher, with a light laugh, "by marrying a gentleman of more liberal view she escaped with a parted throat." "ah, you know to whom i refer. yes, she married manton, but i don't know about his liberality; i'm not sure but he cut her throat because he discovered that she lacked that excellent thing in woman, the middle toe of the right foot." "look at that chap!" said rosser in a low voice, his eyes fixed upon the stranger. that chap was obviously listening intently to the conversation. "damn his impudence!" muttered king--"what ought we to do?" "that's an easy one," rosser replied, rising. "sir," he continued, addressing the stranger, "i think it would be better if you would remove your chair to the other end of the veranda. the presence of gentlemen is evidently an unfamiliar situation to you." the man sprang to his feet and strode forward with clenched hands, his face white with rage. all were now standing. sancher stepped between the belligerents. "you are hasty and unjust," he said to rosser; "this gentleman has done nothing to deserve such language." but rosser would not withdraw a word. by the custom of the country and the time there could be but one outcome to the quarrel. "i demand the satisfaction due to a gentleman," said the stranger, who had become more calm. "i have not an acquaintance in this region. perhaps you, sir," bowing to sancher, "will be kind enough to represent me in this matter." sancher accepted the trust--somewhat reluctantly it must be confessed, for the man's appearance and manner were not at all to his liking. king, who during the colloquy had hardly removed his eyes from the stranger's face and had not spoken a word, consented with a nod to act for rosser, and the upshot of it was that, the principals having retired, a meeting was arranged for the next evening. the nature of the arrangements has been already disclosed. the duel with knives in a dark room was once a commoner feature of southwestern life than it is likely to be again. how thin a veneering of "chivalry" covered the essential brutality of the code under which such encounters were possible we shall see. iii in the blaze of a midsummer noonday the old manton house was hardly true to its traditions. it was of the earth, earthy. the sunshine caressed it warmly and affectionately, with evident disregard of its bad reputation. the grass greening all the expanse in its front seemed to grow, not rankly, but with a natural and joyous exuberance, and the weeds blossomed quite like plants. full of charming lights and shadows and populous with pleasant-voiced birds, the neglected shade trees no longer struggled to run away, but bent reverently beneath their burdens of sun and song. even in the glassless upper windows was an expression of peace and contentment, due to the light within. over the stony fields the visible heat danced with a lively tremor incompatible with the gravity which is an attribute of the supernatural. such was the aspect under which the place presented itself to sheriff adams and two other men who had come out from marshall to look at it. one of these men was mr. king, the sheriff's deputy; the other, whose name was brewer, was a brother of the late mrs. manton. under a beneficent law of the state relating to property which has been for a certain period abandoned by an owner whose residence cannot be ascertained, the sheriff was legal custodian of the manton farm and appurtenances thereunto belonging. his present visit was in mere perfunctory compliance with some order of a court in which mr. brewer had an action to get possession of the property as heir to his deceased sister. by a mere coincidence, the visit was made on the day after the night that deputy king had unlocked the house for another and very different purpose. his presence now was not of his own choosing: he had been ordered to accompany his superior, and at the moment could think of nothing more prudent than simulated alacrity in obedience to the command. carelessly opening the front door, which to his surprise was not locked, the sheriff was amazed to see, lying on the floor of the passage into which it opened, a confused heap of men's apparel. examination showed it to consist of two hats, and the same number of coats, waistcoats, and scarves all in a remarkably good state of preservation, albeit somewhat defiled by the dust in which they lay. mr. brewer was equally astonished, but mr. king's emotion is not of record. with a new and lively interest in his own actions the sheriff now unlatched and pushed open a door on the right, and the three entered. the room was apparently vacant--no; as their eyes became accustomed to the dimmer light something was visible in the farthest angle of the wall. it was a human figure--that of a man crouching close in the corner. something in the attitude made the intruders halt when they had barely passed the threshold. the figure more and more clearly defined itself. the man was upon one knee, his back in the angle of the wall, his shoulders elevated to the level of his ears, his hands before his face, palms outward, the fingers spread and crooked like claws; the white face turned upward on the retracted neck had an expression of unutterable fright, the mouth half open, the eyes incredibly expanded. he was stone dead. yet with the exception of a bowie-knife, which had evidently fallen from his own hand, not another object was in the room. in thick dust that covered the floor were some confused footprints near the door and along the wall through which it opened. along one of the adjoining walls, too, past the boarded-up windows was the trail made by the man himself in reaching his corner. instinctively in approaching the body the three men followed that trail. the sheriff grasped one of the outthrown arms; it was as rigid as iron, and the application of a gentle force rocked the entire body without altering the relation of its parts. brewer, pale with excitement, gazed intently into the distorted face. "god of mercy!" he suddenly cried, "it is manton!" "you are right," said king, with an evident attempt at calmness: "i knew manton. he then wore a full beard and his hair long, but this is he." he might have added: "i recognized him when he challenged rosser. i told rosser and sancher who he was before we played him this horrible trick. when rosser left this dark room at our heels, forgetting his outer clothing in the excitement, and driving away with us in his shirt sleeves--all through the discreditable proceedings we knew with whom we were dealing, murderer and coward that he was!" but nothing of this did mr. king say. with his better light he was trying to penetrate the mystery of the man's death. that he had not once moved from the corner where he had been stationed; that his posture was that of neither attack nor defense; that he had dropped his weapon; that he had obviously perished of sheer horror of something that he _saw_--these were circumstances which mr. king's disturbed intelligence could not rightly comprehend. groping in intellectual darkness for a clew to his maze of doubt, his gaze, directed mechanically downward in the way of one who ponders momentous matters, fell upon something which, there, in the light of day and in the presence of living companions, affected him with terror. in the dust of years that lay thick upon the floor--leading from the door by which they had entered, straight across the room to within a yard of manton's crouching corpse--were three parallel lines of footprints--light but definite impressions of bare feet, the outer ones those of small children, the inner a woman's. from the point at which they ended they did not return; they pointed all one way. brewer, who had observed them at the same moment, was leaning forward in an attitude of rapt attention, horribly pale. "look at that!" he cried, pointing with both hands at the nearest print of the woman's right foot, where she had apparently stopped and stood. "the middle toe is missing--it was gertrude!" gertrude was the late mrs. manton, sister to mr. brewer. the shell of sense by olivia howard dunbar from harper's magazine, december, <UNK> by permission of harper and brothers and olivia howard dunbar. it was intolerably unchanged, the dim, dark-toned room. in an agony of recognition my glance ran from one to another of the comfortable, familiar things that my earthly life had been passed among. incredibly distant from it all as i essentially was. i noted sharply that the very gaps that i myself had left in my bookshelves still stood unfilled; that the delicate fingers of the ferns that i had tended were still stretched futilely toward the light; that the soft agreeable chuckle of my own little clock, like some elderly woman with whom conversation has become automatic, was undiminished. unchanged--or so it seemed at first. but there were certain trivial differences that shortly smote me. the windows were closed too tightly; for i had always kept the house very cool, although i had known that theresa preferred warm rooms. and my work-basket was in disorder; it was preposterous that so small a thing should hurt me so. then, for this was my first experience of the shadow-folded transition, the odd alteration of my emotions bewildered me. for at one moment the place seemed so humanly familiar, so distinctly my own proper envelope, that for love of it i could have laid my cheek against the wall; while in the next i was miserably conscious of strange new shrillnesses. how could they be endured--and had i ever endured them?--those harsh influences that i now perceived at the window; light and color so blinding that they obscured the form of the wind, tumult so discordant that one could scarcely hear the roses open in the garden below? but theresa did not seem to mind any of these things. disorder, it is true, the dear child had never minded. she was sitting all this time at my desk--at _my_ desk--occupied, i could only too easily surmise how. in the light of my own habits of precision it was plain that that sombre correspondence should have been attended to before; but i believe that i did not really reproach theresa, for i knew that her notes, when she did write them, were perhaps less perfunctory than mine. she finished the last one as i watched her, and added it to the heap of black-bordered envelopes that lay on the desk. poor girl! i saw now that they had cost her tears. yet, living beside her day after day, year after year, i had never discovered what deep tenderness my sister possessed. toward each other it had been our habit to display only a temperate affection, and i remember having always thought it distinctly fortunate for theresa, since she was denied my happiness, that she could live so easily and pleasantly without emotions of the devastating sort.... and now, for the first time, i was really to behold her.... could it be theresa, after all, this tangle of subdued turbulences? let no one suppose that it is an easy thing to bear, the relentlessly lucid understanding that i then first exercised; or that, in its first enfranchisement, the timid vision does not yearn for its old screens and mists. suddenly, as theresa sat there, her head, filled with its tender thoughts of me, held in her gentle hands, i felt allan's step on the carpeted stair outside. theresa felt it, too,--but how? for it was not audible. she gave a start, swept the black envelopes out of sight, and pretended to be writing in a little book. then i forgot to watch her any longer in my absorption in allan's coming. it was he, of course, that i was awaiting. it was for him that i had made this first lonely, frightened effort to return, to recover.... it was not that i had supposed he would allow himself to recognize my presence, for i had long been sufficiently familiar with his hard and fast denials of the invisible. he was so reasonable always, so sane--so blindfolded. but i had hoped that because of his very rejection of the ether that now contained me i could perhaps all the more safely, the more secretly, watch him, linger near him. he was near now, very near,--but why did theresa, sitting there in the room that had never belonged to her, appropriate for herself his coming? it was so manifestly i who had drawn him, i whom he had come to seek. the door was ajar. he knocked softly at it "are you there, theresa?" he called. he expected to find her, then, there in my room? i shrank back, fearing, almost, to stay. "i shall have finished in a moment," theresa told him, and he sat down to wait for her. no spirit still unreleased can understand the pang that i felt with allan sitting almost within my touch. almost irresistibly the wish beset me to let him for an instant feel my nearness. then i checked myself, remembering--oh, absurd, piteous human fears!--that my too unguarded closeness might alarm him. it was not so remote a time that i myself had known them, those blind, uncouth timidities. i came, therefore, somewhat nearer--but i did not touch him. i merely leaned toward him and with incredible softness whispered his name. that much i could not have forborne; the spell of life was still too strong in me. but it gave him no comfort, no delight. "theresa!" he called, in a voice dreadful with alarm--and in that instant the last veil fell, and desperately, scarce believingly, i beheld how it stood between them, those two. she turned to him that gentle look of hers. "forgive me," came from him hoarsely. "but i had suddenly the most--unaccountable sensation. can there be too many windows open? there is such a--chill--about." "there are no windows open," theresa assured him. "i took care to shut out the chill. you are not well, allan!" "perhaps not." he embraced the suggestion. "and yet i feel no illness apart from this abominable sensation that persists--persists.... theresa, you must tell me: do i fancy it, or do you, too, feel--something--strange here?" "oh, there is something very strange here," she half sobbed. "there always will be." "good heavens, child, i didn't mean that!" he rose and stood looking about him. "i know, of course, that you have your beliefs, and i respect them, but you know equally well that i have nothing of the sort! so--don't let us conjure up anything inexplicable." i stayed impalpably, imponderably near him. wretched and bereft though i was, i could not have left him while he stood denying me. "what i mean," he went on, in his low, distinct voice, "is a special, an almost ominous sense of cold. upon my soul, theresa,"--he paused--"if i _were_ superstitious, if i _were_ a woman, i should probably imagine it to seem--a presence!" he spoke the last word very faintly, but theresa shrank from it nevertheless. "_don't_ say that, allan!" she cried out. "don't think it, i beg of you! i've tried so hard myself not to think it--and you must help me. you know it is only perturbed, uneasy spirits that wander. with her it is quite different. she has always been so happy--she must still be." i listened, stunned, to theresa's sweet dogmatism. from what blind distances came her confident misapprehensions, how dense, both for her and for allan, was the separating vapor! allan frowned. "don't take me literally, theresa," he explained; and i, who a moment before had almost touched him, now held myself aloof and heard him with a strange untried pity, new born in me. "i'm not speaking of what you call--spirits. it's something much more terrible." he allowed his head to sink heavily on his chest. "if i did not positively know that i had never done her any harm, i should suppose myself to be suffering from guilt, from remorse.... theresa, you know better than i, perhaps. was she content, always? did she believe in me?" "believe in you?--when she knew you to be so good!--when you adored her!" "she thought that? she said it? then what in heaven's name ails me?--unless it is all as you believe, theresa, and she knows now what she didn't know then, poor dear, and minds----" "minds what? what do you mean, allan?" i, who with my perhaps illegitimate advantage saw so clear, knew that he had not meant to tell her: i did him that justice, even in my first jealousy. if i had not tortured him so by clinging near him, he would not have told her. but the moment came, and overflowed, and he did tell her--passionate, tumultuous story that it was. during all our life together, allan's and mine, he had spared me, had kept me wrapped in the white cloak of an unblemished loyalty. but it would have been kinder, i now bitterly thought, if, like many husbands, he had years ago found for the story he now poured forth some clandestine listener; i should not have known. but he was faithful and good, and so he waited till i, mute and chained, was there to hear him. so well did i know him, as i thought, so thoroughly had he once been mine, that i saw it in his eyes, heard it in his voice, before the words came. and yet, when it came, it lashed me with the whips of an unbearable humiliation. for i, his wife, had not known how greatly he could love. and that theresa, soft little traitor, should, in her still way, have cared too! where was the iron in her, i moaned within my stricken spirit, where the steadfastness? from the moment he bade her, she turned her soft little petals up to him--and my last delusion was spent. it was intolerable; and none the less so that in another moment she had, prompted by some belated thought of me, renounced him. allan was hers, yet she put him from her; and it was my part to watch them both. then in the anguish of it all i remembered, awkward, untutored spirit that i was, that i now had the great recourse. whatever human things were unbearable, i had no need to bear. i ceased, therefore, to make the effort that kept me with them. the pitiless poignancy was dulled, the sounds and the light ceased, the lovers faded from me, and again i was mercifully drawn into the dim, infinite spaces. * * * * * there followed a period whose length i cannot measure and during which i was able to make no progress in the difficult, dizzying experience of release. "earth-bound" my jealousy relentlessly kept me. though my two dear ones had forsworn each other, i could not trust them, for theirs seemed to me an affectation of a more than mortal magnanimity. without a ghostly sentinel to prick them with sharp fears and recollections, who could believe that they would keep to it? of the efficacy of my own vigilance, so long as i might choose to exercise it, i could have no doubt, for i had by this time come to have a dreadful exultation in the new power that lived in me. repeated delicate experiment had taught me how a touch or a breath, a wish or a whisper, could control allan's acts, could keep him from theresa. i could manifest myself as palely, as transiently, as a thought. i could produce the merest necessary flicker, like the shadow of a just-opened leaf, on his trembling, tortured consciousness. and these unrealized perceptions of me he interpreted, as i had known that he would, as his soul's inevitable penance. he had come to believe that he had done evil in silently loving theresa all these years, and it was my vengeance to allow him to believe this, to prod him ever to believe it afresh. i am conscious that this frame of mind was not continuous in me. for i remember, too, that when allan and theresa were safely apart and sufficiently miserable i loved them as dearly as i ever had, more dearly perhaps. for it was impossible that i should not perceive, in my new emancipation, that they were, each of them, something more and greater than the two beings i had once ignorantly pictured them. for years they had practiced a selflessness of which i could once scarcely have conceived, and which even now i could only admire without entering into its mystery. while i had lived solely for myself, these two divine creatures had lived exquisitely for me. they had granted me everything, themselves nothing. for my undeserving sake their lives had been a constant torment of renunciation--a torment they had not sought to alleviate by the exchange of a single glance of understanding. there were even marvelous moments when, from the depths of my newly informed heart, i pitied them--poor creatures, who, withheld from the infinite solaces that i had come to know, were still utterly within that shell of sense so frail, so piteously contrived for pain. within it, yes; yet exercising qualities that so sublimely transcended it. yet the shy, hesitating compassion that thus had birth in me was far from being able to defeat the earlier, earthlier emotion. the two, i recognized, were in a sort of conflict; and i, regarding it, assumed that the conflict would never end; that for years, as allan and theresa reckoned time, i should be obliged to withhold myself from the great spaces and linger suffering, grudging, shamed, where they lingered. * * * * * it can never have been explained, i suppose, what, to devitalized perception such as mine, the contact of mortal beings with each other appears to be. once to have exercised this sense-freed perception is to realize that the gift of prophecy, although the subject of such frequent marvel, is no longer mysterious. the merest glance of our sensitive and uncloyed vision can detect the strength of the relation between two beings, and therefore instantly calculate its duration. if you see a heavy weight suspended from a slender string, you can know, without any wizardry, that in a few moments the string will snap; well, such, if you admit the analogy, is prophecy, is foreknowledge. and it was thus that i saw it with theresa and allan. for it was perfectly visible to me that they would very little longer have the strength to preserve, near each other, the denuded impersonal relation that they, and that i, behind them, insisted on; and that they would have to separate. it was my sister, perhaps the more sensitive, who first realized this. it had now become possible for me to observe them almost constantly, the effort necessary to visit them had so greatly diminished; so that i watched her, poor, anguished girl, prepare to leave him. i saw each reluctant movement that she made. i saw her eyes, worn from self-searching; i heard her step grown timid from inexplicable fears; i entered her very heart and heard its pitiful, wild beating. and still i did not interfere. for at this time i had a wonderful, almost demoniacal sense of disposing of matters to suit my own selfish will. at any moment i could have checked their miseries, could have restored happiness and peace. yet it gave me, and i could weep to admit it, a monstrous joy to know that theresa thought she was leaving allan of her own free intention, when it was i who was contriving, arranging, insisting.... and yet she wretchedly felt my presence near her; i am certain of that. a few days before the time of her intended departure my sister told allan that she must speak with him after dinner. our beautiful old house branched out from a circular hall with great arched doors at either end; and it was through the rear doorway that always in summer, after dinner, we passed out into the garden adjoining. as usual, therefore, when the hour came, theresa led the way. that dreadful daytime brilliance that in my present state i found so hard to endure was now becoming softer. a delicate, capricious twilight breeze danced inconsequently through languidly whispering leaves. lovely pale flowers blossomed like little moons in the dusk, and over them the breath of mignonette hung heavily. it was a perfect place--and it had so long been ours, allan's and mine. it made me restless and a little wicked that those two should be there together now. for a little they walked about together, speaking of common, daily things. then suddenly theresa burst out: "i am going away, allan. i have stayed to do everything that needed to be done. now your mother will be here to care for you, and it is time for me to go." he stared at her and stood still. theresa had been there so long, she so definitely, to his mind, belonged there. and she was, as i also had jealously known, so lovely there, the small, dark, dainty creature, in the old hall, on the wide staircases, in the garden.... life there without theresa, even the intentionally remote, the perpetually renounced theresa--he had not dreamed of it, he could not, so suddenly, conceive of it. "sit here," he said, and drew her down beside him on a bench, "and tell me what it means, why you are going. is it because of something that i have been--have done?" she hesitated. i wondered if she would dare tell him. she looked out and away from him, and he waited long for her to speak. the pale stars were sliding into their places. the whispering of the leaves was almost hushed. all about them it was still and shadowy and sweet. it was that wonderful moment when, for lack of a visible horizon, the not yet darkened world seems infinitely greater--a moment when anything can happen, anything be believed in. to me, watching, listening, hovering, there came a dreadful purpose and a dreadful courage. suppose for one moment, theresa should not only feel, but _see_ me--would she dare to tell him then? there came a brief space of terrible effort, all my fluttering, uncertain forces strained to the utmost. the instant of my struggle was endlessly long and the transition seemed to take place outside me--as one sitting in a train, motionless, sees the leagues of earth float by. and then, in a bright, terrible flash i knew i had achieved it--i had _attained visibility_. shuddering, insubstantial, but luminously apparent, i stood there before them. and for the instant that i maintained the visible state i looked straight into theresa's soul. she gave a cry. and then, thing of silly, cruel impulses that i was, i saw what i had done. the very thing that i wished to avert i had precipitated. for allan, in his sudden terror and pity, had bent and caught her in his arms. for the first time they were together; and it was i who had brought them. then, to his whispered urging to tell the reason of her cry, theresa said: "frances was here. you did not see her, standing there, under the lilacs, with no smile on her face?" "my dear, my dear!" was all that allan said. i had so long now lived invisibly with them, he knew that she was right. "i suppose you know what it means?" she asked him, calmly. "dear theresa," allan said, slowly, "if you and i should go away somewhere, could we not evade all this ghostliness? and will you come with me?" "distance would not banish her," my sister confidently asserted. and then she said, softly: "have you thought what a lonely, awesome thing it must be to be so newly dead? pity her, allan. we who are warm and alive should pity her. she loves you still,--that is the meaning of it all, you know--and she wants us to understand that for that reason we must keep apart. oh, it was so plain in her white face as she stood there. and you did not see her?" "it was your face that i saw," allan solemnly told her--oh, how different he had grown from the allan that i had known!--"and yours is the only face that i shall ever see." and again he drew her to him. she sprang from him. "you are defying her, allan!" she cried. "and you must not. it is her right to keep us apart, if she wishes. it must be as she insists. i shall go, as i told you. and, allan, i beg of you, leave me the courage to do as she demands!" they stood facing each other in the deep dusk, and the wounds that i had dealt them gaped red and accusing. "we must pity her," theresa had said. and as i remembered that extraordinary speech, and saw the agony in her face, and the greater agony in allan's, there came the great irreparable cleavage between mortality and me. in a swift, merciful flame the last of my mortal emotions--gross and tenacious they must have been--was consumed. my cold grasp of allan loosened and a new unearthly love of him bloomed in my heart. i was now, however, in a difficulty with which my experience in the newer state was scarcely sufficient to deal. how could i make it plain to allan and theresa that i wished to bring them together, to heal the wounds that i had made? pityingly, remorsefully, i lingered near them all that night and the next day. and by that time had brought myself to the point of a great determination. in the little time that was left, before theresa should be gone and allan bereft and desolate, i saw the one way that lay open to me to convince them of my acquiescence in their destiny. in the deepest darkness and silence of the next night i made a greater effort than it will ever be necessary for me to make again. when they think of me, allan and theresa, i pray now that they will recall what i did that night, and that my thousand frustrations and selfishnesses may shrivel and be blown from their indulgent memories. yet the following morning, as she had planned, theresa appeared at breakfast dressed for her journey. above in her room there were the sounds of departure. they spoke little during the brief meal, but when it was ended allan said: "theresa, there is half an hour before you go. will you come upstairs with me? i had a dream that i must tell you of." "allan!" she looked at him, frightened, but went with him. "it was of frances you dreamed," she said, quietly, as they entered the library together. "did i say it was a dream? but i was awake--thoroughly awake. i had not been sleeping well, and i heard, twice, the striking of the clock. and as i lay there, looking out at the stars, and thinking--thinking of you, theresa,--she came to me, stood there before me, in my room. it was no sheeted specter, you understand; it was frances, literally she. in some inexplicable fashion i seemed to be aware that she wanted to make me know something, and i waited, watching her face. after a few moments it came. she did not speak, precisely. that is, i am sure i heard no sound. yet the words that came from her were definite enough. she said: 'don't let theresa leave you. take her and keep her.' then she went away. was that a dream?" "i had not meant to tell you," theresa eagerly answered, "but now i must. it is too wonderful. what time did your clock strike, allan?" "one, the last time." "yes; it was then that i awoke. and she had been with me. i had not seen her, but her arm had been about me and her kiss was on my cheek. oh. i knew; it was unmistakable. and the sound of her voice was with me." "then she bade you, too----" "yes, to stay with you. i am glad we told each other." she smiled tearfully and began to fasten her wrap. "but you are not going--_now!_" allan cried. "you know that you cannot, now that she has asked you to stay." "then you believe, as i do, that it was she?" theresa demanded. "i can never understand, but i know," he answered her. "and now you will not go?" * * * * * i am freed. there will be no further semblance of me in my old home, no sound of my voice, no dimmest echo of my earthly self. they have no further need of me, the two that i have brought together. theirs is the fullest joy that the dwellers in the shell of sense can know. mine is the transcendent joy of the unseen spaces. the woman at seven brothers by wilbur daniel steele from _land's end_, by wilbur daniel steele. copyright, <UNK> by harper and brothers. by permission of the publishers and wilbur daniel steele. i tell you sir, i was innocent. i didn't know any more about the world at twenty-two than some do at twelve. my uncle and aunt in duxbury brought me up strict; i studied hard in high school, i worked hard after hours, and i went to church twice on sundays, and i can't see it's right to put me in a place like this, with crazy people. oh yes, i know they're crazy--you can't tell _me._ as for what they said in court about finding her with her husband, that's the inspector's lie, sir, because he's down on me, and wants to make it look like my fault. no, sir, i can't say as i thought she was handsome--not at first. for one thing, her lips were too thin and white, and her color was bad. i'll tell you a fact, sir; that first day i came off to the light i was sitting on my cot in the store-room (that's where the assistant keeper sleeps at the seven brothers), as lonesome as i could be, away from home for the first time, and the water all around me, and, even though it was a calm day, pounding enough on the ledge to send a kind of a _woom-woom-woom_ whining up through all that solid rock of the tower. and when old fedderson poked his head down from the living-room with the sunshine above making a kind of bright frame around his hair and whiskers, to give me a cheery, "make yourself to home, son!" i remember i said to myself: "_he's_ all right. i'll get along with _him_. but his wife's enough to sour milk." that was queer, because she was so much under him in age--'long about twenty-eight or so, and him nearer fifty. but that's what i said, sir. of course that feeling wore off, same as any feeling will wear off sooner or later in a place like the seven brothers. cooped up in a place like that you come to know folks so well that you forget what they _do_ look like. there was a long time i never noticed her, any more than you'd notice the cat. we used to sit of an evening around the table, as if you were fedderson there, and me here, and her somewhere back there, in the rocker, knitting. fedderson would be working on his jacob's-ladder, and i'd be reading. he'd been working on that jacob's-ladder a year, i guess, and every time the inspector came off with the tender he was so astonished to see how good that ladder was that the old man would go to work and make it better. that's all he lived for. if i was reading, as i say, i daren't take my eyes off the book, or fedderson had me. and then he'd begin--what the inspector said about him. how surprised the member of the board had been, that time, to see everything so clean about the light. what the inspector had said about fedderson's being stuck here in a second-class light--best keeper on the coast. and so on and so on, till either he or i had to go aloft and have a look at the wicks. he'd been there twenty-three years, all told, and he'd got used to the feeling that he was kept down unfair--so used to it, i guess, that he fed on it, and told himself how folks ashore would talk when he was dead and gone--best keeper on the coast--kept down unfair. not that he said that to me. no, he was far too loyal and humble and respectful, doing his duty without complaint, as anybody could see. and all that time, night after night, hardly ever a word out of the woman. as i remember it, she seemed more like a piece of furniture than anything else--not even a very good cook, nor over and above tidy. one day, when he and i were trimming the lamp, he passed the remark that his _first_ wife used to dust the lens and take a pride in it. not that he said a word against anna, though. he never said a word against any living mortal; he was too upright. i don't know how it came about; or, rather, i _do_ know, but it was so sudden, and so far away from my thoughts, that it shocked me, like the world turned over. it was at prayers. that night i remember fedderson was uncommon long-winded. we'd had a batch of newspapers out by the tender, and at such times the old man always made a long watch of it, getting the world straightened out. for one thing, the united states minister to turkey was dead. well, from him and his soul, fedderson got on to turkey and the presbyterian college there, and from that to heathen in general. he rambled on and on, like the surf on the ledge, _woom-woom-woom_, never coming to an end. you know how you'll be at prayers sometimes. my mind strayed. i counted the canes in the chair-seat where i was kneeling; i plaited a corner of the table-cloth between my fingers for a spell, and by and by my eyes went wandering up the back of the chair. the woman, sir, was looking at me. her chair was back to mine, close, and both our heads were down in the shadow under the edge of the table, with fedderson clear over on the other side by the stove. and there were her two eyes hunting mine between the spindles in the shadow. you won't believe me, sir, but i tell you i felt like jumping to my feet and running out of the room--it was so queer. i don't know what her husband was praying about after that. his voice didn't mean anything, no more than the seas on the ledge away down there. i went to work to count the canes in the seat again, but all my eyes were in the top of my head. it got so i couldn't stand it. we were at the lord's prayer, saying it singsong together, when i had to look up again. and there her two eyes were, between the spindles, hunting mine. just then all of us were saying, "forgive us our trespasses--" i thought of it afterward. when we got up she was turned the other way, but i couldn't help seeing her cheeks were red. it was terrible. i wondered if fedderson would notice, though i might have known he wouldn't--not him. he was in too much of a hurry to get at his jacob's-ladder, and then he had to tell me for the tenth time what the inspector'd said that day about getting him another light--kingdom come, maybe, he said. i made some excuse or other and got away. once in the store-room, i sat down on my cot and stayed there a long time, feeling queerer than anything. i read a chapter in the bible, i don't know why. after i'd got my boots off i sat with them in my hands for as much as an hour, i guess, staring at the oil-tank and its lopsided shadow on the wall. i tell you, sir, i was shocked. i was only twenty-two remember, and i was shocked and horrified. and when i did turn in, finally, i didn't sleep at all well. two or three times i came to, sitting straight up in bed. once i got up and opened the outer door to have a look. the water was like glass, dim, without a breath of wind, and the moon just going down. over on the black shore i made out two lights in a village, like a pair of eyes watching. lonely? my, yes! lonely and nervous. i had a horror of her, sir. the dinghy-boat hung on its davits just there in front of the door, and for a minute i had an awful hankering to climb into it, lower away, and row off, no matter where. it sounds foolish. well, it seemed foolish next morning, with the sun shining and everything as usual--fedderson sucking his pen and wagging his head over his eternal "log," and his wife down in the rocker with her head in the newspaper, and her breakfast work still waiting. i guess that jarred it out of me more than anything else--sight of her slouched down there, with her stringy, yellow hair and her dusty apron and the pale back of her neck, reading the society notes. _society notes_! think of it! for the first time since i came to seven brothers i wanted to laugh. i guess i did laugh when i went aloft to clean the lamp and found everything so free and breezy, gulls flying high and little whitecaps making under a westerly. it was like feeling a big load dropped off your shoulders. fedderson came up with his dust-rag and cocked his head at me. "what's the matter, ray?" said he. "nothing," said i. and then i couldn't help it. "seems kind of out of place for society notes," said i, "out here at seven brothers." he was the other side of the lens, and when he looked at me he had a thousand eyes, all sober. for a minute i thought he was going on dusting, but then he came out and sat down on a sill. "sometimes," said he, "i get to thinking it may be a mite dull for her out here. she's pretty young, ray. not much more'n a girl, hardly." "not much more'n a _girl!_" it gave me a turn, sir, as though i'd seen my aunt in short dresses. "it's a good home for her, though," he went on slow. "i've seen a lot worse ashore, ray. of course if i could get a shore light----" "kingdom come's a shore light." he looked at me out of his deep-set eyes, and then he turned them around the light-room, where he'd been so long. "no," said he, wagging his head. "it ain't for such as me." i never saw so humble a man. "but look here," he went on, more cheerful. "as i was telling her just now, a month from yesterday's our fourth anniversary, and i'm going to take her ashore for the day and give her a holiday--new hat and everything. a girl wants a mite of excitement now and then, ray." there it was again, that "girl." it gave me the fidgets, sir. i had to do something about it. it's close quarters for last names in a light, and i'd taken to calling him uncle matt soon after i came. now, when i was at table that noon i spoke over to where she was standing by the stove, getting him another help of chowder. "i guess i'll have some, too, _aunt_ anna," said i, matter of fact. she never said a word nor gave a sign--just stood there kind of round-shouldered, dipping the chowder. and that night at prayers i hitched my chair around the table, with its back the other way. you get awful lazy in a lighthouse, some ways. no matter how much tinkering you've got, there's still a lot of time and there's such a thing as too much reading. the changes in weather get monotonous, too, by and by; the light burns the same on a thick night as it does on a fair one. of course there's the ships, north-bound, south-bound--wind-jammers, freighters, passenger-boats full of people. in the watches at night you can see their lights go by, and wonder what they are, how they're laden, where they'll fetch up, and all. i used to do that almost every evening when it was my first watch, sitting out on the walk-around up there with my legs hanging over the edge and my chin propped on the railing--lazy. the boston boat was the prettiest to see, with her three tiers of port-holes lit, like a string of pearls wrapped round and round a woman's neck--well away, too, for the ledge must have made a couple of hundred fathoms off the light, like a white dog-tooth of a breaker, even on the darkest night. well, i was lolling there one night, as i say, watching the boston boat go by, not thinking of anything special, when i heard the door on the other side of the tower open and footsteps coming around to me. by and by i nodded toward the boat and passed the remark that she was fetching in uncommon close to-night. no answer. i made nothing of that, for oftentimes fedderson wouldn't answer, and after i'd watched the lights crawling on through the dark a spell, just to make conversation i said i guessed there'd be a bit of weather before long. "i've noticed," said i, "when there's weather coming on, and the wind in the northeast, you can hear the orchestra playing aboard of her just over there. i make it out now. do you?" "yes. oh--yes--! _i hear it all right!_" you can imagine i started. it wasn't him, but _her_. and there was something in the way she said that speech, sir--something--well--unnatural. like a hungry animal snapping at a person's hand. i turned and looked at her sidewise. she was standing by the railing, leaning a little outward, the top of her from the waist picked out bright by the lens behind her. i didn't know what in the world to say, and yet i had a feeling i ought not to sit there mum. "i wonder," said i, "what that captain's thinking of, fetching in so handy to-night. it's no way. i tell you, if 'twasn't for this light, she'd go to work and pile up on the ledge some thick night----" she turned at that and stared straight into the lens. i didn't like the look of her face. somehow, with its edges cut hard all around and its two eyes closed down to slits, like a cat's, it made a kind of mask. "and then," i went on, uneasy enough--"and then where'd all their music be of a sudden, and their goings-on and their singing----" "and dancing!" she clipped me off so quick it took my breath. "d-d-dancing?" said i. "that's dance-music," said she. she was looking at the boat again. "how do you know?" i felt i had to keep on talking. well, sir--she laughed. i looked at her. she had on a shawl of some stuff or other that shined in the light; she had it pulled tight around her with her two hands in front at her breast, and i saw her shoulders swaying in tune. "how do i _know_?" she cried. then she laughed again, the same kind of a laugh. it was queer, sir, to see her, and to hear her. she turned, as quick as that, and leaned toward me. "don't you know how to dance, ray?" said she. "n-no," i managed, and i was going to say "_aunt anna_," but the thing choked in my throat. i tell you she was looking square at me all the time with her two eyes and moving with the music as if she didn't know it. by heavens, sir, it came over me of a sudden that she wasn't so bad-looking, after all. i guess i must have sounded like a fool. "you--you see," said i, "she's cleared the rip there now, and the music's gone. you--you hear?" "yes," said she, turning back slow. "that's where it stops every night--night after night--it stops just there--at the rip." when she spoke again her voice was different. i never heard the like of it, thin and taut as a thread. it made me shiver, sir. "i hate 'em!" that's what she said. "i hate 'em all. i'd like to see 'em dead. i'd love to see 'em torn apart on the rocks, night after night. i could bathe my hands in their blood, night after night." and do you know, sir, i saw it with my own eyes, her hands moving in each other above the rail. but it was her voice, though. i didn't know what to do, or what to say, so i poked my head through the railing and looked down at the water. i don't think i'm a coward, sir, but it was like a cold--ice-cold--hand, taking hold of my beating heart. when i looked up finally, she was gone. by and by i went in and had a look at the lamp, hardly knowing what i was about. then, seeing by my watch it was time for the old man to come on duty, i started to go below. in the seven brothers, you understand, the stair goes down in a spiral through a well against the south wall and first there's the door to the keeper's room and then you come to another, and that's the living-room, and then down to the store-room. and at night, if you don't carry a lantern, it's as black as the pit. well, down i went, sliding my hand along the rail, and as usual i stopped to give a rap on the keeper's door, in case he was taking a nap after supper. sometimes he did. i stood there, blind as a bat, with my mind still up on the walk-around. there was no answer to my knock. i hadn't expected any. just from habit, and with my right foot already hanging down for the next step, i reached out to give the door one more tap for luck. do you know, sir, my hand didn't fetch up on anything. the door had been there a second before, and now the door wasn't there. my hand just went on going through the dark, on and on, and i didn't seem to have sense or power enough to stop it. there didn't seem any air in the well to breathe, and my ears were drumming to the surf--that's how scared i was. and then my hand touched the flesh of a face, and something in the dark said, "oh!" no louder than a sigh. next thing i knew, sir, i was down in the living-room, warm and yellow-lit, with fedderson cocking his head at me across the table, where he was at that eternal jacob's-ladder of his. "what's the matter, ray?" said he. "lord's sake, ray!" "nothing," said i. then i think i told him i was sick. that night i wrote a letter to a.l. peters, the grain-dealer in duxbury, asking for a job--even though it wouldn't go ashore for a couple of weeks, just the writing of it made me feel better. it's hard to tell you how those two weeks went by. i don't know why, but i felt like hiding in a corner all the time. i had to come to meals, but i didn't look at her, though, not once, unless it was by accident. fedderson thought i was still ailing and nagged me to death with advice and so on. one thing i took care not to do, i can tell you, and that was to knock on his door till i'd made certain he wasn't below in the living-room--though i was tempted to. yes, sir; that's a queer thing, and i wouldn't tell you if i hadn't set out to give you the truth. night after night, stopping there on the landing in that black pit, the air gone out of my lungs and the surf drumming in my ears and sweat standing cold on my neck--and one hand lifting up in the air--god forgive me, sir! maybe i did wrong not to look at her more, drooping about her work in her gingham apron, with her hair stringing. when the inspector came off with the tender, that time, i told him i was through. that's when he took the dislike to me, i guess, for he looked at me kind of sneering and said, soft as i was, i'd have to put up with it till next relief. and then, said he, there'd be a whole house-cleaning at seven brothers, because he'd gotten fedderson the berth at kingdom come. and with that he slapped the old man on the back. i wish you could have seen fedderson, sir. he sat down on my cot as if his knees had given 'way. happy? you'd think he'd be happy, with all his dreams come true. yes, he was happy, beaming all over--for a minute. then, sir, he began to shrivel up. it was like seeing a man cut down in his prime before your eyes. he began to wag his head. "no," said he. "no, no; it's not for such as me. i'm good enough for seven brothers, and that's all, mr. bayliss. that's all." and for all the inspector could say, that's what he stuck to. he'd figured himself a martyr so many years, nursed that injustice like a mother with her first-born, sir; and now in his old age, so to speak, they weren't to rob him of it. fedderson was going to wear out his life in a second-class light, and folks would talk--that was his idea. i heard him hailing down as the tender was casting off: "see you to-morrow, mr. bayliss. yep. coming ashore with the wife for a spree. anniversary. yep." but he didn't sound much like a spree. they _had_, robbed him, partly, after all. i wondered what _she_ thought about it. i didn't know till night. she didn't show up to supper, which fedderson and i got ourselves--had a headache, be said. it was my early watch. i went and lit up and came back to read a spell. he was finishing off the jacob's-ladder, and thoughtful, like a man that's lost a treasure. once or twice i caught him looking about the room on the sly. it was pathetic, sir. going up the second time, i stepped out on the walk-around to have a look at things. she was there on the seaward side, wrapped in that silky thing. a fair sea was running across the ledge and it was coming on a little thick--not too thick. off to the right the boston boat was blowing, _whroom-whroom!_ creeping up on us, quarter-speed. there was another fellow behind her, and a fisherman's conch farther offshore. i don't know why, but i stopped beside her and leaned on the rail. she didn't appear to notice me, one way or another. we stood and we stood, listening to the whistles, and the longer we stood the more it got on my nerves, her not noticing me. i suppose she'd been too much on my mind lately. i began to be put out. i scraped my feet. i coughed. by and by i said out loud: "look here, i guess i better get out the fog-horn and give those fellows a toot." "why?" said she, without moving her head--calm as that. "_why?_" it gave me a turn, sir. for a minute i stared at her. "why? because if she don't pick up this light before very many minutes she'll be too close in to wear--tide'll have her on the rocks--that's why!" i couldn't see her face, but i could see one of her silk shoulders lift a little, like a shrug. and there i kept on staring at her, a dumb one, sure enough. i know what brought me to was hearing the boston boat's three sharp toots as she picked up the light--mad as anything--and swung her helm a-port. i turned away from her, sweat stringing down my face, and walked around to the door. it was just as well, too, for the feed-pipe was plugged in the lamp and the wicks were popping. she'd have been out in another five minutes, sir. when i'd finished, i saw that woman standing in the doorway. her eyes were bright. i had a horror of her, sir, a living horror. "if only the light had been out," said she, low and sweet. "god forgive you," said i. "you don't know what you're saying." she went down the stair into the well, winding out of sight, and as long as i could see her, her eyes were watching mine. when i went, myself, after a few minutes, she was waiting for me on that first landing, standing still in the dark. she took hold of my hand, though i tried to get it away. "good-by," said she in my ear. "good-by?" said i. i didn't understand. "you heard what he said to-day--about kingdom come? be it so--on his own head. i'll never come back here. once i set foot ashore--i've got friends in brightonboro, ray." i got away from her and started on down. but i stopped. "brightonboro?" i whispered back. "why do you tell _me_?" my throat was raw to the words, like a sore. "so you'd know," said she. well, sir, i saw them off next morning, down that new jacob's-ladder into the dinghy-boat, her in a dress of blue velvet and him in his best cutaway and derby--rowing away, smaller and smaller, the two of them. and then i went back and sat on my cot, leaving the door open and the ladder still hanging down the wall, along with the boat-falls. i don't know whether it was relief, or what. i suppose i must have been worked up even more than i'd thought those past weeks, for now it was all over i was like a rag. i got down on my knees, sir, and prayed to god for the salvation of my soul, and when i got up and climbed to the living-room it was half past twelve by the clock. there was rain on the windows and the sea was running blue-black under the sun. i'd sat there all that time not knowing there was a squall. it was funny; the glass stood high, but those black squalls kept coming and going all afternoon, while i was at work up in the light-room. and i worked hard, to keep myself busy. first thing i knew it was five, and no sign of the boat yet. it began to get dim and kind of purplish-gray over the land. the sun was down. i lit up, made everything snug, and got out the night-glasses to have another look for that boat. he'd said he intended to get back before five. no sign. and then, standing there, it came over me that of course he wouldn't be coming off--he'd be hunting _her_, poor old fool. it looked like i had to stand two men's watches that night. never mind. i felt like myself again, even if i hadn't had any dinner or supper. pride came to me that night on the walk-around, watching the boats go by--little boats, big boats, the boston boat with all her pearls and her dance-music. they couldn't see me; they didn't know who i was; but to the last of them, they depended on _me_. they say a man must be born again. well, i was born again. i breathed deep in the wind. dawn broke hard and red as a dying coal. i put out the light and started to go below. born again; yes, sir. i felt so good i whistled in the well, and when i came to the first door on the stair i reached out in the dark to give it a rap for luck. and then, sir, the hair prickled all over my scalp, when i found my hand just going on and on through the air, the same as it had gone once before, and all of a sudden i wanted to yell, because i thought i was going to touch flesh. it's funny what their just forgetting to close their door did to me, isn't it? well, i reached for the latch and pulled it to with a bang and ran down as if a ghost was after me. i got up some coffee and bread and bacon for breakfast. i drank the coffee. but somehow i couldn't eat, all along of that open door. the light in the room was blood. i got to thinking. i thought how she'd talked about those men, women, and children on the rocks, and how she'd made to bathe her hands over the rail. i almost jumped out of my chair then; it seemed for a wink she was there beside the stove watching me with that queer half-smile--really, i seemed to see her for a flash across the red table-cloth in the red light of dawn. "look here!" said i to myself, sharp enough; and then i gave myself a good laugh and went below. there i took a look out of the door, which was still open, with the ladder hanging down. i made sure to see the poor old fool come pulling around the point before very long now. my boots were hurting a little, and, taking them off, i lay down on the cot to rest, and somehow i went to sleep. i had horrible dreams. i saw her again standing in that blood-red kitchen, and she seemed to be washing her hands, and the surf on the ledge was whining up the tower, louder and louder all the time, and what it whined was, "night after night--night after night." what woke me was cold water in my face. the store-room was in gloom. that scared me at first; i thought night had come, and remembered the light. but then i saw the gloom was of a storm. the floor was shining wet, and the water in my face was spray, flung up through the open door. when i ran to close it, it almost made me dizzy to see the gray-and-white breakers marching past. the land was gone; the sky shut down heavy overhead; there was a piece of wreckage on the back of a swell, and the jacob's-ladder was carried clean away. how that sea had picked up so quick i can't think. i looked at my watch and it wasn't four in the afternoon yet. when i closed the door, sir, it was almost dark in the store-room. i'd never been in the light before in a gale of wind. i wondered why i was shivering so, till i found it was the floor below me shivering, and the walls and stair. horrible crunchings and grindings ran away up the tower, and now and then there was a great thud somewhere, like a cannon-shot in a cave. i tell you, sir, i was alone, and i was in a mortal fright for a minute or so. and yet i had to get myself together. there was the light up there not tended to, and an early dark coming on and a heavy night and all, and i had to go. and i had to pass that door. you'll say it's foolish, sir, and maybe it _was_ foolish. maybe it was because i hadn't eaten. but i began thinking of that door up there the minute i set foot on the stair, and all the way up through that howling dark well i dreaded to pass it. i told myself i wouldn't stop. i didn't stop. i felt the landing underfoot and i went on, four steps, five--and then i couldn't. i turned and went back. i put out my hand and it went on into nothing. that door, sir, was open again. i left it be; i went on up to the light-room and set to work. it was bedlam there, sir, screeching bedlam, but i took no notice. i kept my eyes down. i trimmed those seven wicks, sir, as neat as ever they were trimmed; i polished the brass till it shone, and i dusted the lens. it wasn't till that was done that i let myself look back to see who it was standing there, half out of sight in the well. it was her, sir. "where'd you come from?" i asked. i remember my voice was sharp. "up jacob's-ladder," said she, and hers was like the syrup of flowers. i shook my head. i was savage, sir. "the ladder's carried away." "i cast it off," said she, with a smile. "then," said i, "you must have come while i was asleep." another thought came on me heavy as a ton of lead. "and where's _he_?" said i. "where's the boat?" "he's drowned," said she, as easy as that. "and i let the boat go adrift. you wouldn't hear me when i called." "but look here," said i. "if you came through the store-room, why didn't you wake me up? tell me that!" it sounds foolish enough, me standing like a lawyer in court, trying to prove she _couldn't_ be there. she didn't answer for a moment. i guess she sighed, though i couldn't hear for the gale, and her eyes grew soft, sir, so soft. "i couldn't," said she. "you looked so peaceful--dear one." my cheeks and neck went hot, sir, as if a warm iron was laid on them. i didn't know what to say. i began to stammer, "what do you mean--" but she was going back down the stair, out of sight. my god sir, and i used not to think she was good-looking! i started to follow her. i wanted to know what she meant. then i said to myself, "if i don't go--if i wait here--she'll come back." and i went to the weather side and stood looking out of the window. not that there was much to see. it was growing dark, and the seven brothers looked like the mane of a running horse, a great, vast, white horse running into the wind. the air was a-welter with it. i caught one peep of a fisherman, lying down flat trying to weather the ledge, and i said, "god help them all to-night," and then i went hot at sound of that "god." i was right about her, though. she was back again. i wanted her to speak first, before i turned, but she wouldn't. i didn't hear her go out; i didn't know what she was up to till i saw her coming outside on the walk-around, drenched wet already. i pounded on the glass for her to come in and not be a fool; if she heard she gave no sign of it. there she stood, and there i stood watching her. lord, sir--was it just that i'd never had eyes to see? or are there women who bloom? her clothes were shining on her, like a carving, and her hair was let down like a golden curtain tossing and streaming in the gale, and there she stood with her lips half open, drinking, and her eyes half closed, gazing straight away over the seven brothers, and her shoulders swaying, as if in tune with the wind and water and all the ruin. and when i looked at her hands over the rail, sir, they were moving in each other as if they bathed, and then i remembered, sir. a cold horror took me. i knew now why she had come back again. she wasn't a woman--she was a devil. i turned my back on her. i said to myself: "it's time to light up. you've got to light up"--like that, over and over, out loud. my hand was shivering so i could hardly find a match; and when i scratched it, it only flared a second and then went out in the back draught from the open door. she was standing in the doorway, looking at me. it's queer, sir, but i felt like a child caught in mischief. "i--i--was going to light up," i managed to say, finally. "why?" said she. no, i can't say it as she did. "_why?_" said i. "_my god!_" she came nearer, laughing, as if with pity, low, you know. "your god? and who is your god? what is god? what is anything on a night like this?" i drew back from her. all i could say anything about was the light. "why not the dark?" said she. "dark is softer than light--tenderer--dearer than light. from the dark up here, away up here in the wind and storm, we can watch the ships go by, you and i. and you love me so. you've loved me so long, ray." "i never have!" i struck out at her. "i don't! i don't!" her voice was lower than ever, but there was the same laughing pity in it. "oh yes, you have." and she was near me again. "i have?" i yelled. "i'll show you! i'll show you if i have!" i got another match, sir, and scratched it on the brass. i gave it to the first wick, the little wick that's inside all the others. it bloomed like a yellow flower. "i _have_?" i yelled, and gave it to the next. then there was a shadow, and i saw she was leaning beside me, her two elbows on the brass, her two arms stretched out above the wicks, her bare forearms and wrists and hands. i gave a gasp: "take care! you'll burn them! for god's sake----" she didn't move or speak. the match burned my fingers and went out, and all i could do was stare at those arms of hers, helpless. i'd never noticed her arms before. they were rounded and graceful and covered with a soft down, like a breath of gold. then i heard her speaking close to my ear. "pretty arms," she said. "pretty arms!" i turned. her eyes were fixed on mine. they seemed heavy, as if with sleep, and yet between their lids they were two wells, deep and deep, and as if they held all the things i'd ever thought or dreamed in them. i looked away from them, at her lips. her lips were red as poppies, heavy with redness. they moved, and i heard them speaking: "poor boy, you love me so, and you want to kiss me--don't you?" "no," said i. but i couldn't turn around. i looked at her hair. i'd always thought it was stringy hair. some hair curls naturally with damp, they say, and perhaps that was it, for there were pearls of wet on it, and it was thick and shimmering around her face, making soft shadows by the temples. there was green in it, queer strands of green like braids. "what is it?" said i. "nothing but weed," said she, with that slow, sleepy smile. somehow or other i felt calmer than i had any time. "look here," said i. "i'm going to light this lamp." i took out a match, scratched it, and touched the third wick. the flame ran around, bigger than the other two together. but still her arms hung there. i bit my lip. "by god, i will!" said i to myself, and i lit the fourth. it was fierce, sir, fierce! and yet those arms never trembled. i had to look around at her. her eyes were still looking into mine, so deep and deep, and her red lips were still smiling with that queer, sleepy droop; the only thing was that tears were raining down her cheeks--big, glowing round, jewel tears. it wasn't human, sir. it was like a dream. "pretty arms," she sighed, and then, as if those words had broken something in her heart, there came a great sob bursting from her lips. to hear it drove me mad. i reached to drag her away, but she was too quick, sir; she cringed from me and slipped out from between my hands. it was like she faded away, sir, and went down in a bundle, nursing her poor arms and mourning over them with those terrible, broken sobs. the sound of them took the manhood out of me--you'd have been the same, sir. i knelt down beside her on the floor and covered my face. "please!" i moaned. "please! please!" that's all i could say. i wanted her to forgive me. i reached out a hand, blind, for forgiveness, and i couldn't find her anywhere. i had hurt her so, and she was afraid of me, of _me_, sir, who loved her so deep it drove me crazy. i could see her down the stair, though it was dim and my eyes were filled with tears. i stumbled after her, crying, "please! please!" the little wicks i'd lit were blowing in the wind from the door and smoking the glass beside them black. one went out. i pleaded with them, the same as i would plead with a human being. i said i'd be back in a second. i promised. and i went on down the stair, crying like a baby because i'd hurt her, and she was afraid of me--of _me_, sir. she had gone into her room. the door was closed against me and i could hear her sobbing beyond it, broken-hearted. my heart was broken too. i beat on the door with my palms. i begged her to forgive me. i told her i loved her. and all the answer was that sobbing in the dark. and then i lifted the latch and went in, groping, pleading. "dearest--please! because i love you!" i heard her speak down near the floor. there wasn't any anger in her voice; nothing but sadness and despair. "no," said she. "you don't love me, ray. you never have." "i do! i have!" "no, no," said she, as if she was tired out. "where are you?" i was groping for her. i thought, and lit a match. she had got to the door and was standing there as if ready to fly. i went toward her, and she made me stop. she took my breath away. "i hurt your arms," said i, in a dream. "no," said she, hardly moving her lips. she held them out to the match's light for me to look and there was never a scar on them--not even that soft, golden down was singed, sir. "you can't hurt my body," said she, sad as anything. "only my heart, ray; my poor heart." i tell you again, she took my breath away. i lit another match. "how can you be so beautiful?" i wondered. she answered in riddles--but oh, the sadness of her, sir. "because," said she, "i've always so wanted to be." "how come your eyes so heavy?" said i. "because i've seen so many things i never dreamed of," said she. "how come your hair so thick?" "it's the seaweed makes it thick," said she smiling queer, queer. "how come seaweed there?" "out of the bottom of the sea." she talked in riddles, but it was like poetry to hear her, or a song. "how come your lips so red?" said i. "because they've wanted so long to be kissed." fire was on me, sir. i reached out to catch her, but she was gone, out of the door and down the stair. i followed, stumbling. i must have tripped on the turn, for i remember going through the air and fetching up with a crash, and i didn't know anything for a spell--how long i can't say. when i came to, she was there, somewhere, bending over me, crooning, "my love--my love--" under her breath like, a song. but then when i got up, she was not where my arms went; she was down the stair again, just ahead of me. i followed her. i was tottering and dizzy and full of pain. i tried to catch up with her in the dark of the store-room, but she was too quick for me, sir, always a little too quick for me. oh, she was cruel to me, sir. i kept bumping against things, hurting myself still worse, and it was cold and wet and a horrible noise all the while, sir; and then, sir, i found the door was open, and a sea had parted the hinges. i don't know how it all went, sir. i'd tell you if i could, but it's all so blurred--sometimes it seems more like a dream. i couldn't find her any more; i couldn't hear her; i went all over, everywhere. once, i remember, i found myself hanging out of that door between the davits, looking down into those big black seas and crying like a baby. it's all riddles and blur. i can't seem to tell you much, sir. it was all--all--i don't know. i was talking to somebody else--not her. it was the inspector. i hardly knew it was the inspector. his face was as gray as a blanket, and his eyes were bloodshot, and his lips were twisted. his left wrist hung down, awkward. it was broken coming aboard the light in that sea. yes, we were in the living-room. yes, sir, it was daylight--gray daylight. i tell you, sir, the man looked crazy to me. he was waving his good arm toward the weather windows, and what he was saying, over and over, was this: "_look what you done, damn you! look what you done_!" and what i was saying was this: "_i've lost her_!" i didn't pay any attention to him, nor him to me. by and by he did, though. he stopped his talking all of a sudden, and his eyes looked like the devil's eyes. he put them up close to mine. he grabbed my arm with his good hand, and i cried, i was so weak. "johnson," said he, "is that it? by the living god--if you got a woman out here, johnson!" "no," said i. "i've lost her." "what do you mean--lost her?" "it was dark," said i--and it's funny how my head was clearing up--"and the door was open--the store-room door--and i was after her--and i guess she stumbled, maybe--and i lost her." "johnson," said he, "what do you mean? you sound crazy--downright crazy. who?" "her," said i. "fedderson's wife." "_who?_" "her," said i. and with that he gave my arm another jerk. "listen," said he, like a tiger. "don't try that on me. it won't do any good--that kind of lies--not where _you're_ going to. fedderson and his wife, too--the both of 'em's drowned deader 'n a door-nail." "i know," said i, nodding my head. i was so calm it made him wild. "you're crazy! crazy as a loon, johnson!" and he was chewing his lip red. "i know, because it was me that found the old man laying on back water flats yesterday morning--_me!_ and she'd been with him in the boat, too, because he had a piece of her jacket tore off, tangled in his arm." "i know," said i, nodding again, like that. "you know _what_, you _crazy, murdering fool_?" those were his words to me, sir. "i know," said i, "what i know." "and _i_ know," said he, "what _i_ know." and there you are, sir. he's inspector. i'm--nobody. at the gate by myla jo closser from the _century magazine_. by permission of the century company and myla j. closser. a shaggy airedale scented his way along the highroad. he had not been there before, but he was guided by the trail of his brethren who had preceded him. he had gone unwillingly upon this journey, yet with the perfect training of dogs he had accepted it without complaint. the path had been lonely, and his heart would have failed him, traveling as he must without his people, had not these traces of countless dogs before him promised companionship of a sort at the end of the road. the landscape had appeared arid at first, for the translation from recent agony into freedom from pain had been so numbing in its swiftness that it was some time before he could fully appreciate the pleasant dog-country through which he was passing. there were woods with leaves upon the ground through which to scurry, long grassy slopes for extended runs, and lakes into which he might plunge for sticks and bring them back to--but he did not complete his thought, for the boy was not with him. a little wave of homesickness possessed him. it made his mind easier to see far ahead a great gate as high as the heavens, wide enough for all. he understood that only man built such barriers and by straining his eyes he fancied he could discern humans passing through to whatever lay beyond. he broke into a run that he might the more quickly gain this inclosure made beautiful by men and women; but his thoughts outran his pace, and he remembered that he had left the family behind, and again this lovely new compound became not perfect, since it would lack the family. the scent of the dogs grew very strong now, and coming nearer, he discovered, to his astonishment that of the myriads of those who had arrived ahead of him thousands were still gathered on the outside of the portal. they sat in a wide circle spreading out on each side of the entrance, big, little, curly, handsome, mongrel, thoroughbred dogs of every age, complexion, and personality. all were apparently waiting for something, someone, and at the pad of the airedale's feet on the hard road they arose and looked in his direction. that the interest passed as soon as they discovered the new-comer to be a dog puzzled him. in his former dwelling-place a four-footed brother was greeted with enthusiasm when he was a friend, with suspicious diplomacy when a stranger, and with sharp reproof when an enemy; but never had he been utterly ignored. he remembered something that he had read many times on great buildings with lofty entrances. "dogs not admitted," the signs had said, and he feared this might be the reason for the waiting circle outside the gate. it might be that this noble portal stood as the dividing-line between mere dogs and humans. but he had been a member of the family, romping with them in the living-room, sitting at meals with them in the dining-room, going upstairs at night with them, and the thought that he was to be "kept out" would be unendurable. he despised the passive dogs. they should be treating a barrier after the fashion of their old country, leaping against it, barking, and scratching the nicely painted door. he bounded up the last little hill to set them an example, for he was still full of the rebellion of the world; but he found no door to leap against. he could see beyond the entrance dear masses of people, yet no dog crossed the threshold. they continued in their patient ring, their gaze upon the winding road. he now advanced cautiously to examine the gate. it occurred to him that it must be fly-time in this region, and he did not wish to make himself ridiculous before all these strangers by trying to bolt through an invisible mesh like the one that had baffled him when he was a little chap. yet there were no screens, and despair entered his soul. what bitter punishment these poor beasts must have suffered before they learned to stay on this side the arch that led to human beings! what had they done on earth to merit this? stolen bones troubled his conscience, runaway days, sleeping in the best chair until the key clicked in the lock. these were sins. at that moment an english bull-terrier, white, with liver-colored spots and a jaunty manner, approached him, snuffling in a friendly way. no sooner had the bull-terrier smelt his collar than he fell to expressing his joy at meeting him. the airedale's reserve was quite thawed by this welcome, though he did not know just what to make of it. "i know you! i know you!" exclaimed the bull-terrier, adding inconsequently, "what's your name?" "tam o'shanter. they call me tammy," was the answer, with a pardonable break in the voice. "i know them," said the bull-terrier. "nice folks." "best ever," said the airedale, trying to be nonchalant, and scratching a flea which was not there. "i don't remember you. when did you know them?" "about fourteen tags ago, when they were first married. we keep track of time here by the license-tags. i had four." "this is my first and only one. you were before my time, i guess." he felt young and shy. "come for a walk, and tell me all about them," was his new friend's invitation. "aren't we allowed in there?" asked tam, looking toward the gate. "sure. you can go in whenever you want to. some of us do at first, but we don't stay." "like it better outside?" "no, no; it isn't that." "then why are all you fellows hanging around here? any old dog can see it's better beyond the arch." "you see, we're waiting for our folks to come." the airedale grasped it at once, and nodded understandingly. "i felt that way when i came along the road. it wouldn't be what it's supposed to be without them. it wouldn't be the perfect place." "not to us," said the bull-terrier. "fine! i've stolen bones, but it must be that i have been forgiven, if i'm to see them here again. it's the great good place all right. but look here," he added as a new thought struck him, "do they wait for us?" the older inhabitant coughed in slight embarrassment. "the humans couldn't do that very well. it wouldn't be the thing to have them hang around outside for just a dog--not dignified." "quite right," agreed tam. "i'm glad they go straight to their mansions. i'd--i'd hate to have them missing me as i am missing them." he sighed. "but, then, they wouldn't have to wait so long." "oh, well, they're getting on. don't be discouraged," comforted the terrier. "and in the meantime it's like a big hotel in summer--watching the new arrivals. see, there is something doing now." all the dogs were aroused to excitement by a little figure making its way uncertainly up the last slope. half of them started to meet it, crowding about in a loving, eager pack. "look out; don't scare it," cautioned the older animals, while word was passed to those farthest from the gate: "quick! quick! a baby's come!" before they had entirely assembled, however, a gaunt yellow hound pushed through the crowd, gave one sniff at the small child, and with a yelp of joy crouched at its feet. the baby embraced the hound in recognition, and the two moved toward the gate. just outside the hound stopped to speak to an aristocratic st. bernard who had been friendly: "sorry to leave you, old fellow," he said, "but i'm going in to watch over the kid. you see, i'm all she has up here." the bull-terrier looked at the airedale for appreciation. "that's the way we do it," he said proudly. "yes, but--" the airedale put his head on one side in perplexity. "yes, but what?" asked the guide. "the dogs that don't have any people--the nobodies' dogs?" "that's the best of all. oh, everything is thought out here. crouch down,--you must be tired,--and watch," said the bull-terrier. soon they spied another small form making the turn in the road. he wore a boy scout's uniform, but he was a little fearful, for all that, so new was this adventure. the dogs rose again and snuffled, but the better groomed of the circle held back, and in their place a pack of odds and ends of the company ran down to meet him. the boy scout was reassured by their friendly attitude, and after petting them impartially, he chose an old-fashioned black and tan, and the two passed in. tam looked questioningly. "they didn't know each other!" he exclaimed. "but they've always wanted to. that's one of the boys who used to beg for a dog, but his father wouldn't let him have one. so all our strays wait for just such little fellows to come along. every boy gets a dog, and every dog gets a master." "i expect the boy's father would like to know that now," commented the airedale. "no doubt he thinks quite often, 'i wish i'd let him have a dog.'" the bull-terrier laughed. "you're pretty near the earth yet, aren't you?" tam admitted it. "i've a lot of sympathy with fathers and with boys, having them both in the family, and a mother as well." the bull-terrier leaped up in astonishment. "you don't mean to say they keep a boy?" "sure; greatest boy on earth. ten this year." "well, well, this is news! i wish they'd kept a boy when i was there." the airedale looked at his new friend intently. "see here, who are you?" he demanded. but the other hurried on: "i used to run away from them just to play with a boy. they'd punish me, and i always wanted to tell them it was their fault for not getting one." "who are you, anyway?" repeated tam. "talking all this interest in me, too. whose dog _were_ you?" "you've already guessed. i see it in your quivering snout. i'm the old dog that had to leave them about ten years ago." "their old dog bully?" "yes, i'm bully." they nosed each other with deeper affection, then strolled about the glades shoulder to shoulder. bully the more eagerly pressed for news. "tell me, how are they getting along?" "very well indeed; they've paid for the house." "i--i suppose you occupy the kennel?" "no. they said they couldn't stand it to see another dog in your old place." bully stopped to howl gently. "that touches me. it's generous in you to tell it. to think they missed me!" for a little while they went on in silence, but as evening fell, and the light from the golden streets inside of the city gave the only glow to the scene, bully grew nervous and suggested that they go back. "we can't see so well at night, and i like to be pretty close to the path, especially toward morning." tam assented. "and i will point them out. you might not know them just at first." "oh, we know them. sometimes the babies have so grown up they're rather hazy in their recollection of how we look. they think we're bigger than we are; but you can't fool us dogs." "it's understood," tam cunningly arranged, "that when he or she arrives you'll sort of make them feel at home while i wait for the boy?" "that's the best plan," assented bully, kindly. "and if by any chance the little fellow should come first,--there's been a lot of them this summer--of course you'll introduce me?" "i shall be proud to do it." and so with muzzles sunk between their paws, and with their eyes straining down the pilgrims' road, they wait outside the gate. ligeia by edgar allan poe and the will therein lieth, which dieth not. who knoweth the mystery of the will, with its vigor? for god is but a great will pervading all things by nature of its intentness. man doth not yield himself to the angels, nor unto death utterly, save only through the weakness of his feeble will.--_joseph glanvill._ i cannot, for my soul, remember how, when, or even precisely where, i first became acquainted with the lady ligeia. long years have since elapsed, and my memory is feeble through much suffering. or, perhaps, i cannot _now_ bring these points to mind, because, in truth, the character of my beloved, her rare learning, her singular yet placid cast of beauty, and the thrilling and enthralling eloquence of her low musical language, made their way into my heart by paces so steadily and stealthily progressive, that they have been unnoticed and unknown. yet i believe that i met her first and most frequently in some large, old, decaying city near the rhine. of her family--i have surely heard her speak. that it is of a remotely ancient date cannot be doubted. ligeia! ligeia! buried in studies of a nature more than all else adapted to deaden impressions of the outward world, it is by that sweet word alone--by ligeia--that i bring before mine eyes in fancy the image of her who is no more. and now, while i write, a recollection flashes upon me that i have _never known_ the paternal name of her who was my friend and my bethrothed, and who became the partner of my studies, and finally the wife of my bosom. was it a playful charge on the part of my ligeia? or was it a test of my strength of affection, that i should institute no inquiries upon this point? or was it rather a caprice of my own--a wildly romantic offering on the shrine of the most passionate devotion? i but indistinctly recall the fact itself--what wonder that i have utterly forgotten the circumstances which originated or attended it? and, indeed, if ever that spirit which is entitled _romance_--if ever she, the wan misty-winged _ashtophet_ of idolatrous egypt, presided, as they tell, over marriages ill-omened, then most surely she presided over mine. there is one dear topic, however, on which my memory fails me not. it is the _person_ of ligeia. in stature she was tall, somewhat slender, and, in her latter days, even emaciated. i would in vain attempt to portray the majesty, the quiet ease of her demeanor, or the incomprehensible lightness and elasticity of her footfall. she came and departed as a shadow. i was never made aware of her entrance into my closed study, save by the dear music of her low sweet voice, as she placed her marble hand upon my shoulder. in beauty of face no maiden ever equaled her. it was the radiance of an opium-dream--an airy and spirit-lifting vision more wildly divine than the phantasies which hovered about the slumbering souls of the daughters of delos. yet her features were not of that regular mold which we have been falsely taught to worship in the classical labors of the heathen. "there is no exquisite beauty," says bacon, lord verulam, speaking truly of all the forms and _genera_ of beauty, "without some _strangeness_ in the proportion." yet, although i saw that the features of ligeia were not of a classic regularity--although i perceived that her loveliness was indeed "exquisite," and felt that there was much of "strangeness" pervading it, yet i have tried in vain to detect the irregularity and to trace home my own perception of "the strange." i examined the contour of the lofty and pale forehead--it was faultless--how cold indeed that word when applied to a majesty so divine!--the skin rivaling the purest ivory, the commanding extent and repose, the gentle prominence of the regions above the temples; and then the raven-black, the glossy, the luxuriant, and naturally-curling tresses, setting forth the full force of the homeric epithet, "hyacinthine!" i looked at the delicate outlines of the nose--and nowhere but in the graceful medallions of the hebrews had i beheld a similar perfection. there were the same luxurious smoothness of surface, the same scarcely perceptible tendency to the aquiline, the same harmoniously curved nostrils speaking the free spirit. i regarded the sweet mouth. here was indeed the triumph of all things heavenly--the magnificent turn of the short upper lip--the soft, voluptuous slumber of the under--the dimples which sported, and the color which spoke--the teeth glancing back, with a brilliancy almost startling, every ray of the holy light which fell upon them in her serene and placid yet most exultingly radiant of all smiles. i scrutinized the formation of the chin--and, here, too, i found the gentleness of breadth, the softness and the majesty, the fullness and the spirituality, of the greek--the contour which the god apollo revealed but in a dream, to cleomenes, the son of the athenian. and then i peered into the large eyes of ligeia. for eyes we have no models in the remotely antique. it might have been, too, that in these eyes of my beloved lay the secret to which lord verulam alludes. they were, i must believe, far larger than the ordinary eyes of our own race. they were even fuller than the fullest of the gazelle eyes of the tribe of the valley of nourjahad. yet it was only at intervals--in moments of intense excitement--that this peculiarity became more than slightly noticeable in ligeia. and at such moments was her beauty--in my heated fancy thus it appeared perhaps--the beauty of beings either above or apart from the earth--the beauty of the fabulous houri of the turk. the hue of the orbs was the most brilliant of black, and, far over them, hung jetty lashes of great length. the brows, slightly irregular in outline, had the same tint. the "strangeness," however, which i found in the eyes was of a nature distinct from the formation, or the color, or the brilliancy of the features, and must, after all, be referred to the _expression_. ah, word of no meaning! behind whose vast latitude of mere sound we intrench our ignorance of so much of the spiritual. the expression of the eyes of ligeia! how for long hours have i pondered upon it! how have i, through the whole of a midsummer night, struggled to fathom it! what was it--that something more profound than the well of democritus--which lay far within the pupils of my beloved? what _was_ it? i was possessed with a passion to discover. those eyes! those large, those shining, those divine orbs! they became to me twin stars of leda, and i to them devoutest of astrologers. there is no point, among the many incomprehensible anomalies of the science of mind, more thrillingly exciting than the fact--never, i believe, noticed in the schools--than in our endeavors to recall to memory something long forgotten, we often find ourselves _upon the very verge_ of remembrance, without being able, in the end, to remember. and thus how frequently, in my intense scrutiny of ligeia's eyes, have i felt approaching the full knowledge of their expression--felt it approaching--yet not quite be mine--and so at length entirely depart! and (strange, oh, strangest mystery of all!) i found, in the commonest objects of the universe, a circle of analogies to that expression. i mean to say that, subsequently to the period when ligeia's beauty passed into my spirit, there dwelling as in a shrine, i derived, from many existences in the material world, a sentiment such as i felt always around, within me, by her large and luminous orbs. yet not the more could i define that sentiment, or analyze, or even steadily view it. i recognized it, let me repeat, sometimes in the survey of a rapidly growing vine--in the contemplation of a moth, a butterfly, a chrysalis, a stream of running water. i have felt it in the ocean--in the falling of a meteor. i have felt it in the glances of unusually aged people. and there are one or two stars in heaven (one especially, a star of the sixth magnitude, double and changeable, to be found near the large star in lyra) in a telescopic scrutiny of which i have been made aware of the feeling. i have been filled with it by certain sounds from stringed instruments, and not unfrequently by passages from books. among innumerable other instances, i well remember something in a volume of joseph glanvill, which (perhaps merely from its quaintness--who shall say?) never failed to inspire me with the sentiment: "and the will therein lieth, which dieth not. who knoweth the mysteries of the will, with its vigor? for god is but a great will pervading all things by nature of its intentness. man doth not yield him to the angels, nor unto death utterly, save only through the weakness of his feeble will." length of years and subsequent reflection have enabled me to trace, indeed, some remote connection between this passage in the english moralist and a portion of the character of ligeia. an _intensity_ in thought, action, or speech was possibly, in her, a result, or at least an index, of that gigantic volition which, during our long intercourse, failed to give other and more immediate evidence of its existence. of all the women whom i have ever known, she, the outwardly calm, the ever-placid ligeia, was the most violently a prey to the tumultuous vultures of stern passion. and of such passion i could form no estimate, save by the miraculous expansion of those eyes which at once so delighted and appalled me,--by the almost magical melody, modulation, distinctness, and placidity of her very low voice,--and by the fierce energy (rendered doubly effective by contrast with her manner of utterance) of the wild words which she habitually uttered. i have spoken of the learning of ligeia: it was immense--such as i have never known in woman. in the classical tongues was she deeply proficient, and as far as my own acquaintance extended in regard to the modern dialects of europe, i have never known her at fault. indeed upon any theme of the most admired because simply the most abstruse of the boasted erudition of the academy, have i _ever_ found ligeia at fault? how singularly--how thrillingly, this one point in the nature of my wife has forced itself, at this late period only, upon my attention! i said her knowledge was such as i have never known in woman--but where breathes the man who has traversed, and successfully, _all_ the wide areas of moral, physical, and mathematical science? i saw not then what i now clearly perceive that the acquisitions of ligeia were gigantic, were astounding; yet i was sufficiently aware of her infinite supremacy to resign myself, with a child-like confidence, to her guidance through the chaotic world of metaphysical investigation at which i was most busily occupied during the earlier years of our marriage. with how vast a triumph--with how vivid a delight--with how much of all that is ethereal in hope did i _feel_, as she bent over me in studies but little sought--but less known,--that delicious vista by slow degrees expanding before me, down whose long, gorgeous, and all untrodden path, i might at length pass onward to the goal of a wisdom too divinely precious not to be forbidden. how poignant, then, must have been the grief with which, after some years, i beheld my well-grounded expectations take wings to themselves and fly away! without ligeia i was but as a child groping benighted. her presence, her readings alone, rendered vividly luminous the many mysteries of the transcendentalism in which we were immersed. wanting the radiant luster of her eyes, letters, lambent and golden, grew duller than saturnian lead. and now those eyes shone less and less frequently upon the pages over which i pored. ligeia grew ill. the wild eyes blazed with a too--too glorious effulgence; the pale fingers became of the transparent waxen hue of the grave; and the blue veins upon the lofty forehead swelled and sank impetuously with the tides of the most gentle emotion. i saw that she must die--and i struggled desperately in spirit with the grim azrael. and the struggles of the passionate wife were, to my astonishment, even more energetic than my own. there had been much in her stern nature to impress me with the belief that, to her, death would have come without its terrors; but not so. words are impotent to convey any just idea of the fierceness of resistance with which she wrestled with the shadow. i groaned in anguish at the pitiable spectacle. i would have soothed--i would have reasoned; but in the intensity of her wild desire for life--for life--_but_ for life--solace and reason were alike the uttermost of folly. yet not until the last instance, amid the most convulsive writhings of her fierce spirit, was shaken the external placidity of her demeanor. her voice grew more gentle--grew more low--yet i would not wish to dwell upon the wild meaning of the quietly uttered words. my brain reeled as i hearkened, entranced, to a melody more than mortal--to assumptions and aspirations which mortality had never before known. that she loved me i should not have doubted; and i might have been easily aware that, in a bosom such as hers, love would have reigned no ordinary passion. but in death only was i fully impressed with the strength of her affection. for long hours, detaining my hand, would she pour out before me the overflowing of a heart whose more than passionate devotion amounted to idolatry. how had i deserved to be so blessed by such confessions?--how had i deserved to be so cursed with the removal of my beloved in the hour of my making them? but upon this subject i cannot bear to dilate. let me say only, that in ligeia's more than womanly abandonment to a love, alas! all unmerited, all unworthily bestowed, i at length, recognized the principle of her longing, with so wildly earnest a desire, for the life which was now fleeing so rapidly away. it is this wild longing--it is this eager vehemence of desire for life--_but_ for life--that i have no power to portray--no utterance capable of expressing. at high noon of the night in which she departed, beckoning me, peremptorily, to her side, she bade me repeat certain verses composed by herself not many days before. i obeyed her. they were these:-- lo! 'tis a gala night within the lonesome latter years! an angel throng, bewinged, bedight in veils, and drowned in tears, sit in a theatre, to see a play of hopes and fears, while the orchestra breathes fitfully the music of the spheres. mimes, in the form of god on high, mutter and mumble low, and hither and thither fly; mere puppets they, who come and go at bidding of vast formless things that shift the scenery to and fro, flapping from out their condor wings invisible wo! that motley drama!--oh, be sure it shall not be forgot! with its phantom chased for evermore by a crowd that seize it not, through a circle that ever returneth in to the self-same spot; and much of madness, and more of sin and horror, the soul of the plot! but see, amid the mimic rout, a crawling shape intrude! a blood-red thing that writhes from out the scenic solitude! it writhes!--it writhes!--with mortal pangs the mimes become its food, and the seraphs sob at vermin fangs in human gore imbued. out--out are the lights--out all: and over each quivering form, the curtain, a funeral pall, comes down with the rush of a storm-- and the angels, all pallid and wan, uprising, unveiling, affirm that the play is the tragedy, "man," and its hero, the conqueror worm. "o god!" half shrieked ligeia, leaping to her feet and extending her arms aloft with a spasmodic movement, as i made an end of these lines--"o god! o divine father!--shall these things be undeviatingly so?--shall this conqueror be not once conquered? are we not part and parcel in thee? who--who knoweth the mysteries of the will with its vigor? man doth not yield him to the angels, _nor unto death utterly_, save only through the weakness of his feeble will." and now, as if exhausted with emotion, she suffered her white arms to fall, and returned solemnly to her bed of death. and as she breathed her last sighs, there came mingled with them a low murmur from her lips. i bent to them my ear, and distinguished, again, the concluding words of the passage in glanvill: "_man doth not yield him to the angels, nor unto death utterly, save only through the weakness of his feeble will._" she died: and i, crushed into the very dust with sorrow, could no longer endure the lonely desolation of my dwelling in the dim and decaying city by the rhine. i had no lack of what the world calls wealth. ligeia had brought me far more, very far more, than ordinarily falls to the lot of mortals. after a few months, therefore, of weary and aimless wandering, i purchased and put in some repair, an abbey, which i shall not name, in one of the wildest and least frequented portions of fair england. the gloomy and dreary grandeur of the building, the almost savage aspect of the domain, the many melancholy and time-honored memories connected with both, had much in unison with the feelings of utter abandonment which had driven me into that remote and unsocial region of the country. yet although the external abbey, with its verdant decay hanging about it, suffered but little alteration, i gave way, with a child-like perversity, and perchance with a faint hope of alleviating my sorrows, to a display of more than regal magnificence within. for such follies, even in childhood, i had imbibed a taste, and now they came back to me as if in the dotage of grief. alas, i feel how much even of incipient madness might have been discovered in the gorgeous and fantastic draperies, in the solemn carvings of egypt, in the wild cornices and furniture, in the bedlam patterns of the carpets of tufted gold! i had become a bounden slave in the trammels of opium, and my labors and my orders had taken a coloring from my dreams. but these absurdities i must not pause to detail. let me speak only of that one chamber, ever accursed, whither, in a moment of mental alienation, i led from the altar as my bride--as the successor of the unforgotten ligeia--the fair-haired and blue-eyed lady rowena trevanion, of tremaine. there is no individual portion of the architecture and decoration of that bridal chamber which is not visibly before me. where were the souls of the haughty family of the bride, when, through thirst of gold, they permitted to pass the threshold of an apartment _so_ bedecked, a maiden and a daughter so beloved? i have said, that i minutely remember the details of the chamber--yet i am sadly forgetful on topics of deep moment; and here there was no system, no keeping, in the fantastic display to take hold upon the memory. the room lay in a high turret of the castellated abbey, was pentagonal in shape, and of capacious size. occupying the whole southern face of the pentagonal was the sole window--an immense sheet of unbroken glass from venice--a single pane, and tinted of a leaden hue, so that the rays of either the sun or moon passing through it, fell with a ghastly luster on the objects within. over the upper portion of this huge window extended the trellis-work of an aged vine, which clambered up the massy walls of the turret. the ceiling, of gloomy-looking oak, was excessively lofty, vaulted, and elaborately fretted with the wildest and most grotesque specimens of a semi-gothic, semi-druidical device. from out the most central recess of this melancholy vaulting, depended, by a single chain of gold with long links, a huge censer of the same metal, saracenic in pattern, and with many perforations so contrived that there writhed in and out of them, as if endued with a serpent vitality, a continual succession of parti-colored fires. some few ottomans and golden candelabra, of eastern figure, were in various stations about; and there was the couch, too--the bridal couch--of an indian model, and low, and sculptured of solid ebony, with a pall-like canopy above. in each of the angles of the chamber stood on end a gigantic sarcophagus of black granite, from the tombs of the kings over against luxor, with their aged lids full of immemorial sculpture. but in the draping of the apartment lay, alas! the chief phantasy of all. the lofty walls, gigantic in height--even unproportionably so--were hung from summit to foot, in vast folds, with a heavy and massive-looking tapestry--tapestry of a material which was found alike as a carpet on the floor, as a covering for the ottomans and the ebony bed, as a canopy for the bed, and as the gorgeous volutes of the curtains which partially shaded the window. the material was the richest cloth of gold. it was spotted all over, at irregular intervals, with arabesque figures, about a foot in diameter, and wrought upon the cloth in patterns of the most jetty black. but these figures partook of the true character of the arabesque only when regarded from a single point of view. by a contrivance now common, and indeed traceable to a very remote period of antiquity, they were made changeable in aspect. to one entering the room, they bore the appearance of simple monstrosities; but upon a farther advance, this appearance gradually departed; and, step by step, as the visitor moved his station in the chamber, he saw himself surrounded by an endless succession of the ghastly forms which belong to the superstition of the norman, or arise in the guilty slumbers of the monk. the phantasmagoric effect was vastly heightened by the artificial introduction of a strong continual current of wind behind the draperies--giving a hideous and uneasy animation to the whole. in halls such as these--in a bridal chamber such as this--i passed, with the lady of tremaine, the unhallowed hours of the first month of our marriage--passed them with but little disquietude. that my wife dreaded the fierce moodiness of my temper--that she shunned me, and loved me but little--i could not help perceiving; but it gave me rather pleasure than otherwise. i loathed her with a hatred belonging more to demon than to man. my memory flew back (oh, with what intensity of regret!) to ligeia, the beloved, the august, the beautiful, the entombed. i reveled in recollections of her purity, of her wisdom, of her lofty--her ethereal nature, of her passionate, her idolatrous love. now, then, did my spirit fully and freely burn with more than all the fires of her own. in the excitement of my opium dreams (for i was habitually fettered in the shackles of the drug), i would call aloud upon her name, during the silence of the night, or among the sheltered recesses of the glens by day, as if, through the wild eagerness, the solemn passion, the consuming ardor of my longing for the departed, i could restore her to the pathways she had abandoned--ah, _could_ it be forever?--upon the earth. about the commencement of the second month of the marriage, the lady rowena was attacked with sudden illness, from which her recovery was slow. the fever which consumed her rendered her nights uneasy; and in her perturbed state of half-slumber, she spoke of sounds, and of motions, in and about the chamber of the turret, which i concluded had no origin save in the distemper of her fancy, or perhaps in the phantasmagoric influences of the chamber itself. she became at length convalescent--finally, well. yet but a second more violent disorder again threw her upon a bed of suffering; and from this attack her frame, at all times feeble, never altogether recovered. her illnesses were, after this epoch, of alarming character, and of more alarming recurrence, defying alike the knowledge and the great exertions of her physicians. with the increase of the chronic disease, which had thus, apparently, taken too sure hold upon her constitution to be eradicated by human means, i could not fail to observe a similar increase in the nervous irritation of her temperament, and in her excitability by trivial causes of fear. she spoke again, and now more frequently and pertinaciously, of the sounds--of the slight sounds--and of the unusual motions among the tapestries, to which she had formerly alluded. one night, near the closing in of september, she pressed this distressing subject with more than usual emphasis upon my attention. she had just awakened from an unquiet slumber, and i had been watching, with feelings half of anxiety, half of vague terror, the workings of her emaciated countenance. i sat by the side of her ebony bed, upon one of the ottomans of india. she partly arose, and spoke, in an earnest low whisper, of sounds which she _then_ heard, but which i could not hear--of motions which she _then_ saw, but which i could not perceive. the wind was rushing hurriedly behind the tapestries, and i wished to show her (what, let me confess it, i could not _all_ believe) that those almost inarticulate breathings, and those very gentle variations of the figures upon the wall, were but the natural effects of that customary rushing of the wind. but a deadly pallor, overspreading her face, had proved to me that my exertions to reassure her would be fruitless. she appeared to be fainting, and no attendants were within call. i remembered where was deposited a decanter of light wine which had been ordered by her physicians, and hastened across the chamber to procure it. but, as i stepped beneath the light of the censer, two circumstances of a startling nature attracted my attention. i had felt that some palpable although invisible object had passed lightly by my person; and i saw that there lay upon the golden carpet, in the very middle of the rich luster thrown from the censer, a shadow--a faint, indefinite shadow of angelic aspect--such as might be fancied for the shadow of a shade. but i was wild with the excitement of an immoderate dose of opium, and heeded these things but little, nor spoke of them to rowena. having found the wine, i recrossed the chamber, and poured out a gobletful, which i held to the lips of the fainting lady. she had now partially recovered, however, and took the vessel herself, while i sank upon an ottoman near me, with my eyes fastened upon her person. it was then that i became distinctly aware of a gentle footfall upon the carpet, and near the couch; and in a second thereafter, as rowena was in the act of raising the wine to her lips, i saw, or may have dreamed that i saw, fall within the goblet, as if from some invisible spring in the atmosphere of the room, three or four large drops of a brilliant and ruby colored fluid. if this i saw--not so rowena. she swallowed the wine unhesitatingly, and i forebore to speak to her of a circumstance which must, after all, i considered, have been but the suggestion of a vivid imagination, rendered morbidly active by the terror of the lady, by the opium, and by the hour. yet i cannot conceal [transcriber's note: the original reads "coneal".] it from my own perception that, immediately subsequent to the fall of the ruby drops, a rapid change for the worse took place in the disorder of my wife; so that, on the third subsequent night, the hands of her menials prepared her for the tomb, and on the fourth, i sat alone, with her shrouded body, in that fantastic chamber which had received her as my bride. wild visions, opium-engendered, flitted, shadow-like, before me. i gazed with unquiet eye upon the sarcophagi in the angles of the room, upon the varying figures of the drapery, and upon the writhing of the parti-colored fires in the censer overhead. my eyes then fell, as i called to mind the circumstances of a former night, to the spot beneath the glare of the censer where i had seen the faint traces of the shadow. it was there, however, no longer; and breathing with greater freedom, i turned my glances to the pallid and rigid figure upon the bed. then rushed upon me a thousand memories of ligeia--and then came back upon my heart, with the turbulent violence of a flood, the whole of that unutterable woe with which i had regarded _her_ thus enshrouded. the night waned; and still, with a bosom full of bitter thoughts of the one only and supremely beloved, i remained gazing upon the body of rowena. it might have been midnight, or perhaps earlier, or later, for i had taken no note of time, when a sob, low, gentle, but very distinct, startled me from my revery. i _felt_ that it came from the bed of ebony--the bed of death. i listened in an agony of superstitious terror--but there was no repetition of the sound. i strained my vision to detect any motion in the corpse--but there was not the slightest perceptible. yet i could not have been deceived. i _had_ heard the noise, however faint, and my soul was awakened within me. i resolutely and perseveringly kept my attention riveted upon the body. many minutes elapsed before any circumstance occurred tending to throw light upon the mystery. at length it became evident that a slight, a very feeble, and barely noticeable tinge of color had flushed up within the cheeks, and along the sunken small veins of the eyelids. through a species of unutterable horror and awe, for which the language of mortality has no sufficiently energetic expression, i felt my heart cease to beat, my limbs grow rigid where i sat. yet a sense of duty finally operated to restore my self-possession. i could no longer doubt that we had been precipitate in our preparations--that rowena still lived. it was necessary that some immediate exertion be made; yet the turret was altogether apart from the portion of the abbey tenanted by the servants--there were none within call--i had no means of summoning them to my aid without leaving the room for many minutes--and this i could not venture to do. i therefore struggled alone in my endeavors to call back the spirit still hovering. in a short period it was certain, however, that a relapse had taken place; the color disappeared from both eyelid and cheek, leaving a wanness even more than that of marble; the lips became doubly shriveled and pinched up in the ghastly expression of death; a repulsive clamminess and coldness overspread rapidly the surface of the body; and all the usual rigorous stiffness immediately supervened. i fell back with a shudder upon the couch from which i had been so startlingly aroused, and again gave myself up to passionate waking visions of ligeia. an hour thus elapsed, when (could it be possible?) i was a second time aware of some vague sound issuing from the region of the bed. i listened--in extremity of horror. the sound came again--it was a sigh. rushing to the corpse, i saw--distinctly saw--a tremor upon the lips. in a minute afterward they relaxed, disclosing a bright line of the pearly teeth. amazement now struggled in my bosom with the profound awe which had hitherto reigned there alone. i felt that my vision grew dim, that my reason wandered; and it was only by a violent effort that i at length succeeded in nerving myself to the task which duty thus once more had pointed out. there was now a partial glow upon the forehead and upon the cheek and throat; a perceptible warmth pervaded the whole frame; there was even a slight pulsation at the heart. the lady _lived_; and with redoubled ardor i betook myself to the task of restoration. i chafed and bathed the temples and the hands and used every exertion which experience, and no little medical reading, could suggest. but in vain. suddenly, the color fled, the pulsation ceased, the lips resumed the expression of the dead, and, in an instant afterward, the whole body took upon itself the icy chilliness, the livid hue, the intense rigidity, the sunken outline, and all the loathsome peculiarities of that which has been, for many days, a tenant of the tomb. and again i sunk into visions of ligeia--and again (what marvel that i shudder while i write?), _again_ there reached my ears a low sob from the region of the ebony bed. but why shall i minutely detail the unspeakable horrors of that night? why shall i pause to relate how, time after time, until near the period of the gray dawn, this hideous drama of revivification was repeated; how each terrific relapse was only into a sterner and apparently more irredeemable death; how each agony wore the aspect of a struggle with some invisible foe; and how each struggle was succeeded by i know not what of wild change in the personal appearance of the corpse? let me hurry to a conclusion. the greater part of the fearful night had worn away, and she who had been dead once again stirred--and now more vigorously than hitherto, although arousing from a dissolution more appalling in its utter hopelessness than any. i had long ceased to struggle or to move, and remained sitting rigidly upon the ottoman, a helpless prey to a whirl of violent emotions, of which extreme awe was perhaps the least terrible, the least consuming. the corpse, i repeat, stirred, and now more vigorously than before. the hues of life flushed up with unwonted energy into the countenance--the limbs relaxed--and, save that the eyelids were yet pressed heavily together, and that the bandages and draperies of the grave still imparted their charnel character to the figure, i might have dreamed that rowena had indeed shaken off, utterly, the fetters of death. but if this idea was not, even then, altogether adopted, i could at least doubt no longer, when, arising from the bed, tottering, with feeble steps, with closed eyes, and with the manner of one bewildered in a dream, the thing that was enshrouded advanced boldly and palpably into the middle of the apartment. i trembled not--i stirred not--for a crowd of unutterable fancies connected with the air, the stature, the demeanor, of the figure, rushing hurriedly through my brain, had paralyzed--had chilled me into stone. i stirred not--but gazed upon the apparition. there was a mad disorder in my thoughts--a tumult unappeasable. could it, indeed, be the _living_ rowena who confronted me? could it, indeed, be rowena _at all_--the fair-haired, the blue-eyed lady rowena trevanion of tremaine? why, _why_ should i doubt it? the bandage lay heavily about the mouth--but then might it not be the mouth of the breathing lady of tremaine? and the cheeks--there were the roses as in her noon of life--yes, these might indeed be the fair cheeks of the living lady of tremaine. and the chin, with its dimples, as in health, might it not be hers?--but _had she then grown taller since her malady?_ what inexpressible madness seized me with that thought? one bound, and i had reached her feet! shrinking from my touch, she let fall from her head, unloosened, the ghastly cerements which had confined it, and there streamed forth into the rushing atmosphere of the chamber huge masses of long and disheveled hair; _it was blacker than the raven wings of midnight._ and now slowly opened _the eyes_ of the figure which stood before me. "here then, at least," i shrieked aloud, "can i never--can i never be mistaken--these are the full, and the black, and the wild eyes--of my lost love--of the lady--of the lady ligeia." the haunted orchard by richard le gallienne from _harper's magazine_, january, <UNK> by permission of harper and brothers and richard le gallienne. spring was once more in the world. as she sang to herself in the faraway woodlands her voice reached even the ears of the city, weary with the long winter. daffodils flowered at the entrances to the subway, furniture removing vans blocked the side streets, children clustered like blossoms on the doorsteps, the open cars were running, and the cry of the "cash clo'" man was once more heard in the land. yes, it was the spring, and the city dreamed wistfully of lilacs and the dewy piping of birds in gnarled old apple-trees, of dogwood lighting up with sudden silver the thickening woods, of water-plants unfolding their glossy scrolls in pools of morning freshness. on sunday mornings, the outbound trains were thronged with eager pilgrims, hastening out of the city, to behold once more the ancient marvel of the spring; and, on sunday evenings, the railway termini were aflower with banners of blossom from rifled woodland and orchard carried in the hands of the returning pilgrims, whose eyes still shone with the spring magic, in whose ears still sang the fairy music. and as i beheld these signs of the vernal equinox i knew that i, too, must follow the music, forsake awhile the beautiful siren we call the city, and in the green silences meet once more my sweetheart solitude. as the train drew out of the grand central, i hummed to myself, "i've a neater, sweeter maiden, in a greener, cleaner land" and so i said good-by to the city, and went forth with beating heart to meet the spring. i had been told of an almost forgotten corner on the south coast of connecticut, where the spring and i could live in an inviolate loneliness--a place uninhabited save by birds and blossoms, woods and thick grass, and an occasional silent farmer, and pervaded by the breath and shimmer of the sound. nor had rumor lied, for when the train set me down at my destination i stepped out into the most wonderful green hush, a leafy sabbath silence through which the very train, as it went farther on its way, seemed to steal as noiselessly as possible for fear of breaking the spell. after a winter in the town, to be dropped thus suddenly into the intense quiet of the country-side makes an almost ghostly impression upon one, as of an enchanted silence, a silence that listens and watches but never speaks, finger on lip. there is a spectral quality about everything upon which the eye falls: the woods, like great green clouds, the wayside flowers, the still farm-houses half lost in orchard bloom--all seem to exist in a dream. everything is so still, everything so supernaturally green. nothing moves or talks, except the gentle susurrus of the spring wind swaying the young buds high up in the quiet sky, or a bird now and again, or a little brook singing softly to itself among the crowding rushes. though, from the houses one notes here and there, there are evidently human inhabitants of this green silence, none are to be seen. i have often wondered where the countryfolk hide themselves, as i have walked hour after hour, past farm and croft and lonely door-yards, and never caught sight of a human face. if you should want to ask the way, a farmer is as shy as a squirrel, and if you knock at a farm-house door, all is as silent as a rabbit-warren. as i walked along in the enchanted stillness, i came at length to a quaint old farm-house--"old colonial" in its architecture--embowered in white lilacs, and surrounded by an orchard of ancient apple-trees which cast a rich shade on the deep spring grass. the orchard had the impressiveness of those old religious groves, dedicated to the strange worship of sylvan gods, gods to be found now only in horace or catullus, and in the hearts of young poets to whom the beautiful antique latin is still dear. the old house seemed already the abode of solitude. as i lifted the latch of the white gate and walked across the forgotten grass, and up on to the veranda already festooned with wistaria, and looked into the window, i saw solitude sitting by an old piano, on which no composer later than bach had ever been played. in other words, the house was empty; and going round to the back, where old barns and stables leaned together as if falling asleep, i found a broken pane, and so climbed in and walked through the echoing rooms. the house was very lonely. evidently no one had lived in it for a long time. yet it was all ready for some occupant, for whom it seemed to be waiting. quaint old four-poster bedsteads stood in three rooms--dimity curtains and spotless linen--old oak chests and mahogany presses; and, opening drawers in chippendale sideboards, i came upon beautiful frail old silver and exquisite china that set me thinking of a beautiful grandmother of mine, made out of old lace and laughing wrinkles and mischievous old blue eyes. there was one little room that particularly interested me, a tiny bedroom all white, and at the window the red roses were already in bud. but what caught my eye with peculiar sympathy was a small bookcase, in which were some twenty or thirty volumes, wearing the same forgotten expression--forgotten and yet cared for--which lay like a kind of memorial charm upon everything in the old house. yes, everything seemed forgotten and yet everything, curiously--even religiously--remembered. i took out book after book from the shelves, once or twice flowers fell out from the pages--and i caught sight of a delicate handwriting here and there and frail markings. it was evidently the little intimate library of a young girl. what surprised me most was to find that quite half the books were in french--french poets and french romancers: a charming, very rare edition of ronsard, a beautifully printed edition of alfred de musset, and a copy of théophile gautier's _mademoiselle de maupin_. how did these exotic books come to be there alone in a deserted new england farm-house? this question was to be answered later in a strange way. meanwhile i had fallen in love with the sad, old, silent place, and as i closed the white gate and was once more on the road, i looked about for someone who could tell me whether or not this house of ghosts might be rented for the summer by a comparatively living man. i was referred to a fine old new england farm-house shining white through the trees a quarter of a mile away. there i met an ancient couple, a typical new england farmer and his wife; the old man, lean, chin-bearded, with keen gray eyes flickering occasionally with a shrewd humor, the old lady with a kindly old face of the withered-apple type and ruddy. they were evidently prosperous people, but their minds--for some reason i could not at the moment divine--seemed to be divided between their new england desire to drive a hard bargain and their disinclination to let the house at all. over and over again they spoke of the loneliness of the place. they feared i would find it very lonely. no one had lived in it for a long time, and so on. it seemed to me that afterwards i understood their curious hesitation, but at the moment only regarded it as a part of the circuitous new england method of bargaining. at all events, the rent i offered finally overcame their disinclination, whatever its cause, and so i came into possession--for four months--of that silent old house, with the white lilacs, and the drowsy barns, and the old piano, and the strange orchard; and, as the summer came on, and the year changed its name from may to june, i used to lie under the apple-trees in the afternoons, dreamily reading some old book, and through half-sleepy eyelids watching the silken shimmer of the sound. i had lived in the old house for about a month, when one afternoon a strange thing happened to me. i remember the date well. it was the afternoon of tuesday, june <UNK> i was reading, or rather dipping here and there, in burton's _anatomy of melancholy_. as i read, i remember that a little unripe apple, with a petal or two of blossom still clinging to it, fell upon the old yellow page. then i suppose i must have fallen into a dream, though it seemed to me that both my eyes and my ears were wide open, for i suddenly became aware of a beautiful young voice singing very softly somewhere among the leaves. the singing was very frail, almost imperceptible, as though it came out of the air. it came and went fitfully, like the elusive fragrance of sweetbrier--as though a girl was walking to and fro, dreamily humming to herself in the still afternoon. yet there was no one to be seen. the orchard had never seemed more lonely. and another fact that struck me as strange was that the words that floated to me out of the aerial music were french, half sad, half gay snatches of some long-dead singer of old france, i looked about for the origin of the sweet sounds, but in vain. could it be the birds that were singing in french in this strange orchard? presently the voice seemed to come quite close to me, so near that it might have been the voice of a dryad singing to me out of the tree against which i was leaning. and this time i distinctly caught the words of the sad little song: _"chante, rossignol, chante, toi qui as le coeur gai; tu as le coeur à rire, moi, je l'ai-t-à pleurer."_ but, though the voice was at my shoulder, i could see no one, and then the singing stopped with what sounded like a sob; and a moment or two later i seemed to hear a sound of sobbing far down the orchard. then there followed silence, and i was left to ponder on the strange occurrence. naturally, i decided that it was just a day-dream between sleeping and waking over the pages of an old book; yet when next day and the day after the invisible singer was in the orchard again, i could not be satisfied with such mere matter-of-fact explanation. _"a la claire fontaine,"_ went the voice to and fro through the thick orchard boughs, _"m'en allant promener, j'ai trouvé l'eau si belle que je m'y suis baigné, lui y a longtemps que je t'aime, jamais je ne t'oubliai."_ it was certainly uncanny to hear that voice going to and fro the orchard, there somewhere amid the bright sun-dazzled boughs--yet not a human creature to be seen--not another house even within half a mile. the most materialistic mind could hardly but conclude that here was something "not dreamed of in our philosophy." it seemed to me that the only reasonable explanation was the entirely irrational one--that my orchard was haunted: haunted by some beautiful young spirit, with some sorrow of lost joy that would not let her sleep quietly in her grave. and next day i had a curious confirmation of my theory. once more i was lying under my favorite apple-tree, half reading and half watching the sound, lulled into a dream by the whir of insects and the spices called up from the earth by the hot sun. as i bent over the page, i suddenly had the startling impression that someone was leaning over my shoulder and reading with me, and that a girl's long hair was falling over me down on to the page. the book was the ronsard i had found in the little bedroom. i turned, but again there was nothing there. yet this time i knew that i had not been dreaming, and i cried out: "poor child! tell me of your grief--that i may help your sorrowing heart to rest." but, of course, there was no answer; yet that night i dreamed a strange dream. i thought i was in the orchard again in the afternoon and once again heard the strange singing--but this time, as i looked up, the singer was no longer invisible. coming toward me was a young girl with wonderful blue eyes filled with tears and gold hair that fell to her waist. she wore a straight, white robe that might have been a shroud or a bridal dress. she appeared not to see me, though she came directly to the tree where i was sitting. and there she knelt and buried her face in the grass and sobbed as if her heart would break. her long hair fell over her like a mantle, and in my dream i stroked it pityingly and murmured words of comfort for a sorrow i did not understand.... then i woke suddenly as one does from dreams. the moon was shining brightly into the room. rising from my bed, i looked out into the orchard. it was almost as bright as day. i could plainly see the tree of which i had been dreaming, and then a fantastic notion possessed me. slipping on my clothes, i went out into one of the old barns and found a spade. then i went to the tree where i had seen the girl weeping in my dream and dug down at its foot. i had dug little more than a foot when my spade struck upon some hard substance, and in a few more moments i had uncovered and exhumed a small box, which, on examination, proved to be one of those pretty old-fashioned chippendale work-boxes used by our grandmothers to keep their thimbles and needles in, their reels of cotton and skeins of silk. after smoothing down the little grave in which i had found it, i carried the box into the house, and under the lamplight examined its contents. then at once i understood why that sad young spirit went to and fro the orchard singing those little french songs--for the treasure-trove i had found under the apple-tree, the buried treasure of an unquiet, suffering soul, proved to be a number of love-letters written mostly in french in a very picturesque hand--letters, too, written but some five or six years before. perhaps i should not have read them--yet i read them with such reverence for the beautiful, impassioned love that animated them, and literally made them "smell sweet and blossom in the dust," that i felt i had the sanction of the dead to make myself the confidant of their story. among the letters were little songs, two of which i had heard the strange young voice singing in the orchard, and, of course, there were many withered flowers and such like remembrances of bygone rapture. not that night could i make out all the story, though it was not difficult to define its essential tragedy, and later on a gossip in the neighborhood and a headstone in the churchyard told me the rest. the unquiet young soul that had sung so wistfully to and fro the orchard was my landlord's daughter. she was the only child of her parents, a beautiful, willful girl, exotically unlike those from whom she was sprung and among whom she lived with a disdainful air of exile. she was, as a child, a little creature of fairy fancies, and as she grew up it was plain to her father and mother that she had come from another world than theirs. to them she seemed like a child in an old fairy-tale strangely found on his hearth by some shepherd as he returns from the fields at evening--a little fairy girl swaddled in fine linen, and dowered with a mysterious bag of gold. soon she developed delicate spiritual needs to which her simple parents were strangers. from long truancies in the woods she would come home laden with mysterious flowers, and soon she came to ask for books and pictures and music, of which the poor souls that had given her birth had never heard. finally she had her way, and went to study at a certain fashionable college; and there the brief romance of her life began. there she met a romantic young frenchman who had read ronsard to her and written her those picturesque letters i had found in the old mahogany work-box. and after a while the young frenchman had gone back to france, and the letters had ceased. month by month went by, and at length one day, as she sat wistful at the window, looking out at the foolish sunlit road, a message came. he was dead. that headstone in the village churchyard tells the rest. she was very young to die--scarcely nineteen years; and the dead who have died young, with all their hopes and dreams still like unfolded buds within their hearts, do not rest so quietly in the grave as those who have gone through the long day from morning until evening and are only too glad to sleep. * * * * * next day i took the little box to a quiet corner of the orchard, and made a little pyre of fragrant boughs--for so i interpreted the wish of that young, unquiet spirit--and the beautiful words are now safe, taken up again into the aerial spaces from which they came. but since then the birds sing no more little french songs in my old orchard. the bowmen by arthur machen from _the bowmen_, by arthur machen. published in england by simpkin, marshall, hamilton, kent & co., ltd., and in america by g.p. putnam's sons. by permission of the publishers and arthur machen. it was during the retreat of the eighty thousand, and the authority of the censorship is sufficient excuse for not being more explicit. but it was on the most awful day of that awful time, on the day when ruin and disaster came so near that their shadow fell over london far away; and, without any certain news, the hearts of men failed within them and grew faint; as if the agony of the army in the battlefield had entered into their souls. on this dreadful day, then, when three hundred thousand men in arms with all their artillery swelled like a flood against the little english company, there was one point above all other points in our battle line that was for a time in awful danger, not merely of defeat, but of utter annihilation. with the permission of the censorship and of the military expert, this corner may, perhaps, be described as a salient, and if this angle were crushed and broken, then the english force as a whole would be shattered, the allied left would be turned, and sedan would inevitably follow. all the morning the german guns had thundered and shrieked against this corner, and against the thousand or so of men who held it. the men joked at the shells, and found funny names for them, and had bets about them, and greeted them with scraps of music-hall songs. but the shells came on and burst, and tore good englishmen limb from limb, and tore brother from brother, and as the heat of the day increased so did the fury of that terrific cannonade. there was no help, it seemed. the english artillery was good, but there was not nearly enough of it; it was being steadily battered into scrap iron. there comes a moment in a storm at sea when people say to one another, "it is at its worst; it can blow no harder," and then there is a blast ten times more fierce than any before it. so it was in these british trenches. there were no stouter hearts in the whole world than the hearts of these men; but even they were appalled as this seven-times-heated hell of the german cannonade fell upon them and overwhelmed them and destroyed them. and at this very moment they saw from their trenches that a tremendous host was moving against their lines. five hundred of the thousand remained, and as far as they could see the german infantry was pressing on against them, column upon column, a gray world of men, ten thousand of them, as it appeared afterwards. there was no hope at all. they shook hands, some of them. one man improvised a new version of the battle-song, "good-by, good-by to tipperary," ending with "and we shan't get there." and they all went on firing steadily. the officer pointed out that such an opportunity for high-class fancy shooting might never occur again; the tipperary humorist asked, "what price sidney street?" and the few machine guns did their best. but everybody knew it was of no use. the dead gray bodies lay in companies and battalions, as others came on and on and on, and they swarmed and stirred, and advanced from beyond and beyond. "world without end. amen," said one of the british soldiers with some irrelevance as he took aim and fired. and then he remembered--he says he cannot think why or wherefore--a queer vegetarian restaurant in london where he had once or twice eaten eccentric dishes of cutlets made of lentils and nuts that pretended to be steak. on all the plates in this restaurant there was printed a figure of st. george in blue, with the motto, "_adsit anglis sanctus georgius_"--"may st. george be a present help to the english." this soldier happened to know latin and other useless things, and now, as he fired at his man in the gray advancing mass--three hundred yards away--he uttered the pious vegetarian motto. he went on firing to the end, and at last bill on his right had to clout him cheerfully over the head to make him stop, pointing out as he did so that the king's ammunition cost money and was not lightly to be wasted in drilling funny patterns into dead germans. for as the latin scholar uttered his invocation he felt something between a shudder and an electric shock pass through his body. the roar of the battle died down in his ears to a gentle murmur; instead of it, he says, he heard a great voice and a shout louder than a thunder-peal crying, "array, array, array!" his heart grew hot as a burning coal, it grew cold as ice within him, as it seemed to him that a tumult of voices answered to his summons. he heard, or seemed to hear, thousands shouting: "st. george! st. george!" "ha! messire, ha! sweet saint, grant us good deliverance!" "st. george for merry england!" "harow! harow! monseigneur st. george, succor us!" "ha! st. george! ha! st. george! a long bow and a strong bow." "heaven's knight, aid us!" and as the soldier heard these voices he saw before him, beyond the trench, a long line of shapes, with a shining about them. they were like men who drew the bow, and with another shout, their cloud of arrows flew singing and tingling through the air towards the german hosts. the other men in the trench were firing all the while. they had no hope; but they aimed just as if they had been shooting at bisley. suddenly one of them lifted up his voice in the plainest english. "gawd help us!" he bellowed to the man next to him, "but we're blooming marvels! look at those gray ... gentlemen, look at them! d'ye see them? they're not going down in dozens nor in 'undreds; it's thousands, it is. look! look! there's a regiment gone while i'm talking to ye." "shut it!" the other soldier bellowed, taking aim, "what are ye gassing about?" but he gulped with astonishment even as he spoke, for, indeed, the gray men were falling by the thousands. the english could hear the guttural scream of the german officers, the crackle of their revolvers as they shot the reluctant; and still line after line crashed to the earth. all the while the latin-bred soldier heard the cry: "harow! harow! monseigneur, dear saint, quick to our aid! st. george help us!" "high chevalier, defend us!" the singing arrows fled so swift and thick that they darkened the air, the heathen horde melted from before them. "more machine guns!" bill yelled to tom. "don't hear them," tom yelled back. "but, thank god, anyway; they've got it in the neck." in fact, there were ten thousand dead german soldiers left before that salient of the english army, and consequently there was no sedan. in germany, a country ruled by scientific principles, the great general staff decided that the contemptible english must have employed shells containing an unknown gas of a poisonous nature, as no wounds were discernible on the bodies of the dead german soldiers. but the man who knew what nuts tasted like when they called themselves steak knew also that st. george had brought his agincourt bowmen to help the english. a ghost by guy de maupassant translated for this volume by m. charles sommer. we were speaking of sequestration, alluding to a recent lawsuit. it was at the close of a friendly evening in a very old mansion in the rue de grenelle, and each of the guests had a story to tell, which he assured us was true. then the old marquis de la tour-samuel, eighty-two years of age, rose and came forward to lean on the mantelpiece. he told the following story in his slightly quavering voice. "i, also, have witnessed a strange thing--so strange that it has been the nightmare of my life. it happened fifty-six years ago, and yet there is not a month when i do not see it again in my dreams. from that day i have borne a mark, a stamp of fear,--do you understand? "yes, for ten minutes i was a prey to terror, in such a way that ever since a constant dread has remained in my soul. unexpected sounds chill me to the heart; objects which i can ill distinguish in the evening shadows make me long to flee. i am afraid at night. "no! i would not have owned such a thing before reaching my present age. but now i may tell everything. one may fear imaginary dangers at eighty-two years old. but before actual danger i have never turned back, _mesdames_. "that affair so upset my mind, filled me with such a deep, mysterious unrest that i never could tell it. i kept it in that inmost part, that corner where we conceal our sad, our shameful secrets, all the weaknesses of our life which cannot be confessed. "i will tell you that strange happening just as it took place, with no attempt to explain it. unless i went mad for one short hour it must be explainable, though. yet i was not mad, and i will prove it to you. imagine what you will. here are the simple facts: "it was in <UNK> in july. i was quartered with my regiment in rouen. "one day, as i was strolling on the quay, i came across a man i believed i recognized, though i could not place him with certainty. i instinctively went more slowly, ready to pause. the stranger saw my impulse, looked at me, and fell into my arms. "it was a friend of my younger days, of whom i had been very fond. he seemed to have become half a century older in the five years since i had seen him. his hair was white, and he stooped in his walk, as if he were exhausted. he understood my amazement and told me the story of his life. "a terrible event had broken him down. he had fallen madly in love with a young girl and married her in a kind of dreamlike ecstasy. after a year of unalloyed bliss and unexhausted passion, she had died suddenly of heart disease, no doubt killed by love itself. "he had left the country on the very day of her funeral, and had come to live in his hotel at rouen. he remained there, solitary and desperate, grief slowly mining him, so wretched that he constantly thought of suicide. "'as i thus came across you again,' he said, 'i shall ask a great favor of you. i want you to go to my château and get some papers i urgently need. they are in the writing-desk of my room, of _our_ room. i cannot send a servant or a lawyer, as the errand must be kept private. i want absolute silence. "'i shall give you the key of the room, which i locked carefully myself before leaving, and the key to the writing-desk. i shall also give you a note for the gardener, who will let you in. "'come to breakfast with me to-morrow, and we'll talk the matter over.' "i promised to render him that slight service. it would mean but a pleasant excursion for me, his home not being more than twenty-five miles from rouen. i could go there in an hour on horseback. "at ten o'clock the next day i was with him. we breakfasted alone together, yet he did not utter more than twenty words. he asked me to excuse him. the thought that i was going to visit the room where his happiness lay shattered, upset him, he said. indeed, he seemed perturbed, worried, as if some mysterious struggle were taking place in his soul. "at last he explained exactly what i was to do. it was very simple. i was to take two packages of letters and some papers, locked in the first drawer at the right of the desk of which i had the key. he added: "'i need not ask you not to glance at them.' "i was almost hurt by his words, and told him so, rather sharply. he stammered: "'forgive me. i suffer so much!' "and tears came to his eyes. "i left about one o'clock to accomplish my errand. "the day was radiant, and i rushed through the meadows, listening to the song of the larks, and the rhythmical beat of my sword on my riding-boots. "then i entered the forest, and i set my horse to walking. branches of the trees softly caressed my face, and now and then i would catch a leaf between my teeth and bite it with avidity, full of the joy of life, such as fills you without reason, with a tumultuous happiness almost indefinable, a kind of magical strength. "as i neared the house i took out the letter for the gardener, and noted with surprise that it was sealed. i was so amazed and so annoyed that i almost turned back without fulfilling my mission. then i thought that i should thus display over-sensitiveness and bad taste. my friend might have sealed it unconsciously, worried as he was. "the manor looked as though it had been deserted the last twenty years. the gate, wide-open and rotten, held, one wondered how. grass filled the paths; you could not tell the flower-beds from the lawn. "at the noise i made kicking a shutter, an old man came out from a side-door and was apparently amazed to see me there. i dismounted from my horse and gave him the letter. he read it once or twice, turned it over, looked at me with suspicion, and asked: "'well, what do you want?' "i answered sharply: "'you must know it as you have read your master's orders. i want to get in the house.' "he appeared overwhelmed. he said: "'so--you are going in--in his room?' "i was getting impatient. "'_parbleu!_ do you intend to question me, by chance?' "he stammered: "'no--monsieur--only--it has not been opened since--since the death. if you will wait five minutes, i will go in to see whether----' "i interrupted angrily: "'see here, are you joking? you can't go in that room, as i have the key!' "he no longer knew what to say. "'then, monsieur, i will show you the way.' "'show me the stairs and leave me alone. i can find it without your help.' "'but--still--monsieur----' "then i lost my temper. "'now be quiet! else you'll be sorry!' "i roughly pushed him aside and went into the house. "i first went through the kitchen, then crossed two small rooms occupied by the man and his wife. from there i stepped into a large hall. i went up the stairs, and i recognized the door my friend had described to me. "i opened it with ease and went in. "the room was so dark that at first i could not distinguish anything. i paused, arrested by that moldy and stale odor peculiar to deserted and condemned rooms, of dead rooms. then gradually my eyes grew accustomed to the gloom, and i saw rather clearly a great room in disorder, a bed without sheets having still its mattresses and pillows, one of which bore the deep print of an elbow or a head, as if someone had just been resting on it. "the chairs seemed all in confusion. i noticed that a door, probably that of a closet, had remained ajar. "i first went to the window and opened it to get some light, but the hinges of the outside shutters were so rusted that i could not loosen them. "i even tried to break them with my sword, but did not succeed. as those fruitless attempts irritated me, and as my eyes were by now adjusted to the dim light, i gave up hope of getting more light and went toward the writing-desk. "i sat down in an arm-chair, folded back the top, and opened the drawer. it was full to the edge. i needed but three packages, which i knew how to distinguish, and i started looking for them. "i was straining my eyes to decipher the inscriptions, when i thought i heard, or rather felt a rustle behind me. i took no notice, thinking a draft had lifted some curtain. but a minute later, another movement, almost indistinct, sent a disagreeable little shiver over my skin. it was so ridiculous to be moved thus even so slightly, that i would not turn round, being ashamed. i had just discovered the second package i needed, and was on the point of reaching for the third, when a great and sorrowful sigh, close to my shoulder, made me give a mad leap two yards away. in my spring i had turned round, my hand on the hilt of my sword, and surely had i not felt that, i should have fled like a coward. "a tall woman, dressed in white, was facing me, standing behind the chair in which i had sat a second before. "such a shudder ran through me that i almost fell back! oh, no one who has not felt them can understand those gruesome and ridiculous terrors! the soul melts; your heart seems to stop; your whole body becomes limp as a sponge, and your innermost parts seem collapsing. "i do not believe in ghosts; and yet i broke down before the hideous fear of the dead; and i suffered, oh, i suffered more in a few minutes, in the irresistible anguish of supernatural dread, than i have suffered in all the rest of my life! "if she had not spoken, i might have died. but she did speak; she spoke in a soft and plaintive voice which set my nerves vibrating. i could not say that i regained my self-control. no, i was past knowing what i did; but the kind of pride i have in me, as well as a military pride, helped me to maintain, almost in spite of myself, an honorable countenance. i was making a pose, a pose for myself, and for her, for her, whatever she was, woman, or phantom. i realized this later, for at the time of the apparition, i could think of nothing. i was afraid. "she said: "'oh, you can be of great help to me, monsieur!' "i tried to answer, but i was unable to utter one word. a vague sound came from my throat. "she continued: "'will you? you can save me, cure me. i suffer terribly. i always suffer. i suffer, oh, i suffer!' "and she sat down gently in my chair. she looked at me. "'will you?' "i nodded my head, being still paralyzed. "then she handed me a woman's comb of tortoise-shell, and murmured: "'comb my hair! oh, comb my hair! that will cure me. look at my head--how i suffer! and my hair--how it hurts!' "her loose hair, very long, very black, it seemed to me, hung over the back of the chair, touching the floor. "why did i do it? why did i, shivering, accept that comb, and why did i take between my hands her long hair, which left on my skin a ghastly impression of cold, as if i had handled serpents? i do not know. "that feeling still clings about my fingers, and i shiver when i recall it. "i combed her, i handled, i know not how, that hair of ice. i bound and unbound it; i plaited it as one plaits a horse's mane. she sighed, bent her head, seemed happy. "suddenly she said, 'thank you!' tore the comb from my hands, and fled through the door which i had noticed was half opened. "left alone, i had for a few seconds the hazy feeling one feels in waking up from a nightmare. then i recovered myself. i ran to the window and broke the shutters by my furious assault. "a stream of light poured in. i rushed to the door through which that being had gone. i found it locked and immovable. "then a fever of flight seized on me, a panic, the true panic of battle. i quickly grasped the three packages of letters from the open desk; i crossed the room running, i took the steps of the stairway four at a time. i found myself outside, i don't know how, and seeing my horse close by, i mounted in one leap and left at a full gallop. "i didn't stop till i reached rouen and drew up in front of my house. having thrown the reins to my orderly, i flew to my room and locked myself in to think. "then for an hour i asked myself whether i had not been the victim of an hallucination. certainly i must have had one of those nervous shocks, one of those brain disorders such as give rise to miracles, to which the supernatural owes its strength. "and i had almost concluded that it was a vision, an illusion of my senses, when i came near to the window. my eyes by chance looked down. my tunic was covered with hairs, long woman's hairs which had entangled themselves around the buttons! "i took them off one by one and threw them out of the window with trembling fingers. "i then called my orderly. i felt too perturbed, too moved, to go and see my friend on that day. besides, i needed to think over what i should tell him. "i had his letters delivered to him. he gave a receipt to the soldier. he inquired after me and was told that i was not well. i had had a sunstroke, or something. he seemed distressed. "i went to see him the next day, early in the morning, bent on telling him the truth. he had gone out the evening before and had not come back. "i returned the same day, but he had not been seen. i waited a week. he did not come back. i notified the police. they searched for him everywhere, but no one could find any trace of his passing or of his retreat. "a careful search was made in the deserted manor. no suspicious clue was discovered. "there was no sign that a woman had been concealed there. "the inquest gave no result, and so the search went no further. "and in fifty-six years i have learned nothing more. i never found out the truth."

"we are in love's hand to-day!" sings gautier, in swinburne's buoyant paraphrase,--and from morn to sunset we are wafted on the violent sea: there is but one love, one may, one flowery strand. love is eternal, all else unreal and put aside. the vision has an end, the scene changes; but we have gained something, the memory of a charm. as many poets, so many charms. there is the charm of evanescence, that which lends to supreme beauty and grace an aureole of pathos. share with landor his one "night of memories and of sighs" for rose aylmer, and you have this to the full. and now take the hand of a new-world minstrel, strayed from some proper habitat to that rude and dissonant america which, as baudelaire saw, "was for poe only a vast prison through which he ran, hither and thither, with the feverish agitation of a being created to breathe in a purer world," and where "his interior life, spiritual as a poet, spiritual even as a drunkard, was but one perpetual effort to escape the influence of this antipathetical atmosphere." clasp the sensitive hand of a troubled singer dreeing thus his weird, and share with him the clime in which he found,--never throughout the day, always in the night,--if not the atlantis whence he had wandered, at least a place of refuge from the bounds in which by day he was immured. to one land only he has power to lead you, and for one night only can you share his dream. a tract of neither earth nor heaven: "no-man's-land," out of space, out of time. here are the perturbed ones, through whose eyes, like those of the cenci, the soul finds windows though the mind is dazed; here spirits, groping for the path which leads to eternity, are halted and delayed. it is the limbo of "planetary souls," wherein are all moonlight uncertainties, all lost loves and illusions. here some are fixed in trance, the only respite attainable; others "move fantastically to a discordant melody:" while everywhere are "sheeted memories of the past-- shrouded forms that start and sigh as they pass the wanderer by." such is the land, and for one night we enter it,--a night of astral phases and recurrent chimes. its monodies are twelve poems, whose music strives to change yet ever is the same. one by one they sound, like the chiming of the brazen and ebony clock, in "the masque of the red death," which made the waltzers pause with "disconcert and tremulousness and meditation," as often as the hour came round. of all these mystical cadences, the plaint of _the raven_, vibrating through the portal, chiefly has impressed the outer world. what things go to the making of a poem,--and how true in this, as in most else, that race which named its bards "the makers"? a work is called out of the void. where there was nothing, it remains,--a new creation, part of the treasure of mankind. and a few exceptional lyrics, more than others that are equally creative, compel us to think anew how bravely the poet's pen turns things unknown "to shapes, and gives to airy nothing a local habitation, and a name." each seems without a prototype, yet all fascinate us with elements wrested from the shadow of the supernatural. now the highest imagination is concerned about the soul of things; it may or may not inspire the fantasy that peoples with images the interlunar vague. still, one of these lyrics, in its smaller way, affects us with a sense of uniqueness, as surely as the sublimer works of a supernatural cast,--marlowe's "faustus," the "faust" of goethe, "manfred," or even those ethereal masterpieces, "the tempest" and "a midsummer night's dream." more than one, while otherwise unique, has some burden or refrain which haunts the memory,--once heard, never forgotten, like the tone of a rarely used but distinctive organ-stop. notable among them is bürger's "lenore," that ghostly and resonant ballad, the lure and foil of the translators. few will deny that coleridge's wondrous "rime of the ancient mariner" stands at their very head. "le juif-errant" would have claims, had beranger been a greater poet; and, but for their remoteness from popular sympathy, "the lady of shalott" and "the blessed damozel" might be added to the list. it was given to edgar allan poe to produce two lyrics, "the bells" and _the raven_, each of which, although perhaps of less beauty than those of tennyson and rossetti, is a unique. "ulalume," while equally strange and imaginative, has not the universal quality that is a portion of our test. _the raven_ in sheer poetical constituents falls below such pieces as "the haunted palace," "the city in the sea," "the sleeper," and "israfel." the whole of it would be exchanged, i suspect, by readers of a fastidious cast, for such passages as these: "around, by lifting winds forgot, resignedly beneath the sky the melancholy waters lie. no rays from the holy heaven come down on the long night-time of that town; but light from out the lurid sea streams up the turrets silently-- * * * up many and many a marvellous shrine whose wreathéd friezes intertwine the viol, the violet, and the vine. * * * no swellings tell that winds may be upon some far-off happier sea-- no heavings hint that winds have been on seas less hideously serene." it lacks the aerial melody of the poet whose heart-strings are a lute: "and they say (the starry choir and the other listening things) that israfeli's fire is owing to that lyre by which he sits and sings-- the trembling living wire of those unusual strings." but _the raven_, like "the bells" and "annabel lee," commends itself to the many and the few. i have said elsewhere that poe's rarer productions seemed to me "those in which there is the appearance, at least, of spontaneity,--in which he yields to his feelings, while dying falls and cadences most musical, most melancholy, come from him unawares." this is still my belief; and yet, upon a fresh study of this poem, it impresses me more than at any time since my boyhood. close acquaintance tells in favor of every true work of art. induce the man, who neither knows art nor cares for it, to examine some poem or painting, and how soon its force takes hold of him! in fact, he will overrate the relative value of the first good work by which his attention has been fairly caught. _the raven_, also, has consistent qualities which even an expert must admire. in no other of its author's poems is the motive more palpably defined. "the haunted palace" is just as definite to the select reader, but poe scarcely would have taken that subtle allegory for bald analysis. _the raven_ is wholly occupied with the author's typical theme--the irretrievable loss of an idolized and beautiful woman; but on other grounds, also, the public instinct is correct in thinking it his representative poem. a man of genius usually gains a footing with the success of some one effort, and this is not always his greatest. recognition is the more instant for having been postponed. he does not acquire it, like a miser's fortune, coin after coin, but "not at all or all in all." and thus with other ambitions: the courtier, soldier, actor,--whatever their parts,--each counts his triumph from some lucky stroke. poe's raven, despite augury, was for him "the bird that made the breeze to blow." the poet settled in new-york, in the winter of <UNK> finding work upon willis's paper, "the evening mirror," and eking out his income by contributions elsewhere. for six years he had been an active writer, and enjoyed a professional reputation; was held in both respect and misdoubt, and was at no loss for his share of the ill-paid journalism of that day. he also had done much of his very best work,--such tales as "ligeia" and "the fall of the house of usher," (the latter containing that mystical counterpart, in verse, of elihu vedder's "a lost mind,") such analytic feats as "the gold bug" and "the mystery of marie roget." he had made proselytes abroad, and gained a lasting hold upon the french mind. he had learned his own power and weakness, and was at his prime, and not without a certain reputation. but he had written nothing that was on the tongue of everybody. to rare and delicate work some popular touch must be added to capture the general audience of one's own time. through the industry of poe's successive biographers, the hit made by _the raven_ has become an oft-told tale. the poet's young wife, virginia, was fading before his eyes, but lingered for another year within death's shadow. the long, low chamber in the house near the bloomingdale road is as famous as the room where rouget de l'isle composed the marseillaise. all have heard that the poem, signed "quarles," appeared in the "american review," with a pseudo-editorial comment on its form; that poe received ten dollars for it; that willis, the kindest and least envious of fashionable arbiters, reprinted it with a eulogy that instantly made it town-talk. all doubt of its authorship was dispelled when poe recited it himself at a literary gathering, and for a time he was the most marked of american authors. the hit stimulated and encouraged him. like another and prouder satirist, he too found "something of summer" even "in the hum of insects." sorrowfully enough, but three years elapsed,--a period of influence, pride, anguish, yet always of imaginative or critical labor,--before the final defeat, before the curtain dropped on a life that for him was in truth a tragedy, and he yielded to "the conqueror worm." "the american review: a whig journal" was a creditable magazine for the time, double-columned, printed on good paper with clear type, and illustrated by mezzotint portraits. amid much matter below the present standard, it contained some that any editor would be glad to receive. the initial volume, for <UNK> has articles by horace greeley, donald mitchell, walter whitman, marsh, tuckerman, and whipple. ralph hoyt's quaint poem, "old," appeared in this volume. and here are three lyrics by poe: "the city in the sea," "the valley of unrest," and _the raven_. two of these were built up,--such was his way,--from earlier studies, but the last-named came out as if freshly composed, and almost as we have it now. the statement that it was not afterward revised is erroneous. eleven trifling changes from the magazine-text appear in _the raven and other poems_, <UNK> a book which the poet shortly felt encouraged to offer the public. these are mostly changes of punctuation, or of single words, the latter kind made to heighten the effect of alliteration. in mr. lang's pretty edition of poe's verse, brought out in the "parchment library," he has shown the instinct of a scholar, and has done wisely, in going back to the text in the volume just mentioned, as given in the london issue of <UNK> the "standard" griswold collection of the poet's works abounds with errors. these have been repeated by later editors, who also have made errors of their own. but the text of _the raven_, owing to the requests made to the author for manuscript copies, was still farther revised by him; in fact, he printed it in richmond, just before his death, with the poetic substitution of "seraphim whose foot-falls" for "angels whose faint foot-falls," in the fourteenth stanza. our present text, therefore, while substantially that of <UNK> is somewhat modified by the poet's later reading, and is, i think, the most correct and effective version of this single poem. the most radical change from the earliest version appeared, however, in the volume in <UNK> the eleventh stanza originally having contained these lines, faulty in rhyme and otherwise a blemish on the poem: "caught from some unhappy master, whom unmerciful disaster followed fast and followed faster--so, when hope he would adjure, stern despair returned, instead of the sweet hope he dared adjure-- that sad answer, 'nevermore!'" it would be well if other, and famous, poets could be as sure of making their changes always improvements. poe constantly rehandled his scanty show of verse, and usually bettered it. _the raven_ was the first of the few poems which he nearly brought to completion before printing. it may be that those who care for poetry lost little by his death. fluent in prose, he never wrote verse for the sake of making a poem. when a refrain of image haunted him, the lyric that resulted was the inspiration, as he himself said, of a passion, not of a purpose. this was at intervals so rare as almost to justify the fairfield theory that each was the product of a nervous crisis. what, then, gave the poet his clue to _the raven_? from what misty foundation did it rise slowly to a music slowly breathed? as usual, more than one thing went to the building of so notable a poem. considering the longer sermons often preached on brief and less suggestive texts, i hope not to be blamed for this discussion of a single lyric,--especially one which an artist like doré has made the subject of prodigal illustration. until recently i had supposed that this piece, and a few which its author composed after its appearance, were exceptional in not having grown from germs in his boyish verse. but mr. fearing gill has shown me some unpublished stanzas by poe, written in his eighteenth year, and entitled, "the demon of the fire." the manuscript appears to be in the poet's early handwriting, and its genuineness is vouched for by the family in whose possession it has remained for half a century. besides the plainest germs of "the bells" and "the haunted palace" it contains a few lines somewhat suggestive of the opening and close of _the raven_. as to the rhythm of our poem, a comparison of dates indicates that this was influenced by the rhythm of "lady geraldine's courtship." poe was one of the first to honor miss barrett's genius; he inscribed his collected poems to her as "the noblest of her sex," and was in sympathy with her lyrical method. the lines from her love-poem, "with a murmurous stir uncertain, in the air, the purple curtain swelleth in and swelleth out around her motionless pale brows," found an echo in these: "and the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain thrilled me--filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before." here poe assumed a privilege for which he roughly censured longfellow, and which no one ever sought on his own premises without swift detection and chastisement. in melody and stanzaic form, we shall see that the two poems are not unlike, but in motive they are totally distinct. the generous poetess felt nothing but the true originality of the poet. "this vivid writing!" she exclaimed,--"this power which is felt!... our great poet, mr. browning, author of 'paracelsus,' &c., is enthusiastic in his admiration of the rhythm." mr. ingram, after referring to "lady geraldine," cleverly points out another source from which poe may have caught an impulse. in <UNK> albert pike, the half-greek, half-frontiersman, poet of arkansas, had printed in "the new mirror," for which poe then was writing, some verses entitled "isadore," but since revised by the author and called "the widowed heart." i select from mr. pike's revision the following stanza, of which the main features correspond with the original version: "restless i pace our lonely rooms, i play our songs no more, the garish sun shines flauntingly upon the unswept floor; the mocking-bird still sits and sings, o melancholy strain! for my heart is like an autumn-cloud that overflows with rain; thou art lost to me forever, isadore!" here we have a prolonged measure, a similarity of refrain, and the introduction of a bird whose song enhances sorrow. there are other trails which may be followed by the curious; notably, a passage which mr. ingram selects from poe's final review of "barnaby rudge": "the raven, too, * * * might have been made, more than we now see it, a portion of the conception of the fantastic barnaby. * * * its character might have performed, in regard to that of the idiot, much the same part as does, in music, the accompaniment in respect to the air." nevertheless, after pointing out these germs and resemblances, the value of this poem still is found in its originality. the progressive music, the scenic detail and contrasted light and shade,--above all, the spiritual passion of the nocturn, make it the work of an informing genius. as for the gruesome bird, he is unlike all the other ravens of his clan, from the "twa corbies" and "three ravens" of the balladists to barnaby's rumpled "grip." here is no semblance of the cawing rook that haunts ancestral turrets and treads the field of heraldry; no boding phantom of which tickell sang that, when, "shrieking at her window thrice, the raven flap'd his wing, too well the love-lorn maiden knew the solemn boding sound." poe's raven is a distinct conception; the incarnation of a mourner's agony and hopelessness; a sable embodied memory, the abiding chronicler of doom, a type of the irreparable. escaped across the styx, from "the night's plutonian shore," he seems the imaged soul of the questioner himself,--of him who can not, will not, quaff the kind nepenthe, because the memory of lenore is all that is left him, and with the surcease of his sorrow even that would be put aside. _the raven_ also may be taken as a representative poem of its author, for its exemplification of all his notions of what a poem should be. these are found in his essays on "the poetic principle," "the rationale of verse," and "the philosophy of composition." poe declared that "in music, perhaps, the soul most nearly attains the great end for which, when inspired by the poetic sentiment, it struggles--the creation of supernal beauty.... verse cannot be better designated than as an inferior or less capable music"; but again, verse which is really the "poetry of words" is "the rhythmical creation of beauty,"--this and nothing more. the _tone_ of the highest beauty is one of sadness. the most melancholy of topics is death. this must be allied to beauty. "the death, then, of a beautiful woman is, unquestionably, the most poetical topic in the world,--and equally is it beyond doubt that the lips best suited for such a topic are those of a bereaved lover." these last expressions are quoted from poe's whimsical analysis of this very poem, but they indicate precisely the general range of his verse. the climax of "the bells" is the muffled monotone of ghouls, who glory in weighing down the human heart. "lenore," _the raven_, "the sleeper," "to one in paradise," and "ulalume" form a tenebrose symphony,--and "annabel lee," written last of all, shows that one theme possessed him to the end. again, these are all nothing if not musical, and some are touched with that quality of the fantastic which awakes the sense of awe, and adds a new fear to agony itself. through all is dimly outlined, beneath a shadowy pall, the poet's ideal love,--so often half-portrayed elsewhere,--the entombed wife of usher, the lady ligeia, in truth the counterpart of his own nature. i suppose that an artist's love for one "in the form" never can wholly rival his devotion to some ideal. the woman near him must exercise her spells, be all by turns and nothing long, charm him with infinite variety, or be content to forego a share of his allegiance. he must be lured by the unattainable, and this is ever just beyond him in his passion for creative art. poe, like hawthorne, came in with the decline of the romantic school, and none delighted more than he to laugh at its calamity. yet his heart was with the romancers and their oriental or gothic effects. his invention, so rich in the prose tales, seemed to desert him when he wrote verse; and his judgment told him that long romantic poems depend more upon incident than inspiration,--and that, to utter the poetry of romance, lyrics would suffice. hence his theory, clearly fitted to his own limitations, that "a 'long poem' is a flat contradiction in terms." the components of _the raven_ are few and simple: a man, a bird, and the phantasmal memory at a woman. but the piece affords a fine display of romantic material. what have we? the midnight; the shadowy chamber with its tomes of forgotten lore; the student,--a modern hieronymus; the raven's tap on the casement; the wintry night and dying fire; the silken wind-swept hangings; the dreams and vague mistrust of the echoing darkness; the black, uncanny bird upon the pallid bust; the accessories of violet velvet and the gloating lamp. all this stage effect of situation, light, color, sound, is purely romantic, and even melodramatic, but of a poetic quality that melodrama rarely exhibits, and thoroughly reflective of the poet's "eternal passion, eternal pain." the rhythmical structure of _the raven_ was sure to make an impression. rhyme, alliteration, the burden, the stanzaic form, were devised with singular adroitness. doubtless the poet was struck with the aptness of miss barrett's musical trochaics, in "eights," and especially by the arrangement adopted near the close of "lady geraldine": "'eyes,' he said, 'now throbbing through me! are ye eyes that did undo me? shining eyes, like antique jewels set in parian statue-stone! underneath that calm white forehead, are ye ever burning torrid o'er the desolate sand-desert of my heart and life undone?'" his artistic introduction of a third rhyme in both the second and fourth lines, and the addition of a fifth line and a final refrain, made the stanza of _the raven_. the persistent alliteration seems to come without effort, and often the rhymes within lines are seductive; while the refrain or burden dominates the whole work. here also he had profited by miss barrett's study of ballads and romaunts in her own and other tongues. a "refrain" is the lure wherewith a poet or a musician holds the wandering ear,--the recurrent longing of nature for the initial strain. i have always admired the beautiful refrains of the english songstress,--"the nightingales, the nightingales," "margret, margret," "my heart and i," "toll slowly," "the river floweth on," "pan, pan is dead," etc. she also employed what i term the repetend, in the use of which poe has excelled all poets since coleridge thus revived it: "o happy living things! no tongue their beauty might declare: a spring of love gushed from my heart, and i blessed them unaware: sure my kind saint took pity on me, and i blessed them unaware." poe created the fifth line of his stanza for the magic of the repetend. he relied upon it to the uttermost in a few later poems,--"lenore," "annabel lee," "ulalume," and "for annie." it gained a wild and melancholy music, i have thought, from the "sweet influences," of the afric burdens and repetends that were sung to him in childhood, attuning with their native melody the voice of our southern poet. "the philosophy of composition," his analysis of _the raven_, is a technical dissection of its method and structure. neither his avowal of cold-blooded artifice, nor his subsequent avowal to friends that an exposure of this artifice was only another of his intellectual hoaxes, need be wholly credited. if he had designed the complete work in advance, he scarcely would have made so harsh a prelude of rattle-pan rhymes to the delicious melody of the second stanza,--not even upon his theory of the fantastic. of course an artist, having perfected a work, sees, like the first artist, that it is good, and sees why it is good. a subsequent analysis, coupled with a disavowal of any sacred fire, readily enough may be made. my belief is that the first conception and rough draft of this poem came as inspiration always comes; that its author then saw how it might be perfected, giving it the final touches described in his chapter on composition, and that the latter, therefore, is neither wholly false nor wholly true. the harm of such analysis is that it tempts a novice to fancy that artificial processes can supersede imagination. the impulse of genius is to guard the secrets of its creative hour. glimpses obtained of the toil, the baffled experiments, which precede a triumph, as in the sketch-work of hawthorne recently brought to light, afford priceless instruction and encouragement to the sincere artist. but one who voluntarily exposes his muse to the gaze of all comers should recall the fate of king candaules. the world still thinks of poe as a "luckless man of genius." i recently heard him mentioned as "one whom everybody seems chartered to misrepresent, decry or slander." but it seems to me that his ill-luck ended with his pitiable death, and that since then his defence has been persistent, and his fame of as steadfast growth as a suffering and gifted author could pray for in his hopeful hour. griswold's decrial and slander turned the current in his favor. critics and biographers have come forward with successive refutations, with tributes to his character, with new editions of his works. his own letters and the minute incidents of his career are before us; the record, good and bad, is widely known. no appellor has received more tender and forgiving judgement. his mishaps in life belonged to his region and period, perchance still more to his own infirmity of will. doubtless his environment was not one to guard a fine-grained, ill-balanced nature from perils without and within. his strongest will, to be lord of himself, gained for him "that heritage of woe." he confessed himself the bird's unhappy master, the stricken sufferer of this poem. but his was a full share of that dramatic temper which exults in the presage of its own doom. there is a delight in playing one's high part: we are all gladiators, crying _ave imperator!_ to quote burke's matter of fact: "in grief the pleasure is still uppermost, and the affliction we suffer has no resemblance to absolute pain, which is always odious, and which we endeavor to shake off as soon as possible." poe went farther, and was an artist even in the tragedy of his career. if, according to his own belief, sadness and the vanishing of beauty are the highest poetic themes, and poetic feeling the keenest earthly pleasure, then the sorrow and darkness of his broken life were not without their frequent compensation. in the following pages, we have a fresh example of an artist's genius characterizing his interpretation of a famous poem. gustave doré, the last work of whose pencil is before us, was not the painter, or even the draughtsman, for realists demanding truth of tone, figure, and perfection. such matters concerned him less than to make shape and distance, light and shade, assist his purpose,--which was to excite the soul, the imagination, of the looker on. this he did by arousing our sense of awe, through marvellous and often sublime conceptions of things unutterable and full of gloom or glory. it is well said that if his works were not great paintings, as pictures they are great indeed. as a "literary artist," and such he was, his force was in direct ratio with the dramatic invention of his author, with the brave audacities of the spirit that kindled his own. hence his success with rabelais, with "le juif-errant," "les contes drolatiques," and "don quixote," and hence, conversely, his failure to express the beauty of tennyson's idyls, of "il paradiso," of the hebrew pastorals, and other texts requiring exaltation, or sweetness and repose. he was a born master of the grotesque, and by a special insight could portray the spectres of a haunted brain. we see objects as his personages saw them, and with the very eyes of the wandering jew, the bewildered don, or the goldsmith's daughter whose fancy so magnifies the king in the shop on the pont-au-change. it was in the nature of things that he should be attracted to each masterpiece of verse or prose that i have termed unique. the lower kingdoms were called into his service; his rocks, trees and mountains, the sky itself, are animate with motive and diablerie. had he lived to illustrate shakespeare, we should have seen a remarkable treatment of caliban, the witches, the storm in "lear"; but doubtless should have questioned his ideals of imogen or miranda. beauty pure and simple, and the perfect excellence thereof, he rarely seemed to comprehend. yet there is beauty in his designs for the "ancient mariner," unreal as they are, and a consecutiveness rare in a series by doré. the rime afforded him a prolonged story, with many shiftings of the scene. in _the raven_ sound and color preserve their monotone and we have no change of place or occasion. what is the result? doré proffers a series of variations upon the theme as he conceived it, "the enigma of death and the hallucination of an inconsolable soul." in some of these drawings his faults are evident; others reveal his powerful originality, and the best qualities in which, as a draughtsman, he stood alone. plainly there was something in common between the working moods of poe and doré. this would appear more clearly had the latter tried his hand upon the "tales of the grotesque and arabesque." both resorted often to the elf-land of fantasy and romance. in melodramatic feats they both, through their command of the supernatural, avoided the danger-line between the ideal and the absurd. poe was the truer worshipper of the beautiful; his love for it was a consecrating passion, and herein he parts company with his illustrator. poet or artist, death at last transfigures all: within the shadow of his sable harbinger, vedder's symbolic crayon aptly sets them face to face, but enfolds them with the mantle of immortal wisdom and power. an american woman has wrought the image of a star-eyed genius with the final torch, the exquisite semblance of one whose vision beholds, but whose lips may not utter, the mysteries of a land beyond "the door of a legended tomb." edmund c. stedman. the poem. [illustration] the raven. once upon a midnight dreary, while i pondered, weak and weary, over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore, while i nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping, as of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door. "'t is some visiter," i muttered, "tapping at my chamber door-- only this, and nothing more." ah, distinctly i remember it was in the bleak december, and each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor. eagerly i wished the morrow:--vainly i had sought to borrow from my books surcease of sorrow--sorrow for the lost lenore-- for the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name lenore-- nameless here for evermore. and the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain thrilled me--filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before; so that now, to still the beating of my heart, i stood repeating "'t is some visiter entreating entrance at my chamber door some late visiter entreating entrance at my chamber door;-- this it is, and nothing more." presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer, "sir," said i, "or madam, truly your forgiveness i implore; but the fact is i was napping, and so gently you came rapping, and so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door, that i scarce was sure i heard you"--here i opened wide the door;-- darkness there, and nothing more. deep into that darkness peering, long i stood there wondering, fearing, doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before; but the silence was unbroken, and the darkness gave no token, and the only word there spoken was the whispered word, "lenore!" this i whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, "lenore!" merely this and nothing more. back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning, soon again i heard a tapping, somewhat louder than before. "surely," said i, "surely that is something at my window lattice; let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore-- let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;-- 't is the wind and nothing more!" open here i flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter, in there stepped a stately raven of the saintly days of yore. not the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he; but, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door-- perched upon a bust of pallas just above my chamber door-- perched, and sat, and nothing more. then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling, by the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore, "though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou," i said, "art sure no craven, ghastly grim and ancient raven wandering from the nightly shore,-- tell me what thy lordly name is on the night's plutonian shore!" quoth the raven, "nevermore." much i marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly, though its answer little meaning--little relevancy bore; for we cannot help agreeing that no living human being ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door-- bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door, with such name as "nevermore." but the raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only that one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour. nothing further then he uttered--not a feather then he fluttered-- till i scarcely more than muttered, "other friends have flown before-- on the morrow _he_ will leave me, as my hopes have flown before." then the bird said, "nevermore." startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken, "doubtless," said i, "what it utters is its only stock and store, caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful disaster followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore-- till the dirges of his hope that melancholy burden bore of 'never--nevermore.'" but the raven still beguiling all my sad soul into smiling, straight i wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird and bust and door; then, upon the velvet sinking, i betook myself to linking fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore-- what this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt and ominous bird of yore meant in croaking "nevermore." this i sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing to the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom's core; this and more i sat divining, with my head at ease reclining on the cushion's velvet lining that the lamplight gloated o'er, but whose velvet violet lining with the lamplight gloating o'er _she_ shall press, ah, nevermore! then, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer swung by seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor. "wretch," i cried, "thy god hath lent thee--by these angels he hath sent thee respite--respite and nepenthe from thy memories of lenore! quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe, and forget this lost lenore!" quoth the raven, "nevermore." "prophet!" said i, "thing of evil!--prophet still, if bird or devil!-- whether tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore, desolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted-- on this home by horror haunted--tell me truly, i implore-- is there--_is_ there balm in gilead?--tell me--tell me, i implore!" quoth the raven, "nevermore." "prophet!" said i, "thing of evil--prophet still, if bird or devil! by that heaven that bends above, us--by that god we both adore-- tell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant aidenn, it shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name lenore-- clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name lenore." quoth the raven, "nevermore." "be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!" i shrieked, upstarting-- "get thee back into the tempest and the night's plutonian shore! leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken! leave my loneliness unbroken!--quit the bust above my door! take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!" quoth the raven, "nevermore." and the raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting on the pallid bust of pallas just above my chamber door; and his eyes have all the seeming of a demon's that is dreaming, and the lamplight o'er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor; and my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor shall be lifted--nevermore!

others not so much so. one consideration which deterred me was, that, having kept no journal during a greater portion of the time in which i was absent, i feared i should not be able to write, from mere memory, a statement so minute and connected as to have the _appearance_ of that truth it would really possess, barring only the natural and unavoidable exaggeration to which all of us are prone when detailing events which have had powerful influence in exciting the imaginative faculties. another reason was, that the incidents to be narrated were of a nature so positively marvellous, that, unsupported as my assertions must necessarily be (except by the evidence of a single individual, and he a half-breed indian), i could only hope for belief among my family, and those of my friends who have had reason, through life, to put faith in my veracity--the probability being that the public at large would regard what i should put forth as merely an impudent and ingenious fiction. a distrust in my own abilities as a writer was, nevertheless, one of the principal causes which prevented me from complying with the suggestions of my advisers. among those gentlemen in virginia who expressed the greatest interest in my statement, more particularly in regard to that portion of it which related to the antarctic ocean, was mr. poe, lately editor of the southern literary messenger, a monthly magazine, published by mr. thomas w. white, in the city of richmond. he strongly advised me, among others, to prepare at once a full account of what i had seen and undergone, and trust to the shrewdness and common sense of the public--insisting, with great plausibility, that however roughly, as regards mere authorship, my book should be got up, its very uncouthness, if there were any, would give it all the better chance of being received as truth. notwithstanding this representation, i did not make up my mind to do as he suggested. he afterward proposed (finding that i would not stir in the matter) that i should allow him to draw up, in his own words, a narrative of the earlier portion of my adventures, from facts afforded by myself, publishing it in the southern messenger _under the garb of fiction_. to this, perceiving no objection, i consented, stipulating only that my real name should be retained. two numbers of the pretended fiction appeared, consequently, in the messenger for january and february <UNK> and, in order that it might certainly be regarded as fiction, the name of mr. poe was affixed to the articles in the table of contents of the magazine. the manner in which this _ruse_ was received has induced me at length to undertake a regular compilation and publication of the adventures in question; for i found that, in spite of the air of fable which had been so ingeniously thrown around that portion of my statement which appeared in the messenger (without altering or distorting a single fact), the public were still not at all disposed to receive it as fable, and several letters were sent to mr. p.'s address distinctly expressing a conviction to the contrary. i thence concluded that the facts of my narrative would prove of such a nature as to carry with them sufficient evidence of their own authenticity, and that i had consequently little to fear on the score of popular incredulity. this _exposé_ being made, it will be seen at once how much of what follows i claim to be my own writing; and it will also be understood that no fact is misrepresented in the first few pages which were written by mr. poe. even to those readers who have not seen the messenger, it will be unnecessary to point out where his portion ends and my own commences; the difference in point of style will be readily perceived. a. g. pym. new-york, july, <UNK> narrative of a. gordon pym. my name is arthur gordon pym. my father was a respectable trader in sea-stores at nantucket, where i was born. my maternal grandfather was an attorney in good practice. he was fortunate in everything, and had speculated very successfully in stocks of the edgarton new-bank, as it was formerly called. by these and other means he had managed to lay by a tolerable sum of money. he was more attached to myself, i believe, than to any other person in the world, and i expected to inherit the most of his property at his death. he sent me, at six years of age, to the school of old mr. ricketts, a gentleman with only one arm, and of eccentric manners--he is well known to almost every person who has visited new bedford. i stayed at his school until i was sixteen, when i left him for mr. e. ronald's academy on the hill. here i became intimate with the son of mr. barnard, a sea captain, who generally sailed in the employ of lloyd and vredenburgh--mr. barnard is also very well known in new bedford, and has many relations, i am certain, in edgarton. his son was named augustus, and he was nearly two years older than myself. he had been on a whaling voyage with his father in the john donaldson, and was always talking to me of his adventures in the south pacific ocean. i used frequently to go home with him, and remain all day, and sometimes all night. we occupied the same bed, and he would be sure to keep me awake until almost light, telling me stories of the natives of the island of tinian, and other places he had visited in his travels. at last i could not help being interested in what he said, and by degrees i felt the greatest desire to go to sea. i owned a sail-boat called the ariel, and worth about seventy-five dollars. she had a half-deck or cuddy, and was rigged sloop-fashion--i forget her tonnage, but she would hold ten persons without much crowding. in this boat we were in the habit of going on some of the maddest freaks in the world; and, when i now think of them, it appears to me a thousand wonders that i am alive to-day. i will relate one of these adventures by way of introduction to a longer and more momentous narrative. one night there was a party at mr. barnard's, and both augustus and myself were not a little intoxicated towards the close of it. as usual, in such cases, i took part of his bed in preference to going home. he went to sleep, as i thought, very quietly (it being near one when the party broke up), and without saying a word on his favourite topic. it might have been half an hour from the time of our getting in bed, and i was just about falling into a doze, when he suddenly started up, and swore with a terrible oath that he would not go to sleep for any arthur pym in christendom, when there was so glorious a breeze from the southwest. i never was so astonished in my life, not knowing what he intended, and thinking that the wines and liquors he had drunk had set him entirely beside himself. he proceeded to talk very coolly, however, saying he knew that i supposed him intoxicated, but that he was never more sober in his life. he was only tired, he added, of lying in bed on such a fine night like a dog, and was determined to get up and dress, and go out on a frolic with the boat. i can hardly tell what possessed me, but the words were no sooner out of his mouth than i felt a thrill of the greatest excitement and pleasure, and thought his mad idea one of the most delightful and most reasonable things in the world. it was blowing almost a gale, and the weather was very cold--it being late in october. i sprang out of bed, nevertheless, in a kind of ecstasy, and told him i was quite as brave as himself, and quite as tired as he was of lying in bed like a dog, and quite as ready for any fun or frolic as any augustus barnard in nantucket. we lost no time in getting on our clothes and hurrying down to the boat. she was lying at the old decayed wharf by the lumber-yard of pankey & co., and almost thumping her sides out against the rough logs. augustus got into her and bailed her, for she was nearly half full of water. this being done, we hoisted jib and mainsail, kept full, and started boldly out to sea. the wind, as i before said, blew freshly from the southwest. the night was very clear and cold. augustus had taken the helm, and i stationed myself by the mast, on the deck of the cuddy. we flew along at a great rate--neither of us having said a word since casting loose from the wharf. i now asked my companion what course he intended to steer, and what time he thought it probable we should get back. he whistled for a few minutes, and then said crustily, "_i_ am going to sea--_you_ may go home if you think proper." turning my eyes upon him, i perceived at once that, in spite of his assumed _nonchalance_, he was greatly agitated. i could see him distinctly by the light of the moon--his face was paler than any marble, and his hand shook so excessively that he could scarcely retain hold of the tiller. i found that something had gone wrong, and became seriously alarmed. at this period i knew little about the management of a boat, and was now depending entirely upon the nautical skill of my friend. the wind, too, had suddenly increased, as we were fast getting out of the lee of the land--still i was ashamed to betray any trepidation, and for almost half an hour maintained a resolute silence. i could stand it no longer, however, and spoke to augustus about the propriety of turning back. as before, it was nearly a minute before he made answer, or took any notice of my suggestion. "by-and-by," said he at length--"time enough--home by-and-by." i had expected a similar reply, but there was something in the tone of these words which filled me with an indescribable feeling of dread. i again looked at the speaker attentively. his lips were perfectly livid, and his knees shook so violently together that he seemed scarcely able to stand. "for god's sake, augustus," i screamed, now heartily frightened, "what ails you?--what is the matter?--what _are_ you going to do?" "matter!" he stammered, in the greatest apparent surprise, letting go the tiller at the same moment, and falling forward into the bottom of the boat--"matter!--why, nothing is the--matter--going home--d--d--don't you see?" the whole truth now flashed upon me. i flew to him and raised him up. he was drunk--beastly drunk--he could no longer either stand, speak, or see. his eyes were perfectly glazed; and as i let him go in the extremity of my despair, he rolled like a mere log into the bilge-water from which i had lifted him. it was evident that, during the evening, he had drunk far more than i suspected, and that his conduct in bed had been the result of a highly-concentrated state of intoxication--a state which, like madness, frequently enables the victim to imitate the outward demeanour of one in perfect possession of his senses. the coolness of the night air, however, had had its usual effect--the mental energy began to yield before its influence--and the confused perception which he no doubt then had of his perilous situation had assisted in hastening the catastrophe. he was now thoroughly insensible, and there was no probability that he would be otherwise for many hours. it is hardly possible to conceive the extremity of my terror. the fumes of the wine lately taken had evaporated, leaving me doubly timid and irresolute. i knew that i was altogether incapable of managing the boat, and that a fierce wind and strong ebb tide were hurrying us to destruction. a storm was evidently gathering behind us; we had neither compass nor provisions; and it was clear that, if we held our present course, we should be out of sight of land before daybreak. these thoughts, with a crowd of others equally fearful, flashed through my mind with a bewildering rapidity, and for some moments paralyzed me beyond the possibility of making any exertion. the boat was going through the water at a terrible rate--full before the wind--no reef in either jib or mainsail--running her bows completely under the foam. it was a thousand wonders she did not broach to--augustus having let go the tiller, as i said before, and i being too much agitated to think of taking it myself. by good luck, however, she kept steady, and gradually i recovered some degree of presence of mind. still the wind was increasing fearfully; and whenever we rose from a plunge forward, the sea behind fell combing over our counter, and deluged us with water. i was so utterly benumbed, too, in every limb, as to be nearly unconscious of sensation. at length i summoned up the resolution of despair, and rushing to the mainsail, let it go by the run. as might have been expected, it flew over the bows, and, getting drenched with water, carried away the mast short off by the board. this latter accident alone saved me from instant destruction. under the jib only, i now boomed along before the wind, shipping heavy seas occasionally over the counter, but relieved from the terror of immediate death. i took the helm, and breathed with greater freedom as i found that there yet remained to us a chance of ultimate escape. augustus still lay senseless in the bottom of the boat; and as there was imminent danger of his drowning (the water being nearly a foot deep just where he fell), i contrived to raise him partially up, and keep him in a sitting position, by passing a rope round his waist, and lashing it to a ringbolt in the deck of the cuddy. having thus arranged everything as well as i could in my chilled and agitated condition, i recommended myself to god, and made up my mind to bear whatever might happen with all the fortitude in my power. hardly had i come to this resolution, when, suddenly, a loud and long scream or yell, as if from the throats of a thousand demons, seemed to pervade the whole atmosphere around and above the boat. never while i live shall i forget the intense agony of terror i experienced at that moment. my hair stood erect on my head--i felt the blood congealing in my veins--my heart ceased utterly to beat, and without having once raised my eyes to learn the source of my alarm, i tumbled headlong and insensible upon the body of my fallen companion. i found myself, upon reviving, in the cabin of a large whaling-ship (the penguin) bound to nantucket. several persons were standing over me, and augustus, paler than death, was busily occupied in chafing my hands. upon seeing me open my eyes, his exclamations of gratitude and joy excited alternate laughter and tears from the rough-looking personages who were present. the mystery of our being in existence was now soon explained. we had been run down by the whaling-ship, which was close hauled, beating up to nantucket with every sail she could venture to set, and consequently running almost at right angles to our own course. several men were on the look-out forward, but did not perceive our boat until it was an impossibility to avoid coming in contact--their shouts of warning upon seeing us were what so terribly alarmed me. the huge ship, i was told, rode immediately over us with as much ease as our own little vessel would have passed over a feather, and without the least perceptible impediment to her progress. not a scream arose from the deck of the victim--there was a slight grating sound to be heard mingling with the roar of wind and water, as the frail bark which was swallowed up rubbed for a moment along the keel of her destroyer--but this was all. thinking our boat (which it will be remembered was dismasted) some mere shell cut adrift as useless, the captain (captain e. t. v. block of new london) was for proceeding on his course without troubling himself further about the matter. luckily, there were two of the look-out who swore positively to having seen some person at our helm, and represented the possibility of yet saving him. a discussion ensued, when block grew angry, and, after a while, said that "it was no business of his to be eternally watching for egg-shells; that the ship should _not_ put about for any such nonsense; and if there was a man run down, it was nobody's fault but his own--he might drown and be d----d," or some language to that effect. henderson, the first mate, now took the matter up, being justly indignant, as well as the whole ship's crew, at a speech evincing so base a degree of heartless atrocity. he spoke plainly, seeing himself upheld by the men, told the captain he considered him a fit subject for the gallows, and that he would disobey his orders if he were hanged for it the moment he set his foot on shore. he strode aft, jostling block (who turned very pale and made no answer) on one side, and seizing the helm, gave the word, in a firm voice, _hard-a-lee!_ the men flew to their posts, and the ship went cleverly about. all this had occupied nearly five minutes, and it was supposed to be hardly within the bounds of possibility that any individual could be saved--allowing any to have been on board the boat. yet, as the reader has seen, both augustus and myself were rescued; and our deliverance seemed to have been brought about by two of those almost inconceivable pieces of good fortune which are attributed by the wise and pious to the special interference of providence. while the ship was yet in stays, the mate lowered the jolly-boat and jumped into her with the very two men, i believe, who spoke up as having seen me at the helm. they had just left the lee of the vessel (the moon still shining brightly) when she made a long and heavy roll to windward, and henderson, at the same moment, starting up in his seat, bawled out to his crew to _back water_. he would say nothing else--repeating his cry impatiently, _back water! back water!_ the men put back as speedily as possible; but by this time the ship had gone round, and gotten fully under headway, although all hands on board were making great exertions to take in sail. in despite of the danger of the attempt, the mate clung to the main-chains as soon as they came within his reach. another huge lurch now brought the starboard side of the vessel out of water nearly as far as her keel, when the cause of his anxiety was rendered obvious enough. the body of a man was seen to be affixed in the most singular manner to the smooth and shining bottom (the penguin was coppered and copper-fastened), and beating violently against it with every movement of the hull. after several ineffectual efforts, made during the lurches of the ship, and at the imminent risk of swamping the boat, i was finally disengaged from my perilous situation and taken on board--for the body proved to be my own. it appeared that one of the timber-bolts having started and broken a passage through the copper, it had arrested my progress as i passed under the ship, and fastened me in so extraordinary a manner to her bottom. the head of the bolt had made its way through the collar of the green baize jacket i had on, and through the back part of my neck, forcing itself out between two sinews and just below the right ear. i was immediately put to bed--although life seemed to be totally extinct. there was no surgeon on board. the captain, however, treated me with every attention--to make amends, i presume, in the eyes of his crew, for his atrocious behaviour in the previous portion of the adventure. in the meantime, henderson had again put off from the ship, although the wind was now blowing almost a hurricane. he had not been gone many minutes when he fell in with some fragments of our boat, and shortly afterward one of the men with him asserted that he could distinguish a cry for help at intervals amid the roaring of the tempest. this induced the hardy seamen to persevere in their search for more than half an hour, although repeated signals to return were made them by captain block, and although every moment on the water in so frail a boat was fraught to them with the most imminent and deadly peril. indeed, it is nearly impossible to conceive how the small jolly they were in could have escaped destruction for a single instant. she was built, however, for the whaling service, and was fitted, as i have since had reason to believe, with air-boxes, in the manner of some life-boats used on the coast of wales. after searching in vain for about the period of time just mentioned, it was determined to get back to the ship. they had scarcely made this resolve when a feeble cry arose from a dark object which floated rapidly by. they pursued and soon overtook it. it proved to be the entire deck of the ariel's cuddy. augustus was struggling near it, apparently in the last agonies. upon getting hold of him it was found that he was attached by a rope to the floating timber. this rope, it will be remembered, i had myself tied round his waist, and made fast to a ringbolt, for the purpose of keeping him in an upright position, and my so doing, it appeared, had been ultimately the means of preserving his life. the ariel was slightly put together, and in going down her frame naturally went to pieces; the deck of the cuddy, as might be expected, was lifted, by the force of the water rushing in, entirely from the main timbers, and floated (with other fragments, no doubt) to the surface--augustus was buoyed up with it, and thus escaped a terrible death. it was more than an hour after being taken on board the penguin before he could give any account of himself, or be made to comprehend the nature of the accident which had befallen our boat. at length he became thoroughly aroused, and spoke much of his sensations while in the water. upon his first attaining any degree of consciousness, he found himself beneath the surface, whirling round and round with inconceivable rapidity, and with a rope wrapped in three or four folds tightly about his neck. in an instant afterward he felt himself going rapidly upward, when, his head striking violently against a hard substance, he again relapsed into insensibility. upon once more reviving he was in fuller possession of his reason--this was still, however, in the greatest degree clouded and confused. he now knew that some accident had occurred, and that he was in the water, although his mouth was above the surface, and he could breathe with some freedom. possibly, at this period, the deck was drifting rapidly before the wind, and drawing him after it, as he floated upon his back. of course, as long as he could have retained this position, it would have been nearly impossible that he should be drowned. presently a surge threw him directly athwart the deck; and this post he endeavoured to maintain, screaming at intervals for help. just before he was discovered by mr. henderson, he had been obliged to relax his hold through exhaustion, and, falling into the sea, had given himself up for lost. during the whole period of his struggles he had not the faintest recollection of the ariel, nor of any matters in connexion with the source of his disaster. a vague feeling of terror and despair had taken entire possession of his faculties. when he was finally picked up, every power of his mind had failed him; and, as before said, it was nearly an hour after getting on board the penguin before he became fully aware of his condition. in regard to myself--i was resuscitated from a state bordering very nearly upon death (and after every other means had been tried in vain for three hours and a half) by vigorous friction with flannels bathed in hot oil--a proceeding suggested by augustus. the wound in my neck, although of an ugly appearance, proved of little real consequence, and i soon recovered from its effects. the penguin got into port about nine o'clock in the morning, after encountering one of the severest gales ever experienced off nantucket. both augustus and myself managed to appear at mr. barnard's in time for breakfast--which, luckily, was somewhat late, owing to the party over night. i suppose all at the table were too much fatigued themselves to notice our jaded appearance--of course, it would not have borne a very rigid scrutiny. schoolboys, however, can accomplish wonders in the way of deception, and i verily believe not one of our friends in nantucket had the slightest suspicion that the terrible story told by some sailors in town of their having run down a vessel at sea and drowned some thirty or forty poor devils, had reference either to the ariel, my companion, or myself. we two have since very frequently talked the matter over--but never without a shudder. in one of our conversations augustus frankly confessed to me, that in his whole life he had at no time experienced so excruciating a sense of dismay, as when on board our little boat he first discovered the extent of his intoxication, and felt himself sinking beneath its influence. chapter ii. in no affairs of mere prejudice, pro or con, do we deduce inferences with entire certainty even from the most simple data. it might be supposed that a catastrophe such as i have just related would have effectually cooled my incipient passion for the sea. on the contrary, i never experienced a more ardent longing for the wild adventures incident to the life of a navigator than within a week after our miraculous deliverance. this short period proved amply long enough to erase from my memory the shadows, and bring out in vivid light all the pleasurably exciting points of colour, all the picturesqueness of the late perilous accident. my conversations with augustus grew daily more frequent and more intensely full of interest. he had a manner of relating his stories of the ocean (more than one half of which i now suspect to have been sheer fabrications) well adapted to have weight with one of my enthusiastic temperament, and somewhat gloomy, although glowing imagination. it is strange, too, that he most strongly enlisted my feelings in behalf of the life of a seaman, when he depicted his more terrible moments of suffering and despair. for the bright side of the painting i had a limited sympathy. my visions were of shipwreck and famine; of death or captivity among barbarian hordes; of a lifetime dragged out in sorrow and tears, upon some gray and desolate rock, in an ocean unapproachable and unknown. such visions or desires--for they amounted to desires--are common, i have since been assured, to the whole numerous race of the melancholy among men--at the time of which i speak i regarded them only as prophetic glimpses of a destiny which i felt myself in a measure bound to fulfil. augustus thoroughly entered into my state of mind. it is probable, indeed, that our intimate communion had resulted in a partial interchange of character. about eighteen months after the period of the ariel's disaster, the firm of lloyd and vredenburgh (a house connected in some manner with the messieurs enderby, i believe, of liverpool) were engaged in repairing and fitting out the brig grampus for a whaling voyage. she was an old hulk, and scarcely seaworthy when all was done to her that could be done. i hardly know why she was chosen in preference to other good vessels belonging to the same owners--but so it was. mr. barnard was appointed to command her, and augustus was going with him. while the brig was getting ready, he frequently urged upon me the excellency of the opportunity now offered for indulging my desire of travel. he found me by no means an unwilling listener--yet the matter could not be so easily arranged. my father made no direct opposition; but my mother went into hysterics at the bare mention of the design; and, more than all, my grandfather, from whom i expected much, vowed to cut me off with a shilling if i should ever broach the subject to him again. these difficulties, however, so far from abating my desire, only added fuel to the flame. i determined to go at all hazards; and, having made known my intention to augustus, we set about arranging a plan by which it might be accomplished. in the meantime i forbore speaking to any of my relations in regard to the voyage, and, as i busied myself ostensibly with my usual studies, it was supposed that i had abandoned the design. i have since frequently examined my conduct on this occasion with sentiments of displeasure as well as of surprise. the intense hypocrisy i made use of for the furtherance of my project--an hypocrisy pervading every word and action of my life for so long a period of time--could only have been rendered tolerable to myself by the wild and burning expectation with which i looked forward to the fulfilment of my long-cherished visions of travel. in pursuance of my scheme of deception, i was necessarily obliged to leave much to the management of augustus, who was employed for the greater part of every day on board the grampus, attending to some arrangements for his father in the cabin and cabin hold. at night, however, we were sure to have a conference, and talk over our hopes. after nearly a month passed in this manner, without our hitting upon any plan we thought likely to succeed, he told me at last that he had determined upon everything necessary. i had a relation living in new bedford, a mr. ross, at whose house i was in the habit of spending occasionally two or three weeks at a time. the brig was to sail about the middle of june (june, <UNK> and it was agreed that, a day or two before her putting to sea, my father was to receive a note, as usual, from mr. ross, asking me to come over and spend a fortnight with robert and emmet (his sons). augustus charged himself with the enditing of this note and getting it delivered. having set out, as supposed, for new bedford, i was then to report myself to my companion, who would contrive a hiding-place for me in the grampus. this hiding-place, he assured me, would be rendered sufficiently comfortable for a residence of many days, during which i was not to make my appearance. when the brig had proceeded so far on her course as to make any turning back a matter out of question, i should then, he said, be formally installed in all the comforts of the cabin; and as to his father, he would only laugh heartily at the joke. vessels enough would be met with by which a letter might be sent home explaining the adventure to my parents. the middle of june at length arrived, and everything had been matured. the note was written and delivered, and on a monday morning i left the house for the new bedford packet, as supposed. i went, however, straight to augustus, who was waiting for me at the corner of a street. it had been our original plan that i should keep out of the way until dark, and then slip on board the brig; but, as there was now a thick fog in our favour, it was agreed to lose no time in secreting me. augustus led the way to the wharf, and i followed at a little distance, enveloped in a thick seaman's cloak, which he had brought with him, so that my person might not be easily recognised. just as we turned the second corner, after passing mr. edmund's well, who should appear, standing right in front of me, and looking me full in the face, but old mr. peterson, my grandfather. "why, bless my soul, gordon," said he, after a long pause, "why, why--_whose_ dirty cloak is that you have on?" "sir!" i replied, assuming, as well as i could, in the exigency of the moment, an air of offended surprise, and talking in the gruffest of all imaginable tones--"sir! you are a sum'mat mistaken--my name, in the first place, bee'nt nothing at all like goddin, and i'd want you for to know better, you blackguard, than to call my new obercoat a darty one!" for my life i could hardly refrain from screaming with laughter at the odd manner in which the old gentleman received this handsome rebuke. he started back two or three steps, turned first pale and then excessively red, threw up his spectacles, then, putting them down, ran full tilt at me, with his umbrella uplifted. he stopped short, however, in his career, as if struck with a sudden recollection; and presently, turning round, hobbled off down the street, shaking all the while with rage, and muttering between his teeth, "won't do--new glasses--thought it was gordon--d----d good-for-nothing salt water long tom." after this narrow escape we proceeded with greater caution, and arrived at our point of destination in safety. there were only one or two of the hands on board, and these were busy forward, doing something to the forecastle combings. captain barnard, we knew very well, was engaged at lloyd and vredenburgh's, and would remain there until late in the evening, so we had little to apprehend on his account. augustus went first up the vessel's side, and in a short while i followed him, without being noticed by the men at work. we proceeded at once into the cabin, and found no person there. it was fitted up in the most comfortable style--a thing somewhat unusual in a whaling-vessel. there were four very excellent staterooms, with wide and convenient berths. there was also a large stove, i took notice, and a remarkably thick and valuable carpet covering the floor of both the cabin and staterooms. the ceiling was full seven feet high, and, in short, everything appeared of a more roomy and agreeable nature than i had anticipated. augustus, however, would allow me but little time for observation, insisting upon the necessity of my concealing myself as soon as possible. he led the way into his own stateroom, which was on the starboard side of the brig, and next to the bulkheads. upon entering, he closed the door and bolted it. i thought i had never seen a nicer little room than the one in which i now found myself. it was about ten feet long, and had only one berth, which, as i said before, was wide and convenient. in that portion of the closet nearest the bulkheads there was a space of four feet square, containing a table, a chair, and a set of hanging shelves full of books, chiefly books of voyages and travels. there were many other little comforts in the room, among which i ought not to forget a kind of safe or refrigerator, in which augustus pointed out to me a host of delicacies, both in the eating and drinking department. he now pressed with his knuckles upon a certain spot of the carpet in one corner of the space just mentioned, letting me know that a portion of the flooring, about sixteen inches square, had been neatly cut out and again adjusted. as he pressed, this portion rose up at one end sufficiently to allow the passage of his finger beneath. in this manner he raised the mouth of the trap (to which the carpet was still fastened by tacks), and i found that it led into the after hold. he next lit a small taper by means of a phosphorus match, and, placing the light in a dark lantern, descended with it through the opening, bidding me follow. i did so, and he then pulled the cover upon the hole, by means of a nail driven into the under side--the carpet, of course, resuming its original position on the floor of the stateroom, and all traces of the aperture being concealed. the taper gave out so feeble a ray, that it was with the greatest difficulty i could grope my way through the confused mass of lumber among which i now found myself. by degrees, however, my eyes became accustomed to the gloom, and i proceeded with less trouble, holding on to the skirts of my friend's coat. he brought me, at length, after creeping and winding through innumerable narrow passages, to an iron-bound box, such as is used sometimes for packing fine earthenware. it was nearly four feet high, and full six long, but very narrow. two large empty oil-casks lay on the top of it, and above these, again, a vast quantity of straw matting, piled up as high as the floor of the cabin. in every other direction around was wedged as closely as possible, even up to the ceiling, a complete chaos of almost every species of ship-furniture, together with a heterogeneous medley of crates, hampers, barrels, and bales, so that it seemed a matter no less than miraculous that we had discovered any passage at all to the box. i afterward found that augustus had purposely arranged the stowage in this hold with a view to affording me a thorough concealment, having had only one assistant in the labour, a man not going out in the brig. my companion now showed me that one of the ends of the box could be removed at pleasure. he slipped it aside and displayed the interior, at which i was excessively amused. a mattress from one of the cabin berths covered the whole of its bottom, and it contained almost every article of mere comfort which could be crowded into so small a space, allowing me, at the same time, sufficient room for my accommodation, either in a sitting position or lying at full length. among other things, there were some books, pen, ink, and paper, three blankets, a large jug full of water, a keg of sea-biscuit, three or four immense bologna sausages, an enormous ham, a cold leg of roast mutton, and half a dozen bottles of cordials and liqueurs. i proceeded immediately to take possession of my little apartment, and this with feelings of higher satisfaction, i am sure, than any monarch ever experienced upon entering a new palace. augustus now pointed out to me the method of fastening the open end of the box, and then, holding the taper close to the deck, showed me a piece of dark whipcord lying along it. this, he said, extended from my hiding-place throughout all the necessary windings among the lumber, to a nail which was driven into the deck of the hold, immediately beneath the trapdoor leading into his stateroom. by means of this cord i should be enabled readily to trace my way out without his guidance, provided any unlooked-for accident should render such a step necessary. he now took his departure, leaving with me the lantern, together with a copious supply of tapers and phosphorus, and promising to pay me a visit as often as he could contrive to do so without observation. this was on the seventeenth of june. i remained three days and nights (as nearly as i could guess) in my hiding-place without getting out of it at all, except twice for the purpose of stretching my limbs by standing erect between two crates just opposite the opening. during the whole period i saw nothing of augustus; but this occasioned me little uneasiness, as i knew the brig was expected to put to sea every hour, and in the bustle he would not easily find opportunities of coming down to me. at length i heard the trap open and shut, and presently he called in a low voice, asking if all was well, and if there was anything i wanted. "nothing," i replied; "i am as comfortable as can be; when will the brig sail?" "she will be under weigh in less than half an hour," he answered. "i came to let you know, and for fear you should be uneasy at my absence. i shall not have a chance of coming down again for some time--perhaps for three or four days more. all is going on right aboveboard. after i go up and close the trap, do you creep along by the whipcord to where the nail is driven in. you will find my watch there--it may be useful to you, as you have no daylight to keep time by. i suppose you can't tell how long you have been buried--only three days--this is the twentieth. i would bring the watch to your box, but am afraid of being missed." with this he went up. in about an hour after he had gone i distinctly felt the brig in motion, and congratulated myself upon having at length fairly commenced a voyage. satisfied with this idea, i determined to make my mind as easy as possible, and await the course of events until i should be permitted to exchange the box for the more roomy, although hardly more comfortable, accommodations of the cabin. my first care was to get the watch. leaving the taper burning, i groped along in the dark, following the cord through windings innumerable, in some of which i discovered that, after toiling a long distance, i was brought back within a foot or two of a former position. at length i reached the nail, and, securing the object of my journey, returned with it in safety. i now looked over the books which had been so thoughtfully provided, and selected the expedition of lewis and clarke to the mouth of the columbia. with this i amused myself for some time, when, growing sleepy, i extinguished the light with great care, and soon fell into a sound slumber. upon awaking i felt strangely confused in mind, and some time elapsed before i could bring to recollection all the various circumstances of my situation. by degrees, however, i remembered all. striking a light, i looked at the watch; but it was run down, and there were, consequently, no means of determining how long i had slept. my limbs were greatly cramped, and i was forced to relieve them by standing between the crates. presently, feeling an almost ravenous appetite, i bethought myself of the cold mutton, some of which i had eaten just before going to sleep, and found excellent. what was my astonishment at discovering it to be in a state of absolute putrefaction! this circumstance occasioned me great disquietude; for, connecting it with the disorder of mind i experienced upon awaking, i began to suppose that i must have slept for an inordinately long period of time. the close atmosphere of the hold might have had something to do with this, and might, in the end, be productive of the most serious results. my head ached excessively; i fancied that i drew every breath with difficulty; and, in short, i was oppressed with a multitude of gloomy feelings. still i could not venture to make any disturbance by opening the trap or otherwise, and, having wound up the watch, contented myself as well as possible. throughout the whole of the next tedious twenty-four hours no person came to my relief, and i could not help accusing augustus of the grossest inattention. what alarmed me chiefly was, that the water in my jug was reduced to about half a pint, and i was suffering much from thirst, having eaten freely of the bologna sausages after the loss of my mutton. i became very uneasy, and could no longer take any interest in my books. i was overpowered, too, with a desire to sleep, yet trembled at the thought of indulging it, lest there might exist some pernicious influence, like that of burning charcoal, in the confined air of the hold. in the mean time the roll of the brig told me that we were far in the main ocean, and a dull humming sound, which reached my ears as if from an immense distance, convinced me no ordinary gale was blowing. i could not imagine a reason for the absence of augustus. we were surely far enough advanced on our voyage to allow of my going up. some accident might have happened to him--but i could think of none which would account for his suffering me to remain so long a prisoner, except, indeed, his having suddenly died or fallen overboard, and upon this idea i could not dwell with any degree of patience. it was possible that we had been baffled by head winds, and were still in the near vicinity of nantucket. this notion, however, i was forced to abandon; for, such being the case, the brig must have frequently gone about; and i was entirely satisfied, from her continual inclination to the larboard, that she had been sailing all along with a steady breeze on her starboard quarter. besides, granting that we were still in the neighbourhood of the island, why should not augustus have visited me and informed me of the circumstance? pondering in this manner upon the difficulties of my solitary and cheerless condition, i resolved to wait yet another twenty-four hours, when, if no relief were obtained, i would make my way to the trap, and endeavour either to hold a parley with my friend, or get at least a little fresh air through the opening, and a further supply of water from his stateroom. while occupied with this thought, however, i fell, in spite of every exertion to the contrary, into a state of profound sleep, or rather stupor. my dreams were of the most terrific description. every species of calamity and horror befell me. among other miseries, i was smothered to death between huge pillows, by demons of the most ghastly and ferocious aspect. immense serpents held me in their embrace, and looked earnestly in my face with their fearfully shining eyes. then deserts, limitless, and of the most forlorn and awe-inspiring character, spread themselves out before me. immensely tall trunks of trees, gray and leafless, rose up in endless succession as far as the eye could reach. their roots were concealed in wide-spreading morasses, whose dreary water lay intensely black, still, and altogether terrible, beneath. and the strange trees seemed endowed with a human vitality, and, waving to and fro their skeleton arms, were crying to the silent waters for mercy, in the shrill and piercing accents of the most acute agony and despair. the scene changed; and i stood, naked and alone, amid the burning sand-plains of zahara. at my feet lay crouched a fierce lion of the tropics. suddenly his wild eyes opened and fell upon me. with a convulsive bound he sprang to his feet, and laid bare his horrible teeth. in another instant there burst from his red throat a roar like the thunder of the firmament, and i fell impetuously to the earth. stifling in a paroxysm of terror, i at last found myself partially awake. my dream, then, was not all a dream. now, at least, i was in possession of my senses. the paws of some huge and real monster were pressing heavily upon my bosom--his hot breath was in my ear--and his white and ghastly fangs were gleaming upon me through the gloom. had a thousand lives hung upon the movement of a limb or the utterance of a syllable, i could have neither stirred nor spoken. the beast, whatever it was, retained his position without attempting any immediate violence, while i lay in an utterly helpless, and, i fancied, a dying condition beneath him. i felt that my powers of body and mind were fast leaving me--in a word, that i was perishing, and perishing of sheer fright. my brain swam--i grew deadly sick--my vision failed--even the glaring eyeballs above me grew dim. making a last strong effort, i at length breathed a faint ejaculation to god, and resigned myself to die. the sound of my voice seemed to arouse all the latent fury of the animal. he precipitated himself at full length upon my body; but what was my astonishment, when, with a long and low whine, he commenced licking my face and hands with the greatest eagerness, and with the most extravagant demonstrations of affection and joy! i was bewildered, utterly lost in amazement--but i could not forget the peculiar whine of my newfoundland dog tiger, and the odd manner of his caresses i well knew. it was he. i experienced a sudden rush of blood to my temples--a giddy and overpowering sense of deliverance and reanimation. i rose hurriedly from the mattress upon which i had been lying, and, throwing myself upon the neck of my faithful follower and friend, relieved the long oppression of my bosom in a flood of the most passionate tears. as upon a former occasion, my conceptions were in a state of the greatest indistinctness and confusion after leaving the mattress. for a long time i found it nearly impossible to connect any ideas--but, by very slow degrees, my thinking faculties returned, and i again called to memory the several incidents of my condition. for the presence of tiger i tried in vain to account; and after busying myself with a thousand different conjectures respecting him, was forced to content myself with rejoicing that he was with me to share my dreary solitude, and render me comfort by his caresses. most people love their dogs--but for tiger i had an affection far more ardent than common; and never, certainly, did any creature more truly deserve it. for seven years he had been my inseparable companion, and in a multitude of instances had given evidence of all the noble qualities for which we value the animal. i had rescued him, when a puppy, from the clutches of a malignant little villain in nantucket, who was leading him, with a rope around his neck, to the water; and the grown dog repaid the obligation, about three years afterward, by saving me from the bludgeon of a street-robber. getting now hold of the watch, i found, upon applying it to my ear, that it had again run down; but at this i was not at all surprised, being convinced, from the peculiar state of my feelings, that i had slept, as before, for a very long period of time; how long, it was of course impossible to say. i was burning up with fever, and my thirst was almost intolerable. i felt about the box for my little remaining supply of water; for i had no light, the taper having burnt to the socket of the lantern, and the phosphorus-box not coming readily to hand. upon finding the jug, however, i discovered it to be empty--tiger, no doubt, having been tempted to drink it, as well as to devour the remnant of mutton, the bone of which lay, well picked, by the opening of the box. the spoiled meat i could well spare, but my heart sank as i thought of the water. i was feeble in the extreme--so much so that i shook all over, as with an ague, at the slightest movement or exertion. to add to my troubles, the brig was pitching and rolling with great violence, and the oil-casks which lay upon my box were in momentary danger of falling down, so as to block up the only way of ingress or egress. i felt, also, terrible sufferings from sea-sickness. these considerations determined me to make my way, at all hazards, to the trap, and obtain immediate relief, before i should be incapacitated from doing so altogether. having come to this resolve, i again felt about for the phosphorus-box and tapers. the former i found after some little trouble; but, not discovering the tapers as soon as i had expected (for i remembered very nearly the spot in which i had placed them), i gave up the search for the present, and bidding tiger lie quiet, began at once my journey towards the trap. in this attempt my great feebleness became more than ever apparent. it was with the utmost difficulty i could crawl along at all, and very frequently my limbs sank suddenly from beneath me; when, falling prostrate on my face, i would remain for some minutes in a state bordering on insensibility. still i struggled forward by slow degrees, dreading every moment that i should swoon amid the narrow and intricate windings of the lumber, in which event i had nothing but death to expect as the result. at length, upon making a push forward with all the energy i could command, i struck my forehead violently against the sharp corner of an iron-bound crate. the accident only stunned me for a few moments; but i found, to my inexpressible grief, that the quick and violent roll of the vessel had thrown the crate entirely across my path, so as effectually to block up the passage. with my utmost exertions i could not move it a single inch from its position, it being closely wedged in among the surrounding boxes and ship-furniture. it became necessary, therefore, enfeebled as i was, either to leave the guidance of the whipcord and seek out a new passage, or to climb over the obstacle, and resume the path on the other side. the former alternative presented too many difficulties and dangers to be thought of without a shudder. in my present weak state of both mind and body, i should infallibly lose my way if i attempted it, and perish miserably amid the dismal and disgusting labyrinths of the hold. i proceeded, therefore, without hesitation, to summon up all my remaining strength and fortitude, and endeavour, as i best might, to clamber over the crate. upon standing erect, with this end in view, i found the undertaking even a more serious task than my fears had led me to imagine. on each side of the narrow passage arose a complete wall of various heavy lumber, which the least blunder on my part might be the means of bringing down upon my head; or, if this accident did not occur, the path might be effectually blocked up against my return by the descending mass, as it was in front by the obstacle there. the crate itself was a long and unwieldy box, upon which no foothold could be obtained. in vain i attempted, by every means in my power, to reach the top, with the hope of being thus enabled to draw myself up. had i succeeded in reaching it, it is certain that my strength would have proved utterly inadequate to the task of getting over, and it was better in every respect that i failed. at length, in a desperate effort to force the crate from its ground, i felt a strong vibration in the side next me. i thrust my hand eagerly to the edge of the planks, and found that a very large one was loose. with my pocket-knife, which luckily i had with me, i succeeded, after great labour, in prying it entirely off; and, getting through the aperture, discovered, to my exceeding joy, that there were no boards on the opposite side--in other words, that the top was wanting, it being the bottom through which i had forced my way. i now met with no important difficulty in proceeding along the line until i finally reached the nail. with a beating heart i stood erect, and with a gentle touch pressed against the cover of the trap. it did not rise as soon as i had expected, and i pressed it with somewhat more determination, still dreading lest some other person than augustus might be in his stateroom. the door, however, to my astonishment, remained steady, and i became somewhat uneasy, for i knew that it had formerly required little or no effort to remove it. i pushed it strongly--it was nevertheless firm: with all my strength--it still did not give way: with rage, with fury, with despair--it set at defiance my utmost efforts; and it was evident, from the unyielding nature of the resistance, that the hole had either been discovered and effectually nailed up, or that some immense weight had been placed upon it, which it was useless to think of removing. my sensations were those of extreme horror and dismay. in vain i attempted to reason on the probable cause of my being thus entombed. i could summon up no connected chain of reflection, and, sinking on the floor, gave way, unresistingly, to the most gloomy imaginings, in which the dreadful deaths of thirst, famine, suffocation, and premature interment, crowded upon me as the prominent disasters to be encountered. at length there returned to me some portion of presence of mind. i arose, and felt with my fingers for the seams or cracks of the aperture. having found them, i examined them closely to ascertain if they emitted any light from the stateroom; but none was visible. i then forced the penblade of my knife through them, until i met with some hard obstacle. scraping against it, i discovered it to be a solid mass of iron, which, from its peculiar wavy feel as i passed the blade along it, i concluded to be a chain-cable. the only course now left me was to retrace my way to the box, and there either yield to my sad fate, or try so to tranquillize my mind as to admit of my arranging some plan of escape. i immediately set about the attempt, and succeeded, after innumerable difficulties, in getting back. as i sank, utterly exhausted, upon the mattress, tiger threw himself at full length by my side, and seemed as if desirous, by his caresses, of consoling me in my troubles, and urging me to bear them with fortitude. the singularity of his behaviour at length forcibly arrested my attention. after licking my face and hands for some minutes, he would suddenly cease doing so, and utter a low whine. upon reaching out my hand towards him, i then invariably found him lying on his back, with his paws uplifted. this conduct, so frequently repeated, appeared strange, and i could in no manner account for it. as the dog seemed distressed, i concluded that he had received some injury; and, taking his paws in my hands, i examined them one by one, but found no sign of any hurt. i then supposed him hungry, and gave him a large piece of ham, which he devoured with avidity--afterward, however, resuming his extraordinary manoeuvres. i now imagined that he was suffering, like myself, the torments of thirst, and was about adopting this conclusion as the true one, when the idea occurred to me that i had as yet only examined his paws, and that there might possibly be a wound upon some portion of his body or head. the latter i felt carefully over, but found nothing. on passing my hand, however, along his back, i perceived a slight erection of the hair extending completely across it. probing this with my finger, i discovered a string, and, tracing it up, found that it encircled the whole body. upon a closer scrutiny, i came across a small slip of what had the feeling of letter paper, through which the string had been fastened in such a manner as to bring it immediately beneath the left shoulder of the animal. chapter iii. the thought instantly occurred to me that the paper was a note from augustus, and that some unaccountable accident having happened to prevent his relieving me from my dungeon, he had devised this method of acquainting me with the true state of affairs. trembling with eagerness, i now commenced another search for my phosphorus matches and tapers. i had a confused recollection of having put them carefully away just before falling asleep; and, indeed, previously to my last journey to the trap, i had been able to remember the exact spot where i had deposited them. but now i endeavoured in vain to call it to mind, and busied myself for a full hour in a fruitless and vexatious search for the missing articles; never, surely, was there a more tantalizing state of anxiety and suspense. at length, while groping about, with my head close to the ballast, near the opening of the box, and outside of it, i perceived a faint glimmering of light in the direction of the steerage. greatly surprised, i endeavoured to make my way towards it, as it appeared to be but a few feet from my position. scarcely had i moved with this intention, when i lost sight of the glimmer entirely, and, before i could bring it into view again, was obliged to feel along by the box until i had exactly resumed my original situation. now, moving my head with caution to and fro, i found that, by proceeding slowly, with great care, in an opposite direction to that in which i had at first started, i was enabled to draw near the light, still keeping it in view. presently i came directly upon it (having squeezed my way through innumerable narrow windings), and found that it proceeded from some fragments of my matches lying in an empty barrel turned upon its side. i was wondering how they came in such a place, when my hand fell upon two or three pieces of taper-wax, which had been evidently mumbled by the dog. i concluded at once that he had devoured the whole of my supply of candles, and i felt hopeless of being ever able to read the note of augustus. the small remnants of the wax were so mashed up among other rubbish in the barrel, that i despaired of deriving any service from them, and left them as they were. the phosphorus, of which there was only a speck or two, i gathered up as well as i could, and returned with it, after much difficulty, to my box, where tiger had all the while remained. what to do next i could not tell. the hold was so intensely dark that i could not see my hand, however close i would hold it to my face. the white slip of paper could barely be discerned, and not even that when i looked at it directly; by turning the exterior portions of the retina towards it, that is to say, by surveying it slightly askance, i found that it became in some measure perceptible. thus the gloom of my prison may be imagined, and the note of my friend, if indeed it were a note from him, seemed only likely to throw me into further trouble, by disquieting to no purpose my already enfeebled and agitated mind. in vain i revolved in my brain a multitude of absurd expedients for procuring light--such expedients precisely as a man in the perturbed sleep occasioned by opium would be apt to fall upon for a similar purpose--each and all of which appear by turns to the dreamer the most reasonable and the most preposterous of conceptions, just as the reasoning or imaginative faculties flicker, alternately, one above the other. at last an idea occurred to me which seemed rational, and which gave me cause to wonder, very justly, that i had not entertained it before. i placed the slip of paper on the back of a book, and, collecting the fragments of the phosphorus matches which i had brought from the barrel, laid them together upon the paper. i then, with the palm of my hand, rubbed the whole over quickly yet steadily. a clear light diffused itself immediately throughout the whole surface; and had there been any writing upon it, i should not have experienced the least difficulty, i am sure, in reading it. not a syllable was there, however--nothing but a dreary and unsatisfactory blank; the illumination died away in a few seconds, and my heart died away within me as it went. i have before stated more than once that my intellect, for some period prior to this, had been in a condition nearly bordering on idiocy. there were, to be sure, momentary intervals of perfect sanity, and, now and then, even of energy; but these were few. it must be remembered that i had been, for many days certainly, inhaling the almost pestilential atmosphere of a close hold in a whaling vessel, and a long portion of that time but scantily supplied with water. for the last fourteen or fifteen hours i had none--nor had i slept during that time. salt provisions of the most exciting kind had been my chief, and, indeed, since the loss of the mutton, my only supply of food, with the exception of the sea-biscuit; and these latter were utterly useless to me, as they were too dry and hard to be swallowed in the swollen and parched condition of my throat. i was now in a high state of fever, and in every respect exceedingly ill. this will account for the fact that many miserable hours of despondency elapsed after my last adventure with the phosphorus, before the thought suggested itself that i had examined only one side of the paper. i shall not attempt to describe my feelings of rage (for i believe i was more angry than anything else) when the egregious oversight i had committed flashed suddenly upon my perception. the blunder itself would have been unimportant, had not my own folly and impetuosity rendered it otherwise--in my disappointment at not finding some words upon the slip, i had childishly torn it in pieces and thrown it away, it was impossible to say where. from the worst part of this dilemma i was relieved by the sagacity of tiger. having got, after a long search, a small piece of the note, i put it to the dog's nose, and endeavoured to make him understand that he must bring me the rest of it. to my astonishment (for i had taught him none of the usual tricks for which his breed are famous), he seemed to enter at once into my meaning, and, rummaging about for a few moments, soon found another considerable portion. bringing me this, he paused a while, and, rubbing his nose against my hand, appeared to be waiting for my approval of what he had done. i patted him on the head, when he immediately made off again. it was now some minutes before he came back--but when he did come, he brought with him a large slip, which proved to be all the paper missing--it having been torn, it seems, only into three pieces. luckily, i had no trouble in finding what few fragments of the phosphorus were left--being guided by the indistinct glow one or two of the particles still emitted. my difficulties had taught me the necessity of caution, and i now took time to reflect upon what i was about to do. it was very probable, i considered, that some words were written upon that side of the paper which had not been examined--but which side was that? fitting the pieces together gave me no clew in this respect, although it assured me that the words (if there were any) would be found all on one side, and connected in a proper manner, as written. there was the greater necessity of ascertaining the point in question beyond a doubt, as the phosphorus remaining would be altogether insufficient for a third attempt, should i fail in the one i was now about to make. i placed the paper on a book as before, and sat for some minutes thoughtfully revolving the matter over in my mind. at last i thought it barely possible that the written side might have some unevenness on its surface, which a delicate sense of feeling might enable me to detect. i determined to make the experiment, and passed my finger very carefully over the side which first presented itself--nothing, however, was perceptible, and i turned the paper, adjusting it on the book. i now again carried my forefinger cautiously along, when i was aware of an exceedingly slight, but still discernible glow, which followed as it proceeded. this, i knew, must arise from some very minute remaining particles of the phosphorus with which i had covered the paper in my previous attempt. the other, or under side, then, was that on which lay the writing, if writing there should finally prove to be. again i turned the note, and went to work as i had previously done. having rubbed in the phosphorus, a brilliancy ensued as before--but this time several lines of ms. in a large hand, and apparently in red ink, became distinctly visible. the glimmer, although sufficiently bright, was but momentary. still, had i not been too greatly excited, there would have been ample time enough for me to peruse the whole three sentences before me--for i saw there were three. in my anxiety, however, to read all at once, i succeeded only in reading the seven concluding words, which thus appeared: _"blood--your life depends upon lying close."_ had i been able to ascertain the entire contents of the note--the full meaning of the admonition which my friend had thus attempted to convey, that admonition, even although it should have revealed a story of disaster the most unspeakable, could not, i am firmly convinced, have imbued my mind with one tithe of the harrowing and yet indefinable horror with which i was inspired by the fragmentary warning thus received. and _"blood"_ too, that word of all words--so rife at all times with mystery, and suffering, and terror--how trebly full of import did it now appear--how chillily and heavily (disjointed, as it thus was, from any foregoing words to qualify or render it distinct) did its vague syllables fall, amid the deep gloom of my prison, into the innermost recesses of my soul! augustus had, undoubtedly, good reasons for wishing me to remain concealed, and i formed a thousand surmises as to what they could be--but i could think of nothing affording a satisfactory solution of the mystery. just after returning from my last journey to the trap, and before my attention had been otherwise directed by the singular conduct of tiger, i had come to the resolution of making myself heard at all events by those on board, or, if i could not succeed in this directly, of trying to cut my way through the orlop deck. the half certainty which i felt of being able to accomplish one of these two purposes in the last emergency, had given me courage (which i should not otherwise have had) to endure the evils of my situation. the few words i had been able to read, however, had cut me off from these final resources, and i now, for the first time, felt all the misery of my fate. in a paroxysm of despair i threw myself again upon the mattress, where, for about the period of a day and night, i lay in a kind of stupor, relieved only by momentary intervals of reason and recollection. at length i once more arose, and busied myself in reflection upon the horrors which encompassed me. for another twenty-four hours it was barely possible that i might exist without water--for a longer time i could not do so. during the first portion of my imprisonment i had made free use of the cordials with which augustus had supplied me, but they only served to excite fever, without in the least degree assuaging my thirst. i had now only about a gill left, and this was of a species of strong peach liqueur at which my stomach revolted. the sausages were entirely consumed; of the ham nothing remained but a small piece of the skin; and all the biscuit, except a few fragments of one, had been eaten by tiger. to add to my troubles, i found that my headache was increasing momentarily, and with it the species of delirium which had distressed me more or less since my first falling asleep. for some hours past it had been with the greatest difficulty i could breathe at all, and now each attempt at so doing was attended with the most distressing spasmodic action of the chest. but there was still another and very different source of disquietude, and one, indeed, whose harassing terrors had been the chief means of arousing me to exertion from my stupor on the mattress. it arose from the demeanour of the dog. i first observed an alteration in his conduct while rubbing in the phosphorus on the paper in my last attempt. as i rubbed, he ran his nose against my hand with a slight snarl; but i was too greatly excited at the time to pay much attention to the circumstance. soon afterward, it will be remembered, i threw myself on the mattress, and fell into a species of lethargy. presently i became aware of a singular hissing sound close at my ears, and discovered it to proceed from tiger, who was panting and wheezing in a state of the greatest apparent excitement, his eyeballs flashing fiercely through the gloom. i spoke to him, when he replied with a low growl, and then remained quiet. presently i relapsed into my stupor, from which i was again awakened in a similar manner. this was repeated three or four times, until finally his behaviour inspired me with so great a degree of fear that i became fully aroused. he was now lying close by the door of the box, snarling fearfully, although in a kind of under tone, and grinding his teeth as if strongly convulsed. i had no doubt whatever that the want of water or the confined atmosphere of the hold had driven him mad, and i was at a loss what course to pursue. i could not endure the thought of killing him, yet it seemed absolutely necessary for my own safety. i could distinctly perceive his eyes fastened upon me with an expression of the most deadly animosity, and i expected every instant that he would attack me. at last i could endure my terrible situation no longer, and determined to make my way from the box at all hazards, and despatch him, if his opposition should render it necessary for me to do so. to get out, i had to pass directly over his body, and he already seemed to anticipate my design--raising himself upon his fore legs (as i perceived by the altered position of his eyes), and displaying the whole of his white fangs, which were easily discernible. i took the remains of the ham-skin, and the bottle containing the liqueur, and secured them about my person, together with a large carving-knife which augustus had left me--then, folding my cloak as closely around me as possible, i made a movement towards the mouth of the box. no sooner did i do this than the dog sprang with a loud growl towards my throat. the whole weight of his body struck me on the right shoulder, and i fell violently to the left, while the enraged animal passed entirely over me. i had fallen upon my knees, with my head buried among the blankets, and these protected me from a second furious assault, during which i felt the sharp teeth pressing vigorously upon the woollen which enveloped my neck--yet, luckily, without being able to penetrate all the folds. i was now beneath the dog, and a few moments would place me completely in his power. despair gave me strength, and i rose bodily up, shaking him from me by main force, and dragging with me the blankets from the mattress. these i now threw over him, and before he could extricate himself i had got through the door and closed it effectually against his pursuit. in this struggle, however, i had been forced to drop the morsel of ham-skin, and i now found my whole stock of provisions reduced to a single gill of liqueur. as this reflection crossed my mind, i felt myself actuated by one of those fits of perverseness which might be supposed to influence a spoiled child in similar circumstances, and, raising the bottle to my lips, i drained it to the last drop, and dashed it furiously upon the floor. scarcely had the echo of the crash died away, when i heard my name pronounced in an eager but subdued voice, issuing from the direction of the steerage. so unexpected was anything of the kind, and so intense was the emotion excited within me by the sound, that i endeavoured in vain to reply. my powers of speech totally failed, and, in an agony of terror lest my friend should conclude me dead, and return without attempting to reach me, i stood up between the crates near the door of the box, trembling convulsively, and gasping and struggling for utterance. had a thousand worlds depended upon a syllable, i could not have spoken it. there was a slight movement now audible among the lumber somewhere forward of my station. the sound presently grew less distinct, then again less so, and still less. shall i ever forget my feelings at this moment? he was going--my friend--my companion, from whom i had a right to expect so much--he was going--he would abandon me--he was gone! he would leave me to perish miserably, to expire in the most horrible and loathsome of dungeons--and one word--one little syllable would save me--yet that single syllable i could not utter! i felt, i am sure, more than ten thousand times the agonies of death itself. my brain reeled, and i fell, deadly sick, against the end of the box. as i fell, the carving-knife was shaken out from the waistband of my pantaloons, and dropped with a rattling sound to the floor. never did any strain of the richest melody come so sweetly to my ears! with the intensest anxiety i listened to ascertain the effect of the noise upon augustus--for i knew that the person who called my name could be no one but himself. all was silent for some moments. at length i again heard the word _arthur!_ repeated in a low tone, and one full of hesitation. reviving hope loosened at once my powers of speech, and i now screamed, at the top of my voice, _"augustus! oh augustus!"_ "hush--for god's sake be silent!" he replied, in a voice trembling with agitation; "i will be with you immediately--as soon as i can make my way through the hold." for a long time i heard him moving among the lumber, and every moment seemed to me an age. at length i felt his hand upon my shoulder, and he placed at the same moment a bottle of water to my lips. those only who have been suddenly redeemed from the jaws of the tomb, or who have known the insufferable torments of thirst under circumstances as aggravated as those which encompassed me in my dreary prison, can form any idea of the unutterable transports which that one long draught of the richest of all physical luxuries afforded. when i had in some degree satisfied my thirst, augustus produced from his pocket three or four cold boiled potatoes, which i devoured with the greatest avidity. he had brought with him a light in a dark lantern, and the grateful rays afforded me scarcely less comfort than the food and drink. but i was impatient to learn the cause of his protracted absence, and he proceeded to recount what had happened on board during my incarceration. chapter iv. the brig put to sea, as i had supposed, in about an hour after he had left the watch. this was on the twentieth of june. it will be remembered that i had then been in the hold for three days; and, during this period, there was so constant a bustle on board, and so much running to and fro, especially in the cabin and staterooms, that he had had no chance of visiting me without the risk of having the secret of the trap discovered. when at length he did come, i had assured him that i was doing as well as possible; and, therefore, for the two next days he felt but little uneasiness on my account--still, however, watching an opportunity of going down. it was not _until the fourth day_ that he found one. several times during this interval he had made up his mind to let his father know of the adventure, and have me come up at once; but we were still within reaching distance of nantucket, and it was doubtful, from some expressions which had escaped captain barnard, whether he would not immediately put back if he discovered me to be on board. besides, upon thinking the matter over, augustus, so he told me, could not imagine that i was in immediate want, or that i would hesitate, in such case, to make myself heard at the trap. when, therefore, he considered everything, he concluded to let me stay until he could meet with an opportunity of visiting me unobserved. this, as i said before, did not occur until the fourth day after his bringing me the watch, and the seventh since i had first entered the hold. he then went down without taking with him any water or provisions, intending in the first place merely to call my attention, and get me to come from the box to the trap--when he would go up to the stateroom and thence hand me down a supply. when he descended for this purpose he found that i was asleep, for it seems that i was snoring very loudly. from all the calculations i can make on the subject, this must have been the slumber into which i fell just after my return from the trap with the watch, and which, consequently, must have lasted _for more than three entire days and nights_ at the very least. latterly, i have had reason, both from my own experience and the assurance of others, to be acquainted with the strong soporific effects of the stench arising from old fish-oil when closely confined; and when i think of the condition of the hold in which i was imprisoned, and the long period during which the brig had been used as a whaling vessel, i am more inclined to wonder that i awoke at all, after once falling asleep, than that i should have slept uninterruptedly for the period specified above. augustus called to me at first in a low voice and without closing the trap--but i made him no reply. he then shut the trap, and spoke to me in a louder, and finally in a very loud tone--still i continued to snore. he was now at a loss what to do. it would take him some time to make his way through the lumber to my box, and in the mean while his absence would be noticed by captain barnard, who had occasion for his services every minute, in arranging and copying papers connected with the business of the voyage. he determined, therefore, upon reflection, to ascend, and await another opportunity of visiting me. he was the more easily induced to this resolve, as my slumber appeared to be of the most tranquil nature, and he could not suppose that i had undergone any inconvenience from my incarceration. he had just made up his mind on these points when his attention was arrested by an unusual bustle, the sound of which proceeded apparently from the cabin. he sprang through the trap as quickly as possible, closed it, and threw open the door of his stateroom. no sooner had he put his foot over the threshold than a pistol flashed in his face, and he was knocked down, at the same moment, by a blow from a handspike. a strong hand held him on the cabin floor, with a tight grasp upon his throat--still he was able to see what was going on around him. his father was tied hand and foot, and lying along the steps of the companion-way with his head down, and a deep wound in the forehead, from which the blood was flowing in a continued stream. he spoke not a word, and was apparently dying. over him stood the first mate, eying him with an expression of fiendish derision, and deliberately searching his pockets, from which he presently drew forth a large wallet and a chronometer. seven of the crew (among whom was the cook, a negro) were rummaging the staterooms on the larboard for arms, where they soon equipped themselves with muskets and ammunition. besides augustus and captain barnard, there were nine men altogether in the cabin, and these among the most ruffianly of the brig's company. the villains now went upon deck, taking my friend with them, after having secured his arms behind his back. they proceeded straight to the forecastle, which was fastened down--two of the mutineers standing by it with axes--two also at the main hatch. the mate called out in a loud voice, "do you hear there below? tumble up with you--one by one, now, mark that--and no grumbling." it was some minutes before any one appeared: at last an englishman, who had shipped as a raw hand, came up, weeping piteously, and entreating the mate in the most humble manner to spare his life. the only reply was a blow on the forehead from an axe. the poor fellow fell to the deck without a groan, and the black cook lifted him up in his arms as he would a child, and tossed him deliberately into the sea. hearing the blow and the plunge of the body, the men below could now be induced to venture on deck neither by threats nor promises, until a proposition was made to smoke them out. a general rush then ensued, and for a moment it seemed possible that the brig might be retaken. the mutineers, however, succeeded at last in closing the forecastle effectually before more than six of their opponents could get up. these six, finding themselves so greatly outnumbered and without arms, submitted after a brief struggle. the mate gave them fair words--no doubt with a view of inducing those below to yield, for they had no difficulty in hearing all that was said on deck. the result proved his sagacity, no less than his diabolical villany. all in the forecastle presently signified their intention of submitting, and, ascending one by one, were pinioned and thrown on their backs together with the first six--there being in all, of the crew who were not concerned in the mutiny, twenty-seven. a scene of the most horrible butchery ensued. the bound seamen were dragged to the gangway. here the cook stood with an axe, striking each victim on the head as he was forced over the side of the vessel by the other mutineers. in this manner twenty-two perished, and augustus had given himself up for lost, expecting every moment his own turn to come next. but it seemed that the villains were now either weary, or in some measure disgusted with their bloody labour; for the four remaining prisoners, together with my friend, who had been thrown on the deck with the rest, were respited while the mate sent below for rum, and the whole murderous party held a drunken carouse, which lasted until sunset. they now fell to disputing in regard to the fate of the survivers, who lay not more than four paces off, and could distinguish every word said. upon some of the mutineers the liquor appeared to have a softening effect, for several voices were heard in favour of releasing the captives altogether, on condition of joining the mutiny and sharing the profits. the black cook, however (who in all respects was a perfect demon, and who seemed to exert as much influence, if not more, than the mate himself), would listen to no proposition of the kind, and rose repeatedly for the purpose of resuming his work at the gangway. fortunately, he was so far overcome by intoxication as to be easily restrained by the less bloodthirsty of the party, among whom was a line-manager, who went by the name of dirk peters. this man was the son of an indian squaw of the tribe of upsarokas, who live among the fastnesses of the black hills near the source of the missouri. his father was a fur-trader, i believe, or at least connected in some manner with the indian trading-posts on lewis river. peters himself was one of the most purely ferocious-looking men i ever beheld. he was short in stature--not more than four feet eight inches high--but his limbs were of the most herculean mould. his hands, especially, were so enormously thick and broad as hardly to retain a human shape. his arms, as well as legs, were _bowed_ in the most singular manner, and appeared to possess no flexibility whatever. his head was equally deformed, being of immense size, with an indentation on the crown (like that on the head of most negroes), and entirely bald. to conceal this latter deficiency, which did not proceed from old age, he usually wore a wig formed of any hair-like material which presented itself--occasionally the skin of a spanish dog or american grizzly bear. at the time spoken of he had on a portion of one of these bearskins; and it added no little to the natural ferocity of his countenance, which betook of the upsaroka character. the mouth extended nearly from ear to ear; the lips were thin, and seemed, like some other portions of his frame, to be devoid of natural pliancy, so that the ruling expression never varied under the influence of any emotion whatever. this ruling expression may be conceived when it is considered that the teeth were exceedingly long and protruding, and never even partially covered, in any instance, by the lips. to pass this man with a casual glance, one might imagine him to be convulsed with laughter--but a second look would induce a shuddering acknowledgment, that if such an expression were indicative of merriment, the merriment must be that of a demon. of this singular being many anecdotes were prevalent among the seafaring men of nantucket. these anecdotes went to prove his prodigious strength when under excitement, and some of them had given rise to a doubt of his sanity. but on board the grampus, it seems, he was regarded at the time of the mutiny with feelings more of derision than of anything else. i have been thus particular in speaking of dirk peters, because, ferocious as he appeared, he proved the main instrument in preserving the life of augustus, and because i shall have frequent occasion to mention him hereafter in the course of my narrative--a narrative, let me here say, which, in its latter portions, will be found to include incidents of a nature so entirely out of the range of human experience, and for this reason so far beyond the limits of human credulity, that i proceed in utter hopelessness of obtaining credence for all that i shall tell, yet confidently trusting in time and progressing science to verify some of the most important and most improbable of my statements. after much indecision and two or three violent quarrels, it was determined at last that all the prisoners (with the exception of augustus, whom peters insisted in a jocular manner upon keeping as his clerk) should be set adrift in one of the smallest whaleboats. the mate went down into the cabin to see if captain barnard was still living--for, it will be remembered, he was left below when the mutineers came up. presently the two made their appearance, the captain pale as death, but somewhat recovered from the effects of his wound. he spoke to the men in a voice hardly articulate, entreated them not to set him adrift, but to return to their duty, and promising to land them wherever they chose, and to take no steps for bringing them to justice. he might as well have spoken to the winds. two of the ruffians seized him by the arms and hurled him over the brig's side into the boat, which had been lowered while the mate went below. the four men who were lying on the deck were then untied and ordered to follow, which they did without attempting any resistance--augustus being still left in his painful position, although he struggled and prayed only for the poor satisfaction of being permitted to bid his father farewell. a handful of sea-biscuit and a jug of water were now handed down; but neither mast, sail, oar, nor compass. the boat was towed astern for a few minutes, during which the mutineers held another consultation--it was then finally cut adrift. by this time night had come on--there were neither moon nor stars visible--and a short and ugly sea was running, although there was no great deal of wind. the boat was instantly out of sight, and little hope could be entertained for the unfortunate sufferers who were in it. this event happened, however, in latitude <UNK> <UNK> north, longitude <UNK> <UNK> west, and consequently at no very great distance from the bermuda islands. augustus therefore endeavoured to console himself with the idea that the boat might either succeed in reaching the land, or come sufficiently near to be fallen in with by vessels off the coast. all sail was now put upon the brig, and she continued her original course to the southwest--the mutineers being bent upon some piratical expedition, in which, from all that could be understood, a ship was to be intercepted on her way from the cape verd islands to porto rico. no attention was paid to augustus, who was untied and suffered to go about anywhere forward of the cabin companion-way. dirk peters treated him with some degree of kindness, and on one occasion saved him from the brutality of the cook. his situation was still one of the most precarious, as the men were continually intoxicated, and there was no relying upon their continued good-humour or carelessness in regard to himself. his anxiety on my account he represented, however, as the most distressing result of his condition; and, indeed, i had never reason to doubt the sincerity of his friendship. more than once he had resolved to acquaint the mutineers with the secret of my being on board, but was restrained from so doing, partly through recollection of the atrocities he had already beheld, and partly through a hope of being able soon to bring me relief. for the latter purpose he was constantly on the watch; but, in spite of the most constant vigilance, three days elapsed after the boat was cut adrift before any chance occurred. at length, on the night of the third day, there came on a heavy blow from the eastward, and all hands were called up to take in sail. during the confusion which ensued, he made his way below unobserved, and into the stateroom. what was his grief and horror in discovering that the latter had been rendered a place of deposite for a variety of sea-stores and ship-furniture, and that several fathoms of old chain-cable, which had been stowed away beneath the companion-ladder, had been dragged thence to make room for a chest, and were now lying immediately upon the trap! to remove it without discovery was impossible, and he returned on deck as quickly as he could. as he came up the mate seized him by the throat, and demanding what he had been doing in the cabin, was about flinging him over the larboard bulwark, when his life was again preserved through the interference of dirk peters. augustus was now put in handcuffs (of which there were several pairs on board), and his feet lashed tightly together. he was then taken into the steerage, and thrown into a lower berth next to the forecastle bulkheads, with the assurance that he should never put his foot on deck again "until the brig was no longer a brig." this was the expression of the cook, who threw him into the berth--it is hardly possible to say what precise meaning was intended by the phrase. the whole affair, however, proved the ultimate means of my relief, as will presently appear. chapter v. for some minutes after the cook had left the forecastle, augustus abandoned himself to despair, never hoping to leave the berth alive. he now came to the resolution of acquainting the first of the men who should come down with my situation, thinking it better to let me take my chance with the mutineers than perish of thirst in the hold--for it had been ten days since i was first imprisoned, and my jug of water was not a plentiful supply even for four. as he was thinking on this subject, the idea came all at once into his head that it might be possible to communicate with me by the way of the main hold. in any other circumstances, the difficulty and hazard of the undertaking would have prevented him from attempting it; but now he had, at all events, little prospect of life, and consequently little to lose--he bent his whole mind, therefore, upon the task. his handcuffs were the first consideration. at first he saw no method of removing them, and feared that he should thus be baffled in the very outset; but, upon a closer scrutiny, he discovered that the irons could be slipped off and on at pleasure with very little effort or inconvenience, merely by squeezing his hands through them--this species of manacle being altogether ineffectual in confining young persons, in whom the smaller bones readily yield to pressure. he now untied his feet, and, leaving the cord in such a manner that it could easily be readjusted in the event of any person's coming down, proceeded to examine the bulkhead where it joined the berth. the partition here was of soft pine board, an inch thick, and he saw that he should have little trouble in cutting his way through. a voice was now heard at the forecastle companion-way, and he had just time to put his right hand into its handcuff (the left had not been removed), and to draw the rope in a slipknot around his ankle, when dirk peters came below, followed by tiger, who immediately leaped into the berth and lay down. the dog had been brought on board by augustus, who knew my attachment to the animal, and thought it would give me pleasure to have him with me during the voyage. he went up to our house for him immediately after first taking me into the hold, but did not think of mentioning the circumstance upon his bringing the watch. since the mutiny, augustus had not seen him before his appearance with dirk peters, and had given him up for lost, supposing him to have been thrown overboard by some of the malignant villains belonging to the mate's gang. it appeared afterward that he had crawled into a hole beneath a whaleboat, from which, not having room to turn round, he could not extricate himself. peters at last let him out, and with a species of good feeling which my friend knew well how to appreciate, had now brought him to him in the forecastle as a companion, leaving at the same time some salt junk and potatoes, with a can of water; he then went on deck, promising to come down with something more to eat on the next day. when he had gone, augustus freed both hands from the manacles and unfastened his feet. he then turned down the head of the mattress on which he had been lying, and with his penknife (for the ruffians had not thought it worth while to search him) commenced cutting vigorously across one of the partition planks, as closely as possible to the floor of the berth. he chose to cut here, because, if suddenly interrupted, he would be able to conceal what had been done by letting the head of the mattress fall into its proper position. for the remainder of the day, however, no disturbance occurred, and by night he had completely divided the plank. it should here be observed, that none of the crew occupied the forecastle as a sleeping-place, living altogether in the cabin since the mutiny, drinking the wines, and feasting on the sea stores of captain barnard, and giving no more heed than was absolutely necessary to the navigation of the brig. these circumstances proved fortunate both for myself and augustus; for, had matters been otherwise, he would have found it impossible to reach me. as it was, he proceeded with confidence in his design. it was near daybreak, however, before he completed the second division of the board (which was about a foot above the first cut), thus making an aperture quite large enough to admit his passage through with facility to the main orlop deck. having got here, he made his way with but little trouble to the lower main hatch, although in so doing he had to scramble over tiers of oil-casks piled nearly as high as the upper deck, there being barely room enough left for his body. upon reaching the hatch, he found that tiger had followed him below, squeezing between two rows of the casks. it was now too late, however, to attempt getting to me before dawn, as the chief difficulty lay in passing through the close stowage in the lower hold. he therefore resolved to return, and wait till the next night. with this design he proceeded to loosen the hatch, so that he might have as little detention as possible when he should come again. no sooner had he loosened it than tiger sprang eagerly to the small opening produced, snuffed for a moment, and then uttered a long whine, scratching at the same time, as if anxious to remove the covering with his paws. there could be no doubt, from his behaviour, that he was aware of my being in the hold, and augustus thought it possible that he would be able to get to me if he put him down. he now hit upon the expedient of sending the note, as it was especially desirable that i should make no attempt at forcing my way out, at least under existing circumstances, and there could be no certainty of his getting to me himself on the morrow as he intended. after events proved how fortunate it was that the idea occurred to him as it did: for, had it not been for the receipt of the note, i should undoubtedly have fallen upon some plan, however desperate, of alarming the crew, and both our lives would most probably have been sacrificed in consequence. having concluded to write, the difficulty was now to procure the materials for so doing. an old toothpick was soon made into a pen; and this by means of feeling altogether, for the between-decks were as dark as pitch. paper enough was obtained from the back of a letter--a duplicate of the forged letter from mr. ross. this had been the original draught; but the handwriting not being sufficiently well imitated, augustus had written another, thrusting the first, by good fortune, into his coat-pocket, where it was now most opportunely discovered. ink alone was thus wanting, and a substitute was immediately found for this by means of a slight incision with the penknife on the back of a finger just above the nail--a copious flow of blood ensuing, as usual from wounds in that vicinity. the note was now written, as well as it could be in the dark and under the circumstances. it briefly explained that a mutiny had taken place; that captain barnard was set adrift; and that i might expect immediate relief as far as provisions were concerned, but must not venture upon making any disturbance. it concluded with these words, _"i have scrawled this with blood--your life depends upon lying close."_ the slip of paper being tied upon the dog, he was now put down the hatchway, and augustus made the best of his way back to the forecastle, where he found no reason to believe that any of the crew had been in his absence. to conceal the hole in the partition, he drove his knife in just above it, and hung up a pea-jacket which he found in the berth. his handcuffs were then replaced, and also the rope around his ankles. these arrangements were scarcely completed when dirk peters came below, very drunk, but in excellent humour, and bringing with him my friend's allowance of provision for the day. this consisted of a dozen large irish potatoes roasted, and a pitcher of water. he sat for some time on a chest by the berth, and talked freely about the mate, and the general concerns of the brig. his demeanour was exceedingly capricious and even grotesque. at one time augustus was much alarmed by his odd conduct. at last, however, he went on deck, muttering a promise to bring his prisoner a good dinner on the morrow. during the day two of the crew (harpooners) came down, accompanied by the cook, all three in nearly the last stage of intoxication. like peters, they made no scruple of talking unreservedly about their plans. it appeared that they were much divided among themselves as to their ultimate course, agreeing in no point except the attack on the ship from the cape verd islands, with which they were in hourly expectation of meeting. as far as could be ascertained, the mutiny had not been brought about altogether for the sake of booty; a private pique of the chief mate's against captain barnard having been the main instigation. there now seemed to be two principal factions among the crew--one headed by the mate, the other by the cook. the former party were for seizing the first suitable vessel which should present itself, and equipping it at some of the west india islands for a piratical cruise. the latter division, however, which was the stronger, and included dirk peters among its partisans, were bent upon pursuing the course originally laid out for the brig into the south pacific; there either to take whale, or act otherwise, as circumstances should suggest. the representations of peters, who had frequently visited these regions, had great weight, apparently, with the mutineers, wavering as they were between half-engendered notions of profit and pleasure. he dwelt on the world of novelty and amusement to be found among the innumerable islands of the pacific, on the perfect security and freedom from all restraint to be enjoyed, but, more particularly, on the deliciousness of the climate, on the abundant means of good living, and on the voluptuous beauty of the women. as yet, nothing had been absolutely determined upon; but the pictures of the hybrid line-manager were taking strong hold upon the ardent imaginations of the seamen, and there was every probability that his intentions would be finally carried into effect. the three men went away in about an hour, and no one else entered the forecastle all day. augustus lay quiet until nearly night. he then freed himself from the rope and irons, and prepared for his attempt. a bottle was found in one of the berths, and this he filled with water from the pitcher left by peters, storing his pockets at the same time with cold potatoes. to his great joy he also came across a lantern, with a small piece of tallow candle in it. this he could light at any moment, as he had in his possession a box of phosphorus matches. when it was quite dark, he got through the hole in the bulkhead, having taken the precaution to arrange the bedclothes in the berth so as to convey the idea of a person covered up. when through, he hung up the pea-jacket on his knife, as before, to conceal the aperture--this manoeuvre being easily effected, as he did not readjust the piece of plank taken out until afterward. he was now on the main orlop deck, and proceeded to make his way, as before, between the upper deck and the oil-casks to the main hatchway. having reached this, he lit the piece of candle, and descended, groping with extreme difficulty among the compact stowage of the hold. in a few moments he became alarmed at the insufferable stench and the closeness of the atmosphere. he could not think it possible that i had survived my confinement for so long a period breathing so oppressive an air. he called my name repeatedly, but i made him no reply, and his apprehensions seemed thus to be confirmed. the brig was rolling violently, and there was so much noise in consequence, that it was useless to listen for any weak sound, such as those of my breathing or snoring. he threw open the lantern, and held it as high as possible, whenever an opportunity occurred, in order that, by observing the light, i might, if alive, be aware that succour was approaching. still nothing was heard from me, and the supposition of my death began to assume the character of certainty. he determined, nevertheless, to force a passage, if possible, to the box, and at least ascertain beyond a doubt the truth of his surmises. he pushed on for some time in a most pitiable state of anxiety, until, at length, he found the pathway utterly blocked up, and that there was no possibility of making any farther way by the course in which he had set out. overcome now by his feelings, he threw himself among the lumber in despair, and wept like a child. it was at this period that he heard the crash occasioned by the bottle which i had thrown down. fortunate, indeed, was it that the incident occurred--for, upon this incident, trivial as it appears, the thread of my destiny depended. many years elapsed, however, before i was aware of this fact. a natural shame and regret for his weakness and indecision prevented augustus from confiding to me at once what a more intimate and unreserved communion afterward induced him to reveal. upon finding his further progress in the hold impeded by obstacles which he could not overcome, he had resolved to abandon his attempt at reaching me, and return at once to the forecastle. before condemning him entirely on this head, the harassing circumstances which embarrassed him should be taken into consideration. the night was fast wearing away, and his absence from the forecastle might be discovered; and, indeed, would necessarily be so, if he should fail to get back to the berth by daybreak. his candle was expiring in the socket, and there would be the greatest difficulty in retracing his way to the hatchway in the dark. it must be allowed, too, that he had every good reason to believe me dead; in which event no benefit could result to me from his reaching the box, and a world of danger would be encountered to no purpose by himself. he had repeatedly called, and i had made him no answer. i had been now eleven days and nights with no more water than that contained in the jug which he had left with me, a supply which it was not at all probable i had hoarded in the beginning of my confinement, as i had had every cause to expect a speedy release. the atmosphere of the hold, too, must have appeared to him, coming from the comparatively open air of the steerage, of a nature absolutely poisonous, and by far more intolerable than it had seemed to me upon my first taking up my quarters in the box--the hatchways at that time having been constantly open for many months previous. add to these considerations that of the scene of bloodshed and terror so lately witnessed by my friend; his confinement, privations, and narrow escapes from death; together with the frail and equivocal tenure by which he still existed--circumstances all so well calculated to prostrate every energy of mind--and the reader will be easily brought, as i have been, to regard his apparent falling off in friendship and in faith with sentiments rather of sorrow than of anger. the crash of the bottle was distinctly heard, yet augustus was not sure that it proceeded from the hold. the doubt, however, was sufficient inducement to persevere. he clambered up nearly to the orlop deck by means of the stowage, and then watching for a lull in the pitchings of the vessel, he called out to me in as loud a tone as he could command--regardless, for the moment, of the danger of being overheard by the crew. it will be remembered that on this occasion the voice reached me, but i was so entirely overcome by violent agitation as to be incapable of reply. confident, now, that his worst apprehensions were well founded, he descended, with a view of getting back to the forecastle without loss of time. in his haste some small boxes were thrown down, the noise occasioned by which i heard, as will be recollected. he had made considerable progress on his return when the fall of the knife again caused him to hesitate. he retraced his steps immediately, and, clambering up the stowage a second time, called out my name, loudly as before, having watched for a lull. this time i found voice to answer. overjoyed at discovering me to be still alive, he now resolved to brave every difficulty and danger in reaching me. having extricated himself as quickly as possible from the labyrinth of lumber by which he was hemmed in, he at length struck into an opening which promised better, and finally, after a series of struggles, arrived at the box in a state of utter exhaustion. chapter vi. the leading particulars of this narration were all that augustus communicated to me while we remained near the box. it was not until afterward that he entered fully into all the details. he was apprehensive of being missed, and i was wild with impatience to leave my detested place of confinement. we resolved to make our way at once to the hole in the bulkhead, near which i was to remain for the present, while he went through to reconnoitre. to leave tiger in the box was what neither of us could endure to think of; yet, how to act otherwise was the question. he now seemed to be perfectly quiet, and we could not even distinguish the sound of his breathing upon applying our ears closely to the box. i was convinced that he was dead, and determined to open the door. we found him lying at full length, apparently in a deep stupor, yet still alive. no time was to be lost, yet i could not bring myself to abandon an animal who had now been twice instrumental in saving my life, without some attempt at preserving him. we therefore dragged him along with us as well as we could, although with the greatest difficulty and fatigue; augustus, during part of the time, being forced to clamber over the impediments in our way with the huge dog in his arms--a feat to which the feebleness of my frame rendered me totally inadequate. at length we succeeded in reaching the hole, when augustus got through, and tiger was pushed in afterward. all was found to be safe, and we did not fail to return sincere thanks to god for our deliverance from the imminent danger we had escaped. for the present it was agreed that i should remain near the opening, through which my companion could readily supply me with a part of his daily provision, and where i could have the advantages of breathing an atmosphere comparatively pure. in explanation of some portions of this narrative wherein i have spoken of the stowage of the brig, and which may appear ambiguous to some of my readers who may have seen a proper or regular stowage, i must here state that the manner in which this most important duty had been performed on board the grampus was a most shameful piece of neglect on the part of captain barnard, who was by no means as careful or as experienced a seaman as the hazardous nature of the service on which he was employed would seem necessarily to demand. a proper stowage cannot be accomplished in a careless manner, and many most disastrous accidents, even within the limits of my own experience, have arisen from neglect or ignorance in this particular. coasting vessels, in the frequent hurry and bustle attendant upon taking in or discharging cargo, are the most liable to mishap from the want of a proper attention to stowage. the great point is to allow no possibility of the cargo or ballast's shifting position even in the most violent rollings of the vessel. with this end, great attention must be paid, not only to the bulk taken in, but to the nature of the bulk, and whether there be a full or only a partial cargo. in most kinds of freight the stowage is accomplished by means of a screw. thus, in a load of tobacco or flour, the whole is screwed so tightly into the hold of the vessel that the barrels or hogsheads upon discharging are found to be completely flattened, and take some time to regain their original shape. this screwing, however, is resorted to principally with a view of obtaining more room in the hold; for in a _full_ load of any such commodities as flour or tobacco, there can be no danger of any shifting whatever, at least none from which inconvenience can result. there have been instances, indeed, where this method of screwing has resulted in the most lamentable consequences, arising from a cause altogether distinct from the danger attendant upon a shifting of cargo. a load of cotton, for example, tightly screwed while in certain conditions, has been known, through the expansion of its bulk, to rend a vessel asunder at sea. there can be no doubt, either, that the same result would ensue in the case of tobacco, while undergoing its usual course of fermentation, were it not for the interstices consequent upon the rotundity of the hogsheads. it is when a partial cargo is received that danger is chiefly to be apprehended from shifting, and that precautions should be always taken to guard against such misfortune. only those who have encountered a violent gale of wind, or, rather, who have experienced the rolling of a vessel in a sudden calm after the gale, can form an idea of the tremendous force of the plunges, and of the consequent terrible impetus given to all loose articles in the vessel. it is then that the necessity of a cautious stowage, when there is a partial cargo, becomes obvious. when lying to (especially with a small head sail), a vessel which is not properly modelled in the bows is frequently thrown upon her beam-ends; this occurring even every fifteen or twenty minutes upon an average, yet without any serious consequences resulting, _provided there be a proper stowage_. if this, however, has not been strictly attended to, in the first of these heavy lurches the whole of the cargo tumbles over to the side of the vessel which lies upon the water, and, being thus prevented from regaining her equilibrium, as she would otherwise necessarily do, she is certain to fill in a few seconds and go down. it is not too much to say that at least one half of the instances in which vessels have foundered in heavy gales at sea may be attributed to a shifting of cargo or of ballast. when a partial cargo of any kind is taken on board, the whole, after being first stowed as compactly as may be, should be covered with a layer of stout shifting-boards, extending completely across the vessel. upon these boards strong temporary stanchions should be erected, reaching to the timbers above, and thus securing everything in its place. in cargoes consisting of grain, or any similar matter, additional precautions are requisite. a hold filled entirely with grain upon leaving port will be found not more than three fourths full upon leaching its destination--this, too, although the freight, when measured bushel by bushel by the consignee, will overrun by a vast deal (on account of the swelling of the grain) the quantity consigned. this result is occasioned by _settling_ during the voyage, and is the more perceptible in proportion to the roughness of the weather experienced. if grain loosely thrown in a vessel, then, is ever so well secured by shifting-boards and stanchions, it will be liable to shift in a long passage so greatly as to bring about the most distressing calamities. to prevent these, every method should be employed before leaving port to _settle_ the cargo as much as possible; and for this there are many contrivances, among which may be mentioned the driving of wedges into the grain. even after all this is done, and unusual pains taken to secure the shifting-boards, no seaman who knows what he is about will feel altogether secure in a gale of any violence with a cargo of grain on board, and, least of all, with a partial cargo. yet there are hundreds of our coasting vessels, and, it is likely, many more from the ports of europe, which sail daily with partial cargoes, even of the most dangerous species, and without any precautions whatever. the wonder is that no more accidents occur than do actually happen. a lamentable instance of this heedlessness occurred to my knowledge in the case of captain joel rice of the schooner firefly, which sailed from richmond, virginia, to madeira, with a cargo of corn, in the year <UNK> the captain had gone many voyages without serious accident, although he was in the habit of paying no attention whatever to his stowage, more than to secure it in the ordinary manner. he had never before sailed with a cargo of grain, and on this occasion had the corn thrown on board loosely, when it did not much more than half fill the vessel. for the first portion of the voyage he met with nothing more than light breezes; but when within a day's sail of madeira there came on a strong gale from the n. n. e. which forced him to lie to. he brought the schooner to the wind under a double-reefed foresail alone, when she rode as well as any vessel could be expected to do, and shipped not a drop of water. towards night the gale somewhat abated, and she rolled with more unsteadiness than before, but still did very well, until a heavy lurch threw her upon her beam-ends to starboard. the corn was then heard to shift bodily, the force of the movement bursting open the main hatchway. the vessel went down like a shot. this happened within hail of a small sloop from madeira, which picked up one of the crew (the only person saved), and which rode out the gale in perfect security, as indeed a jollyboat might have done under proper management. the stowage on board the grampus was most clumsily done, if stowage that could be called which was little better than a promiscuous huddling together of <UNK> and ship furniture. i have already spoken of the condition of articles in the hold. on the orlop deck there was space enough for my body (as i have stated) between the oil-casks and the upper deck; a space was left open around the main hatchway; and several other large spaces were left in the stowage. near the hole cut through the bulkhead by augustus there was room enough for an entire cask, and in this space i found myself comfortably situated for the present. [footnote <UNK> whaling vessels are usually fitted with iron oil-tanks--why the grampus was not i have never been able to ascertain.] by the time my friend had got safely into the berth, and readjusted his handcuffs and the rope, it was broad daylight. we had made a narrow escape indeed; for scarcely had he arranged all matters, when the mate came below, with dirk peters and the cook. they talked for some time about the vessel from the cape verds, and seemed to be excessively anxious for her appearance. at length the cook came to the berth in which augustus was lying, and seated himself in it near the head. i could see and hear everything from my hiding-place, for the piece cut out had not been put back, and i was in momentary expectation that the negro would fall against the pea-jacket, which was hung up to conceal the aperture, in which case all would have been discovered, and our lives would, no doubt, have been instantly sacrificed. our good fortune prevailed, however; and although he frequently touched it as the vessel rolled, he never pressed against it sufficiently to bring about a discovery. the bottom of the jacket had been carefully fastened to the bulkhead, so that the hole might not be seen by its swinging to one side. all this time tiger was lying in the foot of the berth, and appeared to have recovered in some measure his faculties, for i could see him occasionally open his eyes and draw a long breath. after a few minutes the mate and cook went above, leaving dirk peters behind, who, as soon as they were gone, came and sat himself down in the place just occupied by the mate. he began to talk very sociably with augustus, and we could now see that the greater part of his apparent intoxication, while the two others were with him, was a feint. he answered all my companion's questions with perfect freedom; told him that he had no doubt of his father's having been picked up, as there were no less than five sail in sight just before sundown on the day he was cut adrift; and used other language of a consolatory nature, which occasioned me no less surprise than pleasure. indeed, i began to entertain hopes, that through the instrumentality of peters we might be finally enabled to regain possession of the brig, and this idea i mentioned to augustus as soon as i found an opportunity. he thought the matter possible, but urged the necessity of the greatest caution in making the attempt, as the conduct of the hybrid appeared to be instigated by the most arbitrary caprice alone; and, indeed, it was difficult to say if he was at any moment of sound mind. peters went upon deck in about an hour, and did not return again until noon, when he brought augustus a plentiful supply of junk beef and pudding. of this, when we were left alone, i partook heartily, without returning through the hole. no one else came down into the forecastle during the day, and at night i got into augustus's berth, where i slept soundly and sweetly until nearly daybreak, when he awakened me upon hearing a stir upon deck, and i regained my hiding-place as quickly as possible. when the day was fully broke, we found that tiger had recovered his strength almost entirely, and gave no indications of hydrophobia, drinking a little water that was offered him with great apparent eagerness. during the day he regained all his former vigour and appetite. his strange conduct had been brought on, no doubt, by the deleterious quality of the air of the hold, and had no connexion with canine madness. i could not sufficiently rejoice that i had persisted in bringing him with me from the box. this day was the thirtieth of june, and the thirteenth since the grampus made sail from nantucket. on the second of july the mate came below, drunk as usual, and in an excessively good-humour. he came to augustus's berth, and, giving him a slap on the back, asked him if he thought he could behave himself if he let him loose, and whether he would promise not to be going into the cabin again. to this, of course, my friend answered in the affirmative, when the ruffian set him at liberty, after making him drink from a flask of rum which he drew from his coat-pocket. both now went on deck, and i did not see augustus for about three hours. he then came below with the good news that he had obtained permission to go about the brig as he pleased anywhere forward of the mainmast, and that he had been ordered to sleep, as usual, in the forecastle. he brought me, too, a good dinner, and a plentiful supply of water. the brig was still cruising for the vessel from the cape verds, and a sail was now in sight which was thought to be the one in question. as the events of the ensuing eight days were of little importance, and had no direct bearing upon the main incidents of my narrative, i will here throw them into the form of a journal, as i do not wish to omit them altogether. _july <UNK> augustus furnished me with three blankets, with which i contrived a comfortable bed in my hiding-place. no one came below, except my companion, during the day. tiger took his station in the berth just by the aperture, and slept heavily, as if not yet entirely recovered from the effects of his sickness. towards night a flaw of wind struck the brig before sail could be taken in, and very nearly capsized her. the puff died away immediately, however, and no damage was done beyond the splitting of the foretopsail. dirk peters treated augustus all this day with great kindness, and entered into a long conversation with him respecting the pacific ocean, and the islands he had visited in that region. he asked him whether he would not like to go with the mutineers on a kind of exploring and pleasure voyage in those quarters, and said that the men were gradually coming over to the mate's views. to this augustus thought it best to reply that he would be glad to go on such an adventure, since nothing better could be done, and that anything was preferable to a piratical life. _july <UNK> the vessel in sight proved to be a small brig from liverpool, and was allowed to pass unmolested. augustus spent most of his time on deck, with a view of obtaining all the information in his power respecting the intentions of the mutineers. they had frequent and violent quarrels among themselves, in one of which a harpooner, jim bonner, was thrown overboard. the party of the mate was gaining ground. jim bonner belonged to the cook's gang, of which peters was a partisan. _july <UNK> about daybreak there came on a stiff breeze from the west, which at noon freshened into a gale, so that the brig could carry nothing more than her trysail and foresail. in taking in the foretopsail, simms, one of the common hands, and belonging also to the cook's gang, fell overboard, being very much in liquor, and was drowned--no attempt being made to save him. the whole number of persons on board was now thirteen, to wit: dirk peters; seymour, the black cook; ---- jones; ---- greely; hartman rogers; and william allen, of the cook's party; the mate, whose name i never learned; absalom hicks; ---- wilson; john hunt; and richard parker, of the mate's party--besides augustus and myself. _july <UNK> the gale lasted all this day, blowing in heavy squalls, accompanied with rain. the brig took in a good deal of water through her seams, and one of the pumps was kept continually going, augustus being forced to take his turn. just at twilight a large ship passed close by us, without having been discovered until within hail. this ship was supposed to be the one for which the mutineers were on the look-out. the mate hailed her, but the reply was drowned in the roaring of the gale. at eleven, a sea was shipped amid-ships, which tore away a great portion of the larboard bulwarks, and did some other slight damage. towards morning the weather moderated, and at sunrise there was very little wind. _july <UNK> there was a heavy swell running all this day, during which the brig, being light, rolled excessively, and many articles broke loose in the hold, as i could hear distinctly from my hiding-place. i suffered a great deal from sea-sickness. peters had a long conversation this day with augustus, and told him that two of his gang, greely and allen, had gone over to the mate, and were resolved to turn pirates. he put several questions to augustus which he did not then exactly understand. during a part of this evening the leak gained upon the vessel; and little could be done to remedy it, as it was occasioned by the brig's straining, and taking in the water through her seams. a sail was thrummed, and got under the bows, which aided us in some measure, so that we began to gain upon the leak. _july <UNK> a light breeze sprung up at sunrise from the eastward, when the mate headed the brig to the southwest, with the intention of making some of the west india islands, in pursuance of his piratical designs. no opposition was made by peters or the cook; at least none in the hearing of augustus. all idea of taking the vessel from the cape verds was abandoned. the leak was now easily kept under by one pump going every three quarters of an hour. the sail was drawn from beneath the bows. spoke two small schooners during the day. _july <UNK> fine weather. all hands employed in repairing bulwarks. peters had again a long conversation with augustus, and spoke more plainly than he had done heretofore. he said nothing should induce him to come into the mate's views, and even hinted his intention of taking the brig out of his hands. he asked my friend if he could depend upon his aid in such case, to which augustus said, "yes," without hesitation. peters then said he would sound the others of his party upon the subject, and went away. during the remainder of the day augustus had no opportunity of speaking with him privately. chapter vii. _july <UNK> spoke a brig from rio, bound to norfolk. weather hazy, with a light baffling wind from the eastward. to-day hartman rogers died, having been attacked on the eighth with spasms after drinking a glass of grog. this man was of the cook's party, and one upon whom peters placed his main reliance. he told augustus that he believed the mate had poisoned him, and that he expected, if he did not be on the look-out, his own turn would come shortly. there were now only himself, jones, and the cook belonging to his own gang--on the other side there were five. he had spoken to jones about taking the command from the mate; but the project having been coolly received, he had been deterred from pressing the matter any further, or from saying anything to the cook. it was well, as it happened, that he was so prudent, for in the afternoon the cook expressed his determination of siding with the mate, and went over formally to that party; while jones took an opportunity of quarrelling with peters, and hinted that he would let the mate know of the plan in agitation. there was now, evidently, no time to be lost, and peters expressed his determination of attempting to take the vessel at all hazards, provided augustus would lend him his aid. my friend at once assured him of his willingness to enter into any plan for that purpose, and, thinking the opportunity a favourable one, made known the fact of my being on board. at this the hybrid was not more astonished than delighted, as he had no reliance whatever upon jones, whom he already considered as belonging to the party of the mate. they went below immediately, when augustus called to me by name, and peters and myself were soon made acquainted. it was agreed that we should attempt to retake the vessel upon the first good opportunity, leaving jones altogether out of our councils. in the event of success we were to run the brig into the first port that offered, and deliver her up. the desertion of his party had frustrated peters's design of going into the pacific--an adventure which could not be accomplished without a crew, and he depended upon either getting acquitted upon trial on the score of insanity (which he solemnly averred had actuated him in lending his aid to the mutiny), or upon obtaining a pardon, if found guilty, through the representations of augustus and myself. our deliberations were interrupted for the present by the cry of "all hands take in sail," and peters and augustus ran up on deck. as usual, the crew were nearly all drunk; and, before sail could be properly taken in, a violent squall laid the brig on her beam-ends. by keeping her away, however, she righted, having shipped a good deal of water. scarcely was everything secure, when another squall took the vessel, and immediately afterward another--no damage being done. there was every appearance of a gale of wind, which, indeed, shortly came on, with great fury, from the northward and westward. all was made as snug as possible, and we laid to, as usual, under a close-reefed foresail. as night drew on, the wind increased in violence, with a remarkably heavy sea. peters now came into the forecastle with augustus, and we resumed our deliberations. we agreed that no opportunity could be more favourable than the present for carrying our design into effect, as an attempt at such a moment would never be anticipated. as the brig was snugly laid to, there would be no necessity of manoeuvring her until good weather, when, if we succeeded in our attempt, we might liberate one, or perhaps two of the men, to aid us in taking her into port. the main difficulty was the great disproportion in our forces. there were only three of us, and in the cabin there were nine. all the arms on board, too, were in their possession, with the exception of a pair of small pistols which peters had concealed about his person, and the large seaman's knife which he always wore in the waistband of his pantaloons. from certain indications, too, such, for example, as there being no such thing as an axe or a handspike lying in their customary places, we began to fear that the mate had his suspicions, at least in regard to peters, and that he would let slip no opportunity of getting rid of him. it was clear, indeed, that what we should determine to do could not be done too soon. still the odds were too much against us to allow of our proceeding without the greatest caution. peters proposed that he should go up on deck, and enter into conversation with the watch (allen), when he would be able to throw him into the sea without trouble, and without making any disturbance, by seizing a good opportunity; that augustus and myself should then come up, and endeavour to provide ourselves with some kind of weapons from the deck; and that we should then make a rush together, and secure the companion-way before any opposition could be offered. i objected to this, because i could not believe that the mate (who was a cunning fellow in all matters which did not affect his superstitious prejudices) would suffer himself to be so easily entrapped. the very fact of there being a watch on deck at all was sufficient proof that he was upon the alert--it not being usual, except in vessels where discipline is most rigidly enforced, to station a watch on deck when a vessel is lying to in a gale of wind. as i address myself principally, if not altogether, to persons who have never been to sea, it may be as well to state the exact condition of a vessel under such circumstances. lying to, or, in sea-parlance "laying to," is a measure resorted to for various purposes, and effected in various manners. in moderate weather, it is frequently done with a view of merely bringing the vessel to a stand-still, to wait for another vessel, or any similar object. if the vessel which lies to is under full sail, the manoeuvre is usually accomplished by throwing round some portion of her sails so as to let the wind take them aback, when she becomes stationary. but we are now speaking of lying to in a gale of wind. this is done when the wind is ahead, and too violent to admit of carrying sail without danger of capsizing; and sometimes even when the wind is fair, but the sea too heavy for the vessel to be put before it. if a vessel be suffered to scud before the wind in a very heavy sea, much damage is usually done her by the shipping of water over her stern, and sometimes by the violent plunges she makes forward. this manoeuvre, then, is seldom resorted to in such case, unless through necessity. when the vessel is in a leaky condition, she is often put before the wind even in the heaviest seas; for, when lying to, her seams are sure to be greatly opened by her violent straining, and it is not so much the case when scudding. often, too, it becomes necessary to scud a vessel, either when the blast is so exceedingly furious as to tear in pieces the sail which is employed with a view of bringing her head to the wind, or when, through the false modelling of the frame or other causes, this main object cannot be effected. vessels in a gale of wind are laid to in different manners, according to their peculiar construction. some lie to best under a foresail, and this, i believe, is the sail most usually employed. large square-rigged vessels have sails for the express purpose, called storm-staysails. but the jib is occasionally employed by itself--sometimes the jib and foresail, or a double-reefed foresail, and not unfrequently the after-sails, are made use of. foretopsails are very often found to answer the purpose better than any other species of sail. the grampus was generally laid to under a close-reefed foresail. when a vessel is to be laid to, her head is brought up to the wind just so nearly as to fill the sail under which she lies, when hauled flat aft, that is, when brought diagonally across the vessel. this being done, the bows point within a few degrees of the direction from which the wind issues, and the windward bow of course receives the shock of the waves. in this situation a good vessel will ride out a very heavy gale of wind without shipping a drop of water, and without any further attention being requisite on the part of the crew. the helm is usually lashed down, but this is altogether unnecessary (except on account of the noise it makes when loose), for the rudder has no effect upon the vessel when lying to. indeed, the helm had far better be left loose than lashed very fast, for the rudder is apt to be torn off by heavy seas if there be no room for the helm to play. as long as the sail holds, a well-modelled vessel will maintain her situation, and ride every sea, as if instinct with life and reason. if the violence of the wind, however, should tear the sail into pieces (a feat which it requires a perfect hurricane to accomplish under ordinary circumstances), there is then imminent danger. the vessel falls off from the wind, and, coming broadside to the sea, is completely at its mercy: the only resource in this case is to put her quickly before the wind, letting her scud until some other sail can be set. some vessels will lie to under no sail whatever, but such are not to be trusted at sea. but to return from this digression. it had never been customary with the mate to have any watch on deck when lying to in a gale of wind, and the fact that he had now one, coupled with the circumstance of the missing axes and handspikes, fully convinced us that the crew were too well on the watch to be taken by surprise in the manner peters had suggested. something, however, was to be done, and that with as little delay as practicable, for there could be no doubt that a suspicion having been once entertained against peters, he would be sacrificed upon the earliest occasion, and one would certainly be either found or made upon the breaking of the gale. augustus now suggested that if peters could contrive to remove, under any pretext, the piece of chain-cable which lay over the trap in the stateroom, we might possibly be able to come upon them unawares by means of the hold; but a little reflection convinced us that the vessel rolled and pitched too violently for any attempt of that nature. by good fortune i at length hit upon the idea of working upon the superstitious terrors and guilty conscience of the mate. it will be remembered that one of the crew, hartman rogers, had died during the morning, having been attacked two days before with spasms after drinking some spirits and water. peters had expressed to us his opinion that this man had been poisoned by the mate, and for this belief he had reasons, so he said, which were incontrovertible, but which he could not be prevailed upon to explain to us--this wayward refusal being only in keeping with other points of his singular character. but whether or not he had any better grounds for suspecting the mate than we had ourselves, we were easily led to fall in with his suspicion, and determined to act accordingly. rogers had died about eleven in the forenoon, in violent convulsions; and the corpse presented in a few minutes after death one of the most horrid and loathsome spectacles i ever remember to have seen. the stomach was swollen immensely, like that of a man who has been drowned and lain under water for many weeks. the hands were in the same condition, while the face was shrunken, shrivelled, and of a chalky whiteness, except where relieved by two or three glaring red splotches, like those occasioned by the erysipelas: one of these splotches extended diagonally across the face, completely covering up an eye as if with a band of red velvet. in this disgusting condition the body had been brought up from the cabin at noon to be thrown overboard, when the mate getting a glimpse of it (for he now saw it for the first time), and being either touched with remorse for his crime or struck with terror at so horrible a sight, ordered the men to sew the body up in its hammock, and allow it the usual rites of sea-burial. having given these directions he went below, as if to avoid any further sight of his victim. while preparations were making to obey his orders, the gale came on with great fury, and the design was abandoned for the present. the corpse, left to itself, was washed into the larboard scuppers, where it still lay at the time of which i speak, floundering about with the furious lurches of the brig. having arranged our plan, we set about putting it in execution as speedily as possible. peters went upon deck, and, as he had anticipated, was immediately accosted by allen, who appeared to be stationed more as a watch upon the forecastle than for any other purpose. the fate of this villain, however, was speedily and silently decided; for peters, approaching him in a careless manner, as if about to address him, seized him by the throat, and, before he could utter a single cry, tossed him over the bulwarks. he then called to us, and we came up. our first precaution was to look about for something with which to arm ourselves, and in doing this we had to proceed with great care, for it was impossible to stand on deck an instant without holding fast, and violent seas broke over the vessel at every plunge forward. it was indispensable, too, that we should be quick in our operations, for every minute we expected the mate to be up to set the pumps going, as it was evident the brig must be taking in water very fast. after searching about for some time, we could find nothing more fit for our purpose than the two pump-handles, one of which augustus took, and i the other. having secured these, we stripped off the shirt of the corpse and dropped the body overboard. peters and myself then went below, leaving augustus to watch upon deck, where he took his station just where allen had been placed, and with his back to the cabin companion-way, so that, if any one of the mate's gang should come up, he might suppose it was the watch. as soon as i got below i commenced disguising myself so as to represent the corpse of rogers. the shirt which we had taken from the body aided us very much, for it was of a singular form and character, and easily recognisable--a kind of smock, which the deceased wore over his other clothing. it was a blue stockinett, with large white stripes running across. having put this on, i proceeded to equip myself with a false stomach, in imitation of the horrible deformity of the swollen corpse. this was soon effected by means of stuffing with some bedclothes. i then gave the same appearance to my hands by drawing on a pair of white woollen mittens, and filling them in with any kind of rags that offered themselves. peters then arranged my face, first rubbing it well over with white chalk, and afterward splotching it with blood, which he took from a cut in his finger. the streak across the eye was not forgotten, and presented a most shocking appearance. chapter viii. as i viewed myself in a fragment of looking-glass which hung up in the cabin, and by the dim light of a kind of battle-lantern, i was so impressed with a sense of vague awe at my appearance, and at the recollection of the terrific reality which i was thus representing, that i was seized with a violent tremour, and could scarcely summon resolution to go on with my part. it was necessary, however, to act with decision, and peters and myself went upon deck. we there found everything safe, and, keeping close to the bulwarks, the three of us crept to the cabin companion-way. it was only partially closed, precautions having been taken to prevent its being suddenly pushed to from without, by means of placing billets of wood on the upper step so as to interfere with the shutting. we found no difficulty in getting a full view of the interior of the cabin through the cracks where the hinges were placed. it now proved to have been very fortunate for us that we had not attempted to take them by surprise, for they were evidently on the alert. only one was asleep, and he lying just at the foot of the companion-ladder, with a musket by his side. the rest were seated on several mattresses, which had been taken from the berths and thrown on the floor. they were engaged in earnest conversation; and although they had been carousing, as appeared from two empty jugs, with some tin tumblers which lay about, they were not as much intoxicated as usual. all had knives, one or two of them pistols, and a great many muskets were lying in a berth close at hand. we listened to their conversation for some time before we could make up our minds how to act, having as yet resolved on nothing determinate, except that we would attempt to paralyze their exertions, when we should attack them, by means of the apparition of rogers. they were discussing their piratical plans, in which all we could hear distinctly was, that they would unite with the crew of a schooner hornet, and, if possible, get the schooner herself into their possession preparatory to some attempt on a large scale, the particulars of which could not be made out by either of us. one of the men spoke of peters, when the mate replied to him in a low voice which could not be distinguished, and afterward added more loudly, that "he could not understand his being so much forward with the captain's brat in the forecastle, and he thought the sooner both of them were overboard the better." to this no answer was made, but we could easily perceive that the hint was well received by the whole party, and more particularly by jones. at this period i was excessively agitated, the more so as i could see that neither augustus nor peters could determine how to act. i made up my mind, however, to sell my life as dearly as possible, and not to suffer myself to be overcome by any feelings of trepidation. the tremendous noise made by the roaring of the wind in the rigging and the washing of the sea over the deck prevented us from hearing what was said except during momentary lulls. in one of these we all distinctly heard the mate tell one of the men to "go forward, and order the d----d lubbers to come into the cabin, where he could have an eye upon them, for he wanted no such secret doings on board the brig." it was well for us that the pitching of the vessel at this moment was so violent as to prevent this order from being carried into instant execution. the cook got up from his mattress to go for us, when a tremendous lurch, which i thought would carry away the masts, threw him headlong against one of the larboard stateroom doors, bursting it open, and creating a good deal of other confusion. luckily, neither of our party was thrown from his position, and we had time to make a precipitate retreat to the forecastle, and arrange a hurried plan of action before the messenger made his appearance, or rather before he put his head out of the companion-hatch, for he did not come on deck. from this station he could not notice the absence of allen, and he accordingly bawled out as if to him, repeating the orders of the mate. peters cried out, "ay, ay," in a disguised voice, and the cook immediately went below, without entertaining a suspicion that all was not right. my two companions now proceeded boldly aft and down into the cabin, peters closing the door after him in the same manner he had found it. the mate received them with feigned cordiality, and told augustus that, since he had behaved himself so well of late, he might take up his quarters in the cabin, and be one of them for the future. he then poured him out a tumbler half full of rum, and made him drink it. all this i saw and heard, for i followed my friends to the cabin as soon as the door was shut, and took up my old point of observation. i had brought with me the two pump-handles, one of which i secured near the companion-way, to be ready for use when required. i now steadied myself as well as possible so as to have a good view of all that was passing within, and endeavoured to nerve myself to the task of descending among the mutineers when peters should make a signal to me as agreed upon. presently he contrived to turn the conversation upon the bloody deeds of the mutiny, and, by degrees, led the men to talk of the thousand superstitions which are so universally current among seamen. i could not make out all that was said, but i could plainly see the effects of the conversation in the countenances of those present. the mate was evidently much agitated, and presently, when some one mentioned the terrific appearance of rogers's corpse, i thought he was upon the point of swooning. peters now asked him if he did not think it would be better to have the body thrown overboard at once, as it was too horrible a sight to see it floundering about in the scuppers. at this the villain absolutely gasped for breath, and turned his head slowly round upon his companions, as if imploring some one to go up and perform the task. no one, however, stirred, and it was quite evident that the whole party were wound up to the highest pitch of nervous excitement. peters now made me the signal. i immediately threw open the door of the companion-way, and, descending without uttering a syllable, stood erect in the midst of the party. the intense effect produced by this sudden apparition is not at all to be wondered at when the various circumstances are taken into consideration. usually, in cases of a similar nature, there is left in the mind of the spectator some glimmering of doubt as to the reality of the vision before his eyes; a degree of hope, however feeble, that he is the victim of chicanery, and that the apparition is not actually a visitant from the world of shadows. it is not too much to say that such remnants of doubt have been at the bottom of almost every such visitation, and that the appalling horror which has sometimes been brought about, is to be attributed, even in the cases most in point, and where most suffering has been experienced, more to a kind of anticipative horror, lest the apparition _might possibly be_ real, than to an unwavering belief in its reality. but, in the present instance, it will be seen immediately, that in the minds of the mutineers there was not even the shadow of a basis upon which to rest a doubt that the apparition of rogers was indeed a revivification of his disgusting corpse, or at least its spiritual image. the isolated situation of the brig, with its entire inaccessibility on account of the gale, confined the apparently possible means of deception within such narrow and definite limits, that they must have thought themselves enabled to survey them all at a glance. they had now been at sea twenty-four days, without holding more than a speaking communication with any vessel whatever. the whole of the crew, too, at least all whom they had the most remote reason for suspecting to be on board, were assembled in the cabin, with the exception of allen, the watch; and his gigantic stature (he was six feet six inches high) was too familiar in their eyes to permit the notion that he was the apparition before them to enter their minds even for an instant. add to these considerations the awe-inspiring nature of the tempest, and that of the conversation brought about by peters; the deep impression which the loathsomeness of the actual corpse had made in the morning upon the imaginations of the men; the excellence of the imitation in my person; and the uncertain and wavering light in which they beheld me, as the glare of the cabin lantern, swinging violently to and fro, fell dubiously and fitfully upon my figure, and there will be no reason to wonder that the deception had even more than the entire effect which we had anticipated. the mate sprang up from the mattress on which he was lying, and, without uttering a syllable, fell back, stone dead, upon the cabin floor, and was hurled to the leeward like a log by a heavy roll of the brig. of the remaining seven there were but three who had at first any degree of presence of mind. the four others sat for some time rooted apparently to the floor, the most pitiable objects of horror and utter despair my eyes ever encountered. the only opposition we experienced at all was from the cook, john hunt, and richard parker; but they made but a feeble and irresolute defence. the two former were shot instantly by peters, and i felled parker with a blow on the head from the pump-handle which i had brought with me. in the mean time augustus seized one of the muskets lying on the floor, and shot another mutineer (---- wilson) through the breast. there were now but three remaining; but by this time they had become aroused from their lethargy, and perhaps began to see that a deception had been practised upon them, for they fought with great resolution and fury, and, but for the immense muscular strength of peters, might have ultimately got the better of us. these three men were ---- jones, ---- greely, and absalom hicks. jones had thrown augustus on the floor, stabbed him in several places along the right arm, and would no doubt have soon despatched him (as neither peters nor myself could immediately get rid of our own antagonists), had it not been for the timely aid of a friend upon whose assistance we surely had never depended. this friend was no other than tiger. with a low growl he bounded into the cabin, at a most critical moment for augustus, and throwing himself upon jones, pinned him to the floor in an instant. my friend, however, was now too much injured to render us any aid whatever, and i was so encumbered with my disguise that i could do but little. the dog would not leave his hold upon the throat of jones--peters, nevertheless, was far more than a match for the two men who remained, and would, no doubt, have despatched them sooner, had it not been for the narrow space in which he had to act, and the tremendous lurches of the vessel. presently he was enabled to get hold of a heavy stool, several of which lay about the floor. with this he beat out the brains of greely as he was in the act of discharging a musket at me, and immediately afterward a roll of the brig throwing him in contact with hicks, he seized him by the throat, and, by dint of sheer strength, strangled him instantaneously. thus, in far less time than i have taken to tell it, we found ourselves masters of the brig. the only person of our opponents who was left alive was richard parker. this man, it will be remembered, i had knocked down with a blow from the pump-handle at the commencement of the attack. he now lay motionless by the door of the shattered stateroom; but, upon peters touching him with his foot, he spoke, and entreated for mercy. his head was only slightly cut, and otherwise he had received no injury, having been merely stunned by the blow. he now got up, and, for the present, we secured his hands behind his back. the dog was still growling over jones; but, upon examination, we found him completely dead, the blood issuing in a stream from a deep wound in the throat, inflicted, no doubt, by the sharp teeth of the animal. it was now about one o'clock in the morning, and the wind was still blowing tremendously. the brig evidently laboured much more than usual, and it became absolutely necessary that something should be done with a view of easing her in some measure. at almost every roll to leeward she shipped a sea, several of which came partially down into the cabin during our scuffle, the hatchway having been left open by myself when i descended. the entire range of bulwarks to larboard had been swept away, as well as the caboose, together with the jollyboat from the counter. the creaking and working of the mainmast, too, gave indication that it was nearly sprung. to make room for more stowage in the after hold, the heel of this mast had been stepped between decks (a very reprehensible practice, occasionally resorted to by ignorant ship-builders), so that it was in imminent danger of working from its step. but, to crown all our difficulties, we plummed the well, and found no less than seven feet water. leaving the bodies of the crew lying in the cabin, we got to work immediately at the pumps--parker, of course, being set at liberty to assist us in the labour. augustus's arm was bound up as well as we could effect it, and he did what he could, but that was not much. however, we found that we could just manage to keep the leak from gaining upon us by having one pump constantly going. as there were only four of us, this was severe labour; but we endeavoured to keep up our spirits, and looked anxiously for daybreak, when we hoped to lighten the brig by cutting away the mainmast. in this manner we passed a night of terrible anxiety and fatigue, and, when the day at length broke, the gale had neither abated in the least, nor were there any signs of its abating. we now dragged the bodies on deck and threw them overboard. our next care was to get rid of the mainmast. the necessary preparations having been made, peters cut away at the mast (having found axes in the cabin), while the rest of us stood by the stays and lanyards. as the brig gave a tremendous lee-lurch, the word was given to cut away the weather-lanyards, which being done, the whole mass of wood and rigging plunged into the sea, clear of the brig, and without doing any material injury. we now found that the vessel did not labour quite as much as before, but our situation was still exceedingly precarious, and, in spite of the utmost exertions, we could not gain upon the leak without the aid of both pumps. the little assistance which augustus could render us was not really of any importance. to add to our distress, a heavy sea, striking the brig to windward, threw her off several points from the wind, and, before she could regain her position, another broke completely over her, and hurled her full upon her beam-ends. the ballast now shifted in a mass to leeward (the stowage had been knocking about perfectly at random for some time), and for a few moments we thought nothing could save us from capsizing. presently, however, we partially righted; but the ballast still retaining its place to larboard, we lay so much along that it was useless to think of working the pumps, which indeed we could not have done much longer in any case, as our hands were entirely raw with the excessive labour we had undergone, and were bleeding in the most horrible manner. contrary to parker's advice, we now proceeded to cut away the foremast, and at length accomplished it after much difficulty, owing to the position in which we lay. in going overboard the wreck took with it the bowsprit, and left us a complete hulk. so far we had had reason to rejoice in the escape of our longboat, which had received no damage from any of the huge seas which had come on board. but we had not long to congratulate ourselves; for the foremast having gone, and, of course, the foresail with it, by which the brig had been steadied, every sea now made a complete breach over us, and in five minutes our deck was swept from stem to stern, the longboat and starboard bulwarks torn off, and even the windlass shattered into fragments. it was, indeed, hardly possible for us to be in a more pitiable condition. at noon there seemed to be some slight appearance of the gale's abating, but in this we were sadly disappointed, for it only lulled for a few minutes to blow with redoubled fury. about four in the afternoon it was utterly impossible to stand up against the violence of the blast; and, as the night closed in upon us, i had not a shadow of hope that the vessel would hold together until morning. by midnight we had settled very deep in the water, which was now up to the orlop deck. the rudder went soon afterward, the sea which tore it away lifting the after portion of the brig entirely from the water, against which she thumped in her descent with such a concussion as would be occasioned by going ashore. we had all calculated that the rudder would hold its own to the last, as it was unusually strong, being rigged as i have never seen one rigged either before or since. down its main timber there ran a succession of stout iron hooks, and others in the same manner down the stern-post. through these hooks there extended a very thick wrought-iron rod, the rudder being thus held to the stern-post, and swinging freely on the rod. the tremendous force of the sea which tore it off may be estimated by the fact, that the hooks in the stern-post, which ran entirely through it, being clinched on the inside, were drawn every one of them completely out of the solid wood. we had scarcely time to draw breath after the violence of this shock, when one of the most tremendous waves i had then ever known broke right on board of us, sweeping the companion-way clear off, bursting in the hatchways, and filling every inch of the vessel with water. chapter ix. luckily, just before night, all four of us had lashed ourselves firmly to the fragments of the windlass, lying in this manner as flat upon the deck as possible. this precaution alone saved us from destruction. as it was, we were all more or less stunned by the immense weight of water which tumbled upon us, and which did not roll from above us until we were nearly exhausted. as soon as i could recover breath, i called aloud to my companions. augustus alone replied, saying, "it is all over with us, and may god have mercy upon our souls." by-and-by both the others were enabled to speak, when they exhorted us to take courage, as there was still hope; it being impossible, from the nature of the cargo, that the brig could go down, and there being every chance that the gale would blow over by the morning. these words inspired me with new life; for, strange as it may seem, although it was obvious that a vessel with a cargo of empty oil-casks would not sink, i had been hitherto so confused in mind as to have overlooked this consideration altogether; and the danger which i had for some time regarded as the most imminent was that of foundering. as hope revived within me, i made use of every opportunity to strengthen the lashings which held me to the remains of the windlass, and in this occupation i soon discovered that my companions were also busy. the night was as dark as it could possibly be, and the horrible shrieking din and confusion which surrounded us it is useless to attempt describing. our deck lay level with the sea, or rather we were encircled with a towering ridge of foam, a portion of which swept over us every instant. it is not too much to say that our heads were not fairly out of water more than one second in three. although we lay close together, no one of us could see the other, or, indeed, any portion of the brig itself, upon which we were so tempestuously hurled about. at intervals we called one to the other, thus endeavouring to keep alive hope, and render consolation and encouragement to such of us as stood most in need of it. the feeble condition of augustus made him an object of solicitude with us all; and as, from the lacerated condition of his right arm, it must have been impossible for him to secure his lashings with any degree of firmness, we were in momentary expectation of finding that he had gone overboard--yet to render him aid was a thing altogether out of the question. fortunately, his station was more secure than that of any of the rest of us; for the upper part of his body lying just beneath a portion of the shattered windlass, the seas, as they tumbled in upon him, were greatly broken in their violence. in any other situation than this (into which he had been accidentally thrown after having lashed himself in a very exposed spot) he must inevitably have perished before morning. owing to the brig's lying so much along, we were all less liable to be washed off than otherwise would have been the case. the heel, as i have before stated, was to larboard, about one half of the deck being constantly under water. the seas, therefore, which struck us to starboard were much broken by the vessel's side, only reaching us in fragments as we lay flat on our faces; while those which came from larboard, being what are called back-water seas, and obtaining little hold upon us on account of our posture, had not sufficient force to drag us from our fastenings. in this frightful situation we lay until the day broke so as to show us more fully the horrors which surrounded us. the brig was a mere log, rolling about at the mercy of every wave; the gale was upon the increase, if anything, blowing indeed a complete hurricane, and there appeared to us no earthly prospect of deliverance. for several hours we held on in silence, expecting every moment that our lashings would either give way, that the remains of the windlass would go by the board, or that some of the huge seas, which roared in every direction around us and above us, would drive the hulk so far beneath the water that we should be drowned before it could regain the surface. by the mercy of god, however, we were preserved from these imminent dangers, and about midday were cheered by the light of the blessed sun. shortly afterward we could perceive a sensible diminution in the force of the wind, when, now for the first time since the latter part of the evening before, augustus spoke, asking peters, who lay closest to him, if he thought there was any possibility of our being saved. as no reply was at first made to this question, we all concluded that the hybrid had been drowned where he lay; but presently, to our great joy, he spoke, although very feebly, saying that he was in great pain, being so cut by the tightness of his lashings across the stomach, that he must either find means of loosening them or perish, as it was impossible that he could endure his misery much longer. this occasioned us great distress, as it was altogether useless to think of aiding him in any manner while the sea continued washing over us as it did. we exhorted him to bear his sufferings with fortitude, and promised to seize the first opportunity which should offer itself to relieve him. he replied that it would soon be too late; that it would be all over with him before we could help him; and then, after moaning for some minutes, lay silent, when we concluded that he had perished. as the evening drew on, the sea had fallen so much that scarcely more than one wave broke over the hulk from windward in the course of five minutes, and the wind had abated a great deal, although still blowing a severe gale. i had not heard any of my companions speak for hours, and now called to augustus. he replied, although very feebly, so that i could not distinguish what he said. i then spoke to peters and to parker, neither of whom returned any answer. shortly after this period i fell into a state of partial insensibility, during which the most pleasing images floated in my imagination; such as green trees, waving meadows of ripe grain, processions of dancing girls, troops of cavalry, and other phantasies. i now remember that, in all which passed before my mind's eye, _motion_ was a predominant idea. thus, i never fancied any stationary object, such as a house, a mountain, or anything of that kind; but windmills, ships, large birds, balloons, people on horseback, carriages driving furiously, and similar moving objects, presented themselves in endless succession. when i recovered from this state, the sun was, as near as i could guess, an hour high. i had the greatest difficulty in bringing to recollection the various circumstances connected with my situation, and for some time remained firmly convinced that i was still in the hold of the brig, near the box, and that the body of parker was that of tiger. when i at length completely came to my senses, i found that the wind blew no more than a moderate breeze, and that the sea was comparatively calm; so much so that it only washed over the brig amidships. my left arm had broken loose from its lashings, and was much cut about the elbow; my right was entirely benumbed, and the hand and wrist swollen prodigiously by the pressure of the rope, which had worked from the shoulder downward. i was also in great pain from another rope which went about my waist, and had been drawn to an insufferable degree of tightness. looking round upon my companions, i saw that peters still lived, although a thick line was pulled so forcibly around his loins as to give him the appearance of being cut nearly in two; as i stirred, he made a feeble motion to me with his hand, pointing to the rope. augustus gave no indication of life whatever, and was bent nearly double across a splinter of the windlass. parker spoke to me when he saw me moving, and asked me if i had not sufficient strength to release him from his situation; saying, that if i would summon up what spirits i could, and contrive to untie him, we might yet save our lives; but that otherwise we must all perish. i told him to take courage, and i would endeavour to free him. feeling in my pantaloons' pocket, i got hold of my penknife, and, after several ineffectual attempts, at length succeeded in opening it. i then, with my left hand, managed to free my right from its fastenings, and afterward cut the other ropes which held me. upon attempting, however, to move from my position, i found that my legs failed me altogether, and that i could not get up; neither could i move my right arm in any direction. upon mentioning this to parker, he advised me to lie quiet for a few minutes, holding on to the windlass with my left hand, so as to allow time for the blood to circulate. doing this, the numbness presently began to die away, so that i could move first one of my legs, and then the other; and, shortly afterward, i regained the partial use of my right arm. i now crawled with great caution towards parker, without getting on my legs, and soon cut loose all the lashings about him, when, after a short delay, he also recovered the partial use of his limbs. we now lost no time in getting loose the rope from peters. it had cut a deep gash through the waistband of his woollen pantaloons, and through two shirts, and made its way into his groin, from which the blood flowed out copiously as we removed the cordage. no sooner had we removed it, however, than he spoke, and seemed to experience instant relief--being able to move with much greater ease than either parker or myself--this was no doubt owing to the discharge of blood. we had little hope that augustus would recover, as he evinced no signs of life; but, upon getting to him, we discovered that he had merely swooned from loss of blood, the bandages we had placed around his wounded arm having been torn off by the water; none of the ropes which held him to the windlass were drawn sufficiently tight to occasion his death. having relieved him from the fastenings, and got him clear of the broken wood about the windlass, we secured him in a dry place to windward, with his head somewhat lower than his body, and all three of us busied ourselves in chafing his limbs. in about half an hour he came to himself, although it was not until the next morning that he gave signs of recognising any of us, or had sufficient strength to speak. by the time we had thus got clear of our lashings it was quite dark, and it began to cloud up, so that we were again in the greatest agony lest it should come on to blow hard, in which event nothing could have saved us from perishing, exhausted as we were. by good fortune it continued very moderate during the night, the sea subsiding every minute, which gave us great hopes of ultimate preservation. a gentle breeze still blew from the n. w., but the weather was not at all cold. augustus was lashed carefully to windward in such a manner as to prevent him from slipping overboard with the rolls of the vessel, as he was still too weak to hold on at all. for ourselves there was no such necessity. we sat close together, supporting each other with the aid of the broken ropes about the windlass, and devising methods of escape from our frightful situation. we derived much comfort from taking off our clothes and wringing the water from them. when we put them on after this, they felt remarkably warm and pleasant, and served to invigorate us in no little degree. we helped augustus off with his, and wrung them for him, when he experienced the same comfort. our chief sufferings were now those of hunger and thirst, and, when we looked forward to the means of relief in this respect, our hearts sunk within us, and we were induced to regret that we had escaped the less dreadful perils of the sea. we endeavoured, however, to console ourselves with the hope of being speedily picked up by some vessel, and encouraged each other to bear with fortitude the evils that might happen. the morning of the fourteenth at length dawned, and the weather still continued clear and pleasant, with a steady but very light breeze from the n. w. the sea was now quite smooth, and as, from some cause which we could not determine, the brig did not lie so much along as she had done before, the deck was comparatively dry, and we could move about with freedom. we had now been better than three entire days and nights without either food or drink, and it became absolutely necessary that we should make an attempt to get up something from below. as the brig was completely full of water, we went to this work despondingly, and with but little expectation of being able to obtain anything. we made a kind of drag by driving some nails which we broke out from the remains of the companion-hatch into two pieces of wood. tying these across each other, and fastening them to the end of a rope, we threw them into the cabin, and dragged them to and fro, in the faint hope of being thus able to entangle some article which might be of use to us for food, or which might at least render us assistance in getting it. we spent the greater part of the morning in this labour without effect, fishing up nothing more than a few bedclothes, which were readily caught by the nails. indeed, our contrivance was so very clumsy, that any greater success was hardly to be anticipated. we now tried the forecastle, but equally in vain, and were upon the brink of despair, when peters proposed that we should fasten a rope to his body, and let him make an attempt to get up something by diving into the cabin. this proposition we hailed with all the delight which reviving hope could inspire. he proceeded immediately to strip off his clothes with the exception of his pantaloons; and a strong rope was then carefully fastened around his middle, being brought up over his shoulders in such a manner that there was no possibility of its slipping. the undertaking was one of great difficulty and danger; for, as we could hardly expect to find much, if any provision in the cabin itself, it was necessary that the diver, after letting himself down, should make a turn to the right, and proceed under water a distance of ten or twelve feet, in a narrow passage, to the storeroom, and return, without drawing breath. everything being ready, peters now descended into the cabin, going down the companion-ladder until the water reached his chin. he then plunged in, head first, turning to the right as he plunged, and endeavouring to make his way to the storeroom. in this first attempt, however, he was altogether unsuccessful. in less than half a minute after his going down we felt the rope jerked violently (the signal we had agreed upon when he desired to be drawn up). we accordingly drew him up instantly, but so incautiously as to bruise him badly against the ladder. he had brought nothing with him, and had been unable to penetrate more than a very little way into the passage, owing to the constant exertions he found it necessary to make in order to keep himself from floating up against the deck. upon getting out he was very much exhausted, and had to rest full fifteen minutes before he could again venture to descend. the second attempt met with even worse success; for he remained so long under water without giving the signal, that, becoming alarmed for his safety, we drew him out without it, and found that he was almost at the last gasp, having, as he said, repeatedly jerked at the rope without our feeling it. this was probably owing to a portion of it having become entangled in the balustrade at the foot of the ladder. this balustrade was, indeed, so much in the way, that we determined to remove it, if possible, before proceeding with our design. as we had no means of getting it away except by main force, we all descended into the water as far as we could on the ladder, and, giving a pull against it with our united strength, succeeded in breaking it down. the third attempt was equally unsuccessful with the two first, and it now became evident that nothing could be done in this manner without the aid of some weight with which the diver might steady himself, and keep to the floor of the cabin while making his search. for a long time we looked about in vain for something which might answer this purpose; but at length, to our great joy, we discovered one of the weather-forechains so loose that we had not the least difficulty in wrenching it off. having fastened this securely to one of his ancles, peters now made his fourth descent into the cabin, and this time succeeded in making his way to the door of the steward's room. to his inexpressible grief, however, he found it locked, and was obliged to return without effecting an entrance, as, with the greatest exertion, he could remain under water not more, at the utmost extent, than a single minute. our affairs now looked gloomy indeed, and neither augustus nor myself could refrain from bursting into tears, as we thought of the host of difficulties which encompassed us, and the slight probability which existed of our finally making an escape. but this weakness was not of long duration. throwing ourselves on our knees to god, we implored his aid in the many dangers which beset us; and arose with renewed hope and vigour to think what could yet be done by mortal means towards accomplishing our deliverance. chapter x. shortly afterward an incident occurred which i am induced to look upon as more intensely productive of emotion, as far more replete with the extremes first of delight and then of horror, than even any of the thousand chances which afterward befell me in nine long years, crowded with events of the most startling, and, in many cases, of the most unconceived and unconceivable character. we were lying on the deck near the companion-way, and debating the possibility of yet making our way into the storeroom, when, looking towards augustus, who lay fronting myself, i perceived that he had become all at once deadly pale, and that his lips were quivering in the most singular and unaccountable manner. greatly alarmed, i spoke to him, but he made me no reply, and i was beginning to think that he was suddenly taken ill, when i took notice of his eyes, which were glaring apparently at some object behind me. i turned my head, and shall never forget the ecstatic joy which thrilled through every particle of my frame, when i perceived a large brig bearing down upon us, and not more than a couple of miles off. i sprung to my feet as if a musket bullet had suddenly struck me to the heart; and, stretching out my arms in the direction of the vessel, stood in this manner, motionless, and unable to articulate a syllable. peters and parker were equally affected, although in different ways. the former danced about the deck like a madman, uttering the most extravagant rhodomontades, intermingled with howls and imprecations, while the latter burst into tears, and continued for many minutes weeping like a child. the vessel in sight was a large hermaphrodite brig, of a dutch build, and painted black, with a tawdry gilt figurehead. she had evidently seen a good deal of rough weather, and, we supposed, had suffered much in the gale which had proved so disastrous to ourselves; for her foretopmast was gone, and some of her starboard bulwarks. when we first saw her, she was, as i have already said, about two miles off and to windward, bearing down upon us. the breeze was very gentle, and what astonished us chiefly was, that she had no other sails set than her foresail and mainsail, with a flying jib--of course she came down but slowly, and our impatience amounted nearly to phrensy. the awkward manner in which she steered, too, was remarked by all of us, even excited as we were. she yawed about so considerably, that once or twice we thought it impossible she could see us, or imagined that, having seen us, and discovered no person on board, she was about to tack and make off in another direction. upon each of these occasions we screamed and shouted at the top of our voices, when the stranger would appear to change for a moment her intention, and again hold on towards us--this singular conduct being repeated two or three times, so that at last we could think of no other manner of accounting for it than by supposing the helmsman to be in liquor. no person was seen upon her decks until she arrived within about a quarter of a mile of us. we then saw three seamen, whom by their dress we took to be hollanders. two of these were lying on some old sails near the forecastle, and the third, who appeared to be looking at us with great curiosity, was leaning over the starboard bow near the bowsprit. this last was a stout and tall man, with a very dark skin. he seemed by his manner to be encouraging us to have patience, nodding to us in a cheerful although rather odd way, and smiling constantly so as to display a set of the most brilliantly white teeth. as his vessel drew nearer, we saw a red flannel cap which he had on fall from his head into the water; but of this he took little or no notice, continuing his odd smiles and gesticulations. i relate these things and circumstances minutely, and i relate them, it must be understood, precisely as they _appeared_ to us. the brig came on slowly, and now more steadily than before, and--i cannot speak calmly of this event--our hearts leaped up wildly within us, and we poured out our whole souls in shouts and thanksgiving to god for the complete, unexpected, and glorious deliverance that was so palpably at hand. of a sudden, and all at once, there came wafted over the ocean from the strange vessel (which was now close upon us) a smell, a stench, such as the whole world has no name for--no conception of--hellish--utterly suffocating--insufferable, inconceivable. i gasped for breath, and, turning to my companions, perceived that they were paler than marble. but we had now no time left for question or surmise--the brig was within fifty feet of us, and it seemed to be her intention to run under our counter, that we might board her without her putting out a boat. we rushed aft, when, suddenly, a wide yaw threw her off full five or six points from the course she had been running, and, as she passed under our stern at the distance of about twenty feet, we had a full view of her decks. shall i ever forget the triple horror of that spectacle? twenty-five or thirty human bodies, among whom were several females, lay scattered about between the counter and the galley, in the last and most loathsome state of putrefaction! we plainly saw that not a soul lived in that fated vessel! yet we could not help shouting to the dead for help! yes, long and loudly did we beg, in the agony of the moment, that those silent and disgusting images would stay for us, would not abandon us to become like them, would receive us among their goodly company! we were raving with horror and despair--thoroughly mad through the anguish of our grievous disappointment. as our first loud yell of terror broke forth, it was replied to by something, from near the bowsprit of the stranger, so closely resembling the scream of a human voice that the nicest ear might have been startled and deceived. at this instant another sudden yaw brought the region of the forecastle for a moment into view, and we beheld at once the origin of the sound. we saw the tall stout figure still leaning on the bulwark, and still nodding his head to and fro, but his face was now turned from us so that we could not behold it. his arms were extended over the rail, and the palms of his hands fell outward. his knees were lodged upon a stout rope, tightly stretched, and reaching from the heel of the bowsprit to a cathead. on his back, from which a portion of the shirt had been torn, leaving it bare, there sat a huge seagull, busily gorging itself with the horrible flesh, its bill and talons deep buried, and its white plumage spattered all over with blood. as the brig moved further round so as to bring us close in view, the bird, with much apparent difficulty, drew out its crimsoned head, and, after eying us for a moment as if stupified, arose lazily from the body upon which it had been feasting, and, flying directly above our deck, hovered there a while with a portion of clotted and liver-like substance in its beak. the horrid morsel dropped at length with a sullen splash immediately at the feet of parker. may god forgive me, but now, for the first time, there flashed through my mind a thought, a thought which i will not mention, and i felt myself making a step towards the ensanguined spot. i looked upward, and the eyes of augustus met my own with a degree of intense and eager meaning which immediately brought me to my senses. i sprang forward quickly, and, with a deep shudder, threw the frightful thing into the sea. the body from which it had been taken, resting as it did upon the rope, had been easily swayed to and fro by the exertions of the carnivorous bird, and it was this motion which had at first impressed us with the belief of its being alive. as the gull relieved it of its weight, it swung round and fell partially over, so that the face was fully discovered. never, surely, was any object so terribly full of awe! the eyes were gone, and the whole flesh around the mouth, leaving the teeth utterly naked. this, then, was the smile which had cheered us on to hope! this the--but i forbear. the brig, as i have already told, passed under our stern, and made its way slowly but steadily to leeward. with her and with her terrible crew went all our gay visions of deliverance and joy. deliberately as she went by, we might possibly have found means of boarding her, had not our sudden disappointment, and the appalling nature of the discovery which accompanied it, laid entirely prostrate every active faculty of mind and body. we had seen and felt, but we could neither think nor act, until, alas, too late. how much our intellects had been weakened by this incident may be estimated by the fact, that, when the vessel had proceeded so far that we could perceive no more than the half of her hull, the proposition was seriously entertained of attempting to overtake her by swimming! i have, since this period, vainly endeavoured to obtain some clew to the hideous uncertainty which enveloped the fate of the stranger. her build and general appearance, as i have before stated, led us to the belief that she was a dutch trader, and the dresses of the crew also sustained this opinion. we might have easily seen the name upon her stern, and, indeed, taken other observations which would have guided us in making out her character; but the intense excitement of the moment blinded us to everything of that nature. from the saffron-like hue of such of the corpses as were not entirely decayed, we concluded that the whole of her company had perished by the yellow fever, or some other virulent disease of the same fearful kind. if such were the case (and i know not what else to imagine), death, to judge from the positions of the bodies, must have come upon them in a manner awfully sudden and overwhelming, in a way totally distinct from that which generally characterizes even the most deadly pestilences with which mankind are acquainted. it is possible, indeed, that poison, accidentally introduced into some of their sea-stores, may have brought about the disaster; or that the eating some unknown venomous species of fish, or other marine animal, or oceanic bird, might have induced it--but it is utterly useless to form conjectures where all is involved, and will, no doubt, remain for ever involved, in the most appalling and unfathomable mystery. chapter xi. we spent the remainder of the day in a condition of stupid lethargy, gazing after the retreating vessel until the darkness, hiding her from our sight, recalled us in some measure to our senses. the pangs of hunger and thirst then returned, absorbing all other cares and considerations. nothing, however, could be done until the morning, and, securing ourselves as well as possible, we endeavoured to snatch a little repose. in this i succeeded beyond my expectation, sleeping until my companions, who had not been so fortunate, aroused me at daybreak to renew our attempts at getting up provision from the hull. it was now a dead calm, with the sea as smooth as i have ever known it--the weather warm and pleasant. the brig was out of sight. we commenced our operations by wrenching off, with some trouble, another of the forechains; and having fastened both to peters's feet, he again made an endeavour to reach the door of the storeroom, thinking it possible that he might be able to force it open, provided he could get at it in sufficient time; and this he hoped to do, as the hulk lay much more steadily than before. he succeeded very quickly in reaching the door, when, loosening one of the chains from his ankle, he made every exertion to force a passage with it, but in vain, the framework of the room being far stronger than was anticipated. he was quite exhausted with his long stay under water, and it became absolutely necessary that some other one of us should take his place. for this service parker immediately volunteered; but, after making three ineffectual efforts, found that he could never even succeed in getting near the door. the condition of augustus's wounded arm rendered it useless for him to attempt going down, as he would be unable to force the room open should he reach it, and it accordingly now devolved upon me to exert myself for our common deliverance. peters had left one of the chains in the passage, and i found, upon plunging in, that i had not sufficient ballast to keep me firmly down. i determined, therefore, to attempt no more, in my first effort, than merely to recover the other chain. in groping along the floor of the passage for this i felt a hard substance, which i immediately grasped, not having time to ascertain what it was, but returning and ascending instantly to the surface. the prize proved to be a bottle, and our joy may be conceived when i say that it was found to be full of port wine. giving thanks to god for this timely and cheering assistance, we immediately drew the cork with my penknife, and, each taking a moderate sup, felt the most indescribable comfort from the warmth, strength, and spirits with which it inspired us. we then carefully recorked the bottle, and, by means of a handkerchief, swung it in such a manner that there was no possibility of its getting broken. having rested a while after this fortunate discovery, i again descended, and now recovered the chain, with which i instantly came up. i then fastened it on and went down for the third time, when i became fully satisfied that no exertions whatever, in that situation, would enable me to force open the door of the storeroom. i therefore returned in despair. there seemed now to be no longer any room for hope, and i could perceive in the countenances of my companions that they had made up their minds to perish. the wine had evidently produced in them a species of delirium, which, perhaps, i had been prevented from feeling by the immersion i had undergone since drinking it. they talked incoherently, and about matters unconnected with our condition, peters repeatedly asking me questions about nantucket. augustus, too, i remember, approached me with a serious air, and requested me to lend him a pocket-comb, as his hair was full of fish scales, and he wished to get them out before going on shore. parker appeared somewhat less affected, and urged me to dive at random into the cabin, and bring up any article which might come to hand. to this i consented, and, in the first attempt, after staying under a full minute, brought up a small leather trunk belonging to captain barnard. this was immediately opened in the faint hope that it might contain something to eat or drink. we found nothing, however, except a box of razors and two linen shirts. i now went down again, and returned without any success. as my head came above water i heard a crash on deck, and, upon getting up, saw that my companions had ungratefully taken advantage of my absence to drink the remainder of the wine, having let the bottle fall in the endeavour to replace it before i saw them. i remonstrated with them on the heartlessness of their conduct, when augustus burst into tears. the other two endeavoured to laugh the matter off as a joke, but i hope never again to behold laughter of such a species: the distortion of countenance was absolutely frightful. indeed, it was apparent that the stimulus, in the empty state of their stomachs, had taken instant and violent effect, and that they were all exceedingly intoxicated. with great difficulty i prevailed upon them to lie down, when they fell very soon into a heavy slumber, accompanied with loud stertorous breathing. i now found myself, as it were, alone in the brig, and my reflections, to be sure, were of the most fearful and gloomy nature. no prospect offered itself to my view but a lingering death by famine, or, at the best, by being overwhelmed in the first gale which should spring up, for in our present exhausted condition we could have no hope of living through another. the gnawing hunger which i now experienced was nearly insupportable, and i felt myself capable of going to any lengths in order to appease it. with my knife i cut off a small portion of the leather trunk, and endeavoured to eat it, but found it utterly impossible to swallow a single morsel, although i fancied that some little alleviation of my suffering was obtained by chewing small pieces of it and spitting them out. towards night my companions awoke, one by one, each in an indescribable state of weakness and horror, brought on by the wine, whose fumes had now evaporated. they shook as if with a violent ague, and uttered the most lamentable cries for water. their condition affected me in the most lively degree, at the same time causing me to rejoice in the fortunate train of circumstances which had prevented me from indulging in the wine, and consequently from sharing their melancholy and most distressing sensations. their conduct, however, gave me great uneasiness and alarm; for it was evident that, unless some favourable change took place, they could afford me no assistance in providing for our common safety. i had not yet abandoned all idea of being able to get up something from below; but the attempt could not possibly be resumed until some one of them was sufficiently master of himself to aid me by holding the end of the rope while i went down. parker appeared to be somewhat more in possession of his senses than the others, and i endeavoured, by every means in my power, to arouse him. thinking that a plunge in the seawater might have a beneficial effect, i contrived to fasten the end of a rope around his body, and then, leading him to the companion-way (he remaining quite passive all the while), pushed him in, and immediately drew him out. i had good reason to congratulate myself upon having made this experiment; for he appeared much revived and invigorated, and, upon getting out, asked me, in a rational manner, why i had so served him. having explained my object, he expressed himself indebted to me, and said that he felt greatly better from the immersion, afterward conversing sensibly upon our situation. we then resolved to treat augustus and peters in the same way, which we immediately did, when they both experienced much benefit from the shock. this idea of sudden immersion had been suggested to me by reading in some medical work the good effect of the shower-bath in a case where the patient was suffering from _mania à potu_. finding that i could now trust my companions to hold the end of the rope, i again made three or four plunges into the cabin, although it was now quite dark, and a gentle but long swell from the northward rendered the hulk somewhat unsteady. in the course of these attempts i succeeded in bringing up two case-knives, a three-gallon jug, empty, and a blanket, but nothing which could serve us for food. i continued my efforts, after getting these articles, until i was completely exhausted, but brought up nothing else. during the night parker and peters occupied themselves by turns in the same manner; but nothing coming to hand, we now gave up this attempt in despair, concluding that we were exhausting ourselves in vain. we passed the remainder of this night in a state of the most intense mental and bodily anguish that can possibly be imagined. the morning of the sixteenth at length dawned, and we looked eagerly around the horizon for relief, but to no purpose. the sea was still smooth, with only a long swell from the northward, as on yesterday. this was the sixth day since we had tasted either food or drink, with the exception of the bottle of port wine, and it was clear that we could hold out but a very little while longer unless something could be obtained. i never saw before, nor wish to see again, human beings so utterly emaciated as peters and augustus. had i met them on shore in their present condition i should not have had the slightest suspicion that i had ever beheld them. their countenances were totally changed in character, so that i could not bring myself to believe them really the same individuals with whom i had been in company but a few days before. parker, although sadly reduced, and so feeble that he could not raise his head from his bosom, was not so far gone as the other two. he suffered with great patience, making no complaint, and endeavouring to inspire us with hope in every manner he could devise. for myself, although at the commencement of the voyage i had been in bad health, and was at all times of a delicate constitution, i suffered less than any of us, being much less reduced in frame, and retaining my powers of mind in a surprising degree, while the rest were completely prostrated in intellect, and seemed to be brought to a species of second childhood, generally simpering in their expressions, with idiotic smiles, and uttering the most absurd platitudes. at intervals, however, they would appear to revive suddenly, as if inspired all at once with a consciousness of their condition, when they would spring upon their feet in a momentary flash of vigour, and speak, for a short period, of their prospects, in a manner altogether rational, although full of the most intense despair. it is possible, however, that my companions may have entertained the same opinion of their own condition as i did of mine, and that i may have unwittingly been guilty of the same extravagances and imbecilities as themselves--this is a matter which cannot be determined. about noon parker declared that he saw land off the larboard quarter, and it was with the utmost difficulty i could restrain him from plunging into the sea with the view of swimming towards it. peters and augustus took little notice of what he said, being apparently wrapped up in moody contemplation. upon looking in the direction pointed out i could not perceive the faintest appearance of the shore--indeed, i was too well aware that we were far from any land to indulge in a hope of that nature. it was a long time, nevertheless, before i could convince parker of his mistake. he then burst into a flood of tears, weeping like a child, with loud cries and sobs, for two or three hours, when, becoming exhausted, he fell asleep. peters and augustus now made several ineffectual efforts to swallow portions of the leather. i advised them to chew it and spit it out; but they were too excessively debilitated to be able to follow my advice. i continued to chew pieces of it at intervals, and found some relief from so doing; my chief distress was for water, and i was only prevented from taking a draught from the sea by remembering the horrible consequences which thus have resulted to others who were similarly situated with ourselves. the day wore on in this manner, when i suddenly discovered a sail to the eastward, and on our larboard bow. she appeared to be a large ship, and was coming nearly athwart us, being probably twelve or fifteen miles distant. none of my companions had as yet discovered her, and i forbore to tell them of her for the present, lest we might again be disappointed of relief. at length, upon her getting nearer, i saw distinctly that she was heading immediately for us, with her light sails filled. i could now contain myself no longer, and pointed her out to my fellow-sufferers. they immediately sprang to their feet, again indulging in the most extravagant demonstrations of joy, weeping, laughing in an idiotic manner, jumping, stamping upon the deck, tearing their hair, and praying and cursing by turns. i was so affected by their conduct, as well as by what i now considered a sure prospect of deliverance, that i could not refrain from joining in with their madness, and gave way to the impulses of my gratitude and ecstasy by lying and rolling on the deck, clapping my hands, shouting, and other similar acts, until i was suddenly called to my recollection, and once more to the extreme of human misery and despair, by perceiving the ship all at once with her stern fully presented towards us, and steering in a direction nearly opposite to that in which i had at first perceived her. it was some time before i could induce my poor companions to believe that this sad reverse in our prospects had actually taken place. they replied to all my assertions with a stare and a gesture implying that they were not to be deceived by such misrepresentations. the conduct of augustus most sensibly affected me. in spite of all i could say or do to the contrary, he persisted in saying that the ship was rapidly nearing us, and in making preparations to go on board of her. some seaweed floating by the brig, he maintained that it was the ship's boat, and endeavoured to throw himself upon it, howling and shrieking in the most heartrending manner, when i forcibly restrained him from thus casting himself into the sea. having become in some degree pacified, we continued to watch the ship until we finally lost sight of her, the weather becoming hazy, with a light breeze springing up. as soon as she was entirely gone, parker turned suddenly towards me with an expression of countenance which made me shudder. there was about him an air of self-possession which i had not noticed in him until now, and before he opened his lips my heart told me what he would say. he proposed, in a few words, that one of us should die to preserve the existence of the others. chapter xii. i had, for some time past, dwelt upon the prospect of our being reduced to this last horrible extremity, and had secretly made up my mind to suffer death in any shape or under any circumstances rather than resort to such a course. nor was this resolution in any degree weakened by the present intensity of hunger under which i laboured. the proposition had not been heard by either peters or augustus. i therefore took parker aside; and mentally praying to god for power to dissuade him from the horrible purpose he entertained, i expostulated with him for a long time and in the most supplicating manner, begging him in the name of everything which he held sacred, and urging him by every species of argument which the extremity of the case suggested, to abandon the idea, and not to mention it to either of the other two. he heard all i said without attempting to controvert any of my arguments, and i had begun to hope that he would be prevailed upon to do as i desired. but when i had ceased speaking, he said that he knew very well all i had said was true, and that to resort to such a course was the most horrible alternative which could enter into the mind of man; but that he had now held out as long as human nature could be sustained; that it was unnecessary for all to perish, when, by the death of one, it was possible, and even probable, that the rest might be finally preserved; adding that i might save myself the trouble of trying to turn him from his purpose, his mind having been thoroughly made up on the subject even before the appearance of the ship, and that only her heaving in sight had prevented him from mentioning his intention at an earlier period. i now begged him, if he would not be prevailed upon to abandon his design, at least to defer it for another day, when some vessel might come to our relief; again reiterating every argument i could devise, and which i thought likely to have influence with one of his rough nature. he said, in reply, that he had not spoken until the very last possible moment; that he could exist no longer without sustenance of some kind; and that therefore in another day his suggestion would be too late, as regarded himself at least. finding that he was not to be moved by anything i could say in a mild tone, i now assumed a different demeanour, and told him that he must be aware i had suffered less than any of us from our calamities; that my health and strength, consequently, were at that moment far better than his own, or than that either of peters or augustus; in short, that i was in a condition to have my own way by force if i found it necessary; and that, if he attempted in any manner to acquaint the others with his bloody and cannibal designs, i would not hesitate to throw him into the sea. upon this he immediately seized me by the throat, and drawing a knife, made several ineffectual efforts to stab me in the stomach; an atrocity which his excessive debility alone prevented him from accomplishing. in the mean time, being roused to a high pitch of anger, i forced him to the vessel's side, with the full intention of throwing him overboard. he was saved from this fate, however, by the interference of peters, who now approached and separated us, asking the cause of the disturbance. this parker told before i could find means in any manner to prevent him. the effect of his words was even more terrible than what i had anticipated. both augustus and peters, who, it seems, had long secretly entertained the same fearful idea which parker had been merely the first to broach, joined with him in his design, and insisted upon its being immediately carried into effect. i had calculated that one at least of the two former would be found still possessed of sufficient strength of mind to side with myself in resisting any attempt to execute so dreadful a purpose; and, with the aid of either one of them, i had no fear of being able to prevent its accomplishment. being disappointed in this expectation, it became absolutely necessary that i should attend to my own safety, as a further resistance on my part might possibly be considered by men in their frightful condition a sufficient excuse for refusing me fair play in the tragedy that i knew would speedily be enacted. i now told them i was willing to submit to the proposal, merely requesting a delay of about one hour, in order that the fog which had gathered around us might have an opportunity of lifting, when it was possible that the ship we had seen might be again in sight. after great difficulty i obtained from them a promise to wait thus long; and, as i had anticipated (a breeze rapidly coming in), the fog lifted before the hour had expired, when, no vessel appearing in sight, we prepared to draw lots. it is with extreme reluctance that i dwell upon the appalling scene which ensued; a scene which, with its minutest details, no after events have been able to efface in the slightest degree from my memory, and whose stern recollection will imbitter every future moment of my existence. let me run over this portion of my narrative with as much haste as the nature of the events to be spoken of will permit. the only method we could devise for the terrific lottery, in which we were to take each a chance, was that of drawing straws. small splinters of wood were made to answer our purpose, and it was agreed that i should be the holder. i retired to one end of the hulk, while my poor companions silently took up their station in the other with their backs turned towards me. the bitterest anxiety which i endured at any period of this fearful drama was while i occupied myself in the arrangement of the lots. there are few conditions into which man can possibly fall where he will not feel a deep interest in the preservation of his existence; an interest momentarily increasing with the frailness of the tenure by which that existence may be held. but now that the silent, definite, and stern nature of the business in which i was engaged (so different from the tumultuous dangers of the storm or the gradually approaching horrors of famine) allowed me to reflect on the few chances i had of escaping the most appalling of deaths--a death for the most appalling of purposes--every particle of that energy which had so long buoyed me up departed like feathers before the wind, leaving me a helpless prey to the most abject and pitiable terror. i could not, at first, even summon up sufficient strength to tear and fit together the small splinters of wood, my fingers absolutely refusing their office, and my knees knocking violently against each other. my mind ran over rapidly a thousand absurd projects by which to avoid becoming a partner in the awful speculation. i thought of falling on my knees to my companions, and entreating them to let me escape this necessity; of suddenly rushing upon them, and, by putting one of them to death, of rendering the decision by lot useless--in short, of everything but of going through with the matter i had in hand. at last, after wasting a long time in this imbecile conduct, i was recalled to my senses by the voice of parker, who urged me to relieve them at once from the terrible anxiety they were enduring. even then i could not bring myself to arrange the splinters upon the spot, but thought over every species of finesse by which i could trick some one of my fellow-sufferers to draw the short straw, as it had been agreed that whoever drew the shortest of four splinters from my hand was to die for the preservation of the rest. before any one condemn me for this apparent heartlessness, let him be placed in a situation precisely similar to my own. at length delay was no longer possible, and, with a heart almost bursting from my bosom, i advanced to the region of the forecastle, where my companions were awaiting me. i held out my hand with the splinters, and peters immediately drew. he was free--_his_, at least, was not the shortest; and there was now another chance against my escape. i summoned up all my strength, and passed the lots to augustus. he also drew immediately, and he also was free; and now, whether i should live or die, the chances were no more than precisely even. at this moment all the fierceness of the tiger possessed my bosom, and i felt towards my poor fellow-creature, parker, the most intense, the most diabolical hatred. but the feeling did not last; and, at length, with a convulsive shudder and closed eyes, i held out the two remaining splinters towards him. it was full five minutes before he could summon resolution to draw, during which period of heartrending suspense i never once opened my eyes. presently one of the two lots was quickly drawn from my hand. the decision was then over, yet i knew not whether it was for me or against me. no one spoke, and still i dared not satisfy myself by looking at the splinter i held. peters at length took me by the hand, and i forced myself to look up, when i immediately saw by the countenance of parker that i was safe, and that he it was who had been doomed to suffer. gasping for breath, i fell senseless to the deck. i recovered from my swoon in time to behold the consummation of the tragedy in the death of him who had been chiefly instrumental in bringing it about. he made no resistance whatever, and was stabbed in the back by peters, when he fell instantly dead. i must not dwell upon the fearful repast which immediately ensued. such things may be imagined, but words have no power to impress the mind with the exquisite horror of their reality. let it suffice to say that, having in some measure appeased the raging thirst which consumed us by the blood of the victim, and having by common consent taken off the hands, feet, and head, throwing them, together with the entrails, into the sea, we devoured the rest of the body, piecemeal, during the four ever memorable days of the seventeenth, eighteenth, nineteenth, and twentieth of the month. on the nineteenth, there coming on a smart shower which lasted fifteen or twenty minutes, we contrived to catch some water by means of a sheet which had been fished up from the cabin by our drag just after the gale. the quantity we took in all did not amount to more than half a gallon; but even this scanty allowance supplied us with comparative strength and hope. on the twenty-first we were again reduced to the last necessity. the weather still remained warm and pleasant, with occasional fogs and light breezes, most usually from n. to w. on the twenty-second, as we were sitting close huddled together, gloomily revolving over our lamentable condition, there flashed through my mind all at once an idea which inspired me with a bright gleam of hope. i remembered that, when the foremast had been cut away, peters, being in the windward chains, passed one of the axes into my hand, requesting me to put it, if possible, in a place of security, and that a few minutes before the last heavy sea struck the brig and filled her i had taken this axe into the forecastle, and laid it in one of the larboard berths. i now thought it possible that, by getting at this axe, we might cut through the deck over the storeroom, and thus readily supply ourselves with provisions. when i communicated this project to my companions, they uttered a feeble shout of joy, and we all proceeded forthwith to the forecastle. the difficulty of descending here was greater than that of going down in the cabin, the opening being much smaller, for it will be remembered that the whole framework about the cabin companion-hatch had been carried away, whereas the forecastle-way, being a simple hatch of only about three feet square, had remained uninjured. i did not hesitate, however, to attempt the descent; and, a rope being fastened round my body as before, i plunged boldly in, feet foremost, made my way quickly to the berth, and, at the very first attempt, brought up the axe. it was hailed with the most ecstatic joy and triumph, and the ease with which it had been obtained was regarded as an omen of our ultimate preservation. we now commenced cutting at the deck with all the energy of rekindled hope, peters and myself taking the axe by turns, augustus's wounded arm not permitting him to aid us in any degree. as we were still so feeble as to be scarcely able to stand unsupported, and could consequently work but a minute or two without resting, it soon became evident that many long hours would be requisite to accomplish our task--that is, to cut an opening sufficiently large to admit of a free access to the storeroom. this consideration, however, did not discourage us; and, working all night by the light of the moon, we succeeded in effecting our purpose by daybreak on the morning of the twenty-third. peters now volunteered to go down; and, having made all arrangements as before, he descended, and soon returned, bringing up with him a small jar, which, to our great joy, proved to be full of olives. having shared these among us, and devoured them with the greatest avidity, we proceeded to let him down again. this time he succeeded beyond our utmost expectations, returning instantly with a large ham and a bottle of madeira wine. of the latter we each took a moderate sup, having learned by experience the pernicious consequences of indulging too freely. the ham, except about two pounds near the bone, was not in a condition to be eaten, having been entirely spoiled by the salt water. the sound part was divided among us. peters and augustus, not being able to restrain their appetite, swallowed theirs upon the instant; but i was more cautious, and ate but a small portion of mine, dreading the thirst which i knew would ensue. we now rested a while from our labours, which had been intolerably severe. by noon, feeling somewhat strengthened and refreshed, we again renewed our attempt at getting up provision, peters and myself going down alternately, and always with more or less success, until sundown. during this interval we had the good fortune to bring up, altogether, four more small jars of olives, another ham, a carboy containing nearly three gallons of excellent cape madeira wine, and, what gave us still more delight, a small tortoise of the gallipago breed, several of which had been taken on board by captain barnard, as the grampus was leaving port, from the schooner mary pitts, just returned from a sealing voyage in the pacific. in a subsequent portion of this narrative i shall have frequent occasion to mention this species of tortoise. it is found principally, as most of my readers may know, in the group of islands called the gallipagos, which, indeed, derive their name from the animal--the spanish word gallipago meaning a fresh-water terapin. from the peculiarity of their shape and action they have been sometimes called the elephant tortoise. they are frequently found of an enormous size. i have myself seen several which would weigh from twelve to fifteen hundred pounds, although i do not remember that any navigator speaks of having seen them weighing more than eight hundred. their appearance is singular, and even disgusting. their steps are very slow, measured, and heavy, their bodies being carried about a foot from the ground. their neck is long, and exceedingly slender; from eighteen inches to two feet is a very common length, and i killed one, where the distance from the shoulder to the extremity of the head was no less than three feet ten inches. the head has a striking resemblance to that of a serpent. they can exist without food for an almost incredible length of time, instances having been known where they have been thrown into the hold of a vessel and lain two years without nourishment of any kind--being as fat, and, in every respect, in as good order at the expiration of the time as when they were first put in. in one particular these extraordinary animals bear a resemblance to the dromedary, or camel of the desert. in a bag at the root of the neck they carry with them a constant supply of water. in some instances, upon killing them after a full year's deprivation of all nourishment, as much as three gallons of perfectly sweet and fresh water have been found in their bags. their food is chiefly wild parsley and celery, with purslain, sea-kelp, and prickly pears, upon which latter vegetable they thrive wonderfully, a great quantity of it being usually found on the hillsides near the shore wherever the animal itself is discovered. they are excellent and highly nutritious food, and have, no doubt, been the means of preserving the lives of thousands of seamen employed in the whale-fishery and other pursuits in the pacific. the one which we had the good fortune to bring up from the storeroom was not of a large size, weighing probably sixty-five or seventy pounds. it was a female, and in excellent condition, being exceedingly fat, and having more than a quart of limpid and sweet water in its bag. this was indeed a treasure; and, falling on our knees with one accord, we returned fervent thanks to god for so seasonable a relief. we had great difficulty in getting the animal up through the opening, as its struggles were fierce and its strength prodigious. it was upon the point of making its escape from peters's grasp, and slipping back into the water, when augustus, throwing a rope with a slip-knot around its throat, held it up in this manner until i jumped into the hole by the side of peters, and assisted him in lifting it out. the water we drew carefully from the bag into the jug, which, it will be remembered, had been brought up before from the cabin. having done this, we broke off the neck of a bottle so as to form, with the cork, a kind of glass, holding not quite half a gill. we then each drank one of these measures full, and resolved to limit ourselves to this quantity per day as long as it should hold out. during the last two or three days, the weather having been dry and pleasant, the bedding we had obtained from the cabin, as well as our clothing, had become thoroughly dry, so that we passed this night (that of the twenty-third) in comparative comfort, enjoying a tranquil repose, after having supped plentifully on olives and ham, with a small allowance of the wine. being afraid of losing some of our stores overboard during the night, in the event of a breeze springing up, we secured them as well as possible with cordage to the fragments of the windlass. our tortoise, which we were anxious to preserve alive as long as we could, we threw on his back, and otherwise carefully fastened. chapter xiii. _july <UNK> this morning saw us wonderfully recruited in spirits and strength. notwithstanding the perilous situation in which we were still placed, ignorant of our position, although certainly at a great distance from land, without more food than would last us for a fortnight even with great care, almost entirely without water, and floating about at the mercy of every wind and wave, on the merest wreck in the world, still the infinitely more terrible distresses and dangers from which we had so lately and so providentially been delivered caused us to regard what we now endured as but little more than an ordinary evil--so strictly comparative is either good or ill. at sunrise we were preparing to renew our attempts at getting up something from the storeroom, when, a smart shower coming on, with some lightning, we turned our attention to the catching of water by means of the sheet we had used before for this purpose. we had no other means of collecting the rain than by holding the sheet spread out with one of the forechain-plates in the middle of it. the water, thus conducted to the centre, was drained through into our jug. we had nearly filled it in this manner, when, a heavy squall coming on from the northward, obliged us to desist, as the hulk began once more to roll so violently that we could no longer keep our feet. we now went forward, and, lashing ourselves securely to the remnant of the windlass as before, awaited the event with far more calmness than could have been anticipated, or would have been imagined possible under the circumstances. at noon the wind had freshened into a two-reef breeze, and by night into a stiff gale, accompanied with a tremendously heavy swell. experience having taught us, however, the best method of arranging our lashings, we weathered this dreary night in tolerable security, although thoroughly drenched at almost every instant by the sea, and in momentary dread of being washed off. fortunately, the weather was so warm as to render the water rather grateful than otherwise. _july <UNK> this morning the gale had diminished to a mere ten-knot breeze, and the sea had gone down with it so considerably that we were able to keep ourselves dry upon the deck. to our great grief, however, we found that two jars of our olives, as well as the whole of our ham, had been washed overboard, in spite of the careful manner in which they had been fastened. we determined not to kill the tortoise as yet, and contented ourselves for the present with a breakfast on a few of the olives, and a measure of water each, which latter we mixed, half and half, with wine, finding great relief and strength from the mixture, without the distressing intoxication which had ensued upon drinking the port. the sea was still far too rough for the renewal of our efforts at getting up provision from the storeroom. several articles, of no importance to us in our present situation, floated up through the opening during the day, and were immediately washed overboard. we also now observed that the hulk lay more along than ever, so that we could not stand an instant without lashing ourselves. on this account we passed a gloomy and uncomfortable day. at noon the sun appeared to be nearly vertical, and we had no doubt that we had been driven down by the long succession of northward and northwesterly winds into the near vicinity of the equator. towards evening saw several sharks, and were somewhat alarmed by the audacious manner in which an enormously large one approached us. at one time, a lurch throwing the deck very far beneath the water, the monster actually swam in upon us, floundering for some moments just over the companion-hatch, and striking peters violently with his tail. a heavy sea at length hurled him overboard, much to our relief. in moderate weather we might have easily captured him. _july <UNK> this morning, the wind having greatly abated, and the sea not being very rough, we determined to renew our exertions in the storeroom. after a great deal of hard labour during the whole day, we found that nothing further was to be expected from this quarter, the partitions of the room having been stove during the night, and its contents swept into the hold. this discovery, as may be supposed, filled us with despair. _july <UNK> the sea nearly smooth, with a light wind, and still from the northward and westward. the sun coming out hotly in the afternoon, we occupied ourselves in drying our clothes. found great relief from thirst, and much comfort otherwise, by bathing in the sea; in this, however, we were forced to use great caution, being afraid of sharks, several of which were seen swimming around the brig during the day. _july <UNK> good weather still. the brig now began to lie along so alarmingly that we feared she would eventually roll bottom up. prepared ourselves as well as we could for this emergency, lashing our tortoise, water-jug, and two remaining jars of olives as far as possible over to the windward, placing them outside the hull, below the main-chains. the sea very smooth all day, with little or no wind. _july <UNK> a continuance of the same weather. augustus's wounded arm began to evince symptoms of mortification. he complained of drowsiness and excessive thirst, but no acute pain. nothing could be done for his relief beyond rubbing his wounds with a little of the vinegar from the olives, and from this no benefit seemed to be experienced. we did everything in our power for his comfort, and trebled his allowance of water. _july <UNK> an excessively hot day, with no wind. an enormous shark kept close by the hulk during the whole of the forenoon. we made several unsuccessful attempts to capture him by means of a noose. augustus much worse, and evidently sinking as much from want of proper nourishment as from the effect of his wounds. he constantly prayed to be released from his sufferings, wishing for nothing but death. this evening we ate the last of our olives, and found the water in our jug so putrid that we could not swallow it at all without the addition of wine. determined to kill our tortoise in the morning. _july <UNK> after a night of excessive anxiety and fatigue, owing to the position of the hulk, we set about killing and cutting up our tortoise. he proved to be much smaller than we had supposed, although in good condition--the whole meat about him not amounting to more than ten pounds. with a view of preserving a portion of this as long as possible, we cut it into fine pieces, and filled with them our three remaining olive-jars and the wine-bottle (all of which had been kept), pouring in afterward the vinegar from the olives. in this manner we put away about three pounds of the tortoise, intending not to touch it until we had consumed the rest. we concluded to restrict ourselves to about four ounces of the meat per day; the whole would thus last us thirteen days. a brisk shower, with severe thunder and lightning, came on about dusk, but lasted so short a time that we only succeeded in catching about half a pint of water. the whole of this, by common consent, was given to augustus, who now appeared to be in the last extremity. he drank the water from the sheet as we caught it (we holding it above him as he lay so as to let it run into his mouth), for we had now nothing left capable of holding water, unless we had chosen to empty out our wine from the carboy, or the stale water from the jug. either of these expedients would have been resorted to had the shower lasted. the sufferer seemed to derive but little benefit from the draught. his arm was completely black from the wrist to the shoulder, and his feet were like ice. we expected every moment to see him breathe his last. he was frightfully emaciated; so much so that, although he weighed a hundred and twenty-seven pounds upon his leaving nantucket, he now did not weigh more than _forty or fifty at the farthest_. his eyes were sunk far in his head, being scarcely perceptible, and the skin of his cheeks hung so loosely as to prevent his masticating any food, or even swallowing any liquid, without great difficulty. _august <UNK> a continuance of the same calm weather, with an oppressively hot sun. suffered exceedingly from thirst, the water in the jug being absolutely putrid and swarming with vermin. we contrived, nevertheless, to swallow a portion of it by mixing it with wine--our thirst, however, was but little abated. we found more relief by bathing in the sea, but could not avail ourselves of this expedient except at long intervals, on account of the continual presence of sharks. we now saw clearly that augustus could not be saved; that he was evidently dying. we could do nothing to relieve his sufferings, which appeared to be great. about twelve o'clock he expired in strong convulsions, and without having spoken for several hours. his death filled us with the most gloomy forebodings, and had so great an effect upon our spirits that we sat motionless by the corpse during the whole day, and never addressed each other except in a whisper. it was not until some time after dark that we took courage to get up and throw the body overboard. it was then loathsome beyond expression, and so far decayed that, as peters attempted to lift it, an entire leg came off in his grasp. as the mass of putrefaction slipped over the vessel's side into the water, the glare of phosphoric light with which it was surrounded plainly discovered to us seven or eight large sharks, the clashing of whose horrible teeth, as their prey was torn to pieces among them, might have been heard at the distance of a mile. we shrunk within ourselves in the extremity of horror at the sound. _august <UNK> the same fearfully calm and hot weather. the dawn found us in a state of pitiable dejection as well as bodily exhaustion. the water in the jug was now absolutely useless, being a thick gelatinous mass; nothing but frightful-looking worms mingled with slime. we threw it out, and washed the jug well in the sea, afterward pouring a little vinegar in it from our bottles of pickled tortoise. our thirst could now scarcely be endured, and we tried in vain to relieve it by wine, which seemed only to add fuel to the flame, and excited us to a high degree of intoxication. we afterward endeavoured to relieve our sufferings by mixing the wine with seawater; but this instantly brought about the most violent retchings, so that we never again attempted it. during the whole day we anxiously sought an opportunity of bathing, but to no purpose; for the hulk was now entirely besieged on all sides with sharks--no doubt the identical monsters who had devoured our poor companion on the evening before, and who were in momentary expectation of another similar feast. this circumstance occasioned us the most bitter regret, and filled us with the most depressing and melancholy forebodings. we had experienced indescribable relief in bathing, and to have this resource cut off in so frightful a manner was more than we could bear. nor, indeed, were we altogether free from the apprehension of immediate danger, for the least slip or false movement would have thrown us at once within reach of these voracious fish, who frequently thrust themselves directly upon us, swimming up to leeward. no shouts or exertions on our part seemed to alarm them. even when one of the largest was struck with an axe by peters, and much wounded, he persisted in his attempts to push in where we were. a cloud came up at dusk, but, to our extreme anguish, passed over without discharging itself. it is quite impossible to conceive our sufferings from thirst at this period. we passed a sleepless night, both on this account and through dread of the sharks. _august <UNK> no prospect of relief, and the brig lying still more and more along, so that now we could not maintain a footing upon deck at all. busied ourselves in securing our wine and tortoise-meat, so that we might not lose them in the event of our rolling over. got out two stout spikes from the forechains, and, by means of the axe, drove them into the hull to windward within a couple of feet of the water; this not being very far from the keel, as we were nearly upon our beam-ends. to these spikes we now lashed our provisions, as being more secure than their former position beneath the chains. suffered great agony from thirst during the whole day--no chance of bathing on account of the sharks, which never left us for a moment. found it impossible to sleep. _august <UNK> a little before daybreak we perceived that the hulk was heeling over, and aroused ourselves to prevent being thrown off by the movement. at first the roll was slow and gradual, and we contrived to clamber over to windward very well, having taken the precaution to leave ropes hanging from the spikes we had driven in for the provision. but we had not calculated sufficiently upon the acceleration of the impetus; for presently the heel became too violent to allow of our keeping pace with it; and, before either of us knew what was to happen, we found ourselves hurled furiously into the sea, and struggling several fathoms beneath the surface, with the huge hull immediately above us. in going under the water i had been obliged to let go my hold upon the rope; and finding that i was completely beneath the vessel, and my strength utterly exhausted, i scarcely made a struggle for life, and resigned myself, in a few seconds, to die. but here again i was deceived, not having taken into consideration the natural rebound of the hull to windward. the whirl of the water upward, which the vessel occasioned in rolling partially back, brought me to the surface still more violently than i had been plunged beneath. upon coming up, i found myself about twenty yards from the hulk, as near as i could judge. she was lying keel up, rocking furiously from side to side, and the sea in all directions around was much agitated, and full of strong whirlpools. i could see nothing of peters. an oil-cask was floating within a few feet of me, and various other articles from the brig were scattered about. my principal terror was now on account of the sharks, which i knew to be in my vicinity. in order to deter these, if possible, from approaching me, i splashed the water vigorously with both hands and feet as i swam towards the hulk, creating a body of foam. i have no doubt that to this expedient, simple as it was, i was indebted for my preservation; for the sea all around the brig, just before her rolling over, was so crowded with these monsters, that i must have been, and really was, in actual contact with some of them during my progress. by great good fortune, however, i reached the side of the vessel in safety, although so utterly weakened by the violent exertion i had used that i should never have been able to get upon it but for the timely assistance of peters, who now, to my great joy, made his appearance (having scrambled up to the keel from the opposite side of the hull), and threw me the end of a rope--one of those which had been attached to the spikes. having barely escaped this danger, our attention was now directed to the dreadful imminency of another; that of absolute starvation. our whole stock of provision had been swept overboard in spite of all our care in securing it; and seeing no longer the remotest possibility of obtaining more, we gave way both of us to despair, weeping aloud like children, and neither of us attempting to offer consolation to the other. such weakness can scarcely be conceived, and to those who have never been similarly situated will, no doubt, appear unnatural; but it must be remembered that our intellects were so entirely disordered by the long course of privation and terror to which we had been subjected, that we could not justly be considered, at that period, in the light of rational beings. in subsequent perils, nearly as great, if not greater, i bore up with fortitude against all the evils of my situation, and peters, it will be seen, evinced a stoical philosophy nearly as incredible as his present childlike supineness and imbecility--the mental condition made the difference. the overturning of the brig, even with the consequent loss of the wine and turtle, would not, in fact, have rendered our situation more deplorable than before, except for the disappearance of the bedclothes by which we had been hitherto enabled to catch rainwater, and of the jug in which we had kept it when caught; for we found the whole bottom, from within two or three feet of the bends as far as the keel, together with the keel itself, _thickly covered with large barnacles, which proved to be excellent and highly nutritious food_. thus, in two important respects, the accident we had so greatly dreaded proved a benefit rather than an injury; it had opened to us a supply of provisions, which we could not have exhausted, using it moderately, in a month; and it had greatly contributed to our comfort as regards position, we being much more at our ease, and in infinitely less danger, than before. the difficulty, however, of now obtaining water blinded us to all the benefits of the change in our condition. that we might be ready to avail ourselves, as far as possible, of any shower which might fall, we took off our shirts, to make use of them as we had of the sheets--not hoping, of course, to get more in this way, even under the most favourable circumstances, than half a gill at a time. no signs of a cloud appeared during the day, and the agonies of our thirst were nearly intolerable. at night peters obtained about an hour's disturbed sleep, but my intense sufferings would not permit me to close my eyes for a single moment. _august <UNK> to-day, a gentle breeze springing up carried us through a vast quantity of seaweed, among which we were so fortunate as to find eleven small crabs, which afforded us several delicious meals. their shells being quite soft, we ate them entire, and found that they irritated our thirst far less than the barnacles. seeing no trace of sharks among the seaweed, we also ventured to bathe, and remained in the water for four or five hours, during which we experienced a very sensible diminution of our thirst. were greatly refreshed, and spent the night somewhat more comfortably than before, both of us snatching a little sleep. _august <UNK> this day we were blessed by a brisk and continual rain, lasting from about noon until after dark. bitterly did we now regret the loss of our jug and carboy; for, in spite of the little means we had of catching the water, we might have filled one, if not both of them. as it was, we contrived to satisfy the cravings of thirst by suffering the shirts to become saturated, and then wringing them so as to let the grateful fluid trickle into our mouths. in this occupation we passed the entire day. _august <UNK> just at daybreak we both at the same instant descried a sail to the eastward, and _evidently coming towards us!_ we hailed the glorious sight with a long, although feeble shout of rapture; and began instantly to make every signal in our power, by flaring the shirts in the air, leaping as high as our weak condition would permit, and even by hallooing with all the strength of our lungs, although the vessel could not have been less than fifteen miles distant. however, she still continued to near our hulk, and we felt that, if she but held her present course, she must eventually come so close as to perceive us. in about an hour after we first discovered her we could clearly see the people on her decks. she was a long, low, and rakish-looking topsail schooner, with a black ball in her foretopsail, and had, apparently, a full crew. we now became alarmed, for we could hardly imagine it possible that she did not observe us, and were apprehensive that she meant to leave us to perish as we were--an act of fiendish barbarity, which, however incredible it may appear, has been repeatedly perpetrated at sea, under circumstances very nearly similar, and by beings who were regarded as belonging to the human <UNK> in this instance, however, by the mercy of god, we were destined to be most happily deceived; for presently we were aware of a sudden commotion on the deck of the stranger, who immediately afterward run up a british flag, and, hauling her wind, bore up directly upon us. in half an hour more we found ourselves in her cabin. she proved to be the jane guy, of liverpool, captain guy, bound on a sealing and trading voyage to the south seas and pacific. [footnote <UNK> the case of the brig polly, of boston, is one so much in point, and her fate, in many respects, so remarkably similar to our own, that i cannot forbear alluding to it here. this vessel, of one hundred and thirty tons burden, sailed from boston, with a cargo of lumber and provisions, for santa croix, on the twelfth of december, <UNK> under the command of captain casneau. there were eight souls on board besides the captain--the mate, four seamen, and the cook, together with a mr. hunt, and a negro girl belonging to him. on the fifteenth, having cleared the shoal of georges, she sprung a leak in a gale of wind from the southeast, and was finally capsized; but, the mast going by the board, she afterward righted. they remained in this situation, without fire, and with very little provision, for the period of _one hundred and ninety-one days_ (from december the fifteenth to june the twentieth) when captain casneau and samuel badger, the only survivers, were taken off the wreck by the fame, of hull, captain featherstone, bound home from rio janeiro. when picked up they were in latitude <UNK> n., longitude <UNK> w., having drifted above two thousand miles_. on the ninth of july the fame fell in with the brig dromeo, captain perkins, who landed the two sufferers in kennebeck. the narrative from which we gather these details ends in the following words. "it is natural to inquire how they could float such a vast distance, upon the most frequented part of the atlantic, and not be discovered all this time. _they were passed by more than a dozen sail, one of which came so nigh them that they could distinctly see the people on deck and on the rigging looking at them; but, to the inexpressible disappointment of the starving and freezing men, they stifled the dictates of compassion, hoisted sail, and cruelly abandoned them to their fate._"] chapter xiv. the jane guy was a fine-looking topsail schooner of a hundred and eighty tons burden. she was unusually sharp in the bows, and on a wind, in moderate weather, the fastest sailer i have ever seen. her qualities, however, as a rough sea-boat, were not so good, and her draught of water was by far too great for the trade to which she was destined. for this peculiar service a larger vessel, and one of a light proportionate draught, is desirable--say a vessel of from three to three hundred and fifty tons. she should be barque-rigged, and in other respects of a different construction from the usual south sea ships. it is absolutely necessary that she should be well armed. she should have, say ten or twelve twelve pound carronades, and two or three long twelves, with brass blunderbusses, and water-tight arm-chests for each top. her anchors and cables should be of far greater strength than is required for any other species of trade, and, above all, her crew should be numerous and efficient--not less, for such a vessel as i have described, than fifty or sixty able-bodied men. the jane guy had a crew of thirty-five, all able seamen, besides the captain and mate, but she was not altogether as well armed or otherwise equipped as a navigator acquainted with the difficulties and dangers of the trade could have desired. captain guy was a gentleman of great urbanity of manner, and of considerable experience in the southern traffic, to which he had devoted a great portion of his life. he was deficient, however, in energy, and, consequently, in that spirit of enterprise which is here so absolutely requisite. he was part owner of the vessel in which he sailed, and was invested with discretionary powers to cruise in the south seas for any cargo which might come most readily to hand. he had on board, as usual in such voyages, beads, looking-glasses, tinder-works, axes, hatchets, saws, adzes, planes, chisels, gouges, gimlets, files, spokeshaves, rasps, hammers, nails, knives, scissors, razors, needles, thread, crockery-ware, calico, trinkets, and other similar articles. the schooner sailed from liverpool on the tenth of july, crossed the tropic of cancer on the twenty-fifth, in longitude twenty degrees west, and reached sal, one of the cape verd islands, on the twenty-ninth, where she took in salt and other necessaries for the voyage. on the third of august she left the cape verds and steered southwest, stretching over towards the coast of brazil so as to cross the equator between the meridians of twenty-eight and thirty degrees west longitude. this is the course usually taken by vessels bound from europe to the cape of good hope, or by that route to the east indies. by proceeding thus they avoid the calms and strong contrary currents which continually prevail on the coast of guinea, while, in the end, it is found to be the shortest track, as westerly winds are never wanting afterward by which to reach the cape. it was captain guy's intention to make his first stoppage at kerguelen's land--i hardly know for what reason. on the day we were picked up the schooner was off cape st. roque, in longitude <UNK> w.; so that, when found, we had drifted probably, from north to south, _not less than five-and-twenty degrees_. on board the jane guy we were treated with all the kindness our distressed situation demanded. in about a fortnight, during which time we continued steering to the southeast, with gentle breezes and fine weather, both peters and myself recovered entirely from the effects of our late privation and dreadful suffering, and we began to remember what had passed rather as a frightful dream from which we had been happily awakened, than as events which had taken place in sober and naked reality. i have since found that this species of partial oblivion is usually brought about by sudden transition, whether from joy to sorrow or from sorrow to joy--the degree of forgetfulness being proportioned to the degree of difference in the exchange. thus, in my own case, i now feel it impossible to realize the full extent of the misery which i endured during the days spent upon the hulk. the incidents are remembered, but not the feelings which the incidents elicited at the time of their occurrence. i only know that, when they did occur, i _then_ thought human nature could sustain nothing more of agony. we continued our voyage for some weeks without any incidents of greater moment than the occasional meeting with whaling-ships, and more frequently with the black or right whale, so called in contradistinction to the spermaceti. these, however, were chiefly found south of the twenty-fifth parallel. on the sixteenth of september, being in the vicinity of the cape of good hope, the schooner encountered her first gale of any violence since leaving liverpool. in this neighbourhood, but more frequently to the south and east of the promontory (we were to the westward), navigators have often to contend with storms from the northward which rage with great fury. they always bring with them a heavy sea, and one of their most dangerous features is the instantaneous chopping round of the wind, an occurrence almost certain to take place during the greatest force of the gale. a perfect hurricane will be blowing at one moment from the northward or northeast, and in the next not a breath of wind will be felt in that direction, while from the southwest it will come out all at once with a violence almost inconceivable. a bright spot to the southward is the sure forerunner of the change, and vessels are thus enabled to take the proper precautions. it was about six in the morning when the blow came on with a white squall, and, as usual, from the northward. by eight it had increased very much, and brought down upon us one of the most tremendous seas i had then ever beheld. everything had been made as snug as possible, but the schooner laboured excessively, and gave evidence of her bad qualities as a seaboat, pitching her forecastle under at every plunge, and with the greatest difficulty struggling up from one wave before she was buried in another. just before sunset the bright spot for which we had been on the lookout made its appearance in the southwest, and in an hour afterward we perceived the little headsail we carried flapping listlessly against the mast. in two minutes more, in spite of every preparation, we were hurled on our beam-ends as if by magic, and a perfect wilderness of foam made a clear breach over us as we lay. the blow from the southwest, however, luckily proved to be nothing more than a squall, and we had the good fortune to right the vessel without the loss of a spar. a heavy cross sea gave us great trouble for a few hours after this, but towards morning we found ourselves in nearly as good condition as before the gale. captain guy considered that he had made an escape little less than miraculous. on the thirteenth of october we came in sight of prince edward's island, in latitude <UNK> <UNK> s., longitude <UNK> <UNK> e. two days afterward we found ourselves near possession island, and presently passed the islands of crozet, in latitude <UNK> <UNK> s., longitude <UNK> e. on the eighteenth we made kerguelen's or desolation island, in the southern indian ocean, and came to anchor in christmas harbour, having four fathoms of water. this island, or rather group of islands, bears southeast from the cape of good hope, and is distant therefrom nearly eight hundred leagues. it was first discovered in <UNK> by the baron de kergulen, or kerguelen, a frenchman, who, thinking the land to form a portion of an extensive southern continent, carried home information to that effect, which produced much excitement at the time. the government, taking the matter up, sent the baron back in the following year for the purpose of giving his new discovery a critical examination, when the mistake was discovered. in <UNK> captain cook fell in with the same group, and gave to the principal one the name of desolation island, a title which it certainly well deserves. upon approaching the land, however, the navigator might be induced to suppose otherwise, as the sides of most of the hills, from september to march, are clothed with very brilliant verdure. this deceitful appearance is caused by a small plant resembling saxifrage, which is abundant, growing in large patches on a species of crumbling moss. besides this plant there is scarcely a sign of vegetation on the island, if we except some coarse rank grass near the harbour, some lichen, and a shrub which bears resemblance to a cabbage shooting into seed, and which has a bitter and acrid taste. the face of the country is hilly, although none of the hills can be called lofty. their tops are perpetually covered with snow. there are several harbours, of which christmas harbour is the most convenient. it is the first to be met with on the northeast side of the island after passing cape françois, which forms the northern shore, and, by its peculiar shape, serves to distinguish the harbour. its projecting point terminates in a high rock, through which is a large hole, forming a natural arch. the entrance is in latitude <UNK> <UNK> s., longitude <UNK> <UNK> e. passing in here, good anchorage may be found under the shelter of several small islands, which form a sufficient protection from all easterly winds. proceeding on eastwardly from this anchorage you come to wasp bay, at the head of the harbour. this is a small basin, completely landlocked, into which you can go with four fathoms, and find anchorage in from ten to three, hard clay bottom. a ship might lie here with her best bower ahead all the year round without risk. to the westward, at the head of wasp bay, is a small stream of excellent water, easily procured. some seal of the fur and hair species are still to be found on kerguelen's island, and sea elephants abound. the feathered tribes are discovered in great numbers. penguins are very plenty, and of these there are four different kinds. the royal penguin, so called from its size and beautiful plumage, is the largest. the upper part of the body is usually gray, sometimes of a lilach tint; the under portion of the purest white imaginable. the head is of a glossy and most brilliant black, the feet also. the chief beauty of the plumage, however, consists in two broad stripes of a gold colour, which pass along from the head to the breast. the bill is long, and either pink or bright scarlet. these birds walk erect, with a stately carriage. they carry their heads high, with their wings drooping like two arms, and, as their tails project from their body in a line with the legs, the resemblance to a human figure is very striking, and would be apt to deceive the spectator at a casual glance or in the gloom of the evening. the royal penguins which we met with on kerguelen's land were rather larger than a goose. the other kinds are the macaroni, the jackass, and the rookery penguin. these are much smaller, less beautiful in plumage, and different in other respects. besides the penguin many other birds are here to be found, among which may be mentioned seahens, blue peterels, teal, ducks, port egmont hens, shags, cape pigeons, the nelly, seaswallows, terns, seagulls, mother carey's chickens, mother carey's geese, or the great peterel, and, lastly, the albatross. the great peterel is as large as the common albatross, and is carnivorous. it is frequently called the break-bones, or osprey peterel. they are not at all shy, and, when properly cooked, are palatable food. in flying they sometimes sail very close to the surface of the water, with the wings expanded, without appearing to move them in the least degree, or make any exertion with them whatever. the albatross is one of the largest and fiercest of the south sea birds. it is of the gull species, and takes its prey on the wing, never coming on land except for the purpose of breeding. between this bird and the penguin the most singular friendship exists. their nests are constructed with great uniformity, upon a plan concerted between the two species--that of the albatross being placed in the centre of a little square formed by the nests of four penguins. navigators have agreed in calling an assemblage of such encampments _a rookery_. these rookeries have been often described, but, as my readers may not all have seen these descriptions, and as i shall have occasion hereafter to speak of the penguin and albatross, it will not be amiss to say something here of their mode of building and living. when the season for incubation arrives, the birds assemble in vast numbers, and for some days appear to be deliberating upon the proper course to be pursued. at length they proceed to action. a level piece of ground is selected, of suitable extent, usually comprising three or four acres, and situated as near the sea as possible, being still beyond its reach. the spot is chosen with reference to its evenness of surface, and that is preferred which is the least encumbered with stones. this matter being arranged, the birds proceed, with one accord, and actuated apparently by one mind, to trace out, with mathematical accuracy, either a square or other parallelogram, as may best suit the nature of the ground, and of just sufficient size to accommodate easily all the birds assembled, and no more--in this particular seeming determined upon preventing the access of future stragglers who have not participated in the labour of the encampment. one side of the place thus marked out runs parallel with the water's edge, and is left open for ingress or egress. having defined the limits of the rookery, the colony now begin to clear it of every species of rubbish, picking up stone by stone, and carrying them outside of the lines, and close by them, so as to form a wall on the three inland sides. just within this wall a perfectly level and smooth walk is formed, from six to eight feet wide, and extending around the encampment--thus serving the purpose of a general promenade. the next process is to partition out the whole area into small squares exactly equal in size. this is done by forming narrow paths, very smooth, and crossing each other at right angles throughout the entire extent of the rookery. at each intersection of these paths the nest of an albatross is constructed, and a penguin's nest in the centre of each square--thus every penguin is surrounded by four albatrosses, and each albatross by a like number of penguins. the penguin's nest consists of a hole in the earth, very shallow, being only just of sufficient depth to keep her single egg from rolling. the albatross is somewhat less simple in her arrangements, erecting a hillock about a foot high and two in diameter. this is made of earth, seaweed, and shells. on its summit she builds her nest. the birds take especial care never to leave their nests unoccupied for an instant during the period of incubation, or, indeed, until the young progeny are sufficiently strong to take care of themselves. while the male is absent at sea in search of food, the female remains on duty, and it is only upon the return of her partner that she ventures abroad. the eggs are never left uncovered at all--while one bird leaves the nest, the other nestling in by its side. this precaution is rendered necessary by the thievish propensities prevalent in the rookery, the inhabitants making no scruple to purloin each other's eggs at every good opportunity. although there are some rookeries in which the penguin and albatross are the sole population, yet in most of them a variety of oceanic birds are to be met with, enjoying all the privileges of citizenship, and scattering their nests here and there, wherever they can find room, never interfering, however, with the stations of the larger species. the appearance of such encampments, when seen from a distance, is exceedingly singular. the whole atmosphere just above the settlement is darkened with the immense number of the albatross (mingled with the smaller tribes) which are continually hovering over it, either going to the ocean or returning home. at the same time a crowd of penguins are to be observed, some passing to and fro in the narrow alleys, and some marching, with the military strut so peculiar to them, around the general promenade-ground which encircles the rookery. in short, survey it as we will, nothing can be more astonishing than the spirit of reflection evinced by these feathered beings, and nothing surely can be better calculated to elicit reflection in every well-regulated human intellect. on the morning after our arrival in christmas harbour the chief mate, mr. patterson, took the boats, and (although it was somewhat early in the season) went in search of seal, leaving the captain and a young relation of his on a point of barren land to the westward, they having some business, whose nature i could not ascertain, to transact in the interior of the island. captain guy took with him a bottle, in which was a sealed letter, and made his way from the point on which he was set on shore towards one of the highest peaks in the place. it is probable that his design was to leave the letter on that height for some vessel which he expected to come after him. as soon as we lost sight of him we proceeded (peters and myself being in the mate's boat) on our cruise around the coast, looking for seal. in this business we were occupied about three weeks, examining with great care every nook and corner, not only of kerguelen's land, but of the several small islands in the vicinity. our labours, however, were not crowned with any important success. we saw a great many fur seal, but they were exceedingly shy, and, with the greatest exertions, we could only procure three hundred and fifty skins in all. sea elephants were abundant, especially on the western coast of the main island, but of these we killed only twenty, and this with great difficulty. on the smaller islands we discovered a good many of the hair seal, but did not molest them. we returned to the schooner on the eleventh, where we found captain guy and his nephew, who gave a very bad account of the interior, representing it as one of the most dreary and utterly barren countries in the world. they had remained two nights on the island, owing to some misunderstanding, on the part of the second mate, in regard to the sending a jollyboat from the schooner to take them off. chapter xv. on the twelfth we made sail from christmas harbour, retracing our way to the westward, and leaving marion's island, one of crozet's group, on the larboard. we afterward passed prince edward's island, leaving it also on our left; then, steering more to the northward, made, in fifteen days, the islands of tristan d'acunha, in latitude <UNK> <UNK> s., longitude <UNK> <UNK> w. this group, now so well known, and which consists of three circular islands, was first discovered by the portuguese, and was visited afterward by the dutch in <UNK> and by the french in <UNK> the three islands together form a triangle, and are distant from each other about ten miles, there being fine open passages between. the land in all of them is very high, especially in tristan d'acunha, properly so called. this is the largest of the group, being fifteen miles in circumference, and so elevated that it can be seen in clear weather at the distance of eighty or ninety miles. a part of the land towards the north rises more than a thousand feet perpendicularly from the sea. a tableland at this height extends back nearly to the centre of the island, and from this tableland arises a lofty cone like that of teneriffe. the lower half of this cone is clothed with trees of good size, but the upper region is barren rock, usually hidden among the clouds, and covered with snow during the greater part of the year. there are no shoals or other dangers about the island, the shores being remarkably bold and the water deep. on the northwestern coast is a bay, with a beach of black sand, where a landing with boats can be easily effected, provided there be a southerly wind. plenty of excellent water may here be readily procured; also cod, and other fish, may be taken with hook and line. the next island in point of size, and the most westwardly of the group, is that called the inaccessible. its precise situation is <UNK> <UNK> s. latitude, longitude <UNK> <UNK> w. it is seven or eight miles in circumference, and on all sides presents a forbidding and precipitous aspect. its top is perfectly flat, and the whole region is steril, nothing growing upon it except a few stunted shrubs. nightingale island, the smallest and most southerly, is in latitude <UNK> <UNK> s., longitude <UNK> <UNK> w. off its southern extremity is a high ledge of rocky islets; a few also of a similar appearance are seen to the northeast. the ground is irregular and steril, and a deep valley partially separates it. the shores of these islands abound, in the proper season, with sea lions, sea elephants, the hair and fur seal, together with a great variety of oceanic birds. whales are also plenty in their vicinity. owing to the ease with which these various animals were here formerly taken, the group has been much visited since its discovery. the dutch and french frequented it at a very early period. in <UNK> captain patten, of the ship industry, of philadelphia, made tristan d'acunha, where he remained seven months (from august, <UNK> to april, <UNK> for the purpose of collecting sealskins. in this time he gathered no less than five thousand six hundred, and says that he would have had no difficulty in loading a large ship with oil in three weeks. upon his arrival he found no quadrupeds, with the exception of a few wild goats--the island now abounds with all our most valuable domestic animals, which have been introduced by subsequent navigators. i believe it was not long after captain patten's visit that captain colquhoun, of the american brig betsey, touched at the largest of the islands for the purpose of refreshment. he planted onions, potatoes, cabbages, and a great many other vegetables, an abundance of all which are now to be met with. in <UNK> a captain heywood, in the nereus, visited tristan. he found there three americans, who were residing upon the islands to prepare sealskins and oil. one of these men was named jonathan lambert, and he called himself the sovereign of the country. he had cleared and cultivated about sixty acres of land, and turned his attention to raising the coffee-plant and sugar-cane, with which he had been furnished by the american minister at rio janeiro. this settlement, however, was finally abandoned, and in <UNK> the islands were taken possession of by the british government, who sent a detachment for that purpose from the cape of good hope. they did not, however, retain them long; but, upon the evacuation of the country as a british possession, two or three english families took up their residence there independently of the government. on the twenty-fifth of march, <UNK> the berwick, captain jeffrey, from london to van diemen's land, arrived at the place, where they found an englishman of the name of glass, formerly a corporal in the british artillery. he claimed to be supreme governor of the islands, and had under his control twenty-one men and three women. he gave a very favourable account of the salubrity of the climate and of the productiveness of the soil. the population occupied themselves chiefly in collecting sealskins and sea elephant oil, with which they traded to the cape of good hope, glass owning a small schooner. at the period of our arrival the governor was still a resident, but his little community had multiplied, there being fifty-six persons upon tristan, besides a smaller settlement of seven on nightingale island. we had no difficulty in procuring almost every kind of refreshment which we required--sheep, hogs, bullocks, rabbits, poultry, goats, fish in great variety, and vegetables were abundant. having come to anchor close in with the large island, in eighteen fathoms, we took all we wanted on board very conveniently. captain guy also purchased of glass five hundred sealskins and some ivory. we remained here a week, during which the prevailing winds were from the northward and westward, and the weather somewhat hazy. on the fifth of november we made sail to the southward and westward, with the intention of having a thorough search for a group of islands called the auroras, respecting whose existence a great diversity of opinion has existed. these islands are said to have been discovered as early as <UNK> by the commander of the ship aurora. in <UNK> captain manuel de oyarvido, in the ship princess, belonging to the royal philippine company, sailed, as he asserts, directly among them. in <UNK> the spanish corvette atrevida went with the determination of ascertaining their precise situation, and, in a paper published by the royal hydrographical society of madrid in the year <UNK> the following language is used respecting this expedition. "the corvette atrevida practised, in their immediate vicinity, from the twenty-first to the twenty-seventh of january, all the necessary observations, and measured by chronometers the difference of longitude between these islands and the port of soledad in the malninas. the islands are three; they are very nearly in the same meridian; the centre one is rather low, and the other two may be seen at nine leagues distance." the observations made on board the atrevida give the following results as the precise situation of each island. the most northern is in latitude <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> s., longitude <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> w.; the middle one in latitude <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> s., longitude <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> w.; and the most southern in latitude <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> s., longitude <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> w. on the twenty-seventh of january, <UNK> captain james weddel, of the british navy, sailed from staten land also in search of the auroras. he reports that, having made the most diligent search, and passed not only immediately over the spots indicated by the commander of the atrevida, but in every direction throughout the vicinity of these spots, he could discover no indication of land. these conflicting statements have induced other navigators to look out for the islands; and, strange to say, while some have sailed through every inch of sea where they are supposed to lie without finding them, there have been not a few who declare positively that they have seen them, and even been close in with their shores. it was captain guy's intention to make every exertion within his power to settle the question so oddly in <UNK> [footnote <UNK> among the vessels which at various times have professed to meet with the auroras may be mentioned the ship san miguel, in <UNK> the ship aurora, in <UNK> the brig pearl, in <UNK> and the ship dolores, in <UNK> they all agree in giving the mean latitude fifty-three degrees south.] we kept on our course, between the south and west, with variable weather, until the twentieth of the month, when we found ourselves on the debated ground, being in latitude <UNK> <UNK> s., longitude <UNK> <UNK> w.--that is to say, very nearly upon the spot indicated as the situation of the most southern of the group. not perceiving any sign of land, we continued to the westward in the parallel of fifty-three degrees south, as far as the meridian of fifty degrees west. we then stood to the north as far as the parallel of fifty-two degrees south, when we turned to the eastward, and kept our parallel by double altitudes, morning and evening, and meridian altitudes of the planets and moon. having thus gone eastwardly to the meridian of the western coast of georgia, we kept that meridian until we were in the latitude from which we set out. we then took diagonal courses throughout the entire extent of sea circumscribed, keeping a lookout constantly at the masthead, and repeating our examination with the greatest care for a period of three weeks, during which the weather was remarkably pleasant and fair, with no haze whatsoever. of course we were thoroughly satisfied that, whatever islands might have existed in this vicinity at any former period, no vestige of them remained at the present day. since my return home i find that the same ground was traced over with equal care in <UNK> by captain johnson, of the american schooner henry, and by captain morrell, in the american schooner wasp--in both cases with the same result as in our own. chapter xvi. it had been captain guy's original intention, after satisfying himself about the auroras, to proceed through the strait of magellan, and up along the western coast of patagonia; but information received at tristan d'acunha induced him to steer to the southward, in the hope of falling in with some small islands said to lie about the parallel of <UNK> s., longitude <UNK> <UNK> w. in the event of his not discovering these lands, he designed, should the season prove favourable, to push on towards the pole. accordingly, on the twelfth of december, we made sail in that direction. on the eighteenth we found ourselves about the station indicated by glass, and cruised for three days in that neighbourhood without finding any traces of the islands he had mentioned. on the twenty-first, the weather being unusually pleasant, we again made sail to the southward, with the resolution of penetrating in that course as far as possible. before entering upon this portion of my narrative, it may be as well, for the information of those readers who have paid little attention to the progress of discovery in these regions, to give some brief account of the very few attempts at reaching the southern pole which have hitherto been made. that of captain cook was the first of which we have any distinct account. in <UNK> he sailed to the south in the resolution, accompanied by lieutenant furneaux in the adventure. in december he found himself as far as the fifty-eighth parallel of south latitude, and in longitude <UNK> <UNK> e. here he met with narrow fields of ice, about eight or ten inches thick, and running northwest and southeast. this ice was in large cakes, and usually it was packed so closely that the vessels had great difficulty in forcing a passage. at this period captain cook supposed, from the vast number of birds to be seen, and from other indications, that he was in the near vicinity of land. he kept on to the southward, the weather being exceedingly cold, until he reached the sixty-fourth parallel, in longitude <UNK> <UNK> e. here he had mild weather, with gentle breezes, for five days, the thermometer being at thirty-six. in january, <UNK> the vessels crossed the antarctic circle, but did not succeed in penetrating much farther; for, upon reaching latitude <UNK> <UNK> they found all farther progress impeded by an immense body of ice, extending all along the southern horizon as far as the eye could reach. this ice was of every variety--and some large floes of it, miles in extent, formed a compact mass, rising eighteen or twenty feet above the water. it being late in the season, and no hope entertained of rounding these obstructions, captain cook now reluctantly turned to the northward. in the november following he renewed his search in the antarctic. in latitude <UNK> <UNK> he met with a strong current setting to the southward. in december, when the vessels were in latitude <UNK> <UNK> longitude <UNK> <UNK> w., the cold was excessive, with heavy gales and fog. here also birds were abundant; the albatross, the penguin, and the peterel especially. in latitude <UNK> <UNK> some large islands of ice were encountered, and shortly afterward, the clouds to the southward were observed to be of a snowy whiteness, indicating the vicinity of field ice. in latitude <UNK> <UNK> longitude <UNK> <UNK> w., the navigators were stopped, as before, by an immense frozen expanse, which filled the whole area of the southern horizon. the northern edge of this expanse was ragged and broken, so firmly wedged together as to be utterly impassable, and extending about a mile to the southward. behind it the frozen surface was comparatively smooth for some distance, until terminated in the extreme back-ground by gigantic ranges of ice mountains, the one towering above the other. captain cook concluded that this vast field reached the southern pole or was joined to a continent. mr. j. n. reynolds, whose great exertions and perseverance have at length succeeded in getting set on foot a national expedition, partly for the purpose of exploring these regions, thus speaks of the attempt of the resolution. "we are not surprised that captain cook was unable to go beyond <UNK> <UNK> but we are astonished that he did attain that point on the meridian of <UNK> <UNK> west longitude. palmer's land lies south of the shetland, latitude sixty-four degrees, and tends to the southward and westward farther than any navigator has yet penetrated. cook was standing for this land when his progress was arrested by the ice; which, we apprehend, must always be the case in that point, and so early in the season as the sixth of january--and we should not be surprised if a portion of the icy mountains described was attached to the main body of palmer's land, or to some other portions of land lying farther to the southward and westward." in <UNK> captains kreutzenstern and lisiausky were despatched by alexander of russia for the purpose of circumnavigating the globe. in endeavouring to get south, they made no farther than <UNK> <UNK> in longitude <UNK> <UNK> w. they here met with strong currents setting eastwardly. whales were abundant, but they saw no ice. in regard to this voyage, mr. reynolds observes that, if kreutzenstern had arrived where he did earlier in the season, he must have encountered ice--it was march when he reached the latitude specified. the winds prevailing, as they do, from the southward and westward, had carried the floes, aided by currents, into that icy region bounded on the north by georgia, east by sandwich land and the south orkneys, and west by the south shetland islands. in <UNK> captain james weddell, of the british navy, with two very small vessels, penetrated farther to the south than any previous navigator, and this too, without encountering extraordinary difficulties. he states that although he was frequently hemmed in by ice _before_ reaching the seventy-second parallel, yet, upon attaining it, not a particle was to be discovered, and that, upon arriving at the latitude of <UNK> <UNK> no fields, and only three islands of ice were visible. it is somewhat remarkable that, although vast flocks of birds were seen, and other usual indications of land, and although, south of the shetlands, unknown coasts were observed from the masthead tending southwardly, weddell discourages the idea of land existing in the polar regions of the south. on the eleventh of january, <UNK> captain benjamin morrell, of the american schooner wasp, sailed from kerguelen's land with a view of penetrating as far south as possible. on the first of february he found himself in latitude <UNK> <UNK> s., longitude <UNK> <UNK> e. the following passage is extracted from his journal of that date. "the wind soon freshened to an eleven-knot breeze, and we embraced this opportunity of making to the west; being however convinced that the farther we went south beyond latitude sixty-four degrees the less ice was to be apprehended, we steered a little to the southward, until we crossed the antarctic circle, and were in latitude <UNK> <UNK> e. in this latitude there was _no field ice_, and very few ice islands in sight." under the date of march fourteenth i find also this entry. "the sea was now entirely free of field ice, and there were not more than a dozen ice islands in sight. at the same time the temperature of the air and water was at least thirteen degrees higher (more mild) than we had ever found it between the parallels of sixty and sixty-two south. we were now in latitude <UNK> <UNK> s., and the temperature of the air was forty-seven, and that of the water forty-four. in this situation i found the variation to be <UNK> <UNK> easterly, per azimuth.... i have several times passed within the antarctic circle on different meridians, and have uniformly found the temperature, both of the air and the water, to become more and more mild the farther i advanced beyond the sixty-fifth degree of south latitude, and that the variation decreases in the same proportion. while north of this latitude, say between sixty and sixty-five south, we frequently had great difficulty in finding a passage for the vessel between the immense and almost innumerable ice islands, some of which were from one to two miles in circumference, and more than five hundred feet above the surface of the water." being nearly destitute of fuel and water, and without proper instruments, it being also late in the season, captain morrell was now obliged to put back, without attempting any farther progress to the southward, although an entirely open sea lay before him. he expresses the opinion that, had not these overruling considerations obliged him to retreat, he could have penetrated, if not to the pole itself, at least to the eighty-fifth parallel. i have given his ideas respecting these matters somewhat at length, that the reader may have an opportunity of seeing how far they were borne out by my own subsequent experience. in <UNK> captain briscoe, in the employ of the messieurs enderby, whale-ship owners of london, sailed in the brig lively for the south seas, accompanied by the cutter tula. on the twenty-eighth of february, being in latitude <UNK> <UNK> s., longitude <UNK> <UNK> e., he descried land, and "clearly discovered through the snow the black peaks of a range of mountains running e. s. e." he remained in this neighbourhood during the whole of the following month, but was unable to approach the coast nearer than within ten leagues, owing to the boisterous state of the weather. finding it impossible to make farther discovery during this season, he returned northward to winter in van diemen's land. in the beginning of <UNK> he again proceeded southwardly, and on the fourth of february land was seen to the southeast in latitude <UNK> <UNK> longitude <UNK> <UNK> w. this was soon found to be an island near the headland of the country he had first discovered. on the twenty-first of the month he succeeded in landing on the latter, and took possession of it in the name of william iv., calling it adelaide's island, in honour of the english queen. these particulars being made known to the royal geographical society of london, the conclusion was drawn by that body "that there is a continuous tract of land extending from <UNK> <UNK> e. to <UNK> <UNK> w. longitude, running the parallel of from sixty-six to sixty-seven degrees south latitude." in respect to this conclusion mr. reynolds observes, "in the correctness of it we by no means concur; nor do the discoveries of briscoe warrant any such inference. it was within these limits that weddell proceeded south on a meridian to the east of georgia, sandwich land, and the south orkney and shetland islands." my own experience will be found to testify most directly to the falsity of the conclusion arrived at by the society. these are the principal attempts which have been made at penetrating to a high southern latitude, and it will now be seen that there remained, previous to the voyage of the jane, nearly three hundred degrees of longitude in which the antarctic circle had not been crossed at all. of course a wide field lay before us for discovery, and it was with feelings of most intense interest that i heard captain guy express his resolution of pushing boldly to the southward. chapter xvii. we kept our course southwardly for four days after giving up the search for glass's islands, without meeting with any ice at all. on the twenty-sixth, at noon, we were in latitude <UNK> <UNK> s., longitude <UNK> <UNK> w. we now saw several large ice islands, and a floe of field ice, not, however, of any great extent. the winds generally blew from the southeast, or the northeast, but were very light. whenever we had a westerly wind, which was seldom, it was invariably attended with a rain squall. every day we had more or less snow. the thermometer, on the twenty-seventh, stood at thirty-five. _january <UNK> <UNK> this day we found ourselves completely hemmed in by the ice, and our prospects looked cheerless indeed. a strong gale blew, during the whole forenoon, from the northeast, and drove large cakes of the drift against the rudder and counter with such violence that we all trembled for the consequences. towards evening, the gale still blowing with fury, a large field in front separated, and we were enabled, by carrying a press of sail, to force a passage through the smaller flakes into some open water beyond. as we approached this space we took in sail by degrees, and having at length got clear, lay to under a single reefed foresail. _january <UNK> we had now tolerably pleasant weather. at noon we found ourselves in latitude <UNK> <UNK> s., longitude <UNK> <UNK> w., having crossed the antarctic circle. very little ice was to be seen to the southward, although large fields of it lay behind us. this day we rigged some sounding gear, using a large iron pot capable of holding twenty gallons, and a line of two hundred fathoms. we found the current setting to the north, about a quarter of a mile per hour. the temperature of the air was now about thirty-three. here we found the variation to be <UNK> <UNK> easterly, per azimuth. _january <UNK> we had still held on to the southward without any very great impediments. on this morning, however, being in latitude <UNK> <UNK> e., longitude <UNK> <UNK> w., we were again brought to a stand by an immense expanse of firm ice. we saw, nevertheless, much open water to the southward, and felt no doubt of being able to reach it eventually. standing to the eastward along the edge of the floe, we at length came to a passage of about a mile in width, through which we warped our way by sundown. the sea in which we now were was thickly covered with ice islands, but had no field ice, and we pushed on boldly as before. the cold did not seem to increase, although we had snow very frequently, and now and then hail squalls of great violence. immense flocks of the albatross flew over the schooner this day, going from southeast to northwest. _january <UNK> the sea still remained pretty well open, so that we had no difficulty in holding on our course. to the westward we saw some icebergs of incredible size, and in the afternoon passed very near one whose summit could not have been less than four hundred fathoms from the surface of the ocean. its girth was probably, at the base, three quarters of a league, and several streams of water were running from crevices in its sides. we remained in sight of this island two days, and then only lost it in a fog. _january <UNK> early this morning we had the misfortune to lose a man overboard. he was an american, named peter vredenburgh, a native of new-york, and was one of the most valuable hands on board the schooner. in going over the bows his foot slipped, and he fell between two cakes of ice, never rising again. at noon of this day we were in latitude <UNK> <UNK> longitude <UNK> <UNK> w. the cold was now excessive, and we had hail squalls continually from the northward and eastward. in this direction also we saw several more immense icebergs, and the whole horizon to the eastward appeared to be blocked up with field ice, rising in tiers, one mass above the other. some driftwood floated by during the evening, and a great quantity of birds flew over, among which were nellies, peterels, albatrosses, and a large bird of a brilliant blue plumage. the variation here, per azimuth, was less than it had been previously to our passing the antarctic circle. _january <UNK> our passage to the south again looked doubtful, as nothing was to be seen in the direction of the pole but one apparently limitless floe, backed by absolute mountains of ragged ice, one precipice of which arose frowningly above the other. we stood to the westward until the fourteenth, in the hope of finding an entrance. _january <UNK> this morning we reached the western extremity of the field which had impeded us, and, weathering it, came to an open sea, without a particle of ice. upon sounding with two hundred fathoms, we here found a current setting southwardly at the rate of half a mile per hour. the temperature of the air was forty-seven, that of the water thirty-four. we now sailed to the southward, without meeting any interruption of moment until the sixteenth, when, at noon, we were in latitude <UNK> <UNK> longitude <UNK> w. we here again sounded, and found a current setting still southwardly, and at the rate of three quarters of a mile per hour. the variation per azimuth had diminished, and the temperature of the air was mild and pleasant, the thermometer being as high as fifty-one. at this period not a particle of ice was to be discovered. all hands on board now felt certain of attaining the pole. _january <UNK> this day was full of incident. innumerable flights of birds flew over us from the southward, and several were shot from the deck; one of them, a species of pelican, proved to be excellent eating. about midday a small floe of ice was seen from the masthead off the larboard bow, and upon it there appeared to be some large animal. as the weather was good and nearly calm, captain guy ordered out two of the boats to see what it was. dirk peters and myself accompanied the mate in the larger boat. upon coming up with the floe, we perceived that it was in the possession of a gigantic creature of the race of the arctic bear, but far exceeding in size the largest of these animals. being well armed, we made no scruple of attacking it at once. several shots were fired in quick succession, the most of which took effect, apparently, in the head and body. nothing discouraged, however, the monster threw himself from the ice, and swam, with open jaws, to the boat in which were peters and myself. owing to the confusion which ensued among us at this unexpected turn of the adventure, no person was ready immediately with a second shot, and the bear had actually succeeded in getting half his vast bulk across our gunwale, and seizing one of the men by the small of his back, before any efficient means were taken to repel him. in this extremity nothing but the promptness and agility of peters saved us from destruction. leaping upon the back of the huge beast, he plunged the blade of a knife behind the neck, reaching the spinal marrow at a blow. the brute tumbled into the sea lifeless, and without a struggle, rolling over peters as he fell. the latter soon recovered himself, and a rope being thrown him, he secured the carcass before entering the boat. we then returned in triumph to the schooner, towing our trophy behind us. this bear, upon admeasurement, proved to be full fifteen feet in his greatest length. his wool was perfectly white, and very coarse, curling tightly. the eyes were of a blood red, and larger than those of the arctic bear--the snout also more rounded, rather resembling the snout of the bulldog. the meat was tender, but excessively rank and fishy, although the men devoured it with avidity, and declared it excellent eating. scarcely had we got our prize alongside, when the man at the masthead gave the joyful shout of _"land on the starboard bow!"_ all hands were now upon the alert, and, a breeze springing up very opportunely from the northward and eastward, we were soon close in with the coast. it proved to be a low rocky islet, of about a league in circumference, and altogether destitute of vegetation, if we except a species of prickly pear. in approaching it from the northward, a singular ledge of rock is seen projecting into the sea, and bearing a strong resemblance to corded bales of cotton. around this ledge to the westward is a small bay, at the bottom of which our boats effected a convenient landing. it did not take us long to explore every portion of the island, but, with one exception, we found nothing worthy of observation. in the southern extremity, we picked up near the shore, half buried in a pile of loose stones, a piece of wood, which seemed to have formed the prow of a canoe. there had been evidently some attempt at carving upon it, and captain guy fancied that he made out the figure of a tortoise, but the resemblance did not strike me very forcibly. besides this prow, if such it were, we found no other token that any living creature had ever been here before. around the coast we discovered occasional small floes of ice--but these were very few. the exact situation of this islet (to which captain guy gave the name of bennet's islet, in honour of his partner in the ownership of the schooner) is <UNK> <UNK> s. latitude, <UNK> <UNK> w. longitude. we had now advanced to the southward more than eight degrees farther than any previous navigators, and the sea still lay perfectly open before us. we found, too, that the variation uniformly decreased as we proceeded, and, what was still more surprising, that the temperature of the air, and latterly of the water, became milder. the weather might even be called pleasant, and we had a steady but very gentle breeze always from some northern point of the compass. the sky was usually clear, with now and then a slight appearance of thin vapour in the southern horizon--this, however, was invariably of brief duration. two difficulties alone presented themselves to our view; we were getting short of fuel, and symptoms of scurvy had occurred among several of the crew. these considerations began to impress upon captain guy the necessity of returning, and he spoke of it frequently. for my own part, confident as i was of soon arriving at land of some description upon the course we were pursuing, and having every reason to believe, from present appearances, that we should not find it the steril soil met with in the higher arctic latitudes, i warmly pressed upon him the expediency of persevering, at least for a few days longer, in the direction we were now holding. so tempting an opportunity of solving the great problem in regard to an antarctic continent had never yet been afforded to man, and i confess that i felt myself bursting with indignation at the timid and ill-timed suggestions of our commander. i believe, indeed, that what i could not refrain from saying to him on this head had the effect of inducing him to push on. while, therefore, i cannot but lament the most unfortunate and bloody events which immediately arose from my advice, i must still be allowed to feel some degree of gratification at having been instrumental, however remotely, in opening to the eye of science one of the most intensely exciting secrets which has ever engrossed its attention. chapter xviii. _january <UNK> this <UNK> we continued to the southward, with the same pleasant weather as before. the sea was entirely smooth, the air tolerably warm and from the northeast, the temperature of the water fifty-three. we now again got our sounding-gear in order, and, with a hundred and fifty fathoms of line, found the current setting towards the pole at the rate of a mile an hour. this constant tendency to the southward, both in the wind and current, caused some degree of speculation, and even of alarm, in different quarters of the schooner, and i saw distinctly that no little impression had been made upon the mind of captain guy. he was exceedingly sensitive to ridicule, however, and i finally succeeded in laughing him out of his apprehensions. the variation was now very trivial. in the course of the day we saw several large whales of the right species, and innumerable flights of the albatross passed over the vessel. we also picked up a bush, full of red berries, like those of the hawthorn, and the carcass of a singular-looking land-animal. it was three feet in length, and but six inches in height, with four very short legs, the feet armed with long claws of a brilliant scarlet, and resembling coral in substance. the body was covered with a straight silky hair, perfectly white. the tail was peaked like that of a rat, and about a foot and a half long. the head resembled a cat's, with the exception of the ears--these were flapped like the ears of a dog. the _teeth_ were of the same brilliant scarlet as the claws. [footnote <UNK> the terms _morning_ and _evening_, which i have made use of to avoid confusion in my narrative, as far as possible, must not, of course, be taken in their ordinary sense. for a long time past we had had no night at all, the daylight being continual. the dates throughout are according to nautical time, and the bearings must be understood as per compass. i would also remark in this place, that i cannot, in the first portion of what is here written, pretend to strict accuracy in respect to dates, or latitudes and longitudes, having kept no regular journal until after the period of which this first portion treats. in many instances i have relied altogether upon memory.] _january <UNK> to-day, being in latitude <UNK> <UNK> longitude <UNK> <UNK> w. (the sea being of an extraordinarily dark colour), we again saw land from the masthead, and, upon a closer scrutiny, found it to be one of a group of very large islands. the shore was precipitous, and the interior seemed to be well wooded, a circumstance which occasioned us great joy. in about four hours from our first discovering the land we came to anchor in ten fathoms, sandy bottom, a league from the coast, as a high surf, with strong ripples here and there, rendered a nearer approach of doubtful expediency. the two largest boats were now ordered out, and a party, well armed (among whom were peters and myself), proceeded to look for an opening in the reef which appeared to encircle the island. after searching about for some time, we discovered an inlet, which we were entering, when we saw four large canoes put off from the shore, filled with men who seemed to be well armed. we waited for them to come up, and, as they moved with great rapidity, they were soon within hail. captain guy now held up a white handkerchief on the blade of an oar, when the strangers made a full stop, and commenced a loud jabbering all at once, intermingled with occasional shouts, in which we could distinguish the words _anamoo-moo!_ and _lama-lama!_ they continued this for at least half an hour, during which we had a good opportunity of observing their appearance. in the four canoes, which might have been fifty feet long and five broad, there were a hundred and ten savages in all. they were about the ordinary stature of europeans, but of a more muscular and brawny frame. their complexion a jet black, with thick and long woolly hair. they were clothed in skins of an unknown black animal, shaggy and silky, and made to fit the body with some degree of skill, the hair being inside, except where turned out about the neck, wrists, and ankles. their arms consisted principally of clubs, of a dark, and apparently very heavy wood. some spears, however, were observed among them, headed with flint, and a few slings. the bottoms of the canoes were full of black stones about the size of a large egg. when they had concluded their harangue (for it was clear they intended their jabbering for such), one of them who seemed to be the chief stood up in the prow of his canoe, and made signs for us to bring our boats alongside of him. this hint we pretended not to understand, thinking it the wiser plan to maintain, if possible, the interval between us, as their number more than quadrupled our own. finding this to be the case, the chief ordered the three other canoes to hold back, while he advanced towards us with his own. as soon as he came up with us he leaped on board the largest of our boats, and seated himself by the side of captain guy, pointing at the same time to the schooner, and repeating the words _anamoo-moo!_ and _lama-lama!_ we now put back to the vessel, the four canoes following at a little distance. upon getting alongside the chief evinced symptoms of extreme surprise and delight, clapping his hands, slapping his thighs and breast, and laughing obstreperously. his followers behind joined in his merriment, and for some minutes the din was so excessive as to be absolutely deafening. quiet being at length restored, captain guy ordered the boats to be hoisted up, as a necessary precaution, and gave the chief (whose name we soon found to be _too-wit_) to understand that we could admit no more than twenty of his men on deck at one time. with this arrangement he appeared perfectly satisfied, and gave some directions to the canoes, when one of them approached, the rest remaining about fifty yards off. twenty of the savages now got on board, and proceeded to ramble over every part of the deck, and scramble about among the rigging, making themselves much at home, and examining every article with great inquisitiveness. it was quite evident that they had never before seen any of the white race--from whose complexion, indeed, they appeared to recoil. they believed the jane to be a living creature, and seemed to be afraid of hurting it with the points of their spears, carefully turning them up. our crew were much amused with the conduct of too-wit in one instance. the cook was splitting some wood near the galley, and, by accident, struck his axe into the deck, making a gash of considerable depth. the chief immediately ran up, and pushing the cook on one side rather roughly, commenced a half whine, half howl, strongly indicative of sympathy in what he considered the sufferings of the schooner, patting and smoothing the gash with his hand, and washing it from a bucket of seawater which stood by. this was a degree of ignorance for which we were not prepared, and for my part i could not help thinking some of it affected. when the visiters had satisfied, as well as they could, their curiosity in regard to our upper works, they were admitted below, when their amazement exceeded all bounds. their astonishment now appeared to be far too deep for words, for they roamed about in silence, broken only by low ejaculations. the arms afforded them much food for speculation, and they were suffered to handle and examine them at leisure. i do not believe that they had the least suspicion of their actual use, but rather took them for idols, seeing the care we had of them, and the attention with which we watched their movements while handling them. at the great guns their wonder was redoubled. they approached them with every mark of the profoundest reverence and awe, but forbore to examine them minutely. there were two large mirrors in the cabin, and here was the acme of their amazement. too-wit was the first to approach them, and he had got in the middle of the cabin, with his face to one and his back to the other, before he fairly perceived them. upon raising his eyes and seeing his reflected self in the glass, i thought the savage would go mad; but, upon turning short round to make a retreat, and beholding himself a second time in the opposite direction, i was afraid he would expire upon the spot. no persuasions could prevail upon him to take another look; but, throwing himself upon the floor, with his face buried in his hands, he remained thus until we were obliged to drag him upon deck. the whole of the savages were admitted on board in this manner, twenty at a time, too-wit being suffered to remain during the entire period. we saw no disposition to thievery among them, nor did we miss a single article after their departure. throughout the whole of their visit they evinced the most friendly manner. there were, however, some points in their demeanour which we found it impossible to understand: for example, we could not get them to approach several very harmless objects--such as the schooner's sails, an egg, an open book, or a pan of flour. we endeavoured to ascertain if they had among them any articles which might be turned to account in the way of traffic, but found great difficulty in being comprehended. we made out, nevertheless, what greatly astonished us, that the islands abounded in the large tortoise of the gallipagos, one of which we saw in the canoe of too-wit. we saw also some _biche de mer_ in the hands of one of the savages, who was greedily devouring it in its natural state. these anomalies, for they were such when considered in regard to the latitude, induced captain guy to wish for a thorough investigation of the country, in the hope of making a profitable speculation in his discovery. for my own part, anxious as i was to know something more of these islands, i was still more earnestly bent on prosecuting the voyage to the southward without delay. we had now fine weather, but there was no telling how long it would last; and being already in the eighty-fourth parallel, with an open sea before us, a current setting strongly to the southward, and the wind fair, i could not listen with any patience to a proposition of stopping longer than was absolutely necessary for the health of the crew and the taking on board a proper supply of fuel and fresh provisions. i represented to the captain that we might easily make this group on our return, and winter here in the event of being blocked up by the ice. he at length came into my views (for in some way, hardly known to myself, i had acquired much influence over him), and it was finally resolved that, even in the event of our finding _biche de mer_, we should only stay here a week to recruit, and then push on to the southward while we might. accordingly we made every necessary preparation, and, under the guidance of too-wit, got the jane through the reef in safety, coming to anchor about a mile from the shore, in an excellent bay, completely landlocked, on the southeastern coast of the main island, and in ten fathoms of water, black sandy bottom. at the head of this bay there were three fine springs (we were told) of good water, and we saw abundance of wood in the vicinity. the four canoes followed us in, keeping, however, at a respectful distance. too-wit himself remained on board, and, upon our dropping anchor, invited us to accompany him on shore, and visit his village in the interior. to this captain guy consented; and ten savages being left on board as hostages, a party of us, twelve in all, got in readiness to attend the chief. we took care to be well armed, yet without evincing any distrust. the schooner had her guns run out, her boarding-nettings up, and every other proper precaution was taken to guard against surprise. directions were left with the chief mate to admit no person on board during our absence, and, in the event of our not appearing in twelve hours, to send the cutter, with a swivel, round the island in search of us. at every step we took inland the conviction forced itself upon us that we were in a country differing essentially from any hitherto visited by civilized men. we saw nothing with which we had been formerly conversant. the trees resembled no growth of either the torrid, the temperate, or the northern frigid zones, and were altogether unlike those of the lower southern latitudes we had already traversed. the very rocks were novel in their mass, their colour, and their stratification; and the streams themselves, utterly incredible as it may appear, had so little in common with those of other climates, that we were scrupulous of tasting them, and, indeed, had difficulty in bringing ourselves to believe that their qualities were purely those of nature. at a small brook which crossed our path (the first we had reached) too-wit and his attendants halted to drink. on account of the singular character of the water, we refused to taste it, supposing it to be polluted; and it was not until some time afterward we came to understand that such was the appearance of the streams throughout the whole group. i am at a loss to give a distinct idea of the nature of this liquid, and cannot do so without many words. although it flowed with rapidity in all declivities where common water would do so, yet never, except when falling in a cascade, had it the customary appearance of _limpidity_. it was, nevertheless, in point of fact, as perfectly limpid as any limestone water in existence, the difference being only in appearance. at first sight, and especially in cases where little declivity was found, it bore resemblance, as regards consistency, to a thick infusion of gum arabic in common water. but this was only the least remarkable of its extraordinary qualities. it was _not_ colourless, nor was it of any one uniform colour--presenting to the eye, as it flowed, every possible shade of purple, like the hues of a changeable silk. this variation in shade was produced in a manner which excited as profound astonishment in the minds of our party as the mirror had done in the case of too-wit. upon collecting a basinful, and allowing it to settle thoroughly, we perceived that the whole mass of liquid was made up of a number of distinct veins, each of a distinct hue; that these veins did not commingle; and that their cohesion was perfect in regard to their own particles among themselves, and imperfect in regard to neighbouring veins. upon passing the blade of a knife athwart the veins, the water closed over it immediately, as with us, and also, in withdrawing it, all traces of the passage of the knife were instantly obliterated. if, however, the blade was passed down accurately between two veins, a perfect separation was effected, which the power of cohesion did not immediately rectify. the phenomena of this water formed the first definite link in that vast chain of apparent miracles with which i was destined to be at length encircled. chapter xix. we were nearly three hours in reaching the village, it being more than nine miles in the interior, and the path lying through a rugged country. as we passed along, the party of too-wit (the whole hundred and ten savages of the canoes) was momentarily strengthened by smaller detachments, of from two to six or seven, which joined us, as if by accident, at different turns in the road. there appeared so much of system in this that i could not help feeling distrust, and i spoke to captain guy of my apprehensions. it was now too late, however, to recede, and we concluded that our best security lay in evincing a perfect confidence in the good faith of too-wit. we accordingly went on, keeping a wary eye upon the manoeuvres of the savages, and not permitting them to divide our numbers by pushing in between. in this way, passing through a precipitous ravine, we at length reached what we were told was the only collection of habitations upon the island. as we came in sight of them, the chief set up a shout, and frequently repeated the word _klock-klock_; which we supposed to be the name of the village, or perhaps the generic name for villages. the dwellings were of the most miserable description imaginable, and, unlike those of even the lowest of the savage races with which mankind are acquainted, were of no uniform plan. some of them (and these we found belonged to the _wampoos_ or _yampoos_, the great men of the land) consisted of a tree cut down at about four feet from the root, with a large black skin thrown over it, and hanging in loose folds upon the ground. under this the savage nestled. others were formed by means of rough limbs of trees, with the withered foliage upon them, made to recline, at an angle of forty-five degrees, against a bank of clay, heaped up, without regular form, to the height of five or six feet. others, again, were mere holes dug in the earth perpendicularly, and covered over with similar branches, these being removed when the tenant was about to enter, and pulled on again when he had entered. a few were built among the forked limbs of trees as they stood, the upper limbs being partially cut through, so as to bend over upon the lower, thus forming thicker shelter from the weather. the greater number, however, consisted of small shallow caverns, apparently scratched in the face of a precipitous ledge of dark stone, resembling fuller's earth, with which three sides of the village was bounded. at the door of each of these primitive caverns was a small rock, which the tenant carefully placed before the entrance upon leaving his residence, for what purpose i could not ascertain, as the stone itself was never of sufficient size to close up more than a third of the opening. this village, if it were worthy of the name, lay in a valley of some depth, and could only be approached from the southward, the precipitous ledge of which i have already spoken cutting off all access in other directions. through the middle of the valley ran a brawling stream of the same magical-looking water which has been described. we saw several strange animals about the dwellings, all appearing to be thoroughly domesticated. the largest of these creatures resembled our common hog in the structure of the body and snout; the tail, however, was bushy, and the legs slender as those of the antelope. its motion was exceedingly awkward and indecisive, and we never saw it attempt to run. we noticed also several animals very similar in appearance, but of a greater length of body, and covered with a black wool. there were a great variety of tame fowls running about, and these seemed to constitute the chief food of the natives. to our astonishment we saw black albatross among these birds in a state of entire domestication, going to sea periodically for food, but always returning to the village as a home, and using the southern shore in the vicinity as a place of incubation. there they were joined by their friends the pelicans as usual, but these latter never followed them to the dwellings of the savages. among the other kinds of tame fowls were ducks, differing very little from the canvass-back of our own country, black gannets, and a large bird not unlike the buzzard in appearance, but not carnivorous. of fish there seemed to be a great abundance. we saw, during our visit, a quantity of dried salmon, rock cod, blue dolphins, mackerel, blackfish, skate, conger eels, elephant-fish, mullets, soles, parrotfish, leather-jackets, gurnards, hake, flounders, paracutas, and innumerable other varieties. we noticed, too, that most of them were similar to the fish about the group of the lord auckland islands, in a latitude as low as fifty-one degrees south. the gallipago tortoise was also very plentiful. we saw but few wild animals, and none of a large size, or of a species with which we were familiar. one or two serpents of a formidable aspect crossed our path, but the natives paid them little attention, and we concluded that they were not venomous. as we approached the village with too-wit and his party, a vast crowd of the people rushed out to meet us, with loud shouts, among which we could only distinguish the everlasting _anamoo-moo!_ and _lama-lama!_ we were much surprised at perceiving that, with one or two exceptions, these new comers were entirely naked, the skins being used only by the men of the canoes. all the weapons of the country seemed also to be in the possession of the latter, for there was no appearance of any among the villagers. there were a great many women and children, the former not altogether wanting in what might be termed personal beauty. they were straight, tall, and well formed, with a grace and freedom of carriage not to be found in civilized society. their lips, however, like those of the men, were thick and clumsy, so that, even when laughing, the teeth were never disclosed. their hair was of a finer texture than that of the males. among these naked villagers there might have been ten or twelve who were clothed, like the party of too-wit, in dresses of black skin, and armed with lances and heavy clubs. these appeared to have great influence among the rest, and were always addressed by the title _wampoo_. these, too, were the tenants of the black skin palaces. that of too-wit was situated in the centre of the village, and was much larger and somewhat better constructed than others of its kind. the tree which formed its support was cut off at a distance of twelve feet or thereabout from the root, and there were several branches left just below the cut, these serving to extend the covering, and in this way prevent its flapping about the trunk. the covering, too, which consisted of four very large skins fastened together with wooden skewers, was secured at the bottom with pegs driven through it and into the ground. the floor was strewed with a quantity of dry leaves by way of carpet. to this hut we were conducted with great solemnity, and as many of the natives crowded in after us as possible. too-wit seated himself on the leaves, and made signs that we should follow his example. this we did, and presently found ourselves in a situation peculiarly uncomfortable, if not indeed critical. we were on the ground, twelve in number, with the savages, as many as forty, sitting on their hams so closely around us that, if any disturbance had arisen, we should have found it impossible to make use of our arms, or indeed to have risen on our feet. the pressure was not only inside the tent, but outside, where probably was every individual on the whole island, the crowd being prevented from trampling us to death only by the incessant exertions and vociferations of too-wit. our chief security lay, however, in the presence of too-wit himself among us, and we resolved to stick by him closely, as the best chance of extricating ourselves from the dilemma, sacrificing him immediately upon the first appearance of hostile design. after some trouble a certain degree of quiet was restored, when the chief addressed us in a speech of great length, and very nearly resembling the one delivered in the canoes, with the exception that the _anamoo-moos!_ were now somewhat more strenuously insisted upon than the _lama-lamas!_ we listened in profound silence until the conclusion of his harangue, when captain guy replied by assuring the chief of his eternal friendship and good-will, concluding what he had to say by a present of several strings of blue beads and a knife. at the former the monarch, much to our surprise, turned up his nose with some expression of contempt; but the knife gave him the most unlimited satisfaction, and he immediately ordered dinner. this was handed into the tent over the heads of the attendants, and consisted of the palpitating entrails of a species of unknown animal, probably one of the slim-legged hogs which we had observed in our approach to the village. seeing us at a loss how to proceed, he began, by way of setting us an example, to devour yard after yard of the enticing food, until we could positively stand it no longer, and evinced such manifest symptoms of rebellion of stomach as inspired his majesty with a degree of astonishment only inferior to that brought about by the looking-glasses. we declined, however, partaking of the delicacies before us, and endeavoured to make him understand that we had no appetite whatever, having just finished a hearty _déjeuner_. when the monarch had made an end of his meal, we commenced a series of cross-questioning in every ingenious manner we could devise, with a view of discovering what were the chief productions of the country, and whether any of them might be turned to profit. at length he seemed to have some idea of our meaning, and offered to accompany us to a part of the coast where he assured us the _biche de mer_ (pointing to a specimen of that animal) was to be found in great abundance. we were glad at this early opportunity of escaping from the oppression of the crowd, and signified our eagerness to proceed. we now left the tent, and, accompanied by the whole population of the village, followed the chief to the southeastern extremity of the island, not far from the bay where our vessel lay at anchor. we waited here for about an hour, until the four canoes were brought round by some of the savages to our station. the whole of our party then getting into one of them, we were paddled along the edge of the reef before mentioned, and of another still farther out, where we saw a far greater quantity of _biche de mer_ than the oldest seaman among us had ever seen in those groups of the lower latitudes most celebrated for this article of commerce. we stayed near these reefs only long enough to satisfy ourselves that we could easily load a dozen vessels with the animal if necessary, when we were taken alongside the schooner, and parted with too-wit after obtaining from him a promise that he would bring us, in the course of twenty-four hours, as many of the canvass-back ducks and gallipago tortoises as his canoes would hold. in the whole of this adventure we saw nothing in the demeanour of the natives calculated to create suspicion, with the single exception of the systematic manner in which their party was strengthened during our route from the schooner to the village. chapter xx. the chief was as good as his word, and we were soon plentifully supplied with fresh provision. we found the tortoises as fine as we had ever seen, and the ducks surpassed our best species of wild fowl, being exceedingly tender, juicy, and well-flavoured. besides these, the savages brought us, upon our making them comprehend our wishes, a vast quantity of brown celery and scurvy grass, with a canoe-load of fresh fish and some dried. the celery was a treat indeed, and the scurvy grass proved of incalculable benefit in restoring those of our men who had shown symptoms of disease. in a very short time we had not a single person on the sick-list. we had also plenty of other kinds of fresh provision, among which may be mentioned a species of shellfish resembling the muscle in shape, but with the taste of an oyster. shrimps, too, and prawns were abundant, and albatross and other birds' eggs with dark shells. we took in, too, a plentiful stock of the flesh of the hog which i have mentioned before. most of the men found it a palatable food, but i thought it fishy and otherwise disagreeable. in return for these good things we presented the natives with blue beads, brass trinkets, nails, knives, and pieces of red cloth, they being fully delighted in the exchange. we established a regular market on shore, just under the guns of the schooner, where our barterings were carried on with every appearance of good faith, and a degree of order which their conduct at the village of _klock-klock_ had not led us to expect from the savages. matters went on thus very amicably for several days, during which parties of the natives were frequently on board the schooner, and parties of our men frequently on shore, making long excursions into the interior, and receiving no molestation whatever. finding the ease with which the vessel might be loaded with _biche de mer_, owing to the friendly disposition of the islanders, and the readiness with which they would render us assistance in collecting it, captain guy resolved to enter into negotiation with too-wit for the erection of suitable houses in which to cure the article, and for the services of himself and tribe in gathering as much as possible, while he himself took advantage of the fine weather to prosecute his voyage to the southward. upon mentioning this project to the chief he seemed very willing to enter into an agreement. a bargain was accordingly struck, perfectly satisfactory to both parties, by which it was arranged that, after making the necessary preparations, such as laying off the proper grounds, erecting a portion of the buildings, and doing some other work in which the whole of our crew would be required, the schooner should proceed on her route, leaving three of her men on the island to superintend the fulfilment of the project, and instruct the natives in drying the _biche de mer_. in regard to terms, these were made to depend upon the exertions of the savages in our absence. they were to receive a stipulated quantity of blue beads, knives, red cloth, and so forth, for every certain number of piculs of the _biche de mer_ which should be ready on our return. a description of the nature of this important article of commerce, and the method of preparing it, may prove of some interest to my readers, and i can find no more suitable place than this for introducing an account of it. the following comprehensive notice of the substance is taken from a modern history of a voyage to the south seas. "it is that _mollusca_ from the indian seas which is known in commerce by the french name _bouche de mer_ (a nice morsel from the sea). if i am not much mistaken, the celebrated cuvier calls it _gasteropeda pulmonifera_. it is abundantly gathered in the coasts of the pacific islands, and gathered especially for the chinese market, where it commands a great price, perhaps as much as their much-talked of edible bird's nests, which are probably made up of the gelatinous matter picked up by a species of swallow from the body of these molluscæ. they have no shell, no legs, nor any prominent part, except an _absorbing_ and an _excretory_, opposite organs; but, by their elastic wings, like caterpillars or worms, they creep in shallow waters, in which, when low, they can be seen by a kind of swallow, the sharp bill of which, inserted in the soft animal, draws a gummy and filamentous substance, which, by drying, can be wrought into the solid walls of their nest. hence the name of _gasteropeda pulmonifera_. "this mollusca is oblong, and of different sizes, from three to eighteen inches in length; and i have seen a few that were not less than two feet long. they are nearly round, a little flattish on one side, which lies next the bottom of the sea; and they are from one to eight inches thick. they crawl up into shallow water at particular seasons of the year, probably for the purpose of gendering, as we often find them in pairs. it is when the sun has the most power on the water, rendering it tepid, that they approach the shore; and they often go up into places so shallow, that, on the tide's receding, they are left dry, exposed to the heat of the sun. but they do not bring forth their young in shallow water, as we never see any of their progeny, and the full-grown ones are always observed coming in from deep water. they feed principally on that class of zoophytes which produce the coral. "the _biche de mer_ is generally taken in three or four feet water; after which they are brought on shore, and split at one end with a knife, the incision being one inch or more, according to the size of the mollusca. through this opening the entrails are forced out by pressure, and they are much like those of any other small tenant of the deep. the article is then washed, and afterward boiled to a certain degree, which must not be too much or too little. they are then buried in the ground for four hours, then boiled again for a short time, after which they are dried, either by the fire or the sun. those cured by the sun are worth the most; but where one picul <UNK> lbs.) can be cured that way, i can cure thirty piculs by the fire. when once properly cured, they can be kept in a dry place for two or three years without any risk; but they should be examined once in every few months, say four times a year, to see if any dampness is likely to affect them. "the chinese, as before stated, consider _biche de mer_ a very great luxury, believing that it wonderfully strengthens and nourishes the system, and renews the exhausted system of the immoderate voluptuary. the first quality commands a high price in canton, being worth ninety dollars a picul; the second quality seventy-five dollars; the third fifty dollars; the fourth thirty dollars; the fifth twenty dollars; the sixth twelve dollars; the seventh eight dollars; and the eighth four dollars; small cargoes, however, will often bring more in manilla, singapore, and batavia." an agreement having been thus entered into, we proceeded immediately to land everything necessary for preparing the buildings and clearing the ground. a large flat space near the eastern shore of the bay was selected, where there was plenty both of wood and water, and within a convenient distance of the principal reefs on which the _biche de mer_ was to be procured. we now all set to work in good earnest, and soon, to the great astonishment of the savages, had felled a sufficient number of trees for our purpose, getting them quickly in order for the framework of the houses, which in two or three days were so far under way that we could safely trust the rest of the work to the three men whom we intended to leave behind. these were john carson, alfred harris, and ---- peterson (all natives of london, i believe), who volunteered their services in this respect. by the last of the month we had everything in readiness for departure. we had agreed, however, to pay a formal visit of leavestaking to the village, and too-wit insisted so pertinaciously upon our keeping the promise, that we did not think it advisable to run the risk of offending him by a final refusal. i believe that not one of us had at this time the slightest suspicion of the good faith of the savages. they had uniformly behaved with the greatest decorum, aiding us with alacrity in our work, offering us their commodities frequently without price, and never, in any instance, pilfering a single article, although the high value they set upon the goods we had with us was evident by the extravagant demonstrations of joy always manifested upon our making them a present. the women especially were most obliging in every respect, and, upon the whole, we should have been the most suspicious of human beings had we entertained a single thought of perfidy on the part of a people who treated us so well. a very short while sufficed to prove that this apparent kindness of disposition was only the result of a deeply-laid plan for our destruction, and that the islanders for whom we entertained such inordinate feelings of esteem were among the most barbarous, subtle, and bloodthirsty wretches that ever contaminated the face of the globe. it was on the first of february that we went on shore for the purpose of visiting the village. although, as said before, we entertained not the slightest suspicion, still no proper precaution was neglected. six men were left in the schooner with instructions to permit none of the savages to approach the vessel during our absence, under any pretence whatever, and to remain constantly on deck. the boarding-nettings were up, the guns double-shotted with grape and canister, and the swivels loaded with canisters of musket-balls. she lay, with her anchor apeak, about a mile from the shore, and no canoe could approach her in any direction without being distinctly seen and exposed to the full fire of our swivels immediately. the six men being left on board, our shore-party consisted of thirty-two persons in all. we were armed to the teeth, having with us muskets, pistols, and cutlasses, besides each a long kind of seaman's knife, somewhat resembling the bowie knife now so much used throughout our western and southern country. a hundred of the black skin warriors met us at the landing for the purpose of accompanying us on our way. we noticed, however, with some surprise, that they were now entirely without arms; and, upon questioning too-wit in relation to this circumstance, he merely answered that _mattee non we pa pa si_--meaning that there was no need of arms where all were brothers. we took this in good part, and proceeded. we had passed the spring and rivulet of which i before spoke, and were now entering upon a narrow gorge leading through the chain of soapstone hills among which the village was situated. this gorge was very rocky and uneven, so much so that it was with no little difficulty we scrambled through it on our first visit to klock-klock. the whole length of the ravine might have been a mile and a half, or probably two miles. it wound in every possible direction through the hills (having apparently formed, at some remote period, the bed of a torrent), in no instance proceeding more than twenty yards without an abrupt turn. the sides of this dell would have averaged, i am sure, seventy or eighty feet in perpendicular altitude throughout the whole of their extent, and in some portions they arose to an astonishing height, overshadowing the pass so completely that but little of the light of day could penetrate. the general width was about forty feet, and occasionally it diminished so as not to allow the passage of more than five or six persons abreast. in short, there could be no place in the world better adapted for the consummation of an ambuscade, and it was no more than natural that we should look carefully to our arms as we entered upon it. when i now think of our egregious folly, the chief subject of astonishment seems to be, that we should have ever ventured, under any circumstances, so completely into the power of unknown savages as to permit them to march both before and behind us in our progress through this ravine. yet such was the order we blindly took up, trusting foolishly to the force of our party, the unarmed condition of too-wit and his men, the certain efficacy of our fire-arms (whose effect was yet a secret to the natives), and, more than all, to the long-sustained pretension of friendship kept up by these infamous wretches. five or six of them went on before, as if to lead the way, ostentatiously busying themselves in removing the larger stones and rubbish from the path. next came our own party. we walked closely together, taking care only to prevent separation. behind followed the main body of the savages, observing unusual order and decorum. dirk peters, a man named wilson allen, and myself were on the right of our companions, examining, as we went along, the singular stratification of the precipice which overhung us. a fissure in the soft rock attracted our attention. it was about wide enough for one person to enter without squeezing, and extended back into the hill some eighteen or twenty feet in a straight course, sloping afterward to the left. the height of the opening, as far as we could see into it from the main gorge, was perhaps sixty or seventy feet. there were one or two stunted shrubs growing from the crevices, bearing a species of filbert, which i felt some curiosity to examine, and pushed in briskly for that purpose, gathering five or six of the nuts at a grasp, and then hastily retreating. as i turned, i found that peters and allen had followed me. i desired them to go back, as there was not room for two persons to pass, saying they should have some of my nuts. they accordingly turned, and were scrambling back, allen being close to the mouth of the fissure, when i was suddenly aware of a concussion resembling nothing i had ever before experienced, and which impressed me with a vague conception, if indeed i then thought of anything, that the whole foundations of the solid globe were suddenly rent asunder, and that the day of universal dissolution was at hand. chapter xxi. as soon as i could collect my scattered senses, i found myself nearly suffocated, and grovelling in utter darkness among a quantity of loose earth, which was also falling upon me heavily in every direction, threatening to bury me entirely. horribly alarmed at this idea, i struggled to gain my feet, and at length succeeded. i then remained motionless for some moments, endeavouring to conceive what had happened to me, and where i was. presently i heard a deep groan just at my ear, and afterward the smothered voice of peters calling to me for aid in the name of god. i scrambled one or two paces forward, when i fell directly over the head and shoulders of my companion, who, i soon discovered, was buried in a loose mass of earth as far as his middle, and struggling desperately to free himself from the pressure. i tore the dirt from around him with all the energy i could command, and at length succeeded in getting him out. as soon as we sufficiently recovered from our fright and surprise to be capable of conversing rationally, we both came to the conclusion that the walls of the fissure in which we had ventured had, by some convulsion of nature, or probably from their own weight, caved in overhead, and that we were consequently lost for ever, being thus entombed alive. for a long time we gave up supinely to the most intense agony and despair, such as cannot be adequately imagined by those who have never been in a similar situation. i firmly believe that no incident ever occurring in the course of human events is more adapted to inspire the supremeness of mental and bodily distress than a case like our own, of living inhumation. the blackness of darkness which envelops the victim, the terrific oppression of lungs, the stifling fumes from the damp earth, unite with the ghastly considerations that we are beyond the remotest confines of hope, and that such is the allotted portion of _the dead_, to carry into the human heart a degree of appalling awe and horror not to be tolerated--never to be conceived. at length peters proposed that we should endeavour to ascertain precisely the extent of our calamity, and grope about our prison; it being barely possible, he observed, that some opening might be yet left us for escape. i caught eagerly at this hope, and, arousing myself to exertion, attempted to force my way through the loose earth. hardly had i advanced a single step before a glimmer of light became perceptible, enough to convince me that, at all events, we should not immediately perish for want of air. we now took some degree of heart, and encouraged each other to hope for the best. having scrambled over a bank of rubbish which impeded our farther progress in the direction of the light, we found less difficulty in advancing, and also experienced some relief from the excessive oppression of lungs which had tormented us. presently we were enabled to obtain a glimpse of the objects around, and discovered that we were near the extremity of the straight portion of the fissure, where it made a turn to the left. a few struggles more, and we reached the bend, when, to our inexpressible joy, there appeared a long seam or crack extending upward a vast distance, generally at an angle of about forty-five degrees, although sometimes much more precipitous. we could not see through the whole extent of this opening; but, as a good deal of light came down it, we had little doubt of finding at the top of it (if we could by any means reach the top) a clear passage into the open air. i now called to mind that three of us had entered the fissure from the main gorge, and that our companion, allen, was still missing; we determined at once to retrace our steps and look for him. after a long search, and much danger from the farther caving in of the earth above us, peters at length cried out to me that he had hold of our companion's foot, and that his whole body was deeply buried beneath the rubbish, beyond a possibility of extricating him. i soon found that what he said was too true, and that, of course, life had been long extinct. with sorrowful hearts, therefore, we left the corpse to its fate, and again made our way to the bend. the breadth of the seam was barely sufficient to admit us, and, after one or two ineffectual efforts at getting up, we began once more to despair. i have before said that the chain of hills through which ran the main gorge was composed of a species of soft rock resembling soapstone. the sides of the cleft we were now attempting to ascend were of the same material, and so excessively slippery, being wet, that we could get but little foothold upon them even in their least precipitous parts; in some places, where the ascent was nearly perpendicular, the difficulty was, of course, much aggravated; and, indeed, for some time we thought it insurmountable. we took courage, however, from despair; and what, by dint of cutting steps in the soft stone with our bowie knives, and swinging, at the risk of our lives, to small projecting points of a harder species of slaty rock which now and then protruded from the general mass, we at length reached a natural platform, from which was perceptible a patch of blue sky, at the extremity of a thickly-wooded ravine. looking back now, with somewhat more leisure, at the passage through which we had thus far proceeded, we clearly saw, from the appearance of its sides, that it was of late formation, and we concluded that the concussion, whatever it was, which had so unexpectedly overwhelmed us, had also, at the same moment, laid open this path for escape. being quite exhausted with exertion, and, indeed, so weak that we were scarcely able to stand or articulate, peters now proposed that we should endeavour to bring our companions to the rescue by firing the pistols which still remained in our girdles--the muskets as well as cutlasses had been lost among the loose earth at the bottom of the chasm. subsequent events proved that, had we fired, we should have sorely repented it; but, luckily, a half suspicion of foul play had by this time arisen in my mind, and we forbore to let the savages know of our whereabouts. after having reposed for about an hour, we pushed on slowly up the ravine, and had gone no great way before we heard a succession of tremendous yells. at length we reached what might be called the surface of the ground; for our path hitherto, since leaving the platform, had lain beneath an archway of high rock and foliage, at a vast distance overhead. with great caution we stole to a narrow opening, through which we had a clear sight of the surrounding country, when the whole dreadful secret of the concussion broke upon us in one moment and at one view. the spot from which we looked was not far from the summit of the highest peak in the range of the soapstone hills. the gorge in which our party of thirty-two had entered ran within fifty feet to the left of us. but, for at least one hundred yards, the channel or bed of this gorge was entirely filled up with the chaotic ruins of more than a million tons of earth and stone that had been artificially tumbled within it. the means by which the vast mass had been precipitated were not more simple than evident, for sure traces of the murderous work were yet remaining. in several spots along the top of the eastern side of the gorge (we were now on the western) might be seen stakes of wood driven into the earth. in these spots the earth had not given way; but throughout the whole extent of the face of the precipice from which the mass _had_ fallen, it was clear, from marks left in the soil resembling those made by the drill of the rock-blaster, that stakes similar to those we saw standing had been inserted, at not more than a yard apart, for the length of perhaps three hundred feet, and ranging at about ten feet back from the edge of the gulf. strong cords of grape vine were attached to the stakes still remaining on the hill, and it was evident that such cords had also been attached to each of the other stakes. i have already spoken of the singular stratification of these soapstone hills; and the description just given of the narrow and deep fissure through which we effected our escape from inhumation will afford a further conception of its nature. this was such that almost every natural convulsion would be sure to split the soil into perpendicular layers or ridges running parallel with one another; and a very moderate exertion of art would be sufficient for effecting the same purpose. of this stratification the savages had availed themselves to accomplish their treacherous ends. there can be no doubt that, by the continuous line of stakes, a partial rupture of the soil had been brought about, probably to the depth of one or two feet, when, by means of a savage pulling at the end of each of the cords (these cords being attached to the tops of the stakes, and extending back from the edge of the cliff), a vast leverage power was obtained, capable of hurling the whole face of the hill, upon a given signal, into the bosom of the abyss below. the fate of our poor companions was no longer a matter of uncertainty. we alone had escaped from the tempest of that overwhelming destruction. we were the only living white men upon the island. chapter xxii. our situation, as it now appeared, was scarcely less dreadful than when we had conceived ourselves entombed for ever. we saw before us no prospect but that of being put to death by the savages, or of dragging out a miserable existence in captivity among them. we might, to be sure, conceal ourselves for a time from their observation among the fastnesses of the hills, and, as a final resort, in the chasm from which we had just issued; but we must either perish in the long polar winter through cold and famine, or be ultimately discovered in our efforts to obtain relief. the whole country around us seemed to be swarming with savages, crowds of whom, we now perceived, had come over from the islands to the southward on flat rafts, doubtless with a view of lending their aid in the capture and plunder of the jane. the vessel still lay calmly at anchor in the bay, those on board being apparently quite unconscious of any danger awaiting them. how we longed at that moment to be with them! either to aid in effecting their escape, or to perish with them in attempting a defence. we saw no chance even of warning them of their danger without bringing immediate destruction upon our own heads, with but a remote hope of benefit to them. a pistol fired might suffice to apprize them that something wrong had occurred; but the report could not possibly inform them that their only prospect of safety lay in getting out of the harbour forthwith--it could not tell them that no principles of honour now bound them to remain, that their companions were no longer among the living. upon hearing the discharge they could not be more thoroughly prepared to meet the foe, who were now getting ready to attack, than they already were, and always had been. no good, therefore, and infinite harm, would result from our firing, and, after mature deliberation, we forbore. our next thought was to attempt a rush towards the vessel, to seize one of the four canoes which lay at the head of the bay, and endeavour to force a passage on board. but the utter impossibility of succeeding in this desperate task soon became evident. the country, as i said before, was literally swarming with the natives, skulking among the bushes and recesses of the hills, so as not to be observed from the schooner. in our immediate vicinity especially, and blockading the sole path by which we could hope to attain the shore in the proper point, were stationed the whole party of the black skin warriors, with too-wit at their head, and apparently only waiting for some re-enforcement to commence his onset upon the jane. the canoes, too, which lay at the head of the bay were manned with savages, unarmed, it is true, but who undoubtedly had arms within reach. we were forced, therefore, however unwillingly, to remain in our place of concealment, mere spectators of the conflict which presently ensued. in about half an hour we saw some sixty or seventy rafts, or flatboats, with outriggers, filled with savages, and coming round the southern bight of the harbour. they appeared to have no arms except short clubs, and stones which lay in the bottom of the rafts. immediately afterward another detachment, still larger, approached in an opposite direction, and with similar weapons. the four canoes, too, were now quickly filled with natives, starting up from the bushes at the head of the bay, and put off swiftly to join the other parties. thus, in less time than i have taken to tell it, and as if by magic, the jane saw herself surrounded by an immense multitude of desperadoes evidently bent upon capturing her at all hazards. that they would succeed in so doing could not be doubted for an instant. the six men left in the vessel, however resolutely they might engage in her defence, were altogether unequal to the proper management of the guns, or in any manner to sustain a contest at such odds. i could hardly imagine that they would make resistance at all, but in this was deceived; for presently i saw them get springs upon the cable, and bring the vessel's starboard broadside to bear upon the canoes, which by this time were within pistol range, the rafts being nearly a quarter of a mile to windward. owing to some cause unknown, but most probably to the agitation of our poor friends at seeing themselves in so hopeless a situation, the discharge was an entire failure. not a canoe was hit or a single savage injured, the shots striking short and _ricochêting_ over their heads. the only effect produced upon them was astonishment at the unexpected report and smoke, which was so excessive that for some moments i almost thought they would abandon their design entirely, and return to the shore. and this they would most likely have done had our men followed up their broadside by a discharge of small arms, in which, as the canoes were now so near at hand, they could not have failed in doing some execution, sufficient, at least, to deter this party from a farther advance, until they could have given the rafts also a broadside. but, in place of this, they left the canoe party to recover from their panic, and, by looking about them, to see that no injury had been sustained, while they flew to the larboard to get ready for the rafts. the discharge to larboard produced the most terrible effect. the star and double-headed shot of the large guns cut seven or eight of the rafts completely asunder, and killed, perhaps, thirty or forty of the savages outright, while a hundred of them, at least, were thrown into the water, the most of them dreadfully wounded. the remainder, frightened out of their senses, commenced at once a precipitate retreat, not even waiting to pick up their maimed companions, who were swimming about in every direction, screaming and yelling for aid. this great success, however, came too late for the salvation of our devoted people. the canoe party were already on board the schooner to the number of more than a hundred and fifty, the most of them having succeeded in scrambling up the chains and over the boarding nettings even before the matches had been applied to the larboard guns. nothing could now withstand their brute rage. our men were borne down at once, overwhelmed, trodden under foot, and absolutely torn to pieces in an instant. seeing this, the savages on the rafts got the better of their fears, and came up in shoals to the plunder. in five minutes the jane was a pitiable scene indeed of havoc and tumultuous outrage. the decks were split open and ripped up; the cordage, sails, and everything moveable on deck demolished as if by magic; while, by dint of pushing at the stern, towing with the canoes, and hauling at the sides, as they swam in thousands around the vessel, the wretches finally forced her on shore (the cable having been slipped), and delivered her over to the good offices of too-wit, who, during the whole of the engagement, had maintained, like a skilful general, his post of security and reconnoissance among the hills, but, now that the victory was completed to his satisfaction, condescended to scamper down with his warriors of the black skin, and become a partaker in the spoils. too-wit's descent left us at liberty to quit our hiding-place and reconnoitre the hill in the vicinity of the chasm. at about fifty yards from the mouth of it we saw a small spring of water, at which we slaked the burning thirst that now consumed us. not far from the spring we discovered several of the filbert-bushes which i mentioned before. upon tasting the nuts we found them palatable, and very nearly resembling in flavour the common english filbert. we collected our hats full immediately, deposited them within the ravine, and returned for more. while we were busily employed in gathering these, a rustling in the bushes alarmed us, and we were upon the point of stealing back to our covert, when a large black bird of the bittern species strugglingly and slowly arose above the shrubs. i was so much startled that i could do nothing, but peters had sufficient presence of mind to run up to it before it could make its escape, and seize it by the neck. its struggles and screams were tremendous, and we had thoughts of letting it go, lest the noise should alarm some of the savages who might be still lurking in the neighbourhood. a stab with a bowie knife, however, at length brought it to the ground, and we dragged it into the ravine, congratulating ourselves that, at all events, we had thus obtained a supply of food enough to last us for a week. we now went out again to look about us, and ventured a considerable distance down the southern declivity of the hill, but met with nothing else which could serve us for food. we therefore collected a quantity of dry wood and returned, seeing one or two large parties of the natives on their way to the village, laden with the plunder of the vessel, and who, we were apprehensive, might discover us in passing beneath the hill. our next care was to render our place of concealment as secure as possible, and, with this object, we arranged some brushwood over the aperture which i have before spoken of as the one through which we saw the patch of blue sky, on reaching the platform from the interior of the chasm. we left only a very small opening, just wide enough to admit of our seeing the bay, without the risk of being discovered from below. having done this, we congratulated ourselves upon the security of the position; for we were now completely excluded from observation, as long as we chose to remain within the ravine itself, and not venture out upon the hill. we could perceive no traces of the savages having ever been within this hollow; but, indeed, when we came to reflect upon the probability that the fissure through which we attained it had been only just now created by the fall of the cliff opposite, and that no other way of attaining it could be perceived, we were not so much rejoiced at the thought of being secure from molestation as fearful lest there should be absolutely no means left us for descent. we resolved to explore the summit of the hill thoroughly, when a good opportunity should offer. in the mean time we watched the motions of the savages through our loophole. they had already made a complete wreck of the vessel, and were now preparing to set her on fire. in a little while we saw the smoke ascending in huge volumes from her main-hatchway, and, shortly afterward, a dense mass of flame burst up from the forecastle. the rigging, masts, and what remained of the sails caught immediately, and the fire spread rapidly along the decks. still a great many of the savages retained their stations about her, hammering with large stones, axes, and cannon balls at the bolts and other copper and iron work. on the beach, and in canoes and rafts, there were not less, altogether, in the immediate vicinity of the schooner, than ten thousand natives, besides the shoals of them who, laden with booty, were making their way inland and over to the neighbouring islands. we now anticipated a catastrophe, and were not disappointed. first of all there came a smart shock (which we felt distinctly where we were as if we had been slightly galvanized), but unattended with any visible signs of an explosion. the savages were evidently startled, and paused for an instant from their labours and yellings. they were upon the point of recommencing, when suddenly a mass of smoke puffed up from the decks, resembling a black and heavy thunder-cloud--then, as if from its bowels, arose a tall stream of vivid fire to the height, apparently, of a quarter of a mile--then there came a sudden circular expansion of the flame--then the whole atmosphere was magically crowded, in a single instant, with a wild chaos of wood, and metal, and human limbs--and, lastly, came the concussion in its fullest fury, which hurled us impetuously from our feet, while the hills echoed and re-echoed the tumult, and a dense shower of the minutest fragments of the ruins tumbled headlong in every direction around us. the havoc among the savages far exceeded our utmost expectation, and they had now, indeed, reaped the full and perfect fruits of their treachery. perhaps a thousand perished by the explosion, while at least an equal number were desperately mangled. the whole surface of the bay was literally strewn with the struggling and drowning wretches, and on shore matters were even worse. they seemed utterly appalled by the suddenness and completeness of their discomfiture, and made no efforts at assisting one another. at length we observed a total change in their demeanour. from absolute stupor they appeared to be, all at once, aroused to the highest pitch of excitement, and rushed wildly about, going to and from a certain point on the beach, with the strangest expressions of mingled horror, rage, and intense curiosity depicted on their countenances, and shouting, at the top of their voices, _tekeli-li! tekeli-li!_ presently we saw a large body go off into the hills, whence they returned in a short time, carrying stakes of wood. these they brought to the station where the crowd was the thickest, which now separated so as to afford us a view of the object of all this excitement. we perceived something white lying on the ground, but could not immediately make out what it was. at length we saw that it was the carcass of the strange animal with the scarlet teeth and claws which the schooner had picked up at sea on the eighteenth of january. captain guy had had the body preserved for the purpose of stuffing the skin and taking it to england. i remember he had given some directions about it just before our making the island, and it had been brought into the cabin and stowed away in one of the lockers. it had now been thrown on shore by the explosion; but why it had occasioned so much concern among the savages was more than we could comprehend. although they crowded around the carcass at a little distance, none of them seemed willing to approach it closely. by-and-by the men with the stakes drove them in a circle around it, and, no sooner was this arrangement completed, than the whole of the vast assembly rushed into the interior of the island, with loud screams of _tekeli-li! tekeli-li!_ chapter xxiii. during the six or seven days immediately following we remained in our hiding-place upon the hill, going out only occasionally, and then with the greatest precaution, for water and filberts. we had made a kind of pent-house on the platform, furnishing it with a bed of dry leaves, and placing in it three large flat stones, which served us for both fireplace and table. we kindled a fire without difficulty by rubbing two pieces of dry wood together, the one soft, the other hard. the bird we had taken in such good season proved excellent eating, although somewhat tough. it was not an oceanic fowl, but a species of bittern, with jet black and grizzly plumage, and diminutive wings in proportion to its bulk. we afterward saw three of the same kind in the vicinity of the ravine, apparently seeking for the one we had captured; but, as they never alighted, we had no opportunity of catching them. as long as this fowl lasted we suffered nothing from our situation; but it was now entirely consumed, and it became absolutely necessary that we should look out for provision. the filberts would not satisfy the cravings of hunger, afflicting us, too, with severe gripings of the bowels, and, if freely indulged in, with violent headache. we had seen several large tortoises near the seashore to the eastward of the hill, and perceived they might be easily taken, if we could get at them without the observation of the natives. it was resolved, therefore, to make an attempt at descending. we commenced by going down the southern declivity, which seemed to offer the fewest difficulties, but had not proceeded a hundred yards before (as we had anticipated from appearances on the hill-top) our progress was entirely arrested by a branch of the gorge in which our companions had perished. we now passed along the edge of this for about a quarter of a mile, when we were again stopped by a precipice of immense depth, and, not being able to make our way along the brink of it, we were forced to retrace our steps by the main ravine. we now pushed over to the eastward, but with precisely similar fortune. after an hour's scramble, at the risk of breaking our necks, we discovered that we had merely descended into a vast pit of black granite, with fine dust at the bottom, and whence the only egress was by the rugged path in which we had come down. toiling again up this path, we now tried the northern edge of the hill. here we were obliged to use the greatest possible caution in our manoeuvres, as the least indiscretion would expose us to the full view of the savages in the village. we crawled along, therefore, on our hands and knees, and, occasionally, were even forced to throw ourselves at full length, dragging our bodies along by means of the shrubbery. in this careful manner we had proceeded but a little way, when we arrived at a chasm far deeper than any we had yet seen, and leading directly into the main gorge. thus our fears were fully confirmed, and we found ourselves cut off entirely from access to the world below. thoroughly exhausted by our exertions, we made the best of our way back to the platform, and, throwing ourselves upon the bed of leaves, slept sweetly and soundly for some hours. for several days after this fruitless search we were occupied in exploring every part of the summit of the hill, in order to inform ourselves of its actual resources. we found that it would afford us no food, with the exception of the unwholesome filberts, and a rank species of scurvy grass which grew in a little patch of not more than four rods square, and would be soon exhausted. on the fifteenth of february, as near as i can remember, there was not a blade of this left, and the nuts were growing scarce; our situation, therefore, could hardly be more <UNK> on the sixteenth we again went round the walls of our prison, in hope of finding some avenue of escape, but to no purpose. we also descended the chasm in which we had been overwhelmed, with the faint expectation of discovering, through this channel, some opening to the main ravine. here, too, we were disappointed, although we found and brought up with us a musket. [footnote <UNK> this day was rendered remarkable by our observing in the south several huge wreaths of the grayish vapour i have before spoken of.] on the seventeenth we set out with the determination of examining more thoroughly the chasm of black granite into which we had made our way in the first search. we remembered that one of the fissures in the sides of this pit had been but partially looked into, and we were anxious to explore it, although with no expectation of discovering here any opening. we found no great difficulty in reaching the bottom of the hollow as before, and were now sufficiently calm to survey it with some attention. it was, indeed, one of the most singular-looking places imaginable, and we could scarcely bring ourselves to believe it altogether the work of nature. the pit, from its eastern to its western extremity, was about five hundred yards in length, when all its windings were threaded; the distance from east to west in a straight line not being more (i should suppose, having no means of accurate examination) than forty or fifty yards. upon first descending into the chasm, that is to say, for a hundred feet downward from the summit of the hill, the sides of the abyss bore little resemblance to each other, and, apparently, had at no time been connected, the one surface being of the soapstone and the other of marl, granulated with some metallic matter. the average breadth, or interval between the two cliffs, was probably here sixty feet, but there seemed to be no regularity of formation. passing down, however, beyond the limit spoken of, the interval rapidly contracted, and the sides began to run parallel, although, for some distance farther, they were still dissimilar in their material and form of surface. upon arriving within fifty feet of the bottom, a perfect regularity commenced. the sides were now entirely uniform in substance, in colour, and in lateral direction, the material being a very black and shining granite, and the distance between the two sides, at all points facing each other, exactly twenty yards. the precise formation of the chasm will be best understood by means of a delineation taken upon the spot; for i had luckily with me a pocketbook and pencil, which i preserved with great care through a long series of subsequent adventure, and to which i am indebted for memoranda of many subjects which would otherwise have been crowded from my remembrance. [illustration: _figure <UNK> this figure (see figure <UNK> gives the general outlines of the chasm, without the minor cavities in the sides, of which there were several, each cavity having a corresponding protuberance opposite. the bottom of the gulf was covered to the depth of three or four inches with a powder almost impalpable, beneath which we found a continuation of the black granite. to the right, at the lower extremity, will be noticed the appearance of a small opening; this is the fissure alluded to above, and to examine which more minutely than before was the object of our second visit. we now pushed into it with vigour, cutting away a quantity of brambles which impeded us, and removing a vast heap of sharp flints somewhat resembling arrowheads in shape. we were encouraged to persevere, however, by perceiving some little light proceeding from the farther end. we at length squeezed our way for about thirty feet, and found that the aperture was a low and regularly-formed arch, having a bottom of the same impalpable powder as that in the main chasm. a strong light now broke upon us, and, turning a short bend, we found ourselves in another lofty chamber, similar to the one we had left in every respect but longitudinal form. its general figure is here given. (see figure <UNK> [illustration: _figure <UNK> the total length of this chasm, commencing at the opening _a_ and proceeding round the curve _b_ to the extremity _d_, is five hundred and fifty yards. at _c_ we discovered a small aperture similar to the one through which we had issued from the other chasm, and this was choked up in the same manner with brambles and a quantity of the white arrowhead flints. we forced our way through it, finding it about forty feet long, and emerged into a third chasm. this, too, was precisely like the first, except in its longitudinal shape, which was thus. (see figure <UNK> [illustration: _figure <UNK> [illustration: _figure <UNK> we found the entire length of the third chasm three hundred and twenty yards. at the point _a_ was an opening about six feet wide, and extending fifteen feet into the rock, where it terminated in a bed of marl, there being no other chasm beyond, as we had expected. we were about leaving this fissure, into which very little light was admitted, when peters called my attention to a range of singular-looking indentures in the surface of the marl forming the termination of the _cul-de-sac_. with a very slight exertion of the imagination, the left, or most northerly of these indentures might have been taken for the intentional, although rude, representation of a human figure standing erect, with outstretched arm. the rest of them bore also some little resemblance to alphabetical characters, and peters was willing, at all events, to adopt the idle opinion that they were really such. i convinced him of his error, finally, by directing his attention to the floor of the fissure, where, among the powder, we picked up, piece by piece, several large flakes of the marl, which had evidently been broken off by some convulsion from the surface where the indentures were found, and which had projecting points exactly fitting the indentures; thus proving them to have been the work of nature. figure <UNK> presents an accurate copy of the whole. [illustration: _figure <UNK> after satisfying ourselves that these singular caverns afforded us no means of escape from our prison, we made our way back, dejected and dispirited, to the summit of the hill. nothing worth mentioning occurred during the next twenty-four hours, except that, in examining the ground to the eastward of the third chasm, we found two triangular holes of great depth, and also with black granite sides. into these holes we did not think it worth while to attempt descending, as they had the appearance of mere natural wells, without outlet. they were each about twenty yards in circumference, and their shape, as well as relative position in regard to the third chasm, is shown in figure <UNK> preceding page. chapter xxiv. on the twentieth of the month, finding it altogether impossible to subsist any longer upon the filberts, the use of which occasioned us the most excruciating torment, we resolved to make a desperate attempt at descending the southern declivity of the hill. the face of the precipice was here of the softest species of soapstone, although nearly perpendicular throughout its whole extent (a depth of a hundred and fifty feet at the least), and in many places even overarching. after long search we discovered a narrow ledge about twenty feet below the brink of the gulf; upon this peters contrived to leap, with what assistance i could render him by means of our pocket-handkerchiefs tied together. with somewhat more difficulty i also got down; and we then saw the possibility of descending the whole way by the process in which we had clambered up from the chasm when we had been buried by the fall of the hill--that is, by cutting steps in the face of the soapstone with our knives. the extreme hazard of the attempt can scarcely be conceived; but, as there was no other resource, we determined to undertake it. upon the ledge where we stood there grew some filbert-bushes; and to one of these we made fast an end of our rope of handkerchiefs. the other end being tied round peters's waist, i lowered him down over the edge of the precipice until the handkerchiefs were stretched tight. he now proceeded to dig a deep hole in the soapstone (as far in as eight or ten inches), sloping away the rock above to the height of a foot, or thereabout, so as to allow of his driving, with the butt of a pistol, a tolerably strong peg into the levelled surface. i then drew him up for about four feet, when he made a hole similar to the one below, driving in a peg as before, and having thus a resting-place for both feet and hands. i now unfastened the handkerchiefs from the bush, throwing him the end, which he tied to the peg in the uppermost hole, letting himself down gently to a station about three feet lower than he had yet been, that is, to the full extent of the handkerchiefs. here he dug another hole, and drove another peg. he then drew himself up, so as to rest his feet in the hole just cut, taking hold with his hands upon the peg in the one above. it was now necessary to untie the handkerchiefs from the topmost peg, with the view of fastening them to the second; and here he found that an error had been committed in cutting the holes at so great a distance apart. however, after one or two unsuccessful and dangerous attempts at reaching the knot (having to hold on with his left hand while he laboured to undo the fastening with his right), he at length cut the string, leaving six inches of it affixed to the peg. tying the handkerchiefs now to the second peg, he descended to a station below the third, taking care not to go too far down. by these means (means which i should never have conceived of myself, and for which we were indebted altogether to peters's ingenuity and resolution) my companion finally succeeded, with the occasional aid of projections in the cliff, in reaching the bottom without accident. it was some time before i could summon sufficient resolution to follow him; but i did at length attempt it. peters had taken off his shirt before descending, and this, with my own, formed the rope necessary for the adventure. after throwing down the musket found in the chasm, i fastened this rope to the bushes, and let myself down rapidly, striving, by the vigour of my movements, to banish the trepidation which i could overcome in no other manner. this answered sufficiently well for the first four or five steps; but presently i found my imagination growing terribly excited by thoughts of the vast depth yet to be descended, and the precarious nature of the pegs and soapstone holes which were my only support. it was in vain i endeavoured to banish these reflections, and to keep my eyes steadily bent upon the flat surface of the cliff before me. the more earnestly i struggled _not to think_, the more intensely vivid became my conceptions, and the more horribly distinct. at length arrived that crisis of fancy, so fearful in all similar cases, the crisis in which we begin to anticipate the feelings with which we _shall_ fall--to picture to ourselves the sickness, and dizziness, and the last struggle, and the half swoon, and the final bitterness of the rushing and headlong descent. and now i found these fancies creating their own realities, and all imagined horrors crowding upon me in fact. i felt my knees strike violently together, while my fingers were gradually yet certainly relaxing their grasp. there was a ringing in my ears, and i said, "this is my knell of death!" and now i was consumed with the irrepressible desire of looking below. i could not, i would not, confine my glances to the cliff; and, with a wild, indefinable emotion half of horror, half of a relieved oppression, i threw my vision far down into the abyss. for one moment my fingers clutched convulsively upon their hold, while, with the movement, the faintest possible idea of ultimate escape wandered, like a shadow, through my mind--in the next my whole soul was pervaded with _a longing to fall_; a desire, a yearning, a passion utterly uncontrollable. i let go at once my grasp upon the peg, and, turning half round from the precipice, remained tottering for an instant against its naked face. but now there came a spinning of the brain; a shrill-sounding and phantom voice screamed within my ears; a dusky, fiendish, and filmy figure stood immediately beneath me; and, sighing, i sunk down with a bursting heart, and plunged within its arms. i had swooned, and peters had caught me as i fell. he had observed my proceedings from his station at the bottom of the cliff; and, perceiving my imminent danger, had endeavoured to inspire me with courage by every suggestion he could devise; although my confusion of mind had been so great as to prevent my hearing what he said, or being conscious that he had even spoken to me at all. at length, seeing me totter, he hastened to ascend to my rescue, and arrived just in time for my preservation. had i fallen with my full weight, the rope of linen would inevitably have snapped, and i should have been precipitated into the abyss; as it was, he contrived to let me down gently, so as to remain suspended without danger until animation returned. this was in about fifteen minutes. on recovery, my trepidation had entirely vanished; i felt a new being, and, with some little further aid from my companion, reached the bottom also in safety. we now found ourselves not far from the ravine which had proved the tomb of our friends, and to the southward of the spot where the hill had fallen. the place was one of singular wildness, and its aspect brought to my mind the descriptions given by travellers of those dreary regions marking the site of degraded babylon. not to speak of the ruins of the disruptured cliff, which formed a chaotic barrier in the vista to the northward, the surface of the ground in every other direction was strewn with huge tumuli, apparently the wreck of some gigantic structures of art; although, in detail, no semblance of art could be detected. scoria were abundant, and large shapeless blocks of the black granite, intermingled with others of <UNK> and both granulated with metal. of vegetation there were no traces whatsoever throughout the whole of the desolate area within sight. several immense scorpions were seen, and various reptiles not elsewhere to be found in the high latitudes. [footnote <UNK> the marl was also black; indeed, we noticed no light-coloured substances of any kind upon the island.] as food was our most immediate object, we resolved to make our way to the seacoast, distant not more than half a mile, with a view of catching turtle, several of which we had observed from our place of concealment on the hill. we had proceeded some hundred yards, threading our route cautiously between the huge rocks and tumuli, when, upon turning a corner, five savages sprung upon us from a small cavern, felling peters to the ground with a blow from a club. as he fell the whole party rushed upon him to secure their victim, leaving me time to recover from my astonishment. i still had the musket, but the barrel had received so much injury in being thrown from the precipice that i cast it aside as useless, preferring to trust my pistols, which had been carefully preserved in order. with these i advanced upon the assailants, firing one after the other in quick succession. two savages fell, and one, who was in the act of thrusting a spear into peters, sprung to his feet without accomplishing his purpose. my companion being thus released, we had no further difficulty. he had his pistols also, but prudently declined using them, confiding in his great personal strength, which far exceeded that of any person i have ever known. seizing a club from one of the savages who had fallen, he dashed out the brains of the three who remained, killing each instantaneously with a single blow of the weapon, and leaving us completely masters of the field. so rapidly had these events passed, that we could scarcely believe in their reality, and were standing over the bodies of the dead in a species of stupid contemplation, when we were brought to recollection by the sound of shouts in the distance. it was clear that the savages had been alarmed by the firing, and that we had little chance of avoiding discovery. to regain the cliff, it would be necessary to proceed in the direction of the shouts; and even should we succeed in arriving at its base, we should never be able to ascend it without being seen. our situation was one of the greatest peril, and we were hesitating in which path to commence a flight, when one of the savages whom i had shot, and supposed dead, sprang briskly to his feet, and attempted to make his escape. we overtook him, however, before he had advanced many paces, and were about to put him to death, when peters suggested that we might derive some benefit from forcing him to accompany us in our attempt at escape. we therefore dragged him with us, making him understand that we would shoot him if he offered resistance. in a few minutes he was perfectly submissive, and ran by our sides as we pushed in among the rocks, making for the seashore. so far, the irregularities of the ground we had been traversing hid the sea, except at intervals, from our sight, and, when we first had it fairly in view, it was, perhaps, two hundred yards distant. as we emerged into the open beach we saw, to our great dismay, an immense crowd of the natives pouring from the village, and from all visible quarters of the island, making towards us with gesticulations of extreme fury, and howling like wild beasts. we were upon the point of turning upon our steps, and trying to secure a retreat among the fastnesses of the rougher ground, when i discovered the bows of two canoes projecting from behind a large rock which ran out into the water. towards these we now ran with all speed, and, reaching them, found them unguarded, and without any other freight than three of the large gallipago turtles and the usual supply of paddles for sixty rowers. we instantly took possession of one of them, and, forcing our captive on board, pushed out to sea with all the strength we could command. we had not made, however, more than fifty yards from the shore before we became sufficiently calm to perceive the great oversight of which we had been guilty in leaving the other canoe in the power of the savages, who, by this time, were not more than twice as far from the beach as ourselves, and were rapidly advancing to the pursuit. no time was now to be lost. our hope was, at best, a forlorn one, but we had none other. it was very doubtful whether, with the utmost exertion, we could get back in time to anticipate them in taking possession of the canoe; but yet there was a chance that we could. we might save ourselves if we succeeded, while not to make the attempt was to resign ourselves to inevitable butchery. the canoe was modelled with the bow and stern alike, and, in place of turning it round, we merely changed our position in paddling. as soon as the savages perceived this they redoubled their yells, as well as their speed, and approached with inconceivable rapidity. we pulled, however, with all the energy of desperation, and arrived at the contested point before more than one of the natives had attained it. this man paid dearly for his superior agility, peters shooting him through the head with a pistol as he approached the shore. the foremost among the rest of his party were probably some twenty or thirty paces distant as we seized upon the canoe. we at first endeavoured to pull her into the deep water, beyond the reach of the savages, but, finding her too firmly aground, and there being no time to spare, peters, with one or two heavy strokes from the butt of the musket, succeeded in dashing out a large portion of the bow and of one side. we then pushed off. two of the natives by this time had got hold of our boat, obstinately refusing to let go, until we were forced to despatch them with our knives. we were now clear off, and making great way out to sea. the main body of the savages, upon reaching the broken canoe, set up the most tremendous yell of rage and disappointment conceivable. in truth, from everything i could see of these wretches, they appeared to be the most wicked, hypocritical, vindictive, bloodthirsty, and altogether fiendish race of men upon the face of the globe. it is clear we should have had no mercy had we fallen into their hands. they made a mad attempt at following us in the fractured canoe, but, finding it useless, again vented their rage in a series of hideous vociferations, and rushed up into the hills. we were thus relieved from immediate danger, but our situation was still sufficiently gloomy. we knew that four canoes of the kind we had were at one time in the possession of the savages, and were not aware of the fact (afterward ascertained from our captive) that two of these had been blown to pieces in the explosion of the jane guy. we calculated, therefore, upon being yet pursued, as soon as our enemies could get round to the bay (distant about three miles) where the boats were usually laid up. fearing this, we made every exertion to leave the island behind us, and went rapidly through the water, forcing the prisoner to take a paddle. in about half an hour, when we had gained, probably, five or six miles to the southward, a large fleet of the flat-bottomed canoes or rafts was seen to emerge from the bay, evidently with the design of pursuit. presently they put back, despairing to overtake us. chapter xxv. we now found ourselves in the wide and desolate antarctic ocean, in a latitude exceeding eighty-four degrees, in a frail canoe, and with no provision but the three turtles. the long polar winter, too, could not be considered as far distant, and it became necessary that we should deliberate well upon the course to be pursued. there were six or seven islands in sight belonging to the same group, and distant from each other about five or six leagues; but upon neither of these had we any intention to venture. in coming from the northward in the jane guy we had been gradually leaving behind us the severest regions of ice--this, however little it may be in accordance with the generally-received notions respecting the antarctic, was a fact experience would not permit us to deny. to attempt, therefore, getting back, would be folly--especially at so late a period of the season. only one course seemed to be left open for hope. we resolved to steer boldly to the southward, where there was at least a probability of discovering other lands, and more than a probability of finding a still milder climate. so far we had found the antarctic, like the arctic ocean, peculiarly free from violent storms or immoderately rough water; but our canoe was, at best, of frail structure, although large, and we set busily to work with a view of rendering her as safe as the limited means in our possession would admit. the body of the boat was of no better material than bark--the bark of a tree unknown. the ribs were of a tough osier, well adapted to the purpose for which it was used. we had fifty feet room from stem to stern, from four to six in breadth, and in depth throughout four feet and a half--the boats thus differing vastly in shape from those of any other inhabitants of the southern ocean with whom civilized nations are acquainted. we never did believe them the workmanship of the ignorant islanders who owned them; and some days after this period discovered, by questioning our captive, that they were in fact made by the natives of a group to the southwest of the country where we found them, having fallen accidentally into the hands of our barbarians. what we could do for the security of our boat was very little indeed. several wide rents were discovered near both ends, and these we contrived to patch up with pieces of woollen jacket. with the help of the superfluous paddles, of which there were a great many, we erected a kind of framework about the bow, so as to break the force of any seas which might threaten to fill us in that quarter. we also set up two paddle-blades for masts, placing them opposite each other, one by each gunwale, thus saving the necessity of a yard. to these masts we attached a sail made of our shirts--doing this with some difficulty, as here we could get no assistance from our prisoner whatever, although he had been willing enough to labour in all the other operations. the sight of the linen seemed to affect him in a very singular manner. he could not be prevailed upon to touch it or go near it, shuddering when we attempted to force him, and shrieking out _tekeli-li!_ having completed our arrangements in regard to the security of the canoe, we now set sail to the south southeast for the present, with the view of weathering the most southerly of the group in sight. this being done, we turned the bow full to the southward. the weather could by no means be considered disagreeable. we had a prevailing and very gentle wind from the northward, a smooth sea, and continual daylight. no ice whatever was to be seen; _nor did i ever see one particle of this after leaving the parallel of bennet's islet_. indeed, the temperature of the water was here far too warm for its existence in any quantity. having killed the largest of our tortoises, and obtained from him not only food, but a copious supply of water, we continued on our course, without any incident of moment, for perhaps seven or eight days, during which period we must have proceeded a vast distance to the southward, as the wind blew constantly with us, and a very strong current set continually in the direction we were pursuing. _march <UNK> many unusual phenomena now indicated that we were entering upon a region of novelty and wonder. a high range of light gray vapour appeared constantly in the southern horizon, flaring up occasionally in lofty streaks, now darting from east to west, now from west to east, and again presenting a level and uniform summit--in short, having all the wild variations of the aurora borealis. the average height of this vapour, as apparent from our station, was about twenty-five degrees. the temperature of the sea seemed to be increasing momentarily, and there was a very perceptible alteration in its colour. [footnote <UNK> for obvious reasons i cannot pretend to strict accuracy in these dates. they are given principally with a view to perspicuity of narration, and as set down in my pencil memoranda.] _march <UNK> to-day, by repeated questioning of our captive, we came to the knowledge of many particulars in regard to the island of the massacre, its inhabitants, and customs--but with these how can i _now_ detain the reader? i may say, however, that we learned there were eight islands in the group--that they were governed by a common king, named _tsalemon_ or _psalemoun_, who resided in one of the smallest of the islands--that the black skins forming the dress of the warriors came from an animal of huge size to be found only in a valley near the court of the king--that the inhabitants of the group fabricated no other boats than the flat-bottomed rafts; the four canoes being all of the kind in their possession, and these having been obtained, by mere accident, from some large island to the southwest--that his own name was nu-nu--that he had no knowledge of bennet's islet--and that the appellation of the island we had left was _tsalal_. the commencement of the words _tsalemon_ and _tsalal_ was given with a prolonged hissing sound, which we found it impossible to imitate, even after repeated endeavours, and which was precisely the same with the note of the black bittern we had eaten upon the summit of the hill. _march <UNK> the heat of the water was now truly remarkable, and its colour was undergoing a rapid change, being no longer transparent, but of a milky consistency and hue. in our immediate vicinity it was usually smooth, never so rough as to endanger the canoe--but we were frequently surprised at perceiving, to our right and left, at different distances, sudden and extensive agitations of the surface--these, we at length noticed, were always preceded by wild flickerings in the region of vapour to the southward. _march <UNK> to-day, with the view of widening our sail, the breeze from the northward dying away perceptibly, i took from my coat-pocket a white handkerchief. nu-nu was seated at my elbow, and the linen accidentally flaring in his face, he became violently affected with convulsions. these were succeeded by drowsiness and stupor, and low murmurings of tekeli-li! tekeli-li! _march <UNK> the wind had entirely ceased, but it was evident that we were still hurrying on to the southward, under the influence of a powerful current. and now, indeed, it would seem reasonable that we should experience some alarm at the turn events were taking--but we felt none. the countenance of peters indicated nothing of this nature, although it wore at times an expression i could not fathom. the polar winter appeared to be coming on--but coming without its terrors. i felt a _numbness_ of body and mind--a dreaminess of sensation--but this was all. _march <UNK> the gray vapour had now arisen many more degrees above the horizon, and was gradually losing its grayness of tint. the heat of the water was extreme, even unpleasant to the touch, and its milky hue was more evident than ever. to-day a violent agitation of the water occurred very close to the canoe. it was attended, as usual, with a wild flaring up of the vapour at its summit, and a momentary division at its base. a fine white powder, resembling ashes--but certainly not such--fell over the canoe and over a large surface of the water, as the flickering died away among the vapour and the commotion subsided in the sea. nu-nu now threw himself on his face in the bottom of the boat, and no persuasions could induce him to arise. _march <UNK> this day we questioned nu-nu concerning the motives of his countrymen in destroying our companions; but he appeared to be too utterly overcome by terror to afford us any rational reply. he still obstinately lay in the bottom of the boat; and, upon our reiterating the questions as to the motive, made use only of idiotic gesticulations, such as raising with his forefinger the upper lip, and displaying the teeth which lay beneath it. these were black. we had never before seen the teeth of an inhabitant of tsalal. _march <UNK> to-day there floated by us one of the white animals whose appearance upon the beach at tsalal had occasioned so wild a commotion among the savages. i would have picked it up, but there came over me a sudden listlessness, and i forbore. the heat of the water still increased, and the hand could no longer be endured within it. peters spoke little, and i knew not what to think of his apathy. nu-nu breathed, and no more. _march <UNK> the white ashy material fell now continually around us, and in vast quantities. the range of vapour to the southward had arisen prodigiously in the horizon, and began to assume more distinctness of form. i can liken it to nothing but a limitless cataract, rolling silently into the sea from some immense and far-distant rampart in the heaven. the gigantic curtain ranged along the whole extent of the southern horizon. it emitted no sound. _march <UNK> a sullen darkness now hovered above us--but from out the milky depths of the ocean a luminous glare arose, and stole up along the bulwarks of the boat. we were nearly overwhelmed by the white ashy shower which settled upon us and upon the canoe, but melted into the water as it fell. the summit of the cataract was utterly lost in the dimness and the distance. yet we were evidently approaching it with a hideous velocity. at intervals there were visible in it wide, yawning, but momentary rents, and from out these rents, within which was a chaos of flitting and indistinct images, there came rushing and mighty, but soundless winds, tearing up the enkindled ocean in their course. _march <UNK> the darkness had materially increased, relieved only by the glare of the water thrown back from the white curtain before us. many gigantic and pallidly white birds flew continuously now from beyond the veil, and their scream was the eternal _tekeli-li!_ as they retreated from our vision. hereupon nu-nu stirred in the bottom of the boat; but, upon touching him, we found his spirit departed. and now we rushed into the embraces of the cataract, where a chasm threw itself open to receive us. but there arose in our pathway a shrouded human figure, very far larger in its proportions than any dweller among men. and the hue of the skin of the figure was of the perfect whiteness of the snow. note. the circumstances connected with the late sudden and distressing death of mr. pym are already well known to the public through the medium of the daily press. it is feared that the few remaining chapters which were to have completed his narrative, and which were retained by him, while the above were in type, for the purpose of revision, have been irrecoverably lost through the accident by which he perished himself. this, however, may prove not to be the case, and the papers, if ultimately found, will be given to the public. no means have been left untried to remedy the deficiency. the gentleman whose name is mentioned in the preface, and who, from the statement there made, might be supposed able to fill the vacuum, has declined the task--this for satisfactory reasons connected with the general inaccuracy of the details afforded him, and his disbelief in the entire truth of the latter portions of the narration. peters, from whom some information might be expected, is still alive, and a resident of illinois, but cannot be met with at present. he may hereafter be found, and will, no doubt, afford material for a conclusion of mr. pym's account. the loss of the two or three final chapters (for there were but two or three) is the more deeply to be regretted, as, it cannot be doubted, they contained matter relative to the pole itself, or at least to regions in its very near proximity; and as, too, the statements of the author in relation to these regions may shortly be verified or contradicted by means of the governmental expedition now preparing for the southern ocean. on one point in the narrative some remarks may be well offered; and it would afford the writer of this appendix much pleasure if what he may here observe should have a tendency to throw credit, in any degree, upon the very singular pages now published. we allude to the chasms found in the island of tsalal, and to the whole of the figures in the latter portion of chapter xxiii. mr. pym has given the figures of the chasms without comment, and speaks decidedly of the _indentures_ found at the extremity of the most easterly of these chasms as having but a fanciful resemblance to alphabetical characters, and, in short, as being positively _not such_. this assertion is made in a manner so simple, and sustained by a species of demonstration so conclusive (viz., the fitting of the projections of the fragments found among the dust into the indentures upon the wall), that we are forced to believe the writer in earnest; and no reasonable reader should suppose otherwise. but as the facts in relation to _all_ the figures are most singular (especially when taken in connexion with statements made in the body of the narrative), it may be as well to say a word or two concerning them all--this, too, the more especially as the facts in question have, beyond doubt, escaped the attention of mr. poe. figure <UNK> then, figure <UNK> figure <UNK> and figure <UNK> when conjoined with one another in the precise order which the chasms themselves presented, and when deprived of the small lateral branches or arches (which, it will be remembered, served only as means of communication between the main chambers, and were of totally distinct character), constitute an ethiopian verbal root--the root [illustration] "to be shady"--whence all the inflections of shadow or darkness. in regard to the "left or most northwardly" of the indentures in figure <UNK> it is more than probable that the opinion of peters was correct, and that the hieroglyphical appearance was really the work of art, and intended as the representation of a human form. the delineation is before the reader, and he may, or may not, perceive the resemblance suggested; but the rest of the indentures afford strong confirmation of peters's idea. the upper range is evidently the arabic verbal root [illustration] "to be white," whence all the inflections of brilliancy and whiteness. the lower range is not so immediately perspicuous. the characters are somewhat broken and disjointed; nevertheless, it cannot be doubted that, in their perfect state, they formed the full egyptian word [illustration] "the region of the south." it should be observed that these interpretations confirm the opinion of peters in regard to the "most northwardly" of the figures. the arm is outstretched towards the south. conclusions such as these open a wide field for speculation and exciting conjecture. they should be regarded, perhaps, in connexion with some of the most faintly-detailed incidents of the narrative; although in no visible manner is this chain of connexion complete. tekeli-li! was the cry of the affrighted natives of tsalal upon discovering the carcass of the _white_ animal picked up at sea. this also was the shuddering exclamation of the captive tsalalian upon encountering the _white_ materials in possession of mr. pym. this also was the shriek of the swift-flying, _white_, and gigantic birds which issued from the vapoury _white_ curtain of the south. nothing _white_ was to be found at tsalal, and nothing otherwise in the subsequent voyage to the region beyond. it is not impossible that "tsalal," the appellation of the island of the chasms, may be found, upon minute philological scrutiny, to betray either some alliance with the chasms themselves, or some reference to the ethiopian characters so mysteriously written in their windings. _"i have graven it within the hills, and my vengeance upon the dust within the rock."_ the end.

the fall of the house of usher son coeur est un luth suspendu; sitot qu'on le touche il resonne. de beranger. during the whole of a dull, dark, and soundless day in the autumn of the year, when the clouds hung oppressively low in the heavens, i had been passing alone, on horseback, through a singularly dreary tract of country; and at length found myself, as the shades of the evening drew on, within view of the melancholy house of usher. i know not how it was--but, with the first glimpse of the building, a sense of insufferable gloom pervaded my spirit. i say insufferable; for the feeling was unrelieved by any of that half-pleasureable, because poetic, sentiment, with which the mind usually receives even the sternest natural images of the desolate or terrible. i looked upon the scene before me--upon the mere house, and the simple landscape features of the domain--upon the bleak walls--upon the vacant eye-like windows--upon a few rank sedges--and upon a few white trunks of decayed trees--with an utter depression of soul which i can compare to no earthly sensation more properly than to the after-dream of the reveller upon opium--the bitter lapse into everyday life--the hideous dropping off of the veil. there was an iciness, a sinking, a sickening of the heart--an unredeemed dreariness of thought which no goading of the imagination could torture into aught of the sublime. what was it--i paused to think--what was it that so unnerved me in the contemplation of the house of usher? it was a mystery all insoluble; nor could i grapple with the shadowy fancies that crowded upon me as i pondered. i was forced to fall back upon the unsatisfactory conclusion, that while, beyond doubt, there are combinations of very simple natural objects which have the power of thus affecting us, still the analysis of this power lies among considerations beyond our depth. it was possible, i reflected, that a mere different arrangement of the particulars of the scene, of the details of the picture, would be sufficient to modify, or perhaps to annihilate its capacity for sorrowful impression; and, acting upon this idea, i reined my horse to the precipitous brink of a black and lurid tarn that lay in unruffled lustre by the dwelling, and gazed down--but with a shudder even more thrilling than before--upon the remodelled and inverted images of the grey sedge, and the ghastly tree-stems, and the vacant and eye-like windows. nevertheless, in this mansion of gloom i now proposed to myself a sojourn of some weeks. its proprietor, roderick usher, had been one of my boon companions in boyhood; but many years had elapsed since our last meeting. a letter, however, had lately reached me in a distant part of the country--a letter from him--which, in its wildly importunate nature, had admitted of no other than a personal reply. the ms gave evidence of nervous agitation. the writer spoke of acute bodily illness--of a mental disorder which oppressed him--and of an earnest desire to see me, as his best, and indeed his only personal friend, with a view of attempting, by the cheerfulness of my society, some alleviation of his malady. it was the manner in which all this, and much more, was said--it was the apparent heart that went with his request--which allowed me no room for hesitation; and i accordingly obeyed forthwith what i still considered a very singular summons. although, as boys, we had been even intimate associates, yet i really knew little of my friend. his reserve had been always excessive and habitual. i was aware, however, that his very ancient family had been noted, time out of mind, for a peculiar sensibility of temperament, displaying itself, through long ages, in many works of exalted art, and manifested, of late, in repeated deeds of munificent yet unobtrusive charity, as well as in a passionate devotion to the intricacies, perhaps even more than to the orthodox and easily recognisable beauties of musical science. i had learned, too, the very remarkable fact, that the stem of the usher race, all time-honoured as it was, had put forth, at no period, any enduring branch; in other words, that the entire family lay in the direct line of descent, and had always, with very trifling and very temporary variation, so lain. it was this deficiency, i considered, while running over in thought the perfect keeping of the character of the premises with the accredited character of the people, and while speculating upon the possible influence which the one, in the long lapse of centuries, might have exercised upon the other--it was this deficiency, perhaps, of collateral issue, and the consequent undeviating transmission, from sire to son, of the patrimony with the name, which had, at length, so identified the two as to merge the original title of the estate in the quaint and equivocal appellation of the "house of usher"--an appellation which seemed to include, in the minds of the peasantry who used it, both the family and the family mansion. i have said that the sole effect of my somewhat childish experiment--that of looking down within the tarn--had been to deepen the first singular impression. there can be no doubt that the consciousness of the rapid increase of my superstition--for why should i not so term it?--served mainly to accelerate the increase itself. such, i have long known, is the paradoxical law of all sentiments having terror as a basis. and it might have been for this reason only, that, when i again uplifted my eyes to the house itself, from its image in the pool, there grew in my mind a strange fancy--a fancy so ridiculous, indeed, that i but mention it to show the vivid force of the sensations which oppressed me. i had so worked upon my imagination as really to believe that about the whole mansion and domain there hung an atmosphere peculiar to themselves and their immediate vicinity--an atmosphere which had no affinity with the air of heaven, but which had reeked up from the decayed trees, and the grey wall, and the silent tarn--a pestilent and mystic vapour, dull, sluggish, faintly discernible, and leaden-hued. shaking off from my spirit what must have been a dream, i scanned more narrowly the real aspect of the building. its principal feature seemed to be that of an excessive antiquity. the discoloration of ages had been great. minute fungi overspread the whole exterior, hanging in a fine tangled web-work from the eaves. yet all this was apart from any extraordinary dilapidation. no portion of the masonry had fallen; and there appeared to be a wild inconsistency between its still perfect adaptation of parts, and the crumbling condition of the individual stones. in this there was much that reminded me of the specious totality of old wood-work which has rotted for long years in some neglected vault, with no disturbance from the breath of the external air. beyond this indication of extensive decay, however, the fabric gave little token of instability. perhaps the eye of a scrutinizing observer might have discovered a barely perceptible fissure, which, extending from the roof of the building in front, made its way down the wall in a zigzag direction, until it became lost in the sullen waters of the tarn. noticing these things, i rode over a short causeway to the house. a servant in waiting took my horse, and i entered the gothic archway of the hall. a valet, of stealthy step, thence conducted me, in silence, through many dark and intricate passages in my progress to the studio of his master. much that i encountered on the way contributed, i know not how, to heighten the vague sentiments of which i have already spoken. while the objects around me--while the carvings of the ceilings, the sombre tapestries of the walls, the ebony blackness of the floors, and the phantasmagoric armorial trophies which rattled as i strode, were but matters to which, or to such as which, i had been accustomed from my infancy--while i hesitated not to acknowledge how familiar was all this--i still wondered to find how unfamiliar were the fancies which ordinary images were stirring up. on one of the staircases, i met the physician of the family. his countenance, i thought, wore a mingled expression of low cunning and perplexity. he accosted me with trepidation and passed on. the valet now threw open a door and ushered me into the presence of his master. the room in which i found myself was very large and lofty. the windows were long, narrow, and pointed, and at so vast a distance from the black oaken floor as to be altogether inaccessible from within. feeble gleams of encrimsoned light made their way through the trellised panes, and served to render sufficiently distinct the more prominent objects around; the eye, however, struggled in vain to reach the remoter angles of the chamber, or the recesses of the vaulted and fretted ceiling. dark draperies hung upon the walls. the general furniture was profuse, comfortless, antique, and tattered. many books and musical instruments lay scattered about, but failed to give any vitality to the scene. i felt that i breathed an atmosphere of sorrow. an air of stern, deep, and irredeemable gloom hung over and pervaded all. upon my entrance, usher rose from a sofa on which he had been lying at full length, and greeted me with a vivacious warmth which had much in it, i at first thought, of an overdone cordiality--of the constrained effort of the ennuye man of the world. a glance, however, at his countenance, convinced me of his perfect sincerity. we sat down; and for some moments, while he spoke not, i gazed upon him with a feeling half of pity, half of awe. surely, man had never before so terribly altered, in so brief a period, as had roderick usher! it was with difficulty that i could bring myself to admit the identity of the man being before me with the companion of my early boyhood. yet the character of his face had been at all times remarkable. a cadaverousness of complexion; an eye large, liquid, and luminous beyond comparison; lips somewhat thin and very pallid, but of a surpassingly beautiful curve; a nose of a delicate hebrew model, but with a breadth of nostril unusual in similar formations; a finely-moulded chin, speaking, in its want of prominence, of a want of moral energy; hair of a more than web-like softness and tenuity; these features, with an inordinate expansion above the regions of the temple, made up altogether a countenance not easily to be forgotten. and now in the mere exaggeration of the prevailing character of these features, and of the expression they were wont to convey, lay so much of change that i doubted to whom i spoke. the now ghastly pallor of the skin, and the now miraculous lustre of the eye, above all things startled and even awed me. the silken hair, too, had been suffered to grow all unheeded, and as, in its wild gossamer texture, it floated rather than fell about the face, i could not, even with effort, connect its arabesque expression with any idea of simple humanity. in the manner of my friend i was at once struck with an incoherence--an inconsistency; and i soon found this to arise from a series of feeble and futile struggles to overcome an habitual trepidancy--an excessive nervous agitation. for something of this nature i had indeed been prepared, no less by his letter, than by reminiscences of certain boyish traits, and by conclusions deduced from his peculiar physical conformation and temperament. his action was alternately vivacious and sullen. his voice varied rapidly from a tremulous indecision (when the animal spirits seemed utterly in abeyance) to that species of energetic concision--that abrupt, weighty, unhurried, and hollow-sounding enunciation--that leaden, self-balanced and perfectly modulated guttural utterance, which may be observed in the lost drunkard, or the irreclaimable eater of opium, during the periods of his most intense excitement. it was thus that he spoke of the object of my visit, of his earnest desire to see me, and of the solace he expected me to afford him. he entered, at some length, into what he conceived to be the nature of his malady. it was, he said, a constitutional and a family evil, and one for which he despaired to find a remedy--a mere nervous affection, he immediately added, which would undoubtedly soon pass off. it displayed itself in a host of unnatural sensations. some of these, as he detailed them, interested and bewildered me; although, perhaps, the terms, and the general manner of the narration had their weight. he suffered much from a morbid acuteness of the senses; the most insipid food was alone endurable; he could wear only garments of certain texture; the odours of all flowers were oppressive; his eyes were tortured by even a faint light; and there were but peculiar sounds, and these from stringed instruments, which did not inspire him with horror. to an anomalous species of terror i found him a bounden slave. "i shall perish," said he, "i must perish in this deplorable folly. thus, thus, and not otherwise, shall i be lost. i dread the events of the future, not in themselves, but in their results. i shudder at the thought of any, even the most trivial, incident, which may operate upon this intolerable agitation of soul. i have, indeed, no abhorrence of danger, except in its absolute effect--in terror. in this unnerved--in this pitiable condition--i feel that the period will sooner or later arrive when i must abandon life and reason together, in some struggle with the grim phantasm, fear." i learned, moreover, at intervals, and through broken and equivocal hints, another singular feature of his mental condition. he was enchained by certain superstitious impressions in regard to the dwelling which he tenanted, and whence, for many years, he had never ventured forth--in regard to an influence whose supposititious force was conveyed in terms too shadowy here to be re-stated--an influence which some peculiarities in the mere form and substance of his family mansion, had, by dint of long sufferance, he said, obtained over his spirit--an effect which the physique of the grey walls and turrets, and of the dim tarn into which they all looked down, had, at length, brought about upon the morale of his existence. he admitted, however, although with hesitation, that much of the peculiar gloom which thus afflicted him could be traced to a more natural and far more palpable origin--to the severe and long-continued illness--indeed to the evidently approaching dissolution--of a tenderly beloved sister--his sole companion for long years--his last and only relative on earth. "her decease," he said, with a bitterness which i can never forget, "would leave him (him the hopeless and the frail) the last of the ancient race of the ushers." while he spoke, the lady madeline (for so was she called) passed slowly through a remote portion of the apartment, and, without having noticed my presence, disappeared. i regarded her with an utter astonishment not unmingled with dread--and yet i found it impossible to account for such feelings. a sensation of stupor oppressed me, as my eyes followed her retreating steps. when a door, at length, closed upon her, my glance sought instinctively and eagerly the countenance of the brother--but he had buried his face in his hands, and i could only perceive that a far more than ordinary wanness had overspread the emaciated fingers through which trickled many passionate tears. the disease of the lady madeline had long baffled the skill of her physicians. a settled apathy, a gradual wasting away of the person, and frequent although transient affections of a partially cataleptical character, were the unusual diagnosis. hitherto she had steadily borne up against the pressure of her malady, and had not betaken herself finally to bed; but, on the closing in of the evening of my arrival at the house, she succumbed (as her brother told me at night with inexpressible agitation) to the prostrating power of the destroyer; and i learned that the glimpse i had obtained of her person would thus probably be the last i should obtain--that the lady, at least while living, would be seen by me no more. for several days ensuing, her name was unmentioned by either usher or myself: and during this period i was busied in earnest endeavours to alleviate the melancholy of my friend. we painted and read together; or i listened, as if in a dream, to the wild improvisations of his speaking guitar. and thus, as a closer and still closer intimacy admitted me more unreservedly into the recesses of his spirit, the more bitterly did i perceive the futility of all attempt at cheering a mind from which darkness, as if an inherent positive quality, poured forth upon all objects of the moral and physical universe, in one unceasing radiation of gloom. i shall ever bear about me a memory of the many solemn hours i thus spent alone with the master of the house of usher. yet i should fail in any attempt to convey an idea of the exact character of the studies, or of the occupations, in which he involved me, or led me the way. an excited and highly distempered ideality threw a sulphureous lustre over all. his long improvised dirges will ring for ever in my ears. among other things, i hold painfully in mind a certain singular perversion and amplification of the wild air of the last waltz of von weber. from the paintings over which his elaborate fancy brooded, and which grew, touch by touch, into vagueness at which i shuddered the more thrillingly, because i shuddered knowing not why;--from these paintings (vivid as their images now are before me) i would in vain endeavour to educe more than a small portion which should lie within the compass of merely written words. by the utter simplicity, by the nakedness of his designs, he arrested and overawed attention. if ever mortal painted an idea, that mortal was roderick usher. for me at least--in the circumstances then surrounding me--there arose out of the pure abstractions which the hypochondriac contrived to throw upon his canvas, an intensity of intolerable awe, no shadow of which felt i ever yet in the contemplation of the certainly glowing yet too concrete reveries of fuseli. one of the phantasmagoric conceptions of my friend, partaking not so rigidly of the spirit of abstraction, may be shadowed forth, although feebly, in words. a small picture presented the interior of an immensely long and rectangular vault or tunnel, with low walls, smooth, white, and without interruption or device. certain accessory points of the design served well to convey the idea that this excavation lay at an exceeding depth below the surface of the earth. no outlet was observed in any portion of its vast extent, and no torch, or other artificial source of light was discernible; yet a flood of intense rays rolled throughout, and bathed the whole in a ghastly and inappropriate splendour. i have just spoken of that morbid condition of the auditory nerve which rendered all music intolerable to the sufferer, with the exception of certain effects of stringed instruments. it was, perhaps, the narrow limits to which he thus confined himself upon the guitar, which gave birth, in great measure, to the fantastic character of the performances. but the fervid facility of his impromptus could not be so accounted for. they must have been, and were, in the notes, as well as in the words of his wild fantasias (for he not unfrequently accompanied himself with rhymed verbal improvisations), the result of that intense mental collectedness and concentration to which i have previously alluded as observable only in particular moments of the highest artificial excitement. the words of one of these rhapsodies i have easily remembered. i was, perhaps, the more forcibly impressed with it, as he gave it, because, in the under or mystic current of its meaning, i fancied that i perceived, and for the first time, a full consciousness on the part of usher, of the tottering of his lofty reason upon her throne. the verses, which were entitled "the haunted palace," ran very nearly, if not accurately, thus: i. in the greenest of our valleys, by good angels tenanted, once a fair and stately palace-- radiant palace--reared its head. in the monarch thought's dominion-- it stood there! never seraph spread a pinion over fabric half so fair. ii. banners yellow, glorious, golden, on its roof did float and flow; (this--all this--was in the olden time long ago) and every gentle air that dallied, in that sweet day, along the ramparts plumed and pallid, a winged odour went away. iii. wanderers in that happy valley through two luminous windows saw spirits moving musically to a lute's well tuned law, round about a throne, where sitting (porphyrogene!) in state his glory well befitting, the ruler of the realm was seen. iv. and all with pearl and ruby glowing was the fair palace door, through which came flowing, flowing, flowing and sparkling evermore, a troop of echoes whose sweet duty was but to sing, in voices of surpassing beauty, the wit and wisdom of their king. v. but evil things, in robes of sorrow, assailed the monarch's high estate; (ah, let us mourn, for never morrow shall dawn upon him, desolate!) and, round about his home, the glory that blushed and bloomed is but a dim-remembered story, of the old time entombed. vi. and travellers now within that valley, through the red-litten windows, see vast forms that move fantastically to a discordant melody; while, like a rapid ghastly river, through the pale door, a hideous throng rush out forever, and laugh--but smile no more. i well remember that suggestions arising from this ballad, led us into a train of thought wherein there became manifest an opinion of usher's which i mention not so much on account of its novelty (for other men* have thought thus,) as on account of the pertinacity with which he maintained it. this opinion, in its general form, was that of the sentience of all vegetable things. but, in his disordered fancy, the idea had assumed a more daring character, and trespassed, under certain conditions, upon the kingdom of inorganization. i lack words to express the full extent, or the earnest abandon of his persuasion. the belief, however, was connected (as i have previously hinted) with the gray stones of the home of his forefathers. the conditions of the sentience had been here, he imagined, fulfilled in the method of collocation of these stones--in the order of their arrangement, as well as in that of the many fungi which overspread them, and of the decayed trees which stood around--above all, in the long undisturbed endurance of this arrangement, and in its reduplication in the still waters of the tarn. its evidence--the evidence of the sentience--was to be seen, he said, (and i here started as he spoke,) in the gradual yet certain condensation of an atmosphere of their own about the waters and the walls. the result was discoverable, he added, in that silent, yet importunate and terrible influence which for centuries had moulded the destinies of his family, and which made him what i now saw him--what he was. such opinions need no comment, and i will make none. our books--the books which, for years, had formed no small portion of the mental existence of the invalid--were, as might be supposed, in strict keeping with this character of phantasm. we pored together over such works as the ververt et chartreuse of gresset; the belphegor of machiavelli; the heaven and hell of swedenborg; the subterranean voyage of nicholas klimm by holberg; the chiromancy of robert flud, of jean d'indagine, and of de la chambre; the journey into the blue distance of tieck; and the city of the sun by campanella. one favourite volume was a small octavo edition of the directorium inquisitorum, by the dominican eymeric de gironne; and there were passages in pomponius mela, about the old african satyrs and oegipans, over which usher would sit dreaming for hours. his chief delight, however, was found in the perusal of an exceedingly rare and curious book in quarto gothic--the manual of a forgotten church--the vigiliae mortuorum secundum chorum ecclesiae maguntinae. i could not help thinking of the wild ritual of this work, and of its probable influence upon the hypochondriac, when, one evening, having informed me abruptly that the lady madeline was no more, he stated his intention of preserving her corpse for a fortnight, (previously to its final interment), in one of the numerous vaults within the main walls of the building. the worldly reason, however, assigned for this singular proceeding, was one which i did not feel at liberty to dispute. the brother had been led to his resolution (so he told me) by consideration of the unusual character of the malady of the deceased, of certain obtrusive and eager inquiries on the part of her medical men, and of the remote and exposed situation of the burial-ground of the family. i will not deny that when i called to mind the sinister countenance of the person whom i met upon the staircase, on the day of my arrival at the house, i had no desire to oppose what i regarded as at best but a harmless, and by no means an unnatural, precaution. at the request of usher, i personally aided him in the arrangements for the temporary entombment. the body having been encoffined, we two alone bore it to its rest. the vault in which we placed it (and which had been so long unopened that our torches, half smothered in its oppressive atmosphere, gave us little opportunity for investigation) was small, damp, and entirely without means of admission for light; lying, at great depth, immediately beneath that portion of the building in which was my own sleeping apartment. it had been used, apparently, in remote feudal times, for the worst purposes of a donjon-keep, and, in later days, as a place of deposit for powder, or some other highly combustible substance, as a portion of its floor, and the whole interior of a long archway through which we reached it, were carefully sheathed with copper. the door, of massive iron, had been, also, similarly protected. its immense weight caused an unusually sharp grating sound, as it moved upon its hinges. having deposited our mournful burden upon tressels within this region of horror, we partially turned aside the yet unscrewed lid of the coffin, and looked upon the face of the tenant. a striking similitude between the brother and sister now first arrested my attention; and usher, divining, perhaps, my thoughts, murmured out some few words from which i learned that the deceased and himself had been twins, and that sympathies of a scarcely intelligible nature had always existed between them. our glances, however, rested not long upon the dead--for we could not regard her unawed. the disease which had thus entombed the lady in the maturity of youth, had left, as usual in all maladies of a strictly cataleptical character, the mockery of a faint blush upon the bosom and the face, and that suspiciously lingering smile upon the lip which is so terrible in death. we replaced and screwed down the lid, and, having secured the door of iron, made our way, with toil, into the scarcely less gloomy apartments of the upper portion of the house. and now, some days of bitter grief having elapsed, an observable change came over the features of the mental disorder of my friend. his ordinary manner had vanished. his ordinary occupations were neglected or forgotten. he roamed from chamber to chamber with hurried, unequal, and objectless step. the pallor of his countenance had assumed, if possible, a more ghastly hue--but the luminousness of his eye had utterly gone out. the once occasional huskiness of his tone was heard no more; and a tremulous quaver, as if of extreme terror, habitually characterized his utterance. there were times, indeed, when i thought his unceasingly agitated mind was labouring with some oppressive secret, to divulge which he struggled for the necessary courage. at times, again, i was obliged to resolve all into the mere inexplicable vagaries of madness, for i beheld him gazing upon vacancy for long hours, in an attitude of the profoundest attention, as if listening to some imaginary sound. it was no wonder that his condition terrified--that it infected me. i felt creeping upon me, by slow yet certain degrees, the wild influences of his own fantastic yet impressive superstitions. it was, especially, upon retiring to bed late in the night of the seventh or eighth day after the placing of the lady madeline within the donjon, that i experienced the full power of such feelings. sleep came not near my couch--while the hours waned and waned away. i struggled to reason off the nervousness which had dominion over me. i endeavoured to believe that much, if not all of what i felt, was due to the bewildering influence of the gloomy furniture of the room--of the dark and tattered draperies, which, tortured into motion by the breath of a rising tempest, swayed fitfully to and fro upon the walls, and rustled uneasily about the decorations of the bed. but my efforts were fruitless. an irrepressible tremor gradually pervaded my frame; and, at length, there sat upon my very heart an incubus of utterly causeless alarm. shaking this off with a gasp and a struggle, i uplifted myself upon the pillows, and, peering earnestly within the intense darkness of the chamber, hearkened--i know not why, except that an instinctive spirit prompted me--to certain low and indefinite sounds which came, through the pauses of the storm, at long intervals, i knew not whence. overpowered by an intense sentiment of horror, unaccountable yet unendurable, i threw on my clothes with haste (for i felt that i should sleep no more during the night,) and endeavoured to arouse myself from the pitiable condition into which i had fallen, by pacing rapidly to and fro through the apartment. i had taken but few turns in this manner, when a light step on an adjoining staircase arrested my attention. i presently recognized it as that of usher. in an instant afterwards he rapped, with a gentle touch, at my door, and entered, bearing a lamp. his countenance was, as usual, cadaverously wan--but, moreover, there was a species of mad hilarity in his eyes--an evidently restrained hysteria in his whole demeanour. his air appalled me--but anything was preferable to the solitude which i had so long endured, and i even welcomed his presence as a relief. "and you have not seen it?" he said abruptly, after having stared about him for some moments in silence--"you have not then seen it?--but, stay! you shall." thus speaking, and having carefully shaded his lamp, he hurried to one of the casements, and threw it freely open to the storm. the impetuous fury of the entering gust nearly lifted us from our feet. it was, indeed, a tempestuous yet sternly beautiful night, and one wildly singular in its terror and its beauty. a whirlwind had apparently collected its force in our vicinity; for there were frequent and violent alterations in the direction of the wind; and the exceeding density of the clouds (which hung so low as to press upon the turrets of the house) did not prevent our perceiving the lifelike velocity with which they flew careering from all points against each other, without passing away into the distance. i say that even their exceeding density did not prevent our perceiving this--yet we had no glimpse of the moon or stars--nor was there any flashing forth of the lightning. but the under surfaces of the huge masses of agitated vapor, as well as all terrestrial objects immediately around us, were glowing in the unnatural light of a faintly luminous and distinctly visible gaseous exhalation which hung about and enshrouded the mansion. "you must not--you shall not behold this!" said i, shudderingly, to usher, as i led him, with a gentle violence, from the window to a seat. "these appearances, which bewilder you, are merely electrical phenomena not uncommon--or it may be that they have their ghastly origin in the rank miasma of the tarn. let us close this casement;--the air is chilling and dangerous to your frame. here is one of your favourite romances. i will read, and you shall listen;--and so we will pass away this terrible night together." the antique volume which i had taken up was the "mad trist" of sir launcelot canning; but i had called it a favourite of usher's more in sad jest than in earnest; for, in truth, there is little in its uncouth and unimaginative prolixity which could have had interest for the lofty and spiritual ideality of my friend. it was, however, the only book immediately at hand; and i indulged a vague hope that the excitement which now agitated the hypochondriac, might find relief (for the history of mental disorder is full of similar anomalies) even in the extremeness of the folly which i should read. could i have judged, indeed, by the wild overstrained air of vivacity with which he hearkened, or apparently hearkened, to the words of the tale, i might well have congratulated myself upon the success of my design. i had arrived at that well-known portion of the story where ethelred, the hero of the trist, having sought in vain for peaceable admission into the dwelling of the hermit, proceeds to make good an entrance by force. here, it will be remembered, the words of the narrative run thus: "and ethelred, who was by nature of a doughty heart, and who was now mighty withal, on account of the powerfulness of the wine which he had drunken, waited no longer to hold parley with the hermit, who, in sooth, was of an obstinate and maliceful turn, but, feeling the rain upon his shoulders, and fearing the rising of the tempest, uplifted his mace outright, and, with blows, made quickly room in the plankings of the door for his gauntleted hand; and now pulling therewith sturdily, he so cracked, and ripped, and tore all asunder, that the noise of the dry and hollow-sounding wood alarmed and reverberated throughout the forest." at the termination of this sentence i started, and for a moment, paused; for it appeared to me (although i at once concluded that my excited fancy had deceived me)--it appeared to me that, from some very remote portion of the mansion, there came, indistinctly, to my ears, what might have been, in its exact similarity of character, the echo (but a stifled and dull one certainly) of the very cracking and ripping sound which sir launcelot had so particularly described. it was, beyond doubt, the coincidence alone which had arrested my attention; for, amid the rattling of the sashes of the casements, and the ordinary commingled noises of the still increasing storm, the sound, in itself, had nothing, surely, which should have interested or disturbed me. i continued the story: "but the good champion ethelred, now entering within the door, was sore enraged and amazed to perceive no signal of the maliceful hermit; but, in the stead thereof, a dragon of a scaly and prodigious demeanour, and of a fiery tongue, which sat in guard before a palace of gold, with a floor of silver; and upon the wall there hung a shield of shining brass with this legend enwritten-- who entereth herein, a conquerer hath bin; who slayeth the dragon, the shield he shall win; and ethelred uplifted his mace, and struck upon the head of the dragon, which fell before him, and gave up his pesty breath, with a shriek so horrid and harsh, and withal so piercing, that ethelred had fain to close his ears with his hands against the dreadful noise of it, the like whereof was never before heard." here again i paused abruptly, and now with a feeling of wild amazement--for there could be no doubt whatever that, in this instance, i did actually hear (although from what direction it proceeded i found it impossible to say) a low and apparently distant, but harsh, protracted, and most unusual screaming or grating sound--the exact counterpart of what my fancy had already conjured up for the dragon's unnatural shriek as described by the romancer. oppressed, as i certainly was, upon the occurrence of the second and most extraordinary coincidence, by a thousand conflicting sensations, in which wonder and extreme terror were predominant, i still retained sufficient presence of mind to avoid exciting, by any observation, the sensitive nervousness of my companion. i was by no means certain that he had noticed the sounds in question; although, assuredly, a strange alteration had, during the last few minutes, taken place in his demeanour. from a position fronting my own, he had gradually brought round his chair, so as to sit with his face to the door of the chamber; and thus i could but partially perceive his features, although i saw that his lips trembled as if he were murmuring inaudibly. his head had dropped upon his breast--yet i knew that he was not asleep, from the wide and rigid opening of the eye as i caught a glance of it in profile. the motion of his body, too, was at variance with this idea--for he rocked from side to side with a gentle yet constant and uniform sway. having rapidly taken notice of all this, i resumed the narrative of sir launcelot, which thus proceeded: "and now, the champion, having escaped from the terrible fury of the dragon, bethinking himself of the brazen shield, and of the breaking up of the enchantment which was upon it, removed the carcass from out of the way before him, and approached valorously over the silver pavement of the castle to where the shield was upon the wall; which in sooth tarried not for his full coming, but fell down at his feet upon the silver floor, with a mighty great and terrible ringing sound." no sooner had these syllables passed my lips, than--as if a shield of brass had indeed, at the moment, fallen heavily upon a floor of silver--i became aware of a distinct, hollow, metallic, and clangorous, yet apparently muffled reverberation. completely unnerved, i leaped to my feet; but the measured rocking movement of usher was undisturbed. i rushed to the chair in which he sat. his eyes were bent fixedly before him, and throughout his whole countenance there reigned a stony rigidity. but, as i placed my hand upon his shoulder, there came a strong shudder over his whole person; a sickly smile quivered about his lips; and i saw that he spoke in a low, hurried, and gibbering murmur, as if unconscious of my presence. bending closely over him, i at length drank in the hideous import of his words. "not hear it?--yes, i hear it, and have heard it. long--long--long--many minutes, many hours, many days, have i heard it--yet i dared not--oh, pity me, miserable wretch that i am!--i dared not--i dared not speak! we have put her living in the tomb! said i not that my senses were acute? i now tell you that i heard her first feeble movements in the hollow coffin. i heard them--many, many days ago--yet i dared not--i dared not speak! and now--to-night--ethelred--ha! ha!--the breaking of the hermit's door, and the death-cry of the dragon, and the clangour of the shield!--say, rather, the rending of her coffin, and the grating of the iron hinges of her prison, and her struggles within the coppered archway of the vault! oh whither shall i fly? will she not be here anon? is she not hurrying to upbraid me for my haste? have i not heard her footsteps on the stair? do i not distinguish that heavy and horrible beating of her heart? madman!" here he sprang furiously to his feet, and shrieked out his syllables, as if in the effort he were giving up his soul--"madman! i tell you that she now stands without the door!" as if in the superhuman energy of his utterance there had been found the potency of a spell--the huge antique panels to which the speaker pointed, threw slowly back, upon the instant, their ponderous and ebony jaws. it was the work of the rushing gust--but then without those doors there did stand the lofty and enshrouded figure of the lady madeline of usher. there was blood upon her white robes, and the evidence of some bitter struggle upon every portion of her emaciated frame. for a moment she remained trembling and reeling to and fro upon the threshold,--then, with a low moaning cry, fell heavily inward upon the person of her brother, and in her violent and now final death-agonies, bore him to the floor a corpse, and a victim to the terrors he had anticipated. from that chamber, and from that mansion, i fled aghast. the storm was still abroad in all its wrath as i found myself crossing the old causeway. suddenly there shot along the path a wild light, and i turned to see whence a gleam so unusual could have issued; for the vast house and its shadows were alone behind me. the radiance was that of the full, setting, and blood-red moon which now shone vividly through that once barely-discernible fissure of which i have before spoken as extending from the roof of the building, in a zigzag direction, to the base. while i gazed, this fissure rapidly widened--there came a fierce breath of the whirlwind--the entire orb of the satellite burst at once upon my sight--my brain reeled as i saw the mighty walls rushing asunder--there was a long tumultuous shouting sound like the voice of a thousand waters--and the deep and dank tarn at my feet closed sullenly and silently over the fragments of the "house of usher". * watson, dr percival, spallanzani, and especially the bishop of landaff.
