the iron heel




foreword


it cannot be said that the everhard manuscript is an important
historical document. to the historian it bristles with errors--not
errors of fact, but errors of interpretation. looking back across the
seven centuries that have lapsed since avis everhard completed her
manuscript, events, and the bearings of events, that were confused and
veiled to her, are clear to us. she lacked perspective. she was too
close to the events she writes about. nay, she was merged in the events
she has described.

nevertheless, as a personal document, the everhard manuscript is of
inestimable value. but here again enter error of perspective, and
vitiation due to the bias of love. yet we smile, indeed, and forgive
avis everhard for the heroic lines upon which she modelled her husband.
we know to-day that he was not so colossal, and that he loomed among the
events of his times less largely than the manuscript would lead us to
believe.

we know that ernest everhard was an exceptionally strong man, but not so
exceptional as his wife thought him to be. he was, after all, but one of
a large number of heroes who, throughout the world, devoted their lives
to the revolution; though it must be conceded that he did unusual
work, especially in his elaboration and interpretation of working-class
philosophy. “proletarian science” and “proletarian philosophy” were his
phrases for it, and therein he shows the provincialism of his mind--a
defect, however, that was due to the times and that none in that day
could escape.

but to return to the manuscript. especially valuable is it in
communicating to us the feel of those terrible times. nowhere do we find
more vividly portrayed the psychology of the persons that lived in
that turbulent period embraced between the years 1912 and 1932--their
mistakes and ignorance, their doubts and fears and misapprehensions,
their ethical delusions, their violent passions, their inconceivable
sordidness and selfishness. these are the things that are so hard for
us of this enlightened age to understand. history tells us that these
things were, and biology and psychology tell us why they were; but
history and biology and psychology do not make these things alive. we
accept them as facts, but we are left without sympathetic comprehension
of them.

this sympathy comes to us, however, as we peruse the everhard
manuscript. we enter into the minds of the actors in that long-ago
world-drama, and for the time being their mental processes are our
mental processes. not alone do we understand avis everhard's love for
her hero-husband, but we feel, as he felt, in those first days, the
vague and terrible loom of the oligarchy. the iron heel (well named) we
feel descending upon and crushing mankind.

and in passing we note that that historic phrase, the iron heel,
originated in ernest everhard's mind. this, we may say, is the one moot
question that this new-found document clears up. previous to this, the
earliest-known use of the phrase occurred in the pamphlet, “ye slaves,”
 written by george milford and published in december, 1912. this george
milford was an obscure agitator about whom nothing is known, save the
one additional bit of information gained from the manuscript, which
mentions that he was shot in the chicago commune. evidently he had
heard ernest everhard make use of the phrase in some public speech, most
probably when he was running for congress in the fall of 1912. from the
manuscript we learn that everhard used the phrase at a private dinner
in the spring of 1912. this is, without discussion, the earliest-known
occasion on which the oligarchy was so designated.

the rise of the oligarchy will always remain a cause of secret wonder
to the historian and the philosopher. other great historical events
have their place in social evolution. they were inevitable. their coming
could have been predicted with the same certitude that astronomers
to-day predict the outcome of the movements of stars. without these
other great historical events, social evolution could not have
proceeded. primitive communism, chattel slavery, serf slavery, and wage
slavery were necessary stepping-stones in the evolution of society.
but it were ridiculous to assert that the iron heel was a necessary
stepping-stone. rather, to-day, is it adjudged a step aside, or a step
backward, to the social tyrannies that made the early world a hell, but
that were as necessary as the iron heel was unnecessary.

black as feudalism was, yet the coming of it was inevitable. what else
than feudalism could have followed upon the breakdown of that great
centralized governmental machine known as the roman empire? not
so, however, with the iron heel. in the orderly procedure of social
evolution there was no place for it. it was not necessary, and it was
not inevitable. it must always remain the great curiosity of history--a
whim, a fantasy, an apparition, a thing unexpected and undreamed; and
it should serve as a warning to those rash political theorists of to-day
who speak with certitude of social processes.

capitalism was adjudged by the sociologists of the time to be the
culmination of bourgeois rule, the ripened fruit of the bourgeois
revolution. and we of to-day can but applaud that judgment. following
upon capitalism, it was held, even by such intellectual and antagonistic
giants as herbert spencer, that socialism would come. out of the decay
of self-seeking capitalism, it was held, would arise that flower of the
ages, the brotherhood of man. instead of which, appalling alike to
us who look back and to those that lived at the time, capitalism,
rotten-ripe, sent forth that monstrous offshoot, the oligarchy.

too late did the socialist movement of the early twentieth century
divine the coming of the oligarchy. even as it was divined, the
oligarchy was there--a fact established in blood, a stupendous and awful
reality. nor even then, as the everhard manuscript well shows, was any
permanence attributed to the iron heel. its overthrow was a matter of
a few short years, was the judgment of the revolutionists. it is true,
they realized that the peasant revolt was unplanned, and that the first
revolt was premature; but they little realized that the second revolt,
planned and mature, was doomed to equal futility and more terrible
punishment.

it is apparent that avis everhard completed the manuscript during the
last days of preparation for the second revolt; hence the fact that
there is no mention of the disastrous outcome of the second revolt.
it is quite clear that she intended the manuscript for immediate
publication, as soon as the iron heel was overthrown, so that her
husband, so recently dead, should receive full credit for all that he
had ventured and accomplished. then came the frightful crushing of the
second revolt, and it is probable that in the moment of danger, ere she
fled or was captured by the mercenaries, she hid the manuscript in the
hollow oak at wake robin lodge.

of avis everhard there is no further record. undoubtedly she was
executed by the mercenaries; and, as is well known, no record of such
executions was kept by the iron heel. but little did she realize, even
then, as she hid the manuscript and prepared to flee, how terrible had
been the breakdown of the second revolt. little did she realize that
the tortuous and distorted evolution of the next three centuries would
compel a third revolt and a fourth revolt, and many revolts, all drowned
in seas of blood, ere the world-movement of labor should come into its
own. and little did she dream that for seven long centuries the tribute
of her love to ernest everhard would repose undisturbed in the heart of
the ancient oak of wake robin lodge.

the iron heel



chapter i

my eagle


the soft summer wind stirs the redwoods, and wild-water ripples sweet
cadences over its mossy stones. there are butterflies in the sunshine,
and from everywhere arises the drowsy hum of bees. it is so quiet and
peaceful, and i sit here, and ponder, and am restless. it is the quiet
that makes me restless. it seems unreal. all the world is quiet, but it
is the quiet before the storm. i strain my ears, and all my senses, for
some betrayal of that impending storm. oh, that it may not be premature!
that it may not be premature!*

     * the second revolt was largely the work of ernest everhard,
     though he cooperated, of course, with the european leaders.
     the capture and secret execution of everhard was the great
     event of the spring of 1932 a.d.  yet so thoroughly had he
     prepared for the revolt, that his fellow-conspirators were
     able, with little confusion or delay, to carry out his
     plans.  it was after everhard's execution that his wife went
     to wake robin lodge, a small bungalow in the sonoma hills of
     california.

small wonder that i am restless. i think, and think, and i cannot
cease from thinking. i have been in the thick of life so long that i
am oppressed by the peace and quiet, and i cannot forbear from dwelling
upon that mad maelstrom of death and destruction so soon to burst forth.
in my ears are the cries of the stricken; and i can see, as i have
seen in the past,* all the marring and mangling of the sweet, beautiful
flesh, and the souls torn with violence from proud bodies and hurled to
god. thus do we poor humans attain our ends, striving through carnage
and destruction to bring lasting peace and happiness upon the earth.

     * without doubt she here refers to the chicago commune.

and then i am lonely. when i do not think of what is to come, i think of
what has been and is no more--my eagle, beating with tireless wings the
void, soaring toward what was ever his sun, the flaming ideal of human
freedom. i cannot sit idly by and wait the great event that is his
making, though he is not here to see. he devoted all the years of his
manhood to it, and for it he gave his life. it is his handiwork. he made
it.*

     * with all respect to avis everhard, it must be pointed out
     that everhard was but one of many able leaders who planned
     the second revolt.  and we to-day, looking back across the
     centuries, can safely say that even had he lived, the second
     revolt would not have been less calamitous in its outcome
     than it was.

and so it is, in this anxious time of waiting, that i shall write of
my husband. there is much light that i alone of all persons living can
throw upon his character, and so noble a character cannot be blazoned
forth too brightly. his was a great soul, and, when my love grows
unselfish, my chiefest regret is that he is not here to witness
to-morrow's dawn. we cannot fail. he has built too stoutly and too
surely for that. woe to the iron heel! soon shall it be thrust back from
off prostrate humanity. when the word goes forth, the labor hosts of all
the world shall rise. there has been nothing like it in the history of
the world. the solidarity of labor is assured, and for the first time
will there be an international revolution wide as the world is wide.*

     * the second revolt was truly international.  it was a
     colossal plan--too colossal to be wrought by the genius of
     one man alone. labor, in all the oligarchies of the world,
     was prepared to rise at the signal.  germany, italy, france,
     and all australasia were labor countries--socialist states.
     they were ready to lend aid to the revolution.  gallantly
     they did; and it was for this reason, when the second revolt
     was crushed, that they, too, were crushed by the united
     oligarchies of the world, their socialist governments being
     replaced by oligarchical governments.

you see, i am full of what is impending. i have lived it day and night
utterly and for so long that it is ever present in my mind. for that
matter, i cannot think of my husband without thinking of it. he was the
soul of it, and how can i possibly separate the two in thought?

as i have said, there is much light that i alone can throw upon his
character. it is well known that he toiled hard for liberty and suffered
sore. how hard he toiled and how greatly he suffered, i well know; for
i have been with him during these twenty anxious years and i know his
patience, his untiring effort, his infinite devotion to the cause for
which, only two months gone, he laid down his life.

i shall try to write simply and to tell here how ernest everhard entered
my life--how i first met him, how he grew until i became a part of him,
and the tremendous changes he wrought in my life. in this way may you
look at him through my eyes and learn him as i learned him--in all save
the things too secret and sweet for me to tell.

it was in february, 1912, that i first met him, when, as a guest of my
father's* at dinner, he came to our house in berkeley. i cannot say that
my very first impression of him was favorable. he was one of many at
dinner, and in the drawing-room where we gathered and waited for all
to arrive, he made a rather incongruous appearance. it was “preacher's
night,” as my father privately called it, and ernest was certainly out
of place in the midst of the churchmen.

     * john cunningham, avis everhard's father, was a professor
     at the state university at berkeley, california.  his chosen
     field was physics, and in addition he did much original
     research and was greatly distinguished as a scientist.  his
     chief contribution to science was his studies of the
     electron and his monumental work on the “identification of
     matter and energy,” wherein he established, beyond cavil and
     for all time, that the ultimate unit of matter and the
     ultimate unit of force were identical.  this idea had been
     earlier advanced, but not demonstrated, by sir oliver lodge
     and other students in the new field of radio-activity.

in the first place, his clothes did not fit him. he wore a ready-made
suit of dark cloth that was ill adjusted to his body. in fact, no
ready-made suit of clothes ever could fit his body. and on this night,
as always, the cloth bulged with his muscles, while the coat between
the shoulders, what of the heavy shoulder-development, was a maze of
wrinkles. his neck was the neck of a prize-fighter,* thick and strong.
so this was the social philosopher and ex-horseshoer my father had
discovered, was my thought. and he certainly looked it with those
bulging muscles and that bull-throat. immediately i classified him--a
sort of prodigy, i thought, a blind tom** of the working class.

     * in that day it was the custom of men to compete for purses
     of money.  they fought with their hands.  when one was
     beaten into insensibility or killed, the survivor took the
     money.

     ** this obscure reference applies to a blind negro musician
     who took the world by storm in the latter half of the
     nineteenth century of the christian era.

and then, when he shook hands with me! his handshake was firm and
strong, but he looked at me boldly with his black eyes--too boldly, i
thought. you see, i was a creature of environment, and at that time had
strong class instincts. such boldness on the part of a man of my own
class would have been almost unforgivable. i know that i could not avoid
dropping my eyes, and i was quite relieved when i passed him on and
turned to greet bishop morehouse--a favorite of mine, a sweet and
serious man of middle age, christ-like in appearance and goodness, and a
scholar as well.

but this boldness that i took to be presumption was a vital clew to the
nature of ernest everhard. he was simple, direct, afraid of nothing, and
he refused to waste time on conventional mannerisms. “you pleased me,”
 he explained long afterward; “and why should i not fill my eyes with
that which pleases me?” i have said that he was afraid of nothing. he
was a natural aristocrat--and this in spite of the fact that he was in
the camp of the non-aristocrats. he was a superman, a blond beast
such as nietzsche* has described, and in addition he was aflame with
democracy.

     * friederich nietzsche, the mad philosopher of the
     nineteenth century of the christian era, who caught wild
     glimpses of truth, but who, before he was done, reasoned
     himself around the great circle of human thought and off
     into madness.

in the interest of meeting the other guests, and what of my unfavorable
impression, i forgot all about the working-class philosopher, though
once or twice at table i noticed him--especially the twinkle in his eye
as he listened to the talk first of one minister and then of another. he
has humor, i thought, and i almost forgave him his clothes. but the time
went by, and the dinner went by, and he never opened his mouth to speak,
while the ministers talked interminably about the working class and its
relation to the church, and what the church had done and was doing for
it. i noticed that my father was annoyed because ernest did not talk.
once father took advantage of a lull and asked him to say something; but
ernest shrugged his shoulders and with an “i have nothing to say” went
on eating salted almonds.

but father was not to be denied. after a while he said:

“we have with us a member of the working class. i am sure that he can
present things from a new point of view that will be interesting and
refreshing. i refer to mr. everhard.”

the others betrayed a well-mannered interest, and urged ernest for
a statement of his views. their attitude toward him was so broadly
tolerant and kindly that it was really patronizing. and i saw that
ernest noted it and was amused. he looked slowly about him, and i saw
the glint of laughter in his eyes.

“i am not versed in the courtesies of ecclesiastical controversy,” he
began, and then hesitated with modesty and indecision.

“go on,” they urged, and dr. hammerfield said: “we do not mind the truth
that is in any man. if it is sincere,” he amended.

“then you separate sincerity from truth?” ernest laughed quickly.

dr. hammerfield gasped, and managed to answer, “the best of us may be
mistaken, young man, the best of us.”

ernest's manner changed on the instant. he became another man.

“all right, then,” he answered; “and let me begin by saying that you
are all mistaken. you know nothing, and worse than nothing, about the
working class. your sociology is as vicious and worthless as is your
method of thinking.”

it was not so much what he said as how he said it. i roused at the first
sound of his voice. it was as bold as his eyes. it was a clarion-call
that thrilled me. and the whole table was aroused, shaken alive from
monotony and drowsiness.

“what is so dreadfully vicious and worthless in our method of thinking,
young man?” dr. hammerfield demanded, and already there was something
unpleasant in his voice and manner of utterance.

“you are metaphysicians. you can prove anything by metaphysics; and
having done so, every metaphysician can prove every other metaphysician
wrong--to his own satisfaction. you are anarchists in the realm of
thought. and you are mad cosmos-makers. each of you dwells in a cosmos
of his own making, created out of his own fancies and desires. you do
not know the real world in which you live, and your thinking has no
place in the real world except in so far as it is phenomena of mental
aberration.

“do you know what i was reminded of as i sat at table and listened to
you talk and talk? you reminded me for all the world of the scholastics
of the middle ages who gravely and learnedly debated the absorbing
question of how many angels could dance on the point of a needle.
why, my dear sirs, you are as remote from the intellectual life of the
twentieth century as an indian medicine-man making incantation in the
primeval forest ten thousand years ago.”

as ernest talked he seemed in a fine passion; his face glowed, his
eyes snapped and flashed, and his chin and jaw were eloquent with
aggressiveness. but it was only a way he had. it always aroused people.
his smashing, sledge-hammer manner of attack invariably made them forget
themselves. and they were forgetting themselves now. bishop morehouse
was leaning forward and listening intently. exasperation and anger were
flushing the face of dr. hammerfield. and others were exasperated, too,
and some were smiling in an amused and superior way. as for myself, i
found it most enjoyable. i glanced at father, and i was afraid he was
going to giggle at the effect of this human bombshell he had been guilty
of launching amongst us.

“your terms are rather vague,” dr. hammerfield interrupted. “just
precisely what do you mean when you call us metaphysicians?”

“i call you metaphysicians because you reason metaphysically,” ernest
went on. “your method of reasoning is the opposite to that of science.
there is no validity to your conclusions. you can prove everything and
nothing, and no two of you can agree upon anything. each of you goes
into his own consciousness to explain himself and the universe. as
well may you lift yourselves by your own bootstraps as to explain
consciousness by consciousness.”

“i do not understand,” bishop morehouse said. “it seems to me that all
things of the mind are metaphysical. that most exact and convincing
of all sciences, mathematics, is sheerly metaphysical. each and every
thought-process of the scientific reasoner is metaphysical. surely you
will agree with me?”

“as you say, you do not understand,” ernest replied. “the metaphysician
reasons deductively out of his own subjectivity. the scientist reasons
inductively from the facts of experience. the metaphysician reasons
from theory to facts, the scientist reasons from facts to theory. the
metaphysician explains the universe by himself, the scientist explains
himself by the universe.”

“thank god we are not scientists,” dr. hammerfield murmured
complacently.

“what are you then?” ernest demanded.

“philosophers.”

“there you go,” ernest laughed. “you have left the real and solid earth
and are up in the air with a word for a flying machine. pray come down
to earth and tell me precisely what you do mean by philosophy.”

“philosophy is--” (dr. hammerfield paused and cleared his
throat)--“something that cannot be defined comprehensively except to
such minds and temperaments as are philosophical. the narrow scientist
with his nose in a test-tube cannot understand philosophy.”

ernest ignored the thrust. it was always his way to turn the point back
upon an opponent, and he did it now, with a beaming brotherliness of
face and utterance.

“then you will undoubtedly understand the definition i shall now make
of philosophy. but before i make it, i shall challenge you to point out
error in it or to remain a silent metaphysician. philosophy is merely
the widest science of all. its reasoning method is the same as that of
any particular science and of all particular sciences. and by that
same method of reasoning, the inductive method, philosophy fuses all
particular sciences into one great science. as spencer says, the data
of any particular science are partially unified knowledge. philosophy
unifies the knowledge that is contributed by all the sciences.
philosophy is the science of science, the master science, if you please.
how do you like my definition?”

“very creditable, very creditable,” dr. hammerfield muttered lamely.

but ernest was merciless.

“remember,” he warned, “my definition is fatal to metaphysics. if you do
not now point out a flaw in my definition, you are disqualified later on
from advancing metaphysical arguments. you must go through life seeking
that flaw and remaining metaphysically silent until you have found it.”

ernest waited. the silence was painful. dr. hammerfield was pained. he
was also puzzled. ernest's sledge-hammer attack disconcerted him. he
was not used to the simple and direct method of controversy. he looked
appealingly around the table, but no one answered for him. i caught
father grinning into his napkin.

“there is another way of disqualifying the metaphysicians,” ernest said,
when he had rendered dr. hammerfield's discomfiture complete. “judge
them by their works. what have they done for mankind beyond the spinning
of airy fancies and the mistaking of their own shadows for gods? they
have added to the gayety of mankind, i grant; but what tangible good
have they wrought for mankind? they philosophized, if you will pardon my
misuse of the word, about the heart as the seat of the emotions, while
the scientists were formulating the circulation of the blood. they
declaimed about famine and pestilence as being scourges of god, while
the scientists were building granaries and draining cities. they
builded gods in their own shapes and out of their own desires, while
the scientists were building roads and bridges. they were describing
the earth as the centre of the universe, while the scientists were
discovering america and probing space for the stars and the laws of
the stars. in short, the metaphysicians have done nothing, absolutely
nothing, for mankind. step by step, before the advance of science, they
have been driven back. as fast as the ascertained facts of science have
overthrown their subjective explanations of things, they have made new
subjective explanations of things, including explanations of the latest
ascertained facts. and this, i doubt not, they will go on doing to
the end of time. gentlemen, a metaphysician is a medicine man.
the difference between you and the eskimo who makes a fur-clad
blubber-eating god is merely a difference of several thousand years of
ascertained facts. that is all.”

“yet the thought of aristotle ruled europe for twelve centuries,” dr.
ballingford announced pompously. “and aristotle was a metaphysician.”

dr. ballingford glanced around the table and was rewarded by nods and
smiles of approval.

“your illustration is most unfortunate,” ernest replied. “you refer to a
very dark period in human history. in fact, we call that period the dark
ages. a period wherein science was raped by the metaphysicians, wherein
physics became a search for the philosopher's stone, wherein chemistry
became alchemy, and astronomy became astrology. sorry the domination of
aristotle's thought!”

dr. ballingford looked pained, then he brightened up and said:

“granted this horrible picture you have drawn, yet you must confess that
metaphysics was inherently potent in so far as it drew humanity out
of this dark period and on into the illumination of the succeeding
centuries.”

“metaphysics had nothing to do with it,” ernest retorted.

“what?” dr. hammerfield cried. “it was not the thinking and the
speculation that led to the voyages of discovery?”

“ah, my dear sir,” ernest smiled, “i thought you were disqualified. you
have not yet picked out the flaw in my definition of philosophy. you are
now on an unsubstantial basis. but it is the way of the metaphysicians,
and i forgive you. no, i repeat, metaphysics had nothing to do with
it. bread and butter, silks and jewels, dollars and cents, and,
incidentally, the closing up of the overland trade-routes to india,
were the things that caused the voyages of discovery. with the fall of
constantinople, in 1453, the turks blocked the way of the caravans to
india. the traders of europe had to find another route. here was the
original cause for the voyages of discovery. columbus sailed to find
a new route to the indies. it is so stated in all the history books.
incidentally, new facts were learned about the nature, size, and form of
the earth, and the ptolemaic system went glimmering.”

dr. hammerfield snorted.

“you do not agree with me?” ernest queried. “then wherein am i wrong?”

“i can only reaffirm my position,” dr. hammerfield retorted tartly. “it
is too long a story to enter into now.”

“no story is too long for the scientist,” ernest said sweetly. “that is
why the scientist gets to places. that is why he got to america.”

i shall not describe the whole evening, though it is a joy to me to
recall every moment, every detail, of those first hours of my coming to
know ernest everhard.

battle royal raged, and the ministers grew red-faced and excited,
especially at the moments when ernest called them romantic philosophers,
shadow-projectors, and similar things. and always he checked them back
to facts. “the fact, man, the irrefragable fact!” he would proclaim
triumphantly, when he had brought one of them a cropper. he bristled
with facts. he tripped them up with facts, ambuscaded them with facts,
bombarded them with broadsides of facts.

“you seem to worship at the shrine of fact,” dr. hammerfield taunted
him.

“there is no god but fact, and mr. everhard is its prophet,” dr.
ballingford paraphrased.

ernest smilingly acquiesced.

“i'm like the man from texas,” he said. and, on being solicited, he
explained. “you see, the man from missouri always says, 'you've got
to show me.' but the man from texas says, 'you've got to put it in my
hand.' from which it is apparent that he is no metaphysician.”

another time, when ernest had just said that the metaphysical
philosophers could never stand the test of truth, dr. hammerfield
suddenly demanded:

“what is the test of truth, young man? will you kindly explain what has
so long puzzled wiser heads than yours?”

“certainly,” ernest answered. his cocksureness irritated them. “the wise
heads have puzzled so sorely over truth because they went up into the
air after it. had they remained on the solid earth, they would have
found it easily enough--ay, they would have found that they themselves
were precisely testing truth with every practical act and thought of
their lives.”

“the test, the test,” dr. hammerfield repeated impatiently. “never mind
the preamble. give us that which we have sought so long--the test of
truth. give it us, and we will be as gods.”

there was an impolite and sneering scepticism in his words and manner
that secretly pleased most of them at the table, though it seemed to
bother bishop morehouse.

“dr. jordan* has stated it very clearly,” ernest said. “his test of
truth is: 'will it work? will you trust your life to it?'”

     * a noted educator of the late nineteenth and early
     twentieth centuries of the christian era.  he was president
     of the stanford university, a private benefaction of the
     times.

“pish!” dr. hammerfield sneered. “you have not taken bishop berkeley*
into account. he has never been answered.”

     * an idealistic monist who long puzzled the philosophers of
     that time with his denial of the existence of matter, but
     whose clever argument was finally demolished when the new
     empiric facts of science were philosophically generalized.

“the noblest metaphysician of them all,” ernest laughed. “but your
example is unfortunate. as berkeley himself attested, his metaphysics
didn't work.”

dr. hammerfield was angry, righteously angry. it was as though he had
caught ernest in a theft or a lie.

“young man,” he trumpeted, “that statement is on a par with all you have
uttered to-night. it is a base and unwarranted assumption.”

“i am quite crushed,” ernest murmured meekly. “only i don't know what
hit me. you'll have to put it in my hand, doctor.”

“i will, i will,” dr. hammerfield spluttered. “how do you know? you
do not know that bishop berkeley attested that his metaphysics did not
work. you have no proof. young man, they have always worked.”

“i take it as proof that berkeley's metaphysics did not work, because--”
 ernest paused calmly for a moment. “because berkeley made an invariable
practice of going through doors instead of walls. because he trusted his
life to solid bread and butter and roast beef. because he shaved himself
with a razor that worked when it removed the hair from his face.”

“but those are actual things!” dr. hammerfield cried. “metaphysics is of
the mind.”

“and they work--in the mind?” ernest queried softly.

the other nodded.

“and even a multitude of angels can dance on the point of a needle--in
the mind,” ernest went on reflectively. “and a blubber-eating, fur-clad
god can exist and work--in the mind; and there are no proofs to the
contrary--in the mind. i suppose, doctor, you live in the mind?”

“my mind to me a kingdom is,” was the answer.

“that's another way of saying that you live up in the air. but you come
back to earth at meal-time, i am sure, or when an earthquake happens
along. or, tell me, doctor, do you have no apprehension in an earthquake
that that incorporeal body of yours will be hit by an immaterial brick?”

instantly, and quite unconsciously, dr. hammerfield's hand shot up to
his head, where a scar disappeared under the hair. it happened that
ernest had blundered on an apposite illustration. dr. hammerfield
had been nearly killed in the great earthquake* by a falling chimney.
everybody broke out into roars of laughter.

     * the great earthquake of 1906 a.d. that destroyed san
     francisco.

“well?” ernest asked, when the merriment had subsided. “proofs to the
contrary?”

and in the silence he asked again, “well?” then he added, “still well,
but not so well, that argument of yours.”

but dr. hammerfield was temporarily crushed, and the battle raged on in
new directions. on point after point, ernest challenged the ministers.
when they affirmed that they knew the working class, he told them
fundamental truths about the working class that they did not know, and
challenged them for disproofs. he gave them facts, always facts, checked
their excursions into the air, and brought them back to the solid earth
and its facts.

how the scene comes back to me! i can hear him now, with that war-note
in his voice, flaying them with his facts, each fact a lash that stung
and stung again. and he was merciless. he took no quarter,* and gave
none. i can never forget the flaying he gave them at the end:

     * this figure arises from the customs of the times.  when,
     among men fighting to the death in their wild-animal way, a
     beaten man threw down his weapons, it was at the option of
     the victor to slay him or spare him.

“you have repeatedly confessed to-night, by direct avowal or ignorant
statement, that you do not know the working class. but you are not to be
blamed for this. how can you know anything about the working class? you
do not live in the same locality with the working class. you herd
with the capitalist class in another locality. and why not? it is the
capitalist class that pays you, that feeds you, that puts the very
clothes on your backs that you are wearing to-night. and in return you
preach to your employers the brands of metaphysics that are especially
acceptable to them; and the especially acceptable brands are acceptable
because they do not menace the established order of society.”

here there was a stir of dissent around the table.

“oh, i am not challenging your sincerity,” ernest continued. “you are
sincere. you preach what you believe. there lies your strength and your
value--to the capitalist class. but should you change your belief to
something that menaces the established order, your preaching would
be unacceptable to your employers, and you would be discharged. every
little while some one or another of you is so discharged.* am i not
right?”

     * during this period there were many ministers cast out of
     the church for preaching unacceptable doctrine.  especially
     were they cast out when their preaching became tainted with
     socialism.

this time there was no dissent. they sat dumbly acquiescent, with the
exception of dr. hammerfield, who said:

“it is when their thinking is wrong that they are asked to resign.”

“which is another way of saying when their thinking is unacceptable,”
 ernest answered, and then went on. “so i say to you, go ahead and preach
and earn your pay, but for goodness' sake leave the working class alone.
you belong in the enemy's camp. you have nothing in common with the
working class. your hands are soft with the work others have performed
for you. your stomachs are round with the plenitude of eating.” (here
dr. ballingford winced, and every eye glanced at his prodigious girth.
it was said he had not seen his own feet in years.) “and your minds are
filled with doctrines that are buttresses of the established order. you
are as much mercenaries (sincere mercenaries, i grant) as were the men
of the swiss guard.* be true to your salt and your hire; guard, with
your preaching, the interests of your employers; but do not come down to
the working class and serve as false leaders. you cannot honestly be in
the two camps at once. the working class has done without you. believe
me, the working class will continue to do without you. and, furthermore,
the working class can do better without you than with you.”

     france that was beheaded by his people.



chapter ii

challenges.


after the guests had gone, father threw himself into a chair and gave
vent to roars of gargantuan laughter. not since the death of my mother
had i known him to laugh so heartily.

“i'll wager dr. hammerfield was never up against anything like it in his
life,” he laughed. “'the courtesies of ecclesiastical controversy!' did
you notice how he began like a lamb--everhard, i mean, and how quickly
he became a roaring lion? he has a splendidly disciplined mind. he would
have made a good scientist if his energies had been directed that way.”

i need scarcely say that i was deeply interested in ernest everhard. it
was not alone what he had said and how he had said it, but it was the
man himself. i had never met a man like him. i suppose that was why, in
spite of my twenty-four years, i had not married. i liked him; i had to
confess it to myself. and my like for him was founded on things
beyond intellect and argument. regardless of his bulging muscles and
prize-fighter's throat, he impressed me as an ingenuous boy. i felt
that under the guise of an intellectual swashbuckler was a delicate and
sensitive spirit. i sensed this, in ways i knew not, save that they were
my woman's intuitions.

there was something in that clarion-call of his that went to my heart.
it still rang in my ears, and i felt that i should like to hear it
again--and to see again that glint of laughter in his eyes that belied
the impassioned seriousness of his face. and there were further reaches
of vague and indeterminate feelings that stirred in me. i almost loved
him then, though i am confident, had i never seen him again, that the
vague feelings would have passed away and that i should easily have
forgotten him.

but i was not destined never to see him again. my father's new-born
interest in sociology and the dinner parties he gave would not permit.
father was not a sociologist. his marriage with my mother had been very
happy, and in the researches of his own science, physics, he had been
very happy. but when mother died, his own work could not fill the
emptiness. at first, in a mild way, he had dabbled in philosophy; then,
becoming interested, he had drifted on into economics and sociology. he
had a strong sense of justice, and he soon became fired with a passion
to redress wrong. it was with gratitude that i hailed these signs of a
new interest in life, though i little dreamed what the outcome would
be. with the enthusiasm of a boy he plunged excitedly into these new
pursuits, regardless of whither they led him.

he had been used always to the laboratory, and so it was that he turned
the dining room into a sociological laboratory. here came to dinner
all sorts and conditions of men,--scientists, politicians, bankers,
merchants, professors, labor leaders, socialists, and anarchists. he
stirred them to discussion, and analyzed their thoughts of life and
society.

he had met ernest shortly prior to the “preacher's night.” and after the
guests were gone, i learned how he had met him, passing down a street at
night and stopping to listen to a man on a soap-box who was addressing
a crowd of workingmen. the man on the box was ernest. not that he was
a mere soap-box orator. he stood high in the councils of the socialist
party, was one of the leaders, and was the acknowledged leader in the
philosophy of socialism. but he had a certain clear way of stating the
abstruse in simple language, was a born expositor and teacher, and
was not above the soap-box as a means of interpreting economics to the
workingmen.

my father stopped to listen, became interested, effected a meeting, and,
after quite an acquaintance, invited him to the ministers' dinner. it
was after the dinner that father told me what little he knew about him.
he had been born in the working class, though he was a descendant of
the old line of everhards that for over two hundred years had lived
in america.* at ten years of age he had gone to work in the mills,
and later he served his apprenticeship and became a horseshoer. he was
self-educated, had taught himself german and french, and at that time
was earning a meagre living by translating scientific and philosophical
works for a struggling socialist publishing house in chicago. also, his
earnings were added to by the royalties from the small sales of his own
economic and philosophic works.

     * the distinction between being native born and foreign born
     was sharp and invidious in those days.

this much i learned of him before i went to bed, and i lay long awake,
listening in memory to the sound of his voice. i grew frightened at
my thoughts. he was so unlike the men of my own class, so alien and so
strong. his masterfulness delighted me and terrified me, for my fancies
wantonly roved until i found myself considering him as a lover, as a
husband. i had always heard that the strength of men was an irresistible
attraction to women; but he was too strong. “no! no!” i cried out. “it
is impossible, absurd!” and on the morrow i awoke to find in myself
a longing to see him again. i wanted to see him mastering men in
discussion, the war-note in his voice; to see him, in all his certitude
and strength, shattering their complacency, shaking them out of their
ruts of thinking. what if he did swashbuckle? to use his own phrase, “it
worked,” it produced effects. and, besides, his swashbuckling was a fine
thing to see. it stirred one like the onset of battle.

several days passed during which i read ernest's books, borrowed from my
father. his written word was as his spoken word, clear and convincing.
it was its absolute simplicity that convinced even while one continued
to doubt. he had the gift of lucidity. he was the perfect expositor.
yet, in spite of his style, there was much that i did not like. he laid
too great stress on what he called the class struggle, the antagonism
between labor and capital, the conflict of interest.

father reported with glee dr. hammerfield's judgment of ernest, which
was to the effect that he was “an insolent young puppy, made bumptious
by a little and very inadequate learning.” also, dr. hammerfield
declined to meet ernest again.

but bishop morehouse turned out to have become interested in ernest,
and was anxious for another meeting. “a strong young man,” he said; “and
very much alive, very much alive. but he is too sure, too sure.”

ernest came one afternoon with father. the bishop had already arrived,
and we were having tea on the veranda. ernest's continued presence in
berkeley, by the way, was accounted for by the fact that he was taking
special courses in biology at the university, and also that he was hard
at work on a new book entitled “philosophy and revolution.” *

     * this book continued to be secretly printed throughout the
     three centuries of the iron heel.  there are several copies
     of various editions in the national library of ardis.

the veranda seemed suddenly to have become small when ernest arrived.
not that he was so very large--he stood only five feet nine inches; but
that he seemed to radiate an atmosphere of largeness. as he stopped to
meet me, he betrayed a certain slight awkwardness that was strangely at
variance with his bold-looking eyes and his firm, sure hand that clasped
for a moment in greeting. and in that moment his eyes were just as
steady and sure. there seemed a question in them this time, and as
before he looked at me over long.

“i have been reading your 'working-class philosophy,'” i said, and his
eyes lighted in a pleased way.

“of course,” he answered, “you took into consideration the audience to
which it was addressed.”

“i did, and it is because i did that i have a quarrel with you,” i
challenged.

“i, too, have a quarrel with you, mr. everhard,” bishop morehouse said.

ernest shrugged his shoulders whimsically and accepted a cup of tea.

the bishop bowed and gave me precedence.

“you foment class hatred,” i said. “i consider it wrong and criminal
to appeal to all that is narrow and brutal in the working class. class
hatred is anti-social, and, it seems to me, anti-socialistic.”

“not guilty,” he answered. “class hatred is neither in the text nor in
the spirit of anything i have ever written.”

“oh!” i cried reproachfully, and reached for his book and opened it.

he sipped his tea and smiled at me while i ran over the pages.

“page one hundred and thirty-two,” i read aloud: “'the class struggle,
therefore, presents itself in the present stage of social development
between the wage-paying and the wage-paid classes.'”

i looked at him triumphantly.

“no mention there of class hatred,” he smiled back.

“but,” i answered, “you say 'class struggle.'”

“a different thing from class hatred,” he replied. “and, believe me,
we foment no hatred. we say that the class struggle is a law of social
development. we are not responsible for it. we do not make the class
struggle. we merely explain it, as newton explained gravitation. we
explain the nature of the conflict of interest that produces the class
struggle.”

“but there should be no conflict of interest!” i cried.

“i agree with you heartily,” he answered. “that is what we socialists
are trying to bring about,--the abolition of the conflict of interest.
pardon me. let me read an extract.” he took his book and turned back
several pages. “page one hundred and twenty-six: 'the cycle of class
struggles which began with the dissolution of rude, tribal communism
and the rise of private property will end with the passing of private
property in the means of social existence.'”

“but i disagree with you,” the bishop interposed, his pale, ascetic face
betraying by a faint glow the intensity of his feelings. “your premise
is wrong. there is no such thing as a conflict of interest between labor
and capital--or, rather, there ought not to be.”

“thank you,” ernest said gravely. “by that last statement you have given
me back my premise.”

“but why should there be a conflict?” the bishop demanded warmly.

ernest shrugged his shoulders. “because we are so made, i guess.”

“but we are not so made!” cried the other.

“are you discussing the ideal man?” ernest asked, “--unselfish and
godlike, and so few in numbers as to be practically non-existent, or are
you discussing the common and ordinary average man?”

“the common and ordinary man,” was the answer.

“who is weak and fallible, prone to error?”

bishop morehouse nodded.

“and petty and selfish?”

again he nodded.

“watch out!” ernest warned. “i said 'selfish.'”

“the average man is selfish,” the bishop affirmed valiantly.

“wants all he can get?”

“wants all he can get--true but deplorable.”

“then i've got you.” ernest's jaw snapped like a trap. “let me show you.
here is a man who works on the street railways.”

“he couldn't work if it weren't for capital,” the bishop interrupted.

“true, and you will grant that capital would perish if there were no
labor to earn the dividends.”

the bishop was silent.

“won't you?” ernest insisted.

the bishop nodded.

“then our statements cancel each other,” ernest said in a matter-of-fact
tone, “and we are where we were. now to begin again. the workingmen
on the street railway furnish the labor. the stockholders furnish the
capital. by the joint effort of the workingmen and the capital, money is
earned.* they divide between them this money that is earned. capital's
share is called 'dividends.' labor's share is called 'wages.'”

     * in those days, groups of predatory individuals controlled
     all the means of transportation, and for the use of same
     levied toll upon the public.

“very good,” the bishop interposed. “and there is no reason that the
division should not be amicable.”

“you have already forgotten what we had agreed upon,” ernest replied.
“we agreed that the average man is selfish. he is the man that is. you
have gone up in the air and are arranging a division between the kind
of men that ought to be but are not. but to return to the earth, the
workingman, being selfish, wants all he can get in the division. the
capitalist, being selfish, wants all he can get in the division. when
there is only so much of the same thing, and when two men want all they
can get of the same thing, there is a conflict of interest between labor
and capital. and it is an irreconcilable conflict. as long as workingmen
and capitalists exist, they will continue to quarrel over the division.
if you were in san francisco this afternoon, you'd have to walk. there
isn't a street car running.”

“another strike?” * the bishop queried with alarm.

     * these quarrels were very common in those irrational and
     anarchic times.  sometimes the laborers refused to work.
     sometimes the capitalists refused to let the laborers work.
     in the violence and turbulence of such disagreements much
     property was destroyed and many lives lost.  all this is
     inconceivable to us--as inconceivable as another custom of
     that time, namely, the habit the men of the lower classes
     had of breaking the furniture when they quarrelled with
     their wives.

“yes, they're quarrelling over the division of the earnings of the
street railways.”

bishop morehouse became excited.

“it is wrong!” he cried. “it is so short-sighted on the part of the
workingmen. how can they hope to keep our sympathy--”

“when we are compelled to walk,” ernest said slyly.

but bishop morehouse ignored him and went on:

“their outlook is too narrow. men should be men, not brutes. there will
be violence and murder now, and sorrowing widows and orphans. capital
and labor should be friends. they should work hand in hand and to their
mutual benefit.”

“ah, now you are up in the air again,” ernest remarked dryly. “come back
to earth. remember, we agreed that the average man is selfish.”

“but he ought not to be!” the bishop cried.

“and there i agree with you,” was ernest's rejoinder. “he ought not to
be selfish, but he will continue to be selfish as long as he lives in a
social system that is based on pig-ethics.”

the bishop was aghast, and my father chuckled.

“yes, pig-ethics,” ernest went on remorselessly. “that is the meaning
of the capitalist system. and that is what your church is standing
for, what you are preaching for every time you get up in the pulpit.
pig-ethics! there is no other name for it.”

bishop morehouse turned appealingly to my father, but he laughed and
nodded his head.

“i'm afraid mr. everhard is right,” he said. “laissez-faire, the
let-alone policy of each for himself and devil take the hindmost. as mr.
everhard said the other night, the function you churchmen perform is to
maintain the established order of society, and society is established on
that foundation.”

“but that is not the teaching of christ!” cried the bishop.

“the church is not teaching christ these days,” ernest put in quickly.
“that is why the workingmen will have nothing to do with the church.
the church condones the frightful brutality and savagery with which the
capitalist class treats the working class.”

“the church does not condone it,” the bishop objected.

“the church does not protest against it,” ernest replied. “and in so far
as the church does not protest, it condones, for remember the church is
supported by the capitalist class.”

“i had not looked at it in that light,” the bishop said naively. “you
must be wrong. i know that there is much that is sad and wicked in
this world. i know that the church has lost the--what you call the
proletariat.” *

     * proletariat: derived originally from the latin proletarii,
     the name given in the census of servius tullius to those who
     were of value to the state only as the rearers of offspring
     (proles); in other words, they were of no importance either
     for wealth, or position, or exceptional ability.

“you never had the proletariat,” ernest cried. “the proletariat has
grown up outside the church and without the church.”

“i do not follow you,” the bishop said faintly.

“then let me explain. with the introduction of machinery and the factory
system in the latter part of the eighteenth century, the great mass of
the working people was separated from the land. the old system of labor
was broken down. the working people were driven from their villages and
herded in factory towns. the mothers and children were put to work at
the new machines. family life ceased. the conditions were frightful. it
is a tale of blood.”

“i know, i know,” bishop morehouse interrupted with an agonized
expression on his face. “it was terrible. but it occurred a century and
a half ago.”

“and there, a century and a half ago, originated the modern
proletariat,” ernest continued. “and the church ignored it. while a
slaughter-house was made of the nation by the capitalist, the church
was dumb. it did not protest, as to-day it does not protest. as austin
lewis* says, speaking of that time, those to whom the command 'feed my
lambs' had been given, saw those lambs sold into slavery and worked to
death without a protest.** the church was dumb, then, and before i go on
i want you either flatly to agree with me or flatly to disagree with me.
was the church dumb then?”

     * candidate for governor of california on the socialist
     ticket in the fall election of 1906 christian era.  an
     englishman by birth, a writer of many books on political
     economy and philosophy, and one of the socialist leaders of
     the times.

     ** there is no more horrible page in history than the
     treatment of the child and women slaves in the english
     factories in the latter half of the eighteenth century of
     the christian era.  in such industrial hells arose some of
     the proudest fortunes of that day.

bishop morehouse hesitated. like dr. hammerfield, he was unused to this
fierce “infighting,” as ernest called it.

“the history of the eighteenth century is written,” ernest prompted. “if
the church was not dumb, it will be found not dumb in the books.”

“i am afraid the church was dumb,” the bishop confessed.

“and the church is dumb to-day.”

“there i disagree,” said the bishop.

ernest paused, looked at him searchingly, and accepted the challenge.

“all right,” he said. “let us see. in chicago there are women who toil
all the week for ninety cents. has the church protested?”

“this is news to me,” was the answer. “ninety cents per week! it is
horrible!”

“has the church protested?” ernest insisted.

“the church does not know.” the bishop was struggling hard.

“yet the command to the church was, 'feed my lambs,'” ernest sneered.
and then, the next moment, “pardon my sneer, bishop. but can you
wonder that we lose patience with you? when have you protested to your
capitalistic congregations at the working of children in the southern
cotton mills?* children, six and seven years of age, working every night
at twelve-hour shifts? they never see the blessed sunshine. they die
like flies. the dividends are paid out of their blood. and out of the
dividends magnificent churches are builded in new england, wherein your
kind preaches pleasant platitudes to the sleek, full-bellied recipients
of those dividends.”

     * everhard might have drawn a better illustration from the
     southern church's outspoken defence of chattel slavery prior
     to what is known as the “war of the rebellion.”  several
     such illustrations, culled from the documents of the times,
     are here appended.  in 1835 a.d., the general assembly of
     the presbyterian church resolved that: “slavery is
     recognized in both the old and the new testaments, and is
     not condemned by the authority of god.”  the charleston
     baptist association issued the following, in an address, in
     1835 a.d.: “the right of masters to dispose of the time of
     their slaves has been distinctly recognized by the creator
     of all things, who is surely at liberty to vest the right of
     property over any object whomsoever he pleases.”  the rev.
     e. d. simon, doctor of divinity and professor in the
     randolph-macon methodist college of virginia, wrote:
     “extracts from holy writ unequivocally assert the right of
     property in slaves, together with the usual incidents to
     that right.  the right to buy and sell is clearly stated.
     upon the whole, then, whether we consult the jewish policy
     instituted by god himself, or the uniform opinion and
     practice of mankind in all ages, or the injunctions of the
     new testament and the moral law, we are brought to the
     conclusion that slavery is not immoral.  having established
     the point that the first african slaves were legally brought
     into bondage, the right to detain their children in bondage
     follows as an indispensable consequence.  thus we see that
     the slavery that exists in america was founded in right.”

     it is not at all remarkable that this same note should have
     been struck by the church a generation or so later in
     relation to the defence of capitalistic property.  in the
     great museum at asgard there is a book entitled “essays in
     application,” written by henry van dyke.  the book was
     published in 1905 of the christian era. from what we can
     make out, van dyke must have been a churchman. the book is a
     good example of what everhard would have called bourgeois
     thinking.  note the similarity between the utterance of the
     charleston baptist association quoted above, and the
     following utterance of van dyke seventy years later: “the
     bible teaches that god owns the world.  he distributes to
     every man according to his own good pleasure, conformably to
     general laws.”

“i did not know,” the bishop murmured faintly. his face was pale, and he
seemed suffering from nausea.

“then you have not protested?”

the bishop shook his head.

“then the church is dumb to-day, as it was in the eighteenth century?”

the bishop was silent, and for once ernest forbore to press the point.

“and do not forget, whenever a churchman does protest, that he is
discharged.”

“i hardly think that is fair,” was the objection.

“will you protest?” ernest demanded.

“show me evils, such as you mention, in our own community, and i will
protest.”

“i'll show you,” ernest said quietly. “i am at your disposal. i will
take you on a journey through hell.”

“and i shall protest.” the bishop straightened himself in his chair, and
over his gentle face spread the harshness of the warrior. “the church
shall not be dumb!”

“you will be discharged,” was the warning.

“i shall prove the contrary,” was the retort. “i shall prove, if
what you say is so, that the church has erred through ignorance. and,
furthermore, i hold that whatever is horrible in industrial society is
due to the ignorance of the capitalist class. it will mend all that is
wrong as soon as it receives the message. and this message it shall be
the duty of the church to deliver.”

ernest laughed. he laughed brutally, and i was driven to the bishop's
defence.

“remember,” i said, “you see but one side of the shield. there is
much good in us, though you give us credit for no good at all. bishop
morehouse is right. the industrial wrong, terrible as you say it is,
is due to ignorance. the divisions of society have become too widely
separated.”

“the wild indian is not so brutal and savage as the capitalist class,”
 he answered; and in that moment i hated him.

“you do not know us,” i answered. “we are not brutal and savage.”

“prove it,” he challenged.

“how can i prove it . . . to you?” i was growing angry.

he shook his head. “i do not ask you to prove it to me. i ask you to
prove it to yourself.”

“i know,” i said.

“you know nothing,” was his rude reply.

“there, there, children,” father said soothingly.

“i don't care--” i began indignantly, but ernest interrupted.

“i understand you have money, or your father has, which is the same
thing--money invested in the sierra mills.”

“what has that to do with it?” i cried.

“nothing much,” he began slowly, “except that the gown you wear is
stained with blood. the food you eat is a bloody stew. the blood of
little children and of strong men is dripping from your very roof-beams.
i can close my eyes, now, and hear it drip, drop, drip, drop, all about
me.”

and suiting the action to the words, he closed his eyes and leaned back
in his chair. i burst into tears of mortification and hurt vanity. i had
never been so brutally treated in my life. both the bishop and my father
were embarrassed and perturbed. they tried to lead the conversation
away into easier channels; but ernest opened his eyes, looked at me,
and waved them aside. his mouth was stern, and his eyes too; and in the
latter there was no glint of laughter. what he was about to say, what
terrible castigation he was going to give me, i never knew; for at that
moment a man, passing along the sidewalk, stopped and glanced in at us.
he was a large man, poorly dressed, and on his back was a great load of
rattan and bamboo stands, chairs, and screens. he looked at the house as
if debating whether or not he should come in and try to sell some of his
wares.

“that man's name is jackson,” ernest said.

“with that strong body of his he should be at work, and not peddling,” *
i answered curtly.

     * in that day there were many thousands of these poor
     merchants called pedlers.  they carried their whole stock in
     trade from door to door.  it was a most wasteful expenditure
     of energy. distribution was as confused and irrational as
     the whole general system of society.

“notice the sleeve of his left arm,” ernest said gently.

i looked, and saw that the sleeve was empty.

“it was some of the blood from that arm that i heard dripping from your
roof-beams,” ernest said with continued gentleness. “he lost his arm in
the sierra mills, and like a broken-down horse you turned him out on
the highway to die. when i say 'you,' i mean the superintendent and the
officials that you and the other stockholders pay to manage the mills
for you. it was an accident. it was caused by his trying to save the
company a few dollars. the toothed drum of the picker caught his arm. he
might have let the small flint that he saw in the teeth go through. it
would have smashed out a double row of spikes. but he reached for the
flint, and his arm was picked and clawed to shreds from the finger tips
to the shoulder. it was at night. the mills were working overtime. they
paid a fat dividend that quarter. jackson had been working many hours,
and his muscles had lost their resiliency and snap. they made his
movements a bit slow. that was why the machine caught him. he had a wife
and three children.”

“and what did the company do for him?” i asked.

“nothing. oh, yes, they did do something. they successfully fought the
damage suit he brought when he came out of hospital. the company employs
very efficient lawyers, you know.”

“you have not told the whole story,” i said with conviction. “or else
you do not know the whole story. maybe the man was insolent.”

“insolent! ha! ha!” his laughter was mephistophelian. “great god!
insolent! and with his arm chewed off! nevertheless he was a meek and
lowly servant, and there is no record of his having been insolent.”

“but the courts,” i urged. “the case would not have been decided against
him had there been no more to the affair than you have mentioned.”

“colonel ingram is leading counsel for the company. he is a shrewd
lawyer.” ernest looked at me intently for a moment, then went on. “i'll
tell you what you do, miss cunningham. you investigate jackson's case.”

“i had already determined to,” i said coldly.

“all right,” he beamed good-naturedly, “and i'll tell you where to
find him. but i tremble for you when i think of all you are to prove by
jackson's arm.”

and so it came about that both the bishop and i accepted ernest's
challenges. they went away together, leaving me smarting with a sense
of injustice that had been done me and my class. the man was a beast. i
hated him, then, and consoled myself with the thought that his behavior
was what was to be expected from a man of the working class.



chapter iii

jackson's arm.


little did i dream the fateful part jackson's arm was to play in my
life. jackson himself did not impress me when i hunted him out. i found
him in a crazy, ramshackle* house down near the bay on the edge of the
marsh. pools of stagnant water stood around the house, their surfaces
covered with a green and putrid-looking scum, while the stench that
arose from them was intolerable.

     * an adjective descriptive of ruined and dilapidated houses
     in which great numbers of the working people found shelter
     in those days.  they invariably paid rent, and, considering
     the value of such houses, enormous rent, to the landlords.

i found jackson the meek and lowly man he had been described. he was
making some sort of rattan-work, and he toiled on stolidly while i
talked with him. but in spite of his meekness and lowliness, i fancied i
caught the first note of a nascent bitterness in him when he said:

“they might a-given me a job as watchman,* anyway.”

     * in those days thievery was incredibly prevalent.
     everybody stole property from everybody else.  the lords of
     society stole legally or else legalized their stealing,
     while the poorer classes stole illegally.  nothing was safe
     unless guarded.  enormous numbers of men were employed as
     watchmen to protect property.  the houses of the well-to-do
     were a combination of safe deposit vault and fortress.  the
     appropriation of the personal belongings of others by our
     own children of to-day is looked upon as a rudimentary
     survival of the theft-characteristic that in those early
     times was universal.

i got little out of him. he struck me as stupid, and yet the deftness
with which he worked with his one hand seemed to belie his stupidity.
this suggested an idea to me.

“how did you happen to get your arm caught in the machine?” i asked.

he looked at me in a slow and pondering way, and shook his head. “i
don't know. it just happened.”

“carelessness?” i prompted.

“no,” he answered, “i ain't for callin' it that. i was workin' overtime,
an' i guess i was tired out some. i worked seventeen years in them
mills, an' i've took notice that most of the accidents happens just
before whistle-blow.* i'm willin' to bet that more accidents happens
in the hour before whistle-blow than in all the rest of the day. a man
ain't so quick after workin' steady for hours. i've seen too many of 'em
cut up an' gouged an' chawed not to know.”

     * the laborers were called to work and dismissed by savage,
     screaming, nerve-racking steam-whistles.

“many of them?” i queried.

“hundreds an' hundreds, an' children, too.”

with the exception of the terrible details, jackson's story of his
accident was the same as that i had already heard. when i asked him if
he had broken some rule of working the machinery, he shook his head.

“i chucked off the belt with my right hand,” he said, “an' made a reach
for the flint with my left. i didn't stop to see if the belt was off. i
thought my right hand had done it--only it didn't. i reached quick, and
the belt wasn't all the way off. and then my arm was chewed off.”

“it must have been painful,” i said sympathetically.

“the crunchin' of the bones wasn't nice,” was his answer.

his mind was rather hazy concerning the damage suit. only one thing was
clear to him, and that was that he had not got any damages. he had a
feeling that the testimony of the foremen and the superintendent had
brought about the adverse decision of the court. their testimony, as he
put it, “wasn't what it ought to have ben.” and to them i resolved to
go.

one thing was plain, jackson's situation was wretched. his wife was in
ill health, and he was unable to earn, by his rattan-work and peddling,
sufficient food for the family. he was back in his rent, and the oldest
boy, a lad of eleven, had started to work in the mills.

“they might a-given me that watchman's job,” were his last words as i
went away.

by the time i had seen the lawyer who had handled jackson's case, and
the two foremen and the superintendent at the mills who had testified, i
began to feel that there was something after all in ernest's contention.

he was a weak and inefficient-looking man, the lawyer, and at sight of
him i did not wonder that jackson's case had been lost. my first thought
was that it had served jackson right for getting such a lawyer. but
the next moment two of ernest's statements came flashing into my
consciousness: “the company employs very efficient lawyers” and “colonel
ingram is a shrewd lawyer.” i did some rapid thinking. it dawned upon me
that of course the company could afford finer legal talent than could a
workingman like jackson. but this was merely a minor detail. there was
some very good reason, i was sure, why jackson's case had gone against
him.

“why did you lose the case?” i asked.

the lawyer was perplexed and worried for a moment, and i found it in my
heart to pity the wretched little creature. then he began to whine. i
do believe his whine was congenital. he was a man beaten at birth. he
whined about the testimony. the witnesses had given only the evidence
that helped the other side. not one word could he get out of them that
would have helped jackson. they knew which side their bread was buttered
on. jackson was a fool. he had been brow-beaten and confused by colonel
ingram. colonel ingram was brilliant at cross-examination. he had made
jackson answer damaging questions.

“how could his answers be damaging if he had the right on his side?” i
demanded.

“what's right got to do with it?” he demanded back. “you see all those
books.” he moved his hand over the array of volumes on the walls of his
tiny office. “all my reading and studying of them has taught me that
law is one thing and right is another thing. ask any lawyer. you go to
sunday-school to learn what is right. but you go to those books to learn
. . . law.”

“do you mean to tell me that jackson had the right on his side and yet
was beaten?” i queried tentatively. “do you mean to tell me that there
is no justice in judge caldwell's court?”

the little lawyer glared at me a moment, and then the belligerence faded
out of his face.

“i hadn't a fair chance,” he began whining again. “they made a fool out
of jackson and out of me, too. what chance had i? colonel ingram is
a great lawyer. if he wasn't great, would he have charge of the law
business of the sierra mills, of the erston land syndicate, of the
berkeley consolidated, of the oakland, san leandro, and pleasanton
electric? he's a corporation lawyer, and corporation lawyers are not
paid for being fools.* what do you think the sierra mills alone give him
twenty thousand dollars a year for? because he's worth twenty thousand
dollars a year to them, that's what for. i'm not worth that much. if
i was, i wouldn't be on the outside, starving and taking cases like
jackson's. what do you think i'd have got if i'd won jackson's case?”

     * the function of the corporation lawyer was to serve, by
     corrupt methods, the money-grabbing propensities of the
     corporations.  it is on record that theodore roosevelt, at
     that time president of the united states, said in 1905 a.d.,
     in his address at harvard commencement: “we all know that,
     as things actually are, many of the most influential and
     most highly remunerated members of the bar in every centre
     of wealth, make it their special task to work out bold and
     ingenious schemes by which their wealthy clients, individual
     or corporate, can evade the laws which were made to
     regulate, in the interests of the public, the uses of great
     wealth.”

“you'd have robbed him, most probably,” i answered.

“of course i would,” he cried angrily. “i've got to live, haven't i?” *

     * a typical illustration of the internecine strife that
     permeated all society.  men preyed upon one another like
     ravening wolves. the big wolves ate the little wolves, and
     in the social pack jackson was one of the least of the
     little wolves.

“he has a wife and children,” i chided.

“so have i a wife and children,” he retorted. “and there's not a soul in
this world except myself that cares whether they starve or not.”

his face suddenly softened, and he opened his watch and showed me a
small photograph of a woman and two little girls pasted inside the case.

“there they are. look at them. we've had a hard time, a hard time. i
had hoped to send them away to the country if i'd won jackson's case.
they're not healthy here, but i can't afford to send them away.”

when i started to leave, he dropped back into his whine.

“i hadn't the ghost of a chance. colonel ingram and judge caldwell
are pretty friendly. i'm not saying that if i'd got the right kind of
testimony out of their witnesses on cross-examination, that friendship
would have decided the case. and yet i must say that judge caldwell
did a whole lot to prevent my getting that very testimony. why, judge
caldwell and colonel ingram belong to the same lodge and the same club.
they live in the same neighborhood--one i can't afford. and their wives
are always in and out of each other's houses. they're always having
whist parties and such things back and forth.”

“and yet you think jackson had the right of it?” i asked, pausing for
the moment on the threshold.

“i don't think; i know it,” was his answer. “and at first i thought
he had some show, too. but i didn't tell my wife. i didn't want to
disappoint her. she had her heart set on a trip to the country hard
enough as it was.”

“why did you not call attention to the fact that jackson was trying to
save the machinery from being injured?” i asked peter donnelly, one of
the foremen who had testified at the trial.

he pondered a long time before replying. then he cast an anxious look
about him and said:

“because i've a good wife an' three of the sweetest children ye ever
laid eyes on, that's why.”

“i do not understand,” i said.

“in other words, because it wouldn't a-ben healthy,” he answered.

“you mean--” i began.

but he interrupted passionately.

“i mean what i said. it's long years i've worked in the mills. i began
as a little lad on the spindles. i worked up ever since. it's by hard
work i got to my present exalted position. i'm a foreman, if you please.
an' i doubt me if there's a man in the mills that'd put out a hand to
drag me from drownin'. i used to belong to the union. but i've stayed
by the company through two strikes. they called me 'scab.' there's not
a man among 'em to-day to take a drink with me if i asked him. d'ye see
the scars on me head where i was struck with flying bricks? there ain't
a child at the spindles but what would curse me name. me only friend is
the company. it's not me duty, but me bread an' butter an' the life of
me children to stand by the mills. that's why.”

“was jackson to blame?” i asked.

“he should a-got the damages. he was a good worker an' never made
trouble.”

“then you were not at liberty to tell the whole truth, as you had sworn
to do?”

he shook his head.

“the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?” i said
solemnly.

again his face became impassioned, and he lifted it, not to me, but to
heaven.

“i'd let me soul an' body burn in everlastin' hell for them children of
mine,” was his answer.

henry dallas, the superintendent, was a vulpine-faced creature who
regarded me insolently and refused to talk. not a word could i get from
him concerning the trial and his testimony. but with the other foreman i
had better luck. james smith was a hard-faced man, and my heart sank
as i encountered him. he, too, gave me the impression that he was not a
free agent, as we talked i began to see that he was mentally superior
to the average of his kind. he agreed with peter donnelly that jackson
should have got damages, and he went farther and called the action
heartless and cold-blooded that had turned the worker adrift after he
had been made helpless by the accident. also, he explained that there
were many accidents in the mills, and that the company's policy was to
fight to the bitter end all consequent damage suits.

“it means hundreds of thousands a year to the stockholders,” he said;
and as he spoke i remembered the last dividend that had been paid my
father, and the pretty gown for me and the books for him that had been
bought out of that dividend. i remembered ernest's charge that my
gown was stained with blood, and my flesh began to crawl underneath my
garments.

“when you testified at the trial, you didn't point out that jackson
received his accident through trying to save the machinery from damage?”
 i said.

“no, i did not,” was the answer, and his mouth set bitterly. “i
testified to the effect that jackson injured himself by neglect and
carelessness, and that the company was not in any way to blame or
liable.”

“was it carelessness?” i asked.

“call it that, or anything you want to call it. the fact is, a man gets
tired after he's been working for hours.”

i was becoming interested in the man. he certainly was of a superior
kind.

“you are better educated than most workingmen,” i said.

“i went through high school,” he replied. “i worked my way through doing
janitor-work. i wanted to go through the university. but my father died,
and i came to work in the mills.

“i wanted to become a naturalist,” he explained shyly, as though
confessing a weakness. “i love animals. but i came to work in the mills.
when i was promoted to foreman i got married, then the family came, and
. . . well, i wasn't my own boss any more.”

“what do you mean by that?” i asked.

“i was explaining why i testified at the trial the way i did--why i
followed instructions.”

“whose instructions?”

“colonel ingram. he outlined the evidence i was to give.”

“and it lost jackson's case for him.”

he nodded, and the blood began to rise darkly in his face.

“and jackson had a wife and two children dependent on him.”

“i know,” he said quietly, though his face was growing darker.

“tell me,” i went on, “was it easy to make yourself over from what you
were, say in high school, to the man you must have become to do such a
thing at the trial?”

the suddenness of his outburst startled and frightened me. he ripped*
out a savage oath, and clenched his fist as though about to strike me.

     * it is interesting to note the virilities of language that
     were common speech in that day, as indicative of the life,
     'red of claw and fang,' that was then lived.  reference is
     here made, of course, not to the oath of smith, but to the
     verb ripped used by avis everhard.

“i beg your pardon,” he said the next moment. “no, it was not easy. and
now i guess you can go away. you've got all you wanted out of me. but
let me tell you this before you go. it won't do you any good to repeat
anything i've said. i'll deny it, and there are no witnesses. i'll deny
every word of it; and if i have to, i'll do it under oath on the witness
stand.”

after my interview with smith i went to my father's office in
the chemistry building and there encountered ernest. it was quite
unexpected, but he met me with his bold eyes and firm hand-clasp, and
with that curious blend of his awkwardness and ease. it was as though
our last stormy meeting was forgotten; but i was not in the mood to have
it forgotten.

“i have been looking up jackson's case,” i said abruptly.

he was all interested attention, and waited for me to go on, though i
could see in his eyes the certitude that my convictions had been shaken.

“he seems to have been badly treated,” i confessed. “i--i--think some of
his blood is dripping from our roof-beams.”

“of course,” he answered. “if jackson and all his fellows were treated
mercifully, the dividends would not be so large.”

“i shall never be able to take pleasure in pretty gowns again,” i added.

i felt humble and contrite, and was aware of a sweet feeling that
ernest was a sort of father confessor. then, as ever after, his strength
appealed to me. it seemed to radiate a promise of peace and protection.

“nor will you be able to take pleasure in sackcloth,” he said gravely.
“there are the jute mills, you know, and the same thing goes on there.
it goes on everywhere. our boasted civilization is based upon blood,
soaked in blood, and neither you nor i nor any of us can escape the
scarlet stain. the men you talked with--who were they?”

i told him all that had taken place.

“and not one of them was a free agent,” he said. “they were all tied to
the merciless industrial machine. and the pathos of it and the tragedy
is that they are tied by their heartstrings. their children--always
the young life that it is their instinct to protect. this instinct is
stronger than any ethic they possess. my father! he lied, he stole, he
did all sorts of dishonorable things to put bread into my mouth and into
the mouths of my brothers and sisters. he was a slave to the industrial
machine, and it stamped his life out, worked him to death.”

“but you,” i interjected. “you are surely a free agent.”

“not wholly,” he replied. “i am not tied by my heartstrings. i am often
thankful that i have no children, and i dearly love children. yet if i
married i should not dare to have any.”

“that surely is bad doctrine,” i cried.

“i know it is,” he said sadly. “but it is expedient doctrine. i am a
revolutionist, and it is a perilous vocation.”

i laughed incredulously.

“if i tried to enter your father's house at night to steal his dividends
from the sierra mills, what would he do?”

“he sleeps with a revolver on the stand by the bed,” i answered. “he
would most probably shoot you.”

“and if i and a few others should lead a million and a half of men*
into the houses of all the well-to-do, there would be a great deal of
shooting, wouldn't there?”

     * this reference is to the socialist vote cast in the united
     states in 1910.  the rise of this vote clearly indicates the
     swift growth of the party of revolution.  its voting
     strength in the united states in 1888 was 2068; in 1902,
     127,713; in 1904, 435,040; in 1908, 1,108,427; and in 1910,
     1,688,211.

“yes, but you are not doing that,” i objected.

“it is precisely what i am doing. and we intend to take, not the mere
wealth in the houses, but all the sources of that wealth, all the
mines, and railroads, and factories, and banks, and stores. that is
the revolution. it is truly perilous. there will be more shooting, i am
afraid, than even i dream of. but as i was saying, no one to-day is
a free agent. we are all caught up in the wheels and cogs of the
industrial machine. you found that you were, and that the men you talked
with were. talk with more of them. go and see colonel ingram. look
up the reporters that kept jackson's case out of the papers, and the
editors that run the papers. you will find them all slaves of the
machine.”

a little later in our conversation i asked him a simple little
question about the liability of workingmen to accidents, and received a
statistical lecture in return.

“it is all in the books,” he said. “the figures have been gathered, and
it has been proved conclusively that accidents rarely occur in the
first hours of the morning work, but that they increase rapidly in the
succeeding hours as the workers grow tired and slower in both their
muscular and mental processes.

“why, do you know that your father has three times as many chances for
safety of life and limb than has a working-man? he has. the insurance*
companies know. they will charge him four dollars and twenty cents a
year on a thousand-dollar accident policy, and for the same policy they
will charge a laborer fifteen dollars.”

     * in the terrible wolf-struggle of those centuries, no man
     was permanently safe, no matter how much wealth he amassed.
     out of fear for the welfare of their families, men devised
     the scheme of insurance.  to us, in this intelligent age,
     such a device is laughably absurd and primitive.  but in
     that age insurance was a very serious matter.  the amusing
     part of it is that the funds of the insurance companies were
     frequently plundered and wasted by the very officials who
     were intrusted with the management of them.

“and you?” i asked; and in the moment of asking i was aware of a
solicitude that was something more than slight.

“oh, as a revolutionist, i have about eight chances to the workingman's
one of being injured or killed,” he answered carelessly. “the insurance
companies charge the highly trained chemists that handle explosives
eight times what they charge the workingmen. i don't think they'd insure
me at all. why did you ask?”

my eyes fluttered, and i could feel the blood warm in my face. it
was not that he had caught me in my solicitude, but that i had caught
myself, and in his presence.

just then my father came in and began making preparations to depart with
me. ernest returned some books he had borrowed, and went away first. but
just as he was going, he turned and said:

“oh, by the way, while you are ruining your own peace of mind and i
am ruining the bishop's, you'd better look up mrs. wickson and
mrs. pertonwaithe. their husbands, you know, are the two principal
stockholders in the mills. like all the rest of humanity, those two
women are tied to the machine, but they are so tied that they sit on top
of it.”



chapter iv

slaves of the machine


the more i thought of jackson's arm, the more shaken i was. i was
confronted by the concrete. for the first time i was seeing life. my
university life, and study and culture, had not been real. i had learned
nothing but theories of life and society that looked all very well on
the printed page, but now i had seen life itself. jackson's arm was a
fact of life. “the fact, man, the irrefragable fact!” of ernest's was
ringing in my consciousness.

it seemed monstrous, impossible, that our whole society was based
upon blood. and yet there was jackson. i could not get away from him.
constantly my thought swung back to him as the compass to the pole. he
had been monstrously treated. his blood had not been paid for in order
that a larger dividend might be paid. and i knew a score of happy
complacent families that had received those dividends and by that much
had profited by jackson's blood. if one man could be so monstrously
treated and society move on its way unheeding, might not many men be so
monstrously treated? i remembered ernest's women of chicago who toiled
for ninety cents a week, and the child slaves of the southern cotton
mills he had described. and i could see their wan white hands, from
which the blood had been pressed, at work upon the cloth out of which
had been made my gown. and then i thought of the sierra mills and the
dividends that had been paid, and i saw the blood of jackson upon my
gown as well. jackson i could not escape. always my meditations led me
back to him.

down in the depths of me i had a feeling that i stood on the edge of
a precipice. it was as though i were about to see a new and awful
revelation of life. and not i alone. my whole world was turning over.
there was my father. i could see the effect ernest was beginning to have
on him. and then there was the bishop. when i had last seen him he had
looked a sick man. he was at high nervous tension, and in his eyes there
was unspeakable horror. from the little i learned i knew that ernest had
been keeping his promise of taking him through hell. but what scenes of
hell the bishop's eyes had seen, i knew not, for he seemed too stunned
to speak about them.

once, the feeling strong upon me that my little world and all the world
was turning over, i thought of ernest as the cause of it; and also i
thought, “we were so happy and peaceful before he came!” and the next
moment i was aware that the thought was a treason against truth, and
ernest rose before me transfigured, the apostle of truth, with shining
brows and the fearlessness of one of gods own angels, battling for the
truth and the right, and battling for the succor of the poor and lonely
and oppressed. and then there arose before me another figure, the
christ! he, too, had taken the part of the lowly and oppressed,
and against all the established power of priest and pharisee. and i
remembered his end upon the cross, and my heart contracted with a pang
as i thought of ernest. was he, too, destined for a cross?--he, with his
clarion call and war-noted voice, and all the fine man's vigor of him!

and in that moment i knew that i loved him, and that i was melting
with desire to comfort him. i thought of his life. a sordid, harsh, and
meagre life it must have been. and i thought of his father, who had lied
and stolen for him and been worked to death. and he himself had gone
into the mills when he was ten! all my heart seemed bursting with desire
to fold my arms around him, and to rest his head on my breast--his head
that must be weary with so many thoughts; and to give him rest--just
rest--and easement and forgetfulness for a tender space.

i met colonel ingram at a church reception. him i knew well and had
known well for many years. i trapped him behind large palms and rubber
plants, though he did not know he was trapped. he met me with the
conventional gayety and gallantry. he was ever a graceful man,
diplomatic, tactful, and considerate. and as for appearance, he was
the most distinguished-looking man in our society. beside him even the
venerable head of the university looked tawdry and small.

and yet i found colonel ingram situated the same as the unlettered
mechanics. he was not a free agent. he, too, was bound upon the wheel.
i shall never forget the change in him when i mentioned jackson's case.
his smiling good nature vanished like a ghost. a sudden, frightful
expression distorted his well-bred face. i felt the same alarm that i
had felt when james smith broke out. but colonel ingram did not curse.
that was the slight difference that was left between the workingman and
him. he was famed as a wit, but he had no wit now. and, unconsciously,
this way and that he glanced for avenues of escape. but he was trapped
amid the palms and rubber trees.

oh, he was sick of the sound of jackson's name. why had i brought the
matter up? he did not relish my joke. it was poor taste on my part,
and very inconsiderate. did i not know that in his profession personal
feelings did not count? he left his personal feelings at home when
he went down to the office. at the office he had only professional
feelings.

“should jackson have received damages?” i asked.

“certainly,” he answered. “that is, personally, i have a feeling that he
should. but that has nothing to do with the legal aspects of the case.”

he was getting his scattered wits slightly in hand.

“tell me, has right anything to do with the law?” i asked.

“you have used the wrong initial consonant,” he smiled in answer.

“might?” i queried; and he nodded his head. “and yet we are supposed to
get justice by means of the law?”

“that is the paradox of it,” he countered. “we do get justice.”

“you are speaking professionally now, are you not?” i asked.

colonel ingram blushed, actually blushed, and again he looked anxiously
about him for a way of escape. but i blocked his path and did not offer
to move.

“tell me,” i said, “when one surrenders his personal feelings to his
professional feelings, may not the action be defined as a sort of
spiritual mayhem?”

i did not get an answer. colonel ingram had ingloriously bolted,
overturning a palm in his flight.

next i tried the newspapers. i wrote a quiet, restrained, dispassionate
account of jackson's case. i made no charges against the men with whom
i had talked, nor, for that matter, did i even mention them. i gave
the actual facts of the case, the long years jackson had worked in the
mills, his effort to save the machinery from damage and the consequent
accident, and his own present wretched and starving condition. the
three local newspapers rejected my communication, likewise did the two
weeklies.

i got hold of percy layton. he was a graduate of the university, had
gone in for journalism, and was then serving his apprenticeship as
reporter on the most influential of the three newspapers. he smiled when
i asked him the reason the newspapers suppressed all mention of jackson
or his case.

“editorial policy,” he said. “we have nothing to do with that. it's up
to the editors.”

“but why is it policy?” i asked.

“we're all solid with the corporations,” he answered. “if you paid
advertising rates, you couldn't get any such matter into the papers. a
man who tried to smuggle it in would lose his job. you couldn't get it
in if you paid ten times the regular advertising rates.”

“how about your own policy?” i questioned. “it would seem your function
is to twist truth at the command of your employers, who, in turn, obey
the behests of the corporations.”

“i haven't anything to do with that.” he looked uncomfortable for the
moment, then brightened as he saw his way out. “i, myself, do not write
untruthful things. i keep square all right with my own conscience. of
course, there's lots that's repugnant in the course of the day's work.
but then, you see, that's all part of the day's work,” he wound up
boyishly.

“yet you expect to sit at an editor's desk some day and conduct a
policy.”

“i'll be case-hardened by that time,” was his reply.

“since you are not yet case-hardened, tell me what you think right now
about the general editorial policy.”

“i don't think,” he answered quickly. “one can't kick over the ropes
if he's going to succeed in journalism. i've learned that much, at any
rate.”

and he nodded his young head sagely.

“but the right?” i persisted.

“you don't understand the game. of course it's all right, because it
comes out all right, don't you see?”

“delightfully vague,” i murmured; but my heart was aching for the youth
of him, and i felt that i must either scream or burst into tears.

i was beginning to see through the appearances of the society in which i
had always lived, and to find the frightful realities that were beneath.
there seemed a tacit conspiracy against jackson, and i was aware of a
thrill of sympathy for the whining lawyer who had ingloriously fought
his case. but this tacit conspiracy grew large. not alone was it aimed
against jackson. it was aimed against every workingman who was maimed in
the mills. and if against every man in the mills, why not against every
man in all the other mills and factories? in fact, was it not true of
all the industries?

and if this was so, then society was a lie. i shrank back from my own
conclusions. it was too terrible and awful to be true. but there was
jackson, and jackson's arm, and the blood that stained my gown and
dripped from my own roof-beams. and there were many jacksons--hundreds
of them in the mills alone, as jackson himself had said. jackson i could
not escape.

i saw mr. wickson and mr. pertonwaithe, the two men who held most of the
stock in the sierra mills. but i could not shake them as i had shaken
the mechanics in their employ. i discovered that they had an ethic
superior to that of the rest of society. it was what i may call the
aristocratic ethic or the master ethic.* they talked in large ways of
policy, and they identified policy and right. and to me they talked in
fatherly ways, patronizing my youth and inexperience. they were the most
hopeless of all i had encountered in my quest. they believed absolutely
that their conduct was right. there was no question about it, no
discussion. they were convinced that they were the saviours of society,
and that it was they who made happiness for the many. and they drew
pathetic pictures of what would be the sufferings of the working class
were it not for the employment that they, and they alone, by their
wisdom, provided for it.

     * before avis everhard was born, john stuart mill, in his
     essay, on liberty, wrote: “wherever there is an ascendant
     class, a large portion of the morality emanates from its
     class interests and its class feelings of superiority.”

fresh from these two masters, i met ernest and related my experience. he
looked at me with a pleased expression, and said:

“really, this is fine. you are beginning to dig truth for yourself. it
is your own empirical generalization, and it is correct. no man in the
industrial machine is a free-will agent, except the large capitalist,
and he isn't, if you'll pardon the irishism.* you see, the masters
are quite sure that they are right in what they are doing. that is the
crowning absurdity of the whole situation. they are so tied by their
human nature that they can't do a thing unless they think it is right.
they must have a sanction for their acts.

     * verbal contradictions, called bulls, were long an amiable
     weakness of the ancient irish.

“when they want to do a thing, in business of course, they must wait
till there arises in their brains, somehow, a religious, or ethical, or
scientific, or philosophic, concept that the thing is right. and then
they go ahead and do it, unwitting that one of the weaknesses of the
human mind is that the wish is parent to the thought. no matter what
they want to do, the sanction always comes. they are superficial
casuists. they are jesuitical. they even see their way to doing wrong
that right may come of it. one of the pleasant and axiomatic fictions
they have created is that they are superior to the rest of mankind in
wisdom and efficiency. therefrom comes their sanction to manage the
bread and butter of the rest of mankind. they have even resurrected the
theory of the divine right of kings--commercial kings in their case.*

     * the newspapers, in 1902 of that era, credited the
     president of the anthracite coal trust, george f. baer, with
     the enunciation of the following principle: “the rights and
     interests of the laboring man will be protected by the
     christian men to whom god in his infinite wisdom has given
     the property interests of the country.”

“the weakness in their position lies in that they are merely
business men. they are not philosophers. they are not biologists nor
sociologists. if they were, of course all would be well. a business man
who was also a biologist and a sociologist would know, approximately,
the right thing to do for humanity. but, outside the realm of business,
these men are stupid. they know only business. they do not know mankind
nor society, and yet they set themselves up as arbiters of the fates of
the hungry millions and all the other millions thrown in. history, some
day, will have an excruciating laugh at their expense.”

i was not surprised when i had my talk out with mrs. wickson and mrs.
pertonwaithe. they were society women.* their homes were palaces. they
had many homes scattered over the country, in the mountains, on lakes,
and by the sea. they were tended by armies of servants, and their social
activities were bewildering. they patronized the university and the
churches, and the pastors especially bowed at their knees in meek
subservience.** they were powers, these two women, what of the money
that was theirs. the power of subsidization of thought was theirs to a
remarkable degree, as i was soon to learn under ernest's tuition.

     * society is here used in a restricted sense, a common usage
     of the times to denote the gilded drones that did no labor,
     but only glutted themselves at the honey-vats of the
     workers.  neither the business men nor the laborers had time
     or opportunity for society. society was the creation of the
     idle rich who toiled not and who in this way played.

     ** “bring on your tainted money,” was the expressed
     sentiment of the church during this period.

they aped their husbands, and talked in the same large ways about
policy, and the duties and responsibilities of the rich. they were
swayed by the same ethic that dominated their husbands--the ethic of
their class; and they uttered glib phrases that their own ears did not
understand.

also, they grew irritated when i told them of the deplorable condition
of jackson's family, and when i wondered that they had made no
voluntary provision for the man. i was told that they thanked no one
for instructing them in their social duties. when i asked them flatly
to assist jackson, they as flatly refused. the astounding thing about it
was that they refused in almost identically the same language, and this
in face of the fact that i interviewed them separately and that one did
not know that i had seen or was going to see the other. their common
reply was that they were glad of the opportunity to make it perfectly
plain that no premium would ever be put on carelessness by them; nor
would they, by paying for accident, tempt the poor to hurt themselves in
the machinery.*

     * in the files of the outlook, a critical weekly of the
     period, in the number dated august 18, 1906, is related the
     circumstance of a workingman losing his arm, the details of
     which are quite similar to those of jackson's case as
     related by avis everhard.

and they were sincere, these two women. they were drunk with conviction
of the superiority of their class and of themselves. they had a
sanction, in their own class-ethic, for every act they performed. as i
drove away from mrs. pertonwaithe's great house, i looked back at
it, and i remembered ernest's expression that they were bound to the
machine, but that they were so bound that they sat on top of it.



chapter v

the philomaths


ernest was often at the house. nor was it my father, merely, nor
the controversial dinners, that drew him there. even at that time i
flattered myself that i played some part in causing his visits, and it
was not long before i learned the correctness of my surmise. for never
was there such a lover as ernest everhard. his gaze and his hand-clasp
grew firmer and steadier, if that were possible; and the question that
had grown from the first in his eyes, grew only the more imperative.

my impression of him, the first time i saw him, had been unfavorable.
then i had found myself attracted toward him. next came my repulsion,
when he so savagely attacked my class and me. after that, as i saw that
he had not maligned my class, and that the harsh and bitter things he
said about it were justified, i had drawn closer to him again. he became
my oracle. for me he tore the sham from the face of society and gave
me glimpses of reality that were as unpleasant as they were undeniably
true.

as i have said, there was never such a lover as he. no girl could
live in a university town till she was twenty-four and not have love
experiences. i had been made love to by beardless sophomores and gray
professors, and by the athletes and the football giants. but not one
of them made love to me as ernest did. his arms were around me before i
knew. his lips were on mine before i could protest or resist. before his
earnestness conventional maiden dignity was ridiculous. he swept me off
my feet by the splendid invincible rush of him. he did not propose. he
put his arms around me and kissed me and took it for granted that
we should be married. there was no discussion about it. the only
discussion--and that arose afterward--was when we should be married.

it was unprecedented. it was unreal. yet, in accordance with ernest's
test of truth, it worked. i trusted my life to it. and fortunate was the
trust. yet during those first days of our love, fear of the future
came often to me when i thought of the violence and impetuosity of his
love-making. yet such fears were groundless. no woman was ever blessed
with a gentler, tenderer husband. this gentleness and violence on
his part was a curious blend similar to the one in his carriage of
awkwardness and ease. that slight awkwardness! he never got over it,
and it was delicious. his behavior in our drawing-room reminded me of a
careful bull in a china shop.*

     * in those days it was still the custom to fill the living
     rooms with bric-a-brac.  they had not discovered simplicity
     of living. such rooms were museums, entailing endless labor
     to keep clean. the dust-demon was the lord of the household.
     there were a myriad devices for catching dust, and only a
     few devices for getting rid of it.

it was at this time that vanished my last doubt of the completeness of
my love for him (a subconscious doubt, at most). it was at the philomath
club--a wonderful night of battle, wherein ernest bearded the masters
in their lair. now the philomath club was the most select on the pacific
coast. it was the creation of miss brentwood, an enormously wealthy old
maid; and it was her husband, and family, and toy. its members were the
wealthiest in the community, and the strongest-minded of the wealthy,
with, of course, a sprinkling of scholars to give it intellectual tone.

the philomath had no club house. it was not that kind of a club. once a
month its members gathered at some one of their private houses to listen
to a lecture. the lecturers were usually, though not always, hired. if a
chemist in new york made a new discovery in say radium, all his expenses
across the continent were paid, and as well he received a princely fee
for his time. the same with a returning explorer from the polar regions,
or the latest literary or artistic success. no visitors were allowed,
while it was the philomath's policy to permit none of its discussions
to get into the papers. thus great statesmen--and there had been such
occasions--were able fully to speak their minds.

i spread before me a wrinkled letter, written to me by ernest twenty
years ago, and from it i copy the following:

“your father is a member of the philomath, so you are able to come.
therefore come next tuesday night. i promise you that you will have the
time of your life. in your recent encounters, you failed to shake the
masters. if you come, i'll shake them for you. i'll make them snarl like
wolves. you merely questioned their morality. when their morality is
questioned, they grow only the more complacent and superior. but i shall
menace their money-bags. that will shake them to the roots of their
primitive natures. if you can come, you will see the cave-man, in
evening dress, snarling and snapping over a bone. i promise you a great
caterwauling and an illuminating insight into the nature of the beast.

“they've invited me in order to tear me to pieces. this is the idea of
miss brentwood. she clumsily hinted as much when she invited me.
she's given them that kind of fun before. they delight in getting
trustful-souled gentle reformers before them. miss brentwood thinks i
am as mild as a kitten and as good-natured and stolid as the family cow.
i'll not deny that i helped to give her that impression. she was very
tentative at first, until she divined my harmlessness. i am to receive
a handsome fee--two hundred and fifty dollars--as befits the man who,
though a radical, once ran for governor. also, i am to wear evening
dress. this is compulsory. i never was so apparelled in my life. i
suppose i'll have to hire one somewhere. but i'd do more than that to
get a chance at the philomaths.”

of all places, the club gathered that night at the pertonwaithe house.
extra chairs had been brought into the great drawing-room, and in
all there must have been two hundred philomaths that sat down to hear
ernest. they were truly lords of society. i amused myself with running
over in my mind the sum of the fortunes represented, and it ran well
into the hundreds of millions. and the possessors were not of the idle
rich. they were men of affairs who took most active parts in industrial
and political life.

we were all seated when miss brentwood brought ernest in. they moved
at once to the head of the room, from where he was to speak. he was
in evening dress, and, what of his broad shoulders and kingly head, he
looked magnificent. and then there was that faint and unmistakable touch
of awkwardness in his movements. i almost think i could have loved him
for that alone. and as i looked at him i was aware of a great joy. i
felt again the pulse of his palm on mine, the touch of his lips; and
such pride was mine that i felt i must rise up and cry out to the
assembled company: “he is mine! he has held me in his arms, and i,
mere i, have filled that mind of his to the exclusion of all his
multitudinous and kingly thoughts!”

at the head of the room, miss brentwood introduced him to colonel van
gilbert, and i knew that the latter was to preside. colonel van gilbert
was a great corporation lawyer. in addition, he was immensely wealthy.
the smallest fee he would deign to notice was a hundred thousand
dollars. he was a master of law. the law was a puppet with which he
played. he moulded it like clay, twisted and distorted it like a chinese
puzzle into any design he chose. in appearance and rhetoric he was
old-fashioned, but in imagination and knowledge and resource he was as
young as the latest statute. his first prominence had come when he broke
the shardwell will.* his fee for this one act was five hundred thousand
dollars. from then on he had risen like a rocket. he was often called
the greatest lawyer in the country--corporation lawyer, of course; and
no classification of the three greatest lawyers in the united states
could have excluded him.

     * this breaking of wills was a peculiar feature of the
     period. with the accumulation of vast fortunes, the problem
     of disposing of these fortunes after death was a vexing one
     to the accumulators. will-making and will-breaking became
     complementary trades, like armor-making and gun-making.  the
     shrewdest will-making lawyers were called in to make wills
     that could not be broken.  but these wills were always
     broken, and very often by the very lawyers that had drawn
     them up.  nevertheless the delusion persisted in the wealthy
     class that an absolutely unbreakable will could be cast; and
     so, through the generations, clients and lawyers pursued the
     illusion.  it was a pursuit like unto that of the universal
     solvent of the mediaeval alchemists.

he arose and began, in a few well-chosen phrases that carried an
undertone of faint irony, to introduce ernest. colonel van gilbert was
subtly facetious in his introduction of the social reformer and member
of the working class, and the audience smiled. it made me angry, and
i glanced at ernest. the sight of him made me doubly angry. he did not
seem to resent the delicate slurs. worse than that, he did not seem to
be aware of them. there he sat, gentle, and stolid, and somnolent. he
really looked stupid. and for a moment the thought rose in my mind, what
if he were overawed by this imposing array of power and brains? then i
smiled. he couldn't fool me. but he fooled the others, just as he had
fooled miss brentwood. she occupied a chair right up to the front, and
several times she turned her head toward one or another of her confreres
and smiled her appreciation of the remarks.

colonel van gilbert done, ernest arose and began to speak. he began in
a low voice, haltingly and modestly, and with an air of evident
embarrassment. he spoke of his birth in the working class, and of the
sordidness and wretchedness of his environment, where flesh and spirit
were alike starved and tormented. he described his ambitions and ideals,
and his conception of the paradise wherein lived the people of the upper
classes. as he said:

“up above me, i knew, were unselfishnesses of the spirit, clean and
noble thinking, keen intellectual living. i knew all this because i read
'seaside library' * novels, in which, with the exception of the villains
and adventuresses, all men and women thought beautiful thoughts, spoke a
beautiful tongue, and performed glorious deeds. in short, as i accepted
the rising of the sun, i accepted that up above me was all that was fine
and noble and gracious, all that gave decency and dignity to life, all
that made life worth living and that remunerated one for his travail and
misery.”

     * a curious and amazing literature that served to make the
     working class utterly misapprehend the nature of the leisure
     class.

he went on and traced his life in the mills, the learning of the
horseshoeing trade, and his meeting with the socialists. among them, he
said, he had found keen intellects and brilliant wits, ministers of the
gospel who had been broken because their christianity was too wide for
any congregation of mammon-worshippers, and professors who had been
broken on the wheel of university subservience to the ruling class. the
socialists were revolutionists, he said, struggling to overthrow the
irrational society of the present and out of the material to build the
rational society of the future. much more he said that would take too
long to write, but i shall never forget how he described the life among
the revolutionists. all halting utterance vanished. his voice grew
strong and confident, and it glowed as he glowed, and as the thoughts
glowed that poured out from him. he said:

“amongst the revolutionists i found, also, warm faith in the human,
ardent idealism, sweetnesses of unselfishness, renunciation, and
martyrdom--all the splendid, stinging things of the spirit. here life
was clean, noble, and alive. i was in touch with great souls who exalted
flesh and spirit over dollars and cents, and to whom the thin wail of
the starved slum child meant more than all the pomp and circumstance of
commercial expansion and world empire. all about me were nobleness of
purpose and heroism of effort, and my days and nights were sunshine
and starshine, all fire and dew, with before my eyes, ever burning
and blazing, the holy grail, christ's own grail, the warm human,
long-suffering and maltreated but to be rescued and saved at the last.”

as before i had seen him transfigured, so now he stood transfigured
before me. his brows were bright with the divine that was in him, and
brighter yet shone his eyes from the midst of the radiance that seemed
to envelop him as a mantle. but the others did not see this radiance,
and i assumed that it was due to the tears of joy and love that dimmed
my vision. at any rate, mr. wickson, who sat behind me, was unaffected,
for i heard him sneer aloud, “utopian.” *

     * the people of that age were phrase slaves.  the abjectness
     of their servitude is incomprehensible to us.  there was a
     magic in words greater than the conjurer's art.  so
     befuddled and chaotic were their minds that the utterance of
     a single word could negative the generalizations of a
     lifetime of serious research and thought. such a word was
     the adjective utopian.  the mere utterance of it could damn
     any scheme, no matter how sanely conceived, of economic
     amelioration or regeneration.  vast populations grew
     frenzied over such phrases as “an honest dollar” and “a full
     dinner pail.”  the coinage of such phrases was considered
     strokes of genius.

ernest went on to his rise in society, till at last he came in touch
with members of the upper classes, and rubbed shoulders with the men
who sat in the high places. then came his disillusionment, and this
disillusionment he described in terms that did not flatter his audience.
he was surprised at the commonness of the clay. life proved not to be
fine and gracious. he was appalled by the selfishness he encountered,
and what had surprised him even more than that was the absence of
intellectual life. fresh from his revolutionists, he was shocked by the
intellectual stupidity of the master class. and then, in spite of their
magnificent churches and well-paid preachers, he had found the masters,
men and women, grossly material. it was true that they prattled sweet
little ideals and dear little moralities, but in spite of their prattle
the dominant key of the life they lived was materialistic. and they were
without real morality--for instance, that which christ had preached but
which was no longer preached.

“i met men,” he said, “who invoked the name of the prince of peace
in their diatribes against war, and who put rifles in the hands of
pinkertons* with which to shoot down strikers in their own factories. i
met men incoherent with indignation at the brutality of prize-fighting,
and who, at the same time, were parties to the adulteration of food that
killed each year more babes than even red-handed herod had killed.

     * originally, they were private detectives; but they quickly
     became hired fighting men of the capitalists, and ultimately
     developed into the mercenaries of the oligarchy.

“this delicate, aristocratic-featured gentleman was a dummy director
and a tool of corporations that secretly robbed widows and orphans. this
gentleman, who collected fine editions and was a patron of literature,
paid blackmail to a heavy-jowled, black-browed boss of a municipal
machine. this editor, who published patent medicine advertisements,
called me a scoundrelly demagogue because i dared him to print in his
paper the truth about patent medicines.* this man, talking soberly and
earnestly about the beauties of idealism and the goodness of god, had
just betrayed his comrades in a business deal. this man, a pillar of the
church and heavy contributor to foreign missions, worked his shop girls
ten hours a day on a starvation wage and thereby directly encouraged
prostitution. this man, who endowed chairs in universities and erected
magnificent chapels, perjured himself in courts of law over dollars
and cents. this railroad magnate broke his word as a citizen, as a
gentleman, and as a christian, when he granted a secret rebate, and he
granted many secret rebates. this senator was the tool and the slave,
the little puppet, of a brutal uneducated machine boss;** so was this
governor and this supreme court judge; and all three rode on railroad
passes; and, also, this sleek capitalist owned the machine, the machine
boss, and the railroads that issued the passes.

     * patent medicines were patent lies, but, like the charms
     and indulgences of the middle ages, they deceived the
     people.  the only difference lay in that the patent
     medicines were more harmful and more costly.

     ** even as late as 1912, a.d., the great mass of the people
     still persisted in the belief that they ruled the country by
     virtue of their ballots.  in reality, the country was ruled
     by what were called political machines.  at first the
     machine bosses charged the master capitalists extortionate
     tolls for legislation; but in a short time the master
     capitalists found it cheaper to own the political machines
     themselves and to hire the machine bosses.

“and so it was, instead of in paradise, that i found myself in the
arid desert of commercialism. i found nothing but stupidity, except for
business. i found none clean, noble, and alive, though i found many who
were alive--with rottenness. what i did find was monstrous selfishness
and heartlessness, and a gross, gluttonous, practised, and practical
materialism.”

much more ernest told them of themselves and of his disillusionment.
intellectually they had bored him; morally and spiritually they had
sickened him; so that he was glad to go back to his revolutionists, who
were clean, noble, and alive, and all that the capitalists were not.

“and now,” he said, “let me tell you about that revolution.”

but first i must say that his terrible diatribe had not touched them. i
looked about me at their faces and saw that they remained complacently
superior to what he had charged. and i remembered what he had told me:
that no indictment of their morality could shake them. however, i could
see that the boldness of his language had affected miss brentwood. she
was looking worried and apprehensive.

ernest began by describing the army of revolution, and as he gave the
figures of its strength (the votes cast in the various countries), the
assemblage began to grow restless. concern showed in their faces, and i
noticed a tightening of lips. at last the gage of battle had been thrown
down. he described the international organization of the socialists that
united the million and a half in the united states with the twenty-three
millions and a half in the rest of the world.

“such an army of revolution,” he said, “twenty-five millions strong, is
a thing to make rulers and ruling classes pause and consider. the cry
of this army is: 'no quarter! we want all that you possess. we will
be content with nothing less than all that you possess. we want in our
hands the reins of power and the destiny of mankind. here are our hands.
they are strong hands. we are going to take your governments, your
palaces, and all your purpled ease away from you, and in that day
you shall work for your bread even as the peasant in the field or the
starved and runty clerk in your metropolises. here are our hands. they
are strong hands!'”

and as he spoke he extended from his splendid shoulders his two great
arms, and the horseshoer's hands were clutching the air like eagle's
talons. he was the spirit of regnant labor as he stood there, his hands
outreaching to rend and crush his audience. i was aware of a faintly
perceptible shrinking on the part of the listeners before this figure
of revolution, concrete, potential, and menacing. that is, the women
shrank, and fear was in their faces. not so with the men. they were
of the active rich, and not the idle, and they were fighters. a low,
throaty rumble arose, lingered on the air a moment, and ceased. it
was the forerunner of the snarl, and i was to hear it many times that
night--the token of the brute in man, the earnest of his primitive
passions. and they were unconscious that they had made this sound.
it was the growl of the pack, mouthed by the pack, and mouthed in all
unconsciousness. and in that moment, as i saw the harshness form in
their faces and saw the fight-light flashing in their eyes, i realized
that not easily would they let their lordship of the world be wrested
from them.

ernest proceeded with his attack. he accounted for the existence of the
million and a half of revolutionists in the united states by charging
the capitalist class with having mismanaged society. he sketched the
economic condition of the cave-man and of the savage peoples of to-day,
pointing out that they possessed neither tools nor machines, and
possessed only a natural efficiency of one in producing power. then
he traced the development of machinery and social organization so that
to-day the producing power of civilized man was a thousand times greater
than that of the savage.

“five men,” he said, “can produce bread for a thousand. one man can
produce cotton cloth for two hundred and fifty people, woollens for
three hundred, and boots and shoes for a thousand. one would conclude
from this that under a capable management of society modern civilized
man would be a great deal better off than the cave-man. but is he? let
us see. in the united states to-day there are fifteen million* people
living in poverty; and by poverty is meant that condition in life in
which, through lack of food and adequate shelter, the mere standard of
working efficiency cannot be maintained. in the united states to-day, in
spite of all your so-called labor legislation, there are three millions
of child laborers.** in twelve years their numbers have been doubled.
and in passing i will ask you managers of society why you did not make
public the census figures of 1910? and i will answer for you, that
you were afraid. the figures of misery would have precipitated the
revolution that even now is gathering.

     * robert hunter, in 1906, in a book entitled “poverty,”
      pointed out that at that time there were ten millions in the
     united states living in poverty.

     ** in the united states census of 1900 (the last census the
     figures of which were made public), the number of child
     laborers was placed at 1,752,187.

“but to return to my indictment. if modern man's producing power is
a thousand times greater than that of the cave-man, why then, in the
united states to-day, are there fifteen million people who are not
properly sheltered and properly fed? why then, in the united states
to-day, are there three million child laborers? it is a true indictment.
the capitalist class has mismanaged. in face of the facts that modern
man lives more wretchedly than the cave-man, and that his producing
power is a thousand times greater than that of the cave-man, no other
conclusion is possible than that the capitalist class has mismanaged,
that you have mismanaged, my masters, that you have criminally and
selfishly mismanaged. and on this count you cannot answer me here
to-night, face to face, any more than can your whole class answer the
million and a half of revolutionists in the united states. you cannot
answer. i challenge you to answer. and furthermore, i dare to say to
you now that when i have finished you will not answer. on that point
you will be tongue-tied, though you will talk wordily enough about other
things.

“you have failed in your management. you have made a shambles of
civilization. you have been blind and greedy. you have risen up (as you
to-day rise up), shamelessly, in our legislative halls, and declared
that profits were impossible without the toil of children and babes.
don't take my word for it. it is all in the records against you. you
have lulled your conscience to sleep with prattle of sweet ideals and
dear moralities. you are fat with power and possession, drunken with
success; and you have no more hope against us than have the drones,
clustered about the honey-vats, when the worker-bees spring upon them
to end their rotund existence. you have failed in your management of
society, and your management is to be taken away from you. a million and
a half of the men of the working class say that they are going to get
the rest of the working class to join with them and take the management
away from you. this is the revolution, my masters. stop it if you can.”

for an appreciable lapse of time ernest's voice continued to ring
through the great room. then arose the throaty rumble i had heard
before, and a dozen men were on their feet clamoring for recognition
from colonel van gilbert. i noticed miss brentwood's shoulders moving
convulsively, and for the moment i was angry, for i thought that she was
laughing at ernest. and then i discovered that it was not laughter,
but hysteria. she was appalled by what she had done in bringing this
firebrand before her blessed philomath club.

colonel van gilbert did not notice the dozen men, with passion-wrought
faces, who strove to get permission from him to speak. his own face
was passion-wrought. he sprang to his feet, waving his arms, and for a
moment could utter only incoherent sounds. then speech poured from him.
but it was not the speech of a one-hundred-thousand-dollar lawyer, nor
was the rhetoric old-fashioned.

“fallacy upon fallacy!” he cried. “never in all my life have i heard so
many fallacies uttered in one short hour. and besides, young man, i must
tell you that you have said nothing new. i learned all that at college
before you were born. jean jacques rousseau enunciated your socialistic
theory nearly two centuries ago. a return to the soil, forsooth!
reversion! our biology teaches the absurdity of it. it has been
truly said that a little learning is a dangerous thing, and you have
exemplified it to-night with your madcap theories. fallacy upon fallacy!
i was never so nauseated in my life with overplus of fallacy. that for
your immature generalizations and childish reasonings!”

he snapped his fingers contemptuously and proceeded to sit down. there
were lip-exclamations of approval on the part of the women, and hoarser
notes of confirmation came from the men. as for the dozen men who
were clamoring for the floor, half of them began speaking at once. the
confusion and babel was indescribable. never had mrs. pertonwaithe's
spacious walls beheld such a spectacle. these, then, were the cool
captains of industry and lords of society, these snarling, growling
savages in evening clothes. truly ernest had shaken them when he
stretched out his hands for their moneybags, his hands that had
appeared in their eyes as the hands of the fifteen hundred thousand
revolutionists.

but ernest never lost his head in a situation. before colonel van
gilbert had succeeded in sitting down, ernest was on his feet and had
sprung forward.

“one at a time!” he roared at them.

the sound arose from his great lungs and dominated the human tempest. by
sheer compulsion of personality he commanded silence.

“one at a time,” he repeated softly. “let me answer colonel van gilbert.
after that the rest of you can come at me--but one at a time, remember.
no mass-plays here. this is not a football field.

“as for you,” he went on, turning toward colonel van gilbert, “you have
replied to nothing i have said. you have merely made a few excited and
dogmatic assertions about my mental caliber. that may serve you in your
business, but you can't talk to me like that. i am not a workingman,
cap in hand, asking you to increase my wages or to protect me from the
machine at which i work. you cannot be dogmatic with truth when you deal
with me. save that for dealing with your wage-slaves. they will not dare
reply to you because you hold their bread and butter, their lives, in
your hands.

“as for this return to nature that you say you learned at college before
i was born, permit me to point out that on the face of it you cannot
have learned anything since. socialism has no more to do with the state
of nature than has differential calculus with a bible class. i have
called your class stupid when outside the realm of business. you, sir,
have brilliantly exemplified my statement.”

this terrible castigation of her hundred-thousand-dollar lawyer was too
much for miss brentwood's nerves. her hysteria became violent, and she
was helped, weeping and laughing, out of the room. it was just as well,
for there was worse to follow.

“don't take my word for it,” ernest continued, when the interruption had
been led away. “your own authorities with one unanimous voice will prove
you stupid. your own hired purveyors of knowledge will tell you that you
are wrong. go to your meekest little assistant instructor of sociology
and ask him what is the difference between rousseau's theory of the
return to nature and the theory of socialism; ask your greatest orthodox
bourgeois political economists and sociologists; question through
the pages of every text-book written on the subject and stored on the
shelves of your subsidized libraries; and from one and all the answer
will be that there is nothing congruous between the return to nature and
socialism. on the other hand, the unanimous affirmative answer will be
that the return to nature and socialism are diametrically opposed to
each other. as i say, don't take my word for it. the record of your
stupidity is there in the books, your own books that you never read. and
so far as your stupidity is concerned, you are but the exemplar of your
class.

“you know law and business, colonel van gilbert. you know how to serve
corporations and increase dividends by twisting the law. very good.
stick to it. you are quite a figure. you are a very good lawyer, but you
are a poor historian, you know nothing of sociology, and your biology is
contemporaneous with pliny.”

here colonel van gilbert writhed in his chair. there was perfect quiet
in the room. everybody sat fascinated--paralyzed, i may say. such
fearful treatment of the great colonel van gilbert was unheard of,
undreamed of, impossible to believe--the great colonel van gilbert
before whom judges trembled when he arose in court. but ernest never
gave quarter to an enemy.

“this is, of course, no reflection on you,” ernest said. “every man to
his trade. only you stick to your trade, and i'll stick to mine. you
have specialized. when it comes to a knowledge of the law, of how
best to evade the law or make new law for the benefit of thieving
corporations, i am down in the dirt at your feet. but when it comes to
sociology--my trade--you are down in the dirt at my feet. remember that.
remember, also, that your law is the stuff of a day, and that you are
not versatile in the stuff of more than a day. therefore your
dogmatic assertions and rash generalizations on things historical and
sociological are not worth the breath you waste on them.”

ernest paused for a moment and regarded him thoughtfully, noting his
face dark and twisted with anger, his panting chest, his writhing body,
and his slim white hands nervously clenching and unclenching.

“but it seems you have breath to use, and i'll give you a chance to
use it. i indicted your class. show me that my indictment is wrong. i
pointed out to you the wretchedness of modern man--three million child
slaves in the united states, without whose labor profits would not be
possible, and fifteen million under-fed, ill-clothed, and worse-housed
people. i pointed out that modern man's producing power through social
organization and the use of machinery was a thousand times greater than
that of the cave-man. and i stated that from these two facts no other
conclusion was possible than that the capitalist class had mismanaged.
this was my indictment, and i specifically and at length challenged you
to answer it. nay, i did more. i prophesied that you would not answer.
it remains for your breath to smash my prophecy. you called my speech
fallacy. show the fallacy, colonel van gilbert. answer the indictment
that i and my fifteen hundred thousand comrades have brought against
your class and you.”

colonel van gilbert quite forgot that he was presiding, and that in
courtesy he should permit the other clamorers to speak. he was on his
feet, flinging his arms, his rhetoric, and his control to the winds,
alternately abusing ernest for his youth and demagoguery, and
savagely attacking the working class, elaborating its inefficiency and
worthlessness.

“for a lawyer, you are the hardest man to keep to a point i ever saw,”
 ernest began his answer to the tirade. “my youth has nothing to do with
what i have enunciated. nor has the worthlessness of the working class.
i charged the capitalist class with having mismanaged society. you have
not answered. you have made no attempt to answer. why? is it because you
have no answer? you are the champion of this whole audience. every
one here, except me, is hanging on your lips for that answer. they
are hanging on your lips for that answer because they have no answer
themselves. as for me, as i said before, i know that you not only cannot
answer, but that you will not attempt an answer.”

“this is intolerable!” colonel van gilbert cried out. “this is insult!”

“that you should not answer is intolerable,” ernest replied gravely.
“no man can be intellectually insulted. insult, in its very nature,
is emotional. recover yourself. give me an intellectual answer to my
intellectual charge that the capitalist class has mismanaged society.”

colonel van gilbert remained silent, a sullen, superior expression on
his face, such as will appear on the face of a man who will not bandy
words with a ruffian.

“do not be downcast,” ernest said. “take consolation in the fact that
no member of your class has ever yet answered that charge.” he turned to
the other men who were anxious to speak. “and now it's your chance. fire
away, and do not forget that i here challenge you to give the answer
that colonel van gilbert has failed to give.”

it would be impossible for me to write all that was said in the
discussion. i never realized before how many words could be spoken in
three short hours. at any rate, it was glorious. the more his opponents
grew excited, the more ernest deliberately excited them. he had an
encyclopaedic command of the field of knowledge, and by a word or a
phrase, by delicate rapier thrusts, he punctured them. he named the
points of their illogic. this was a false syllogism, that conclusion had
no connection with the premise, while that next premise was an impostor
because it had cunningly hidden in it the conclusion that was being
attempted to be proved. this was an error, that was an assumption, and
the next was an assertion contrary to ascertained truth as printed in
all the text-books.

and so it went. sometimes he exchanged the rapier for the club and went
smashing amongst their thoughts right and left. and always he demanded
facts and refused to discuss theories. and his facts made for them a
waterloo. when they attacked the working class, he always retorted, “the
pot calling the kettle black; that is no answer to the charge that
your own face is dirty.” and to one and all he said: “why have you not
answered the charge that your class has mismanaged? you have talked
about other things and things concerning other things, but you have not
answered. is it because you have no answer?”

it was at the end of the discussion that mr. wickson spoke. he was the
only one that was cool, and ernest treated him with a respect he had not
accorded the others.

“no answer is necessary,” mr. wickson said with slow deliberation. “i
have followed the whole discussion with amazement and disgust. i am
disgusted with you gentlemen, members of my class. you have behaved like
foolish little schoolboys, what with intruding ethics and the thunder
of the common politician into such a discussion. you have been
outgeneralled and outclassed. you have been very wordy, and all you have
done is buzz. you have buzzed like gnats about a bear. gentlemen, there
stands the bear” (he pointed at ernest), “and your buzzing has only
tickled his ears.

“believe me, the situation is serious. that bear reached out his paws
tonight to crush us. he has said there are a million and a half of
revolutionists in the united states. that is a fact. he has said that
it is their intention to take away from us our governments, our palaces,
and all our purpled ease. that, also, is a fact. a change, a great
change, is coming in society; but, haply, it may not be the change the
bear anticipates. the bear has said that he will crush us. what if we
crush the bear?”

the throat-rumble arose in the great room, and man nodded to man
with indorsement and certitude. their faces were set hard. they were
fighters, that was certain.

“but not by buzzing will we crush the bear,” mr. wickson went on coldly
and dispassionately. “we will hunt the bear. we will not reply to the
bear in words. our reply shall be couched in terms of lead. we are in
power. nobody will deny it. by virtue of that power we shall remain in
power.”

he turned suddenly upon ernest. the moment was dramatic.

“this, then, is our answer. we have no words to waste on you. when you
reach out your vaunted strong hands for our palaces and purpled ease,
we will show you what strength is. in roar of shell and shrapnel and
in whine of machine-guns will our answer be couched.* we will grind you
revolutionists down under our heel, and we shall walk upon your faces.
the world is ours, we are its lords, and ours it shall remain. as for
the host of labor, it has been in the dirt since history began, and i
read history aright. and in the dirt it shall remain so long as i and
mine and those that come after us have the power. there is the word.
it is the king of words--power. not god, not mammon, but power. pour it
over your tongue till it tingles with it. power.”

     * to show the tenor of thought, the following definition is
     quoted from “the cynic's word book” (1906 a.d.), written by
     one ambrose bierce, an avowed and confirmed misanthrope of
     the period: “grapeshot, n.  an argument which the future is
     preparing in answer to the demands of american socialism.”

“i am answered,” ernest said quietly. “it is the only answer that could
be given. power. it is what we of the working class preach. we know,
and well we know by bitter experience, that no appeal for the right, for
justice, for humanity, can ever touch you. your hearts are hard as
your heels with which you tread upon the faces of the poor. so we have
preached power. by the power of our ballots on election day will we take
your government away from you--”

“what if you do get a majority, a sweeping majority, on election
day?” mr. wickson broke in to demand. “suppose we refuse to turn the
government over to you after you have captured it at the ballot-box?”

“that, also, have we considered,” ernest replied. “and we shall give you
an answer in terms of lead. power you have proclaimed the king of words.
very good. power it shall be. and in the day that we sweep to victory at
the ballot-box, and you refuse to turn over to us the government we have
constitutionally and peacefully captured, and you demand what we are
going to do about it--in that day, i say, we shall answer you; and in
roar of shell and shrapnel and in whine of machine-guns shall our answer
be couched.

“you cannot escape us. it is true that you have read history aright. it
is true that labor has from the beginning of history been in the dirt.
and it is equally true that so long as you and yours and those that come
after you have power, that labor shall remain in the dirt. i agree with
you. i agree with all that you have said. power will be the arbiter,
as it always has been the arbiter. it is a struggle of classes. just as
your class dragged down the old feudal nobility, so shall it be dragged
down by my class, the working class. if you will read your biology and
your sociology as clearly as you do your history, you will see that this
end i have described is inevitable. it does not matter whether it is in
one year, ten, or a thousand--your class shall be dragged down. and it
shall be done by power. we of the labor hosts have conned that word over
till our minds are all a-tingle with it. power. it is a kingly word.”

and so ended the night with the philomaths.



chapter vi

adumbrations


it was about this time that the warnings of coming events began to fall
about us thick and fast. ernest had already questioned father's policy
of having socialists and labor leaders at his house, and of openly
attending socialist meetings; and father had only laughed at him for
his pains. as for myself, i was learning much from this contact with the
working-class leaders and thinkers. i was seeing the other side of
the shield. i was delighted with the unselfishness and high idealism
i encountered, though i was appalled by the vast philosophic and
scientific literature of socialism that was opened up to me. i was
learning fast, but i learned not fast enough to realize then the peril
of our position.

there were warnings, but i did not heed them. for instance, mrs.
pertonwaithe and mrs. wickson exercised tremendous social power in
the university town, and from them emanated the sentiment that i was a
too-forward and self-assertive young woman with a mischievous penchant
for officiousness and interference in other persons' affairs. this
i thought no more than natural, considering the part i had played
in investigating the case of jackson's arm. but the effect of such
a sentiment, enunciated by two such powerful social arbiters, i
underestimated.

true, i noticed a certain aloofness on the part of my general friends,
but this i ascribed to the disapproval that was prevalent in my circles
of my intended marriage with ernest. it was not till some time afterward
that ernest pointed out to me clearly that this general attitude of
my class was something more than spontaneous, that behind it were the
hidden springs of an organized conduct. “you have given shelter to an
enemy of your class,” he said. “and not alone shelter, for you have
given your love, yourself. this is treason to your class. think not that
you will escape being penalized.”

but it was before this that father returned one afternoon. ernest was
with me, and we could see that father was angry--philosophically angry.
he was rarely really angry; but a certain measure of controlled anger
he allowed himself. he called it a tonic. and we could see that he was
tonic-angry when he entered the room.

“what do you think?” he demanded. “i had luncheon with wilcox.”

wilcox was the superannuated president of the university, whose withered
mind was stored with generalizations that were young in 1870, and which
he had since failed to revise.

“i was invited,” father announced. “i was sent for.”

he paused, and we waited.

“oh, it was done very nicely, i'll allow; but i was reprimanded. i! and
by that old fossil!”

“i'll wager i know what you were reprimanded for,” ernest said.

“not in three guesses,” father laughed.

“one guess will do,” ernest retorted. “and it won't be a guess. it will
be a deduction. you were reprimanded for your private life.”

“the very thing!” father cried. “how did you guess?”

“i knew it was coming. i warned you before about it.”

“yes, you did,” father meditated. “but i couldn't believe it. at any
rate, it is only so much more clinching evidence for my book.”

“it is nothing to what will come,” ernest went on, “if you persist in
your policy of having these socialists and radicals of all sorts at your
house, myself included.”

“just what old wilcox said. and of all unwarranted things! he said it
was in poor taste, utterly profitless, anyway, and not in harmony with
university traditions and policy. he said much more of the same vague
sort, and i couldn't pin him down to anything specific. i made it pretty
awkward for him, and he could only go on repeating himself and telling
me how much he honored me, and all the world honored me, as a scientist.
it wasn't an agreeable task for him. i could see he didn't like it.”

“he was not a free agent,” ernest said. “the leg-bar* is not always worn
graciously.”

     * leg-bar--the african slaves were so manacled; also
     criminals.  it was not until the coming of the brotherhood
     of man that the leg-bar passed out of use.

“yes. i got that much out of him. he said the university needed ever
so much more money this year than the state was willing to furnish; and
that it must come from wealthy personages who could not but be offended
by the swerving of the university from its high ideal of the passionless
pursuit of passionless intelligence. when i tried to pin him down to
what my home life had to do with swerving the university from its high
ideal, he offered me a two years' vacation, on full pay, in europe,
for recreation and research. of course i couldn't accept it under the
circumstances.”

“it would have been far better if you had,” ernest said gravely.

“it was a bribe,” father protested; and ernest nodded.

“also, the beggar said that there was talk, tea-table gossip and so
forth, about my daughter being seen in public with so notorious a
character as you, and that it was not in keeping with university tone
and dignity. not that he personally objected--oh, no; but that there was
talk and that i would understand.”

ernest considered this announcement for a moment, and then said, and his
face was very grave, withal there was a sombre wrath in it:

“there is more behind this than a mere university ideal. somebody has
put pressure on president wilcox.”

“do you think so?” father asked, and his face showed that he was
interested rather than frightened.

“i wish i could convey to you the conception that is dimly forming in my
own mind,” ernest said. “never in the history of the world was society
in so terrific flux as it is right now. the swift changes in our
industrial system are causing equally swift changes in our religious,
political, and social structures. an unseen and fearful revolution is
taking place in the fibre and structure of society. one can only dimly
feel these things. but they are in the air, now, to-day. one can feel
the loom of them--things vast, vague, and terrible. my mind recoils from
contemplation of what they may crystallize into. you heard wickson talk
the other night. behind what he said were the same nameless, formless
things that i feel. he spoke out of a superconscious apprehension of
them.”

“you mean . . . ?” father began, then paused.

“i mean that there is a shadow of something colossal and menacing that
even now is beginning to fall across the land. call it the shadow of an
oligarchy, if you will; it is the nearest i dare approximate it. what
its nature may be i refuse to imagine.* but what i wanted to say was
this: you are in a perilous position--a peril that my own fear enhances
because i am not able even to measure it. take my advice and accept the
vacation.”

     * though, like everhard, they did not dream of the nature of
     it, there were men, even before his time, who caught
     glimpses of the shadow.  john c. calhoun said: “a power has
     risen up in the government greater than the people
     themselves, consisting of many and various and powerful
     interests, combined into one mass, and held together by the
     cohesive power of the vast surplus in the banks.”  and that
     great humanist, abraham lincoln, said, just before his
     assassination: “i see in the near future a crisis
     approaching that unnerves me and causes me to tremble for
     the safety of my country. . . .  corporations have been
     enthroned, an era of corruption in high places will follow,
     and the money-power of the country will endeavor to prolong
     its reign by working upon the prejudices of the people until
     the wealth is aggregated in a few hands and the republic is
     destroyed.”

“but it would be cowardly,” was the protest.

“not at all. you are an old man. you have done your work in the world,
and a great work. leave the present battle to youth and strength. we
young fellows have our work yet to do. avis will stand by my side in
what is to come. she will be your representative in the battle-front.”

“but they can't hurt me,” father objected. “thank god i am independent.
oh, i assure you, i know the frightful persecution they can wage on
a professor who is economically dependent on his university. but i am
independent. i have not been a professor for the sake of my salary. i
can get along very comfortably on my own income, and the salary is all
they can take away from me.”

“but you do not realize,” ernest answered. “if all that i fear be so,
your private income, your principal itself, can be taken from you just
as easily as your salary.”

father was silent for a few minutes. he was thinking deeply, and i could
see the lines of decision forming in his face. at last he spoke.

“i shall not take the vacation.” he paused again. “i shall go on with
my book.* you may be wrong, but whether you are wrong or right, i shall
stand by my guns.”

     * this book, “economics and education,” was published in
     that year. three copies of it are extant; two at ardis, and
     one at asgard.  it dealt, in elaborate detail, with one
     factor in the persistence of the established, namely, the
     capitalistic bias of the universities and common schools.
     it was a logical and crushing indictment of the whole system
     of education that developed in the minds of the students
     only such ideas as were favorable to the capitalistic
     regime, to the exclusion of all ideas that were inimical and
     subversive.  the book created a furor, and was promptly
     suppressed by the oligarchy.

“all right,” ernest said. “you are travelling the same path that bishop
morehouse is, and toward a similar smash-up. you'll both be proletarians
before you're done with it.”

the conversation turned upon the bishop, and we got ernest to explain
what he had been doing with him.

“he is soul-sick from the journey through hell i have given him. i took
him through the homes of a few of our factory workers. i showed him the
human wrecks cast aside by the industrial machine, and he listened to
their life stories. i took him through the slums of san francisco, and
in drunkenness, prostitution, and criminality he learned a deeper cause
than innate depravity. he is very sick, and, worse than that, he has got
out of hand. he is too ethical. he has been too severely touched. and,
as usual, he is unpractical. he is up in the air with all kinds of
ethical delusions and plans for mission work among the cultured. he
feels it is his bounden duty to resurrect the ancient spirit of the
church and to deliver its message to the masters. he is overwrought.
sooner or later he is going to break out, and then there's going to be
a smash-up. what form it will take i can't even guess. he is a pure,
exalted soul, but he is so unpractical. he's beyond me. i can't keep
his feet on the earth. and through the air he is rushing on to his
gethsemane. and after this his crucifixion. such high souls are made for
crucifixion.”

“and you?” i asked; and beneath my smile was the seriousness of the
anxiety of love.

“not i,” he laughed back. “i may be executed, or assassinated, but i
shall never be crucified. i am planted too solidly and stolidly upon the
earth.”

“but why should you bring about the crucifixion of the bishop?” i asked.
“you will not deny that you are the cause of it.”

“why should i leave one comfortable soul in comfort when there are
millions in travail and misery?” he demanded back.

“then why did you advise father to accept the vacation?”

“because i am not a pure, exalted soul,” was the answer. “because i am
solid and stolid and selfish. because i love you and, like ruth of
old, thy people are my people. as for the bishop, he has no daughter.
besides, no matter how small the good, nevertheless his little
inadequate wail will be productive of some good in the revolution, and
every little bit counts.”

i could not agree with ernest. i knew well the noble nature of
bishop morehouse, and i could not conceive that his voice raised for
righteousness would be no more than a little inadequate wail. but i did
not yet have the harsh facts of life at my fingers' ends as ernest had.
he saw clearly the futility of the bishop's great soul, as coming events
were soon to show as clearly to me.

it was shortly after this day that ernest told me, as a good story, the
offer he had received from the government, namely, an appointment as
united states commissioner of labor. i was overjoyed. the salary was
comparatively large, and would make safe our marriage. and then it
surely was congenial work for ernest, and, furthermore, my jealous pride
in him made me hail the proffered appointment as a recognition of his
abilities.

then i noticed the twinkle in his eyes. he was laughing at me.

“you are not going to . . . to decline?” i quavered.

“it is a bribe,” he said. “behind it is the fine hand of wickson, and
behind him the hands of greater men than he. it is an old trick, old as
the class struggle is old--stealing the captains from the army of labor.
poor betrayed labor! if you but knew how many of its leaders have been
bought out in similar ways in the past. it is cheaper, so much cheaper,
to buy a general than to fight him and his whole army. there was--but
i'll not call any names. i'm bitter enough over it as it is. dear heart,
i am a captain of labor. i could not sell out. if for no other reason,
the memory of my poor old father and the way he was worked to death
would prevent.”

the tears were in his eyes, this great, strong hero of mine. he never
could forgive the way his father had been malformed--the sordid lies and
the petty thefts he had been compelled to, in order to put food in his
children's mouths.

“my father was a good man,” ernest once said to me. “the soul of him was
good, and yet it was twisted, and maimed, and blunted by the savagery
of his life. he was made into a broken-down beast by his masters, the
arch-beasts. he should be alive to-day, like your father. he had a
strong constitution. but he was caught in the machine and worked to
death--for profit. think of it. for profit--his life blood transmuted
into a wine-supper, or a jewelled gewgaw, or some similar sense-orgy of
the parasitic and idle rich, his masters, the arch-beasts.”



chapter vii

the bishop's vision


“the bishop is out of hand,” ernest wrote me. “he is clear up in the
air. tonight he is going to begin putting to rights this very miserable
world of ours. he is going to deliver his message. he has told me so,
and i cannot dissuade him. to-night he is chairman of the i.p.h.,* and
he will embody his message in his introductory remarks.

     * there is no clew to the name of the organization for which
     these initials stand.

“may i bring you to hear him? of course, he is foredoomed to futility.
it will break your heart--it will break his; but for you it will be an
excellent object lesson. you know, dear heart, how proud i am because
you love me. and because of that i want you to know my fullest value, i
want to redeem, in your eyes, some small measure of my unworthiness.
and so it is that my pride desires that you shall know my thinking is
correct and right. my views are harsh; the futility of so noble a soul
as the bishop will show you the compulsion for such harshness. so come
to-night. sad though this night's happening will be, i feel that it will
but draw you more closely to me.”

the i.p.h. held its convention that night in san francisco.* this
convention had been called to consider public immorality and the remedy
for it. bishop morehouse presided. he was very nervous as he sat on the
platform, and i could see the high tension he was under. by his side
were bishop dickinson; h. h. jones, the head of the ethical department
in the university of california; mrs. w. w. hurd, the great charity
organizer; philip ward, the equally great philanthropist; and several
lesser luminaries in the field of morality and charity. bishop morehouse
arose and abruptly began:

     * it took but a few minutes to cross by ferry from berkeley
     to san francisco.  these, and the other bay cities,
     practically composed one community.

“i was in my brougham, driving through the streets. it was night-time.
now and then i looked through the carriage windows, and suddenly my eyes
seemed to be opened, and i saw things as they really are. at first i
covered my eyes with my hands to shut out the awful sight, and then, in
the darkness, the question came to me: what is to be done? what is to be
done? a little later the question came to me in another way: what would
the master do? and with the question a great light seemed to fill
the place, and i saw my duty sun-clear, as saul saw his on the way to
damascus.

“i stopped the carriage, got out, and, after a few minutes'
conversation, persuaded two of the public women to get into the brougham
with me. if jesus was right, then these two unfortunates were my
sisters, and the only hope of their purification was in my affection and
tenderness.

“i live in one of the loveliest localities of san francisco. the house
in which i live cost a hundred thousand dollars, and its furnishings,
books, and works of art cost as much more. the house is a mansion.
no, it is a palace, wherein there are many servants. i never knew what
palaces were good for. i had thought they were to live in. but now i
know. i took the two women of the street to my palace, and they are
going to stay with me. i hope to fill every room in my palace with such
sisters as they.”

the audience had been growing more and more restless and unsettled, and
the faces of those that sat on the platform had been betraying greater
and greater dismay and consternation. and at this point bishop dickinson
arose, and with an expression of disgust on his face, fled from the
platform and the hall. but bishop morehouse, oblivious to all, his eyes
filled with his vision, continued:

“oh, sisters and brothers, in this act of mine i find the solution of
all my difficulties. i didn't know what broughams were made for, but now
i know. they are made to carry the weak, the sick, and the aged; they
are made to show honor to those who have lost the sense even of shame.

“i did not know what palaces were made for, but now i have found a use
for them. the palaces of the church should be hospitals and nurseries
for those who have fallen by the wayside and are perishing.”

he made a long pause, plainly overcome by the thought that was in him,
and nervous how best to express it.

“i am not fit, dear brethren, to tell you anything about morality. i
have lived in shame and hypocrisies too long to be able to help others;
but my action with those women, sisters of mine, shows me that the
better way is easy to find. to those who believe in jesus and his gospel
there can be no other relation between man and man than the relation
of affection. love alone is stronger than sin--stronger than death. i
therefore say to the rich among you that it is their duty to do what i
have done and am doing. let each one of you who is prosperous take into
his house some thief and treat him as his brother, some unfortunate and
treat her as his sister, and san francisco will need no police force
and no magistrates; the prisons will be turned into hospitals, and the
criminal will disappear with his crime.

“we must give ourselves and not our money alone. we must do as christ
did; that is the message of the church today. we have wandered far from
the master's teaching. we are consumed in our own flesh-pots. we have
put mammon in the place of christ. i have here a poem that tells the
whole story. i should like to read it to you. it was written by an
erring soul who yet saw clearly.* it must not be mistaken for an attack
upon the catholic church. it is an attack upon all churches, upon the
pomp and splendor of all churches that have wandered from the master's
path and hedged themselves in from his lambs. here it is:

     “the silver trumpets rang across the dome;
             the people knelt upon the ground with awe;
             and borne upon the necks of men i saw,
     like some great god, the holy lord of rome.

     “priest-like, he wore a robe more white than foam,
             and, king-like, swathed himself in royal red,
             three crowns of gold rose high upon his head;
     in splendor and in light the pope passed home.

     “my heart stole back across wide wastes of years
             to one who wandered by a lonely sea;
     and sought in vain for any place of rest:
     'foxes have holes, and every bird its nest,
             i, only i, must wander wearily,
     and bruise my feet, and drink wine salt with tears.'”

     * oscar wilde, one of the lords of language of the
     nineteenth century of the christian era.

the audience was agitated, but unresponsive. yet bishop morehouse was
not aware of it. he held steadily on his way.

“and so i say to the rich among you, and to all the rich, that bitterly
you oppress the master's lambs. you have hardened your hearts. you have
closed your ears to the voices that are crying in the land--the voices
of pain and sorrow that you will not hear but that some day will be
heard. and so i say--”

but at this point h. h. jones and philip ward, who had already risen
from their chairs, led the bishop off the platform, while the audience
sat breathless and shocked.

ernest laughed harshly and savagely when he had gained the street. his
laughter jarred upon me. my heart seemed ready to burst with suppressed
tears.

“he has delivered his message,” ernest cried. “the manhood and the
deep-hidden, tender nature of their bishop burst out, and his christian
audience, that loved him, concluded that he was crazy! did you see them
leading him so solicitously from the platform? there must have been
laughter in hell at the spectacle.”

“nevertheless, it will make a great impression, what the bishop did and
said to-night,” i said.

“think so?” ernest queried mockingly.

“it will make a sensation,” i asserted. “didn't you see the reporters
scribbling like mad while he was speaking?”

“not a line of which will appear in to-morrow's papers.”

“i can't believe it,” i cried.

“just wait and see,” was the answer. “not a line, not a thought that he
uttered. the daily press? the daily suppressage!”

“but the reporters,” i objected. “i saw them.”

“not a word that he uttered will see print. you have forgotten the
editors. they draw their salaries for the policy they maintain. their
policy is to print nothing that is a vital menace to the established.
the bishop's utterance was a violent assault upon the established
morality. it was heresy. they led him from the platform to prevent him
from uttering more heresy. the newspapers will purge his heresy in the
oblivion of silence. the press of the united states? it is a parasitic
growth that battens on the capitalist class. its function is to serve
the established by moulding public opinion, and right well it serves it.

“let me prophesy. to-morrow's papers will merely mention that the bishop
is in poor health, that he has been working too hard, and that he broke
down last night. the next mention, some days hence, will be to the
effect that he is suffering from nervous prostration and has been given
a vacation by his grateful flock. after that, one of two things will
happen: either the bishop will see the error of his way and return from
his vacation a well man in whose eyes there are no more visions, or else
he will persist in his madness, and then you may expect to see in the
papers, couched pathetically and tenderly, the announcement of his
insanity. after that he will be left to gibber his visions to padded
walls.”

“now there you go too far!” i cried out.

“in the eyes of society it will truly be insanity,” he replied. “what
honest man, who is not insane, would take lost women and thieves into
his house to dwell with him sisterly and brotherly? true, christ died
between two thieves, but that is another story. insanity? the mental
processes of the man with whom one disagrees, are always wrong.
therefore the mind of the man is wrong. where is the line between
wrong mind and insane mind? it is inconceivable that any sane man can
radically disagree with one's most sane conclusions.

“there is a good example of it in this evening's paper. mary mckenna
lives south of market street. she is a poor but honest woman. she is
also patriotic. but she has erroneous ideas concerning the american flag
and the protection it is supposed to symbolize. and here's what happened
to her. her husband had an accident and was laid up in hospital three
months. in spite of taking in washing, she got behind in her rent.
yesterday they evicted her. but first, she hoisted an american flag, and
from under its folds she announced that by virtue of its protection they
could not turn her out on to the cold street. what was done? she was
arrested and arraigned for insanity. to-day she was examined by the
regular insanity experts. she was found insane. she was consigned to the
napa asylum.”

“but that is far-fetched,” i objected. “suppose i should disagree with
everybody about the literary style of a book. they wouldn't send me to
an asylum for that.”

“very true,” he replied. “but such divergence of opinion would
constitute no menace to society. therein lies the difference. the
divergence of opinion on the parts of mary mckenna and the bishop do
menace society. what if all the poor people should refuse to pay rent
and shelter themselves under the american flag? landlordism would go
crumbling. the bishop's views are just as perilous to society. ergo, to
the asylum with him.”

but still i refused to believe.

“wait and see,” ernest said, and i waited.

next morning i sent out for all the papers. so far ernest was right. not
a word that bishop morehouse had uttered was in print. mention was made
in one or two of the papers that he had been overcome by his feelings.
yet the platitudes of the speakers that followed him were reported at
length.

several days later the brief announcement was made that he had gone away
on a vacation to recover from the effects of overwork. so far so good,
but there had been no hint of insanity, nor even of nervous collapse.
little did i dream the terrible road the bishop was destined to
travel--the gethsemane and crucifixion that ernest had pondered about.



chapter viii

the machine breakers


it was just before ernest ran for congress, on the socialist ticket,
that father gave what he privately called his “profit and loss” dinner.
ernest called it the dinner of the machine breakers. in point of fact,
it was merely a dinner for business men--small business men, of
course. i doubt if one of them was interested in any business the total
capitalization of which exceeded a couple of hundred thousand dollars.
they were truly representative middle-class business men.

there was owen, of silverberg, owen & company--a large grocery firm with
several branch stores. we bought our groceries from them. there were
both partners of the big drug firm of kowalt & washburn, and mr.
asmunsen, the owner of a large granite quarry in contra costa county.
and there were many similar men, owners or part-owners in small
factories, small businesses and small industries--small capitalists, in
short.

they were shrewd-faced, interesting men, and they talked with simplicity
and clearness. their unanimous complaint was against the corporations
and trusts. their creed was, “bust the trusts.” all oppression
originated in the trusts, and one and all told the same tale of woe.
they advocated government ownership of such trusts as the railroads
and telegraphs, and excessive income taxes, graduated with ferocity,
to destroy large accumulations. likewise they advocated, as a cure for
local ills, municipal ownership of such public utilities as water, gas,
telephones, and street railways.

especially interesting was mr. asmunsen's narrative of his tribulations
as a quarry owner. he confessed that he never made any profits out of
his quarry, and this, in spite of the enormous volume of business
that had been caused by the destruction of san francisco by the big
earthquake. for six years the rebuilding of san francisco had been going
on, and his business had quadrupled and octupled, and yet he was no
better off.

“the railroad knows my business just a little bit better than i do,” he
said. “it knows my operating expenses to a cent, and it knows the terms
of my contracts. how it knows these things i can only guess. it must
have spies in my employ, and it must have access to the parties to all
my contracts. for look you, when i place a big contract, the terms
of which favor me a goodly profit, the freight rate from my quarry to
market is promptly raised. no explanation is made. the railroad gets my
profit. under such circumstances i have never succeeded in getting the
railroad to reconsider its raise. on the other hand, when there have
been accidents, increased expenses of operating, or contracts with less
profitable terms, i have always succeeded in getting the railroad to
lower its rate. what is the result? large or small, the railroad always
gets my profits.”

“what remains to you over and above,” ernest interrupted to ask, “would
roughly be the equivalent of your salary as a manager did the railroad
own the quarry.”

“the very thing,” mr. asmunsen replied. “only a short time ago i had my
books gone through for the past ten years. i discovered that for
those ten years my gain was just equivalent to a manager's salary. the
railroad might just as well have owned my quarry and hired me to run
it.”

“but with this difference,” ernest laughed; “the railroad would have had
to assume all the risk which you so obligingly assumed for it.”

“very true,” mr. asmunsen answered sadly.

having let them have their say, ernest began asking questions right and
left. he began with mr. owen.

“you started a branch store here in berkeley about six months ago?”

“yes,” mr. owen answered.

“and since then i've noticed that three little corner groceries have
gone out of business. was your branch store the cause of it?”

mr. owen affirmed with a complacent smile. “they had no chance against
us.”

“why not?”

“we had greater capital. with a large business there is always less
waste and greater efficiency.”

“and your branch store absorbed the profits of the three small ones. i
see. but tell me, what became of the owners of the three stores?”

“one is driving a delivery wagon for us. i don't know what happened to
the other two.”

ernest turned abruptly on mr. kowalt.

“you sell a great deal at cut-rates.* what have become of the owners of
the small drug stores that you forced to the wall?”

     * a lowering of selling price to cost, and even to less than
     cost. thus, a large company could sell at a loss for a
     longer period than a small company, and so drive the small
     company out of business.  a common device of competition.

“one of them, mr. haasfurther, has charge now of our prescription
department,” was the answer.

“and you absorbed the profits they had been making?”

“surely. that is what we are in business for.”

“and you?” ernest said suddenly to mr. asmunsen. “you are disgusted
because the railroad has absorbed your profits?”

mr. asmunsen nodded.

“what you want is to make profits yourself?”

again mr. asmunsen nodded.

“out of others?”

there was no answer.

“out of others?” ernest insisted.

“that is the way profits are made,” mr. asmunsen replied curtly.

“then the business game is to make profits out of others, and to prevent
others from making profits out of you. that's it, isn't it?”

ernest had to repeat his question before mr. asmunsen gave an answer,
and then he said:

“yes, that's it, except that we do not object to the others making
profits so long as they are not extortionate.”

“by extortionate you mean large; yet you do not object to making large
profits yourself? . . . surely not?”

and mr. asmunsen amiably confessed to the weakness. there was one other
man who was quizzed by ernest at this juncture, a mr. calvin, who had
once been a great dairy-owner.

“some time ago you were fighting the milk trust,” ernest said to him;
“and now you are in grange politics.* how did it happen?”

     * many efforts were made during this period to organize the
     perishing farmer class into a political party, the aim of
     which was destroy the trusts and corporations by drastic
     legislation.  all such attempts ended in failure.

“oh, i haven't quit the fight,” mr. calvin answered, and he looked
belligerent enough. “i'm fighting the trust on the only field where it
is possible to fight--the political field. let me show you. a few years
ago we dairymen had everything our own way.”

“but you competed among yourselves?” ernest interrupted.

“yes, that was what kept the profits down. we did try to organize, but
independent dairymen always broke through us. then came the milk trust.”

“financed by surplus capital from standard oil,” * ernest said.

     * the first successful great trust--almost a generation in
     advance of the rest.

“yes,” mr. calvin acknowledged. “but we did not know it at the time.
its agents approached us with a club. “come in and be fat,” was their
proposition, “or stay out and starve.” most of us came in. those that
didn't, starved. oh, it paid us . . . at first. milk was raised a cent a
quart. one-quarter of this cent came to us. three-quarters of it went to
the trust. then milk was raised another cent, only we didn't get any
of that cent. our complaints were useless. the trust was in control. we
discovered that we were pawns. finally, the additional quarter of a cent
was denied us. then the trust began to squeeze us out. what could we do?
we were squeezed out. there were no dairymen, only a milk trust.”

“but with milk two cents higher, i should think you could have
competed,” ernest suggested slyly.

“so we thought. we tried it.” mr. calvin paused a moment. “it broke us.
the trust could put milk upon the market more cheaply than we. it could
sell still at a slight profit when we were selling at actual loss.
i dropped fifty thousand dollars in that venture. most of us went
bankrupt.* the dairymen were wiped out of existence.”

     * bankruptcy--a peculiar institution that enabled an
     individual, who had failed in competitive industry, to
     forego paying his debts. the effect was to ameliorate the
     too savage conditions of the fang-and-claw social struggle.

“so the trust took your profits away from you,” ernest said, “and you've
gone into politics in order to legislate the trust out of existence and
get the profits back?”

mr. calvin's face lighted up. “that is precisely what i say in my
speeches to the farmers. that's our whole idea in a nutshell.”

“and yet the trust produces milk more cheaply than could the independent
dairymen?” ernest queried.

“why shouldn't it, with the splendid organization and new machinery its
large capital makes possible?”

“there is no discussion,” ernest answered. “it certainly should, and,
furthermore, it does.”

mr. calvin here launched out into a political speech in exposition of
his views. he was warmly followed by a number of the others, and the cry
of all was to destroy the trusts.

“poor simple folk,” ernest said to me in an undertone. “they see clearly
as far as they see, but they see only to the ends of their noses.”

a little later he got the floor again, and in his characteristic way
controlled it for the rest of the evening.

“i have listened carefully to all of you,” he began, “and i see plainly
that you play the business game in the orthodox fashion. life sums
itself up to you in profits. you have a firm and abiding belief that
you were created for the sole purpose of making profits. only there is a
hitch. in the midst of your own profit-making along comes the trust
and takes your profits away from you. this is a dilemma that interferes
somehow with the aim of creation, and the only way out, as it seems to
you, is to destroy that which takes from you your profits.

“i have listened carefully, and there is only one name that will
epitomize you. i shall call you that name. you are machine-breakers. do
you know what a machine-breaker is? let me tell you. in the eighteenth
century, in england, men and women wove cloth on hand-looms in their own
cottages. it was a slow, clumsy, and costly way of weaving cloth,
this cottage system of manufacture. along came the steam-engine and
labor-saving machinery. a thousand looms assembled in a large factory,
and driven by a central engine wove cloth vastly more cheaply than
could the cottage weavers on their hand-looms. here in the factory was
combination, and before it competition faded away. the men and women who
had worked the hand-looms for themselves now went into the factories
and worked the machine-looms, not for themselves, but for the capitalist
owners. furthermore, little children went to work on the machine-looms,
at lower wages, and displaced the men. this made hard times for the men.
their standard of living fell. they starved. and they said it was
all the fault of the machines. therefore, they proceeded to break the
machines. they did not succeed, and they were very stupid.

“yet you have not learned their lesson. here are you, a century and a
half later, trying to break machines. by your own confession the trust
machines do the work more efficiently and more cheaply than you can.
that is why you cannot compete with them. and yet you would break those
machines. you are even more stupid than the stupid workmen of england.
and while you maunder about restoring competition, the trusts go on
destroying you.

“one and all you tell the same story,--the passing away of competition
and the coming on of combination. you, mr. owen, destroyed competition
here in berkeley when your branch store drove the three small groceries
out of business. your combination was more effective. yet you feel the
pressure of other combinations on you, the trust combinations, and you
cry out. it is because you are not a trust. if you were a grocery trust
for the whole united states, you would be singing another song. and the
song would be, 'blessed are the trusts.' and yet again, not only is your
small combination not a trust, but you are aware yourself of its lack
of strength. you are beginning to divine your own end. you feel
yourself and your branch stores a pawn in the game. you see the powerful
interests rising and growing more powerful day by day; you feel their
mailed hands descending upon your profits and taking a pinch here and
a pinch there--the railroad trust, the oil trust, the steel trust, the
coal trust; and you know that in the end they will destroy you, take
away from you the last per cent of your little profits.

“you, sir, are a poor gamester. when you squeezed out the three small
groceries here in berkeley by virtue of your superior combination, you
swelled out your chest, talked about efficiency and enterprise, and sent
your wife to europe on the profits you had gained by eating up the three
small groceries. it is dog eat dog, and you ate them up. but, on the
other hand, you are being eaten up in turn by the bigger dogs, wherefore
you squeal. and what i say to you is true of all of you at this table.
you are all squealing. you are all playing the losing game, and you are
all squealing about it.

“but when you squeal you don't state the situation flatly, as i have
stated it. you don't say that you like to squeeze profits out of others,
and that you are making all the row because others are squeezing your
profits out of you. no, you are too cunning for that. you say something
else. you make small-capitalist political speeches such as mr. calvin
made. what did he say? here are a few of his phrases i caught: 'our
original principles are all right,' 'what this country requires is a
return to fundamental american methods--free opportunity for all,' 'the
spirit of liberty in which this nation was born,' 'let us return to the
principles of our forefathers.'

“when he says 'free opportunity for all,' he means free opportunity to
squeeze profits, which freedom of opportunity is now denied him by the
great trusts. and the absurd thing about it is that you have repeated
these phrases so often that you believe them. you want opportunity
to plunder your fellow-men in your own small way, but you hypnotize
yourselves into thinking you want freedom. you are piggish and
acquisitive, but the magic of your phrases leads you to believe that you
are patriotic. your desire for profits, which is sheer selfishness, you
metamorphose into altruistic solicitude for suffering humanity. come
on now, right here amongst ourselves, and be honest for once. look the
matter in the face and state it in direct terms.”

there were flushed and angry faces at the table, and withal a measure
of awe. they were a little frightened at this smooth-faced young fellow,
and the swing and smash of his words, and his dreadful trait of calling
a spade a spade. mr. calvin promptly replied.

“and why not?” he demanded. “why can we not return to ways of our
fathers when this republic was founded? you have spoken much truth, mr.
everhard, unpalatable though it has been. but here amongst ourselves let
us speak out. let us throw off all disguise and accept the truth as mr.
everhard has flatly stated it. it is true that we smaller capitalists
are after profits, and that the trusts are taking our profits away from
us. it is true that we want to destroy the trusts in order that our
profits may remain to us. and why can we not do it? why not? i say, why
not?”

“ah, now we come to the gist of the matter,” ernest said with a pleased
expression. “i'll try to tell you why not, though the telling will be
rather hard. you see, you fellows have studied business, in a small way,
but you have not studied social evolution at all. you are in the
midst of a transition stage now in economic evolution, but you do not
understand it, and that's what causes all the confusion. why cannot you
return? because you can't. you can no more make water run up hill than
can you cause the tide of economic evolution to flow back in its channel
along the way it came. joshua made the sun stand still upon gibeon, but
you would outdo joshua. you would make the sun go backward in the sky.
you would have time retrace its steps from noon to morning.

“in the face of labor-saving machinery, of organized production, of the
increased efficiency of combination, you would set the economic sun
back a whole generation or so to the time when there were no great
capitalists, no great machinery, no railroads--a time when a host of
little capitalists warred with each other in economic anarchy, and when
production was primitive, wasteful, unorganized, and costly. believe me,
joshua's task was easier, and he had jehovah to help him. but god has
forsaken you small capitalists. the sun of the small capitalists is
setting. it will never rise again. nor is it in your power even to make
it stand still. you are perishing, and you are doomed to perish utterly
from the face of society.

“this is the fiat of evolution. it is the word of god. combination is
stronger than competition. primitive man was a puny creature hiding in
the crevices of the rocks. he combined and made war upon his carnivorous
enemies. they were competitive beasts. primitive man was a combinative
beast, and because of it he rose to primacy over all the animals. and
man has been achieving greater and greater combinations ever since. it
is combination versus competition, a thousand centuries long struggle,
in which competition has always been worsted. whoso enlists on the side
of competition perishes.”

“but the trusts themselves arose out of competition,” mr. calvin
interrupted.

“very true,” ernest answered. “and the trusts themselves destroyed
competition. that, by your own word, is why you are no longer in the
dairy business.”

the first laughter of the evening went around the table, and even mr.
calvin joined in the laugh against himself.

“and now, while we are on the trusts,” ernest went on, “let us settle
a few things. i shall make certain statements, and if you disagree
with them, speak up. silence will mean agreement. is it not true that
a machine-loom will weave more cloth and weave more cheaply than a
hand-loom?” he paused, but nobody spoke up. “is it not then highly
irrational to break the machine-loom and go back to the clumsy and more
costly hand-loom method of weaving?” heads nodded in acquiescence. “is
it not true that that known as a trust produces more efficiently and
cheaply than can a thousand competing small concerns?” still no one
objected. “then is it not irrational to destroy that cheap and efficient
combination?”

no one answered for a long time. then mr. kowalt spoke.

“what are we to do, then?” he demanded. “to destroy the trusts is the
only way we can see to escape their domination.”

ernest was all fire and aliveness on the instant.

“i'll show you another way!” he cried. “let us not destroy those
wonderful machines that produce efficiently and cheaply. let us control
them. let us profit by their efficiency and cheapness. let us run them
for ourselves. let us oust the present owners of the wonderful machines,
and let us own the wonderful machines ourselves. that, gentlemen, is
socialism, a greater combination than the trusts, a greater economic and
social combination than any that has as yet appeared on the planet. it
is in line with evolution. we meet combination with greater combination.
it is the winning side. come on over with us socialists and play on the
winning side.”

here arose dissent. there was a shaking of heads, and mutterings arose.

“all right, then, you prefer to be anachronisms,” ernest laughed. “you
prefer to play atavistic roles. you are doomed to perish as all atavisms
perish. have you ever asked what will happen to you when greater
combinations than even the present trusts arise? have you ever
considered where you will stand when the great trusts themselves combine
into the combination of combinations--into the social, economic, and
political trust?”

he turned abruptly and irrelevantly upon mr. calvin.

“tell me,” ernest said, “if this is not true. you are compelled to form
a new political party because the old parties are in the hands of the
trusts. the chief obstacle to your grange propaganda is the trusts.
behind every obstacle you encounter, every blow that smites you, every
defeat that you receive, is the hand of the trusts. is this not so? tell
me.”

mr. calvin sat in uncomfortable silence.

“go ahead,” ernest encouraged.

“it is true,” mr. calvin confessed. “we captured the state legislature
of oregon and put through splendid protective legislation, and it was
vetoed by the governor, who was a creature of the trusts. we elected a
governor of colorado, and the legislature refused to permit him to take
office. twice we have passed a national income tax, and each time the
supreme court smashed it as unconstitutional. the courts are in the
hands of the trusts. we, the people, do not pay our judges sufficiently.
but there will come a time--”

“when the combination of the trusts will control all legislation, when
the combination of the trusts will itself be the government,” ernest
interrupted.

“never! never!” were the cries that arose. everybody was excited and
belligerent.

“tell me,” ernest demanded, “what will you do when such a time comes?”

“we will rise in our strength!” mr. asmunsen cried, and many voices
backed his decision.

“that will be civil war,” ernest warned them.

“so be it, civil war,” was mr. asmunsen's answer, with the cries of all
the men at the table behind him. “we have not forgotten the deeds of our
forefathers. for our liberties we are ready to fight and die.”

ernest smiled.

“do not forget,” he said, “that we had tacitly agreed that liberty in
your case, gentlemen, means liberty to squeeze profits out of others.”

the table was angry, now, fighting angry; but ernest controlled the
tumult and made himself heard.

“one more question. when you rise in your strength, remember, the reason
for your rising will be that the government is in the hands of the
trusts. therefore, against your strength the government will turn the
regular army, the navy, the militia, the police--in short, the whole
organized war machinery of the united states. where will your strength
be then?”

dismay sat on their faces, and before they could recover, ernest struck
again.

“do you remember, not so long ago, when our regular army was only fifty
thousand? year by year it has been increased until to-day it is three
hundred thousand.”

again he struck.

“nor is that all. while you diligently pursued that favorite phantom
of yours, called profits, and moralized about that favorite fetich of
yours, called competition, even greater and more direful things have
been accomplished by combination. there is the militia.”

“it is our strength!” cried mr. kowalt. “with it we would repel the
invasion of the regular army.”

“you would go into the militia yourself,” was ernest's retort, “and
be sent to maine, or florida, or the philippines, or anywhere else,
to drown in blood your own comrades civil-warring for their liberties.
while from kansas, or wisconsin, or any other state, your own comrades
would go into the militia and come here to california to drown in blood
your own civil-warring.”

now they were really shocked, and they sat wordless, until mr. owen
murmured:

“we would not go into the militia. that would settle it. we would not be
so foolish.”

ernest laughed outright.

“you do not understand the combination that has been effected. you could
not help yourself. you would be drafted into the militia.”

“there is such a thing as civil law,” mr. owen insisted.

“not when the government suspends civil law. in that day when you
speak of rising in your strength, your strength would be turned against
yourself. into the militia you would go, willy-nilly. habeas corpus, i
heard some one mutter just now. instead of habeas corpus you would get
post mortems. if you refused to go into the militia, or to obey after
you were in, you would be tried by drumhead court martial and shot down
like dogs. it is the law.”

“it is not the law!” mr. calvin asserted positively. “there is no such
law. young man, you have dreamed all this. why, you spoke of sending the
militia to the philippines. that is unconstitutional. the constitution
especially states that the militia cannot be sent out of the country.”

“what's the constitution got to do with it?” ernest demanded. “the
courts interpret the constitution, and the courts, as mr. asmunsen
agreed, are the creatures of the trusts. besides, it is as i have said,
the law. it has been the law for years, for nine years, gentlemen.”

“that we can be drafted into the militia?” mr. calvin asked
incredulously. “that they can shoot us by drumhead court martial if we
refuse?”

“yes,” ernest answered, “precisely that.”

“how is it that we have never heard of this law?” my father asked, and i
could see that it was likewise new to him.

“for two reasons,” ernest said. “first, there has been no need to
enforce it. if there had, you'd have heard of it soon enough. and
secondly, the law was rushed through congress and the senate secretly,
with practically no discussion. of course, the newspapers made no
mention of it. but we socialists knew about it. we published it in our
papers. but you never read our papers.”

“i still insist you are dreaming,” mr. calvin said stubbornly. “the
country would never have permitted it.”

“but the country did permit it,” ernest replied. “and as for my
dreaming--” he put his hand in his pocket and drew out a small
pamphlet--“tell me if this looks like dream-stuff.”

he opened it and began to read:

“'section one, be it enacted, and so forth and so forth, that the
militia shall consist of every able-bodied male citizen of the
respective states, territories, and district of columbia, who is more
than eighteen and less than forty-five years of age.'

“'section seven, that any officer or enlisted man'--remember section
one, gentlemen, you are all enlisted men--'that any enlisted man of the
militia who shall refuse or neglect to present himself to such mustering
officer upon being called forth as herein prescribed, shall be subject
to trial by court martial, and shall be punished as such court martial
shall direct.'

“'section eight, that courts martial, for the trial of officers or men
of the militia, shall be composed of militia officers only.'

“'section nine, that the militia, when called into the actual service
of the united states, shall be subject to the same rules and articles of
war as the regular troops of the united states.'

“there you are gentlemen, american citizens, and fellow-militiamen. nine
years ago we socialists thought that law was aimed against labor. but it
would seem that it was aimed against you, too. congressman wiley, in the
brief discussion that was permitted, said that the bill 'provided for
a reserve force to take the mob by the throat'--you're the mob,
gentlemen--'and protect at all hazards life, liberty, and property.' and
in the time to come, when you rise in your strength, remember that you
will be rising against the property of the trusts, and the liberty of
the trusts, according to the law, to squeeze you. your teeth are pulled,
gentlemen. your claws are trimmed. in the day you rise in your strength,
toothless and clawless, you will be as harmless as any army of clams.”

“i don't believe it!” kowalt cried. “there is no such law. it is a
canard got up by you socialists.”

“this bill was introduced in the house of representatives on july 30,
1902,” was the reply. “it was introduced by representative dick of
ohio. it was rushed through. it was passed unanimously by the senate
on january 14, 1903. and just seven days afterward was approved by the
president of the united states.” *

     * everhard was right in the essential particulars, though
     his date of the introduction of the bill is in error.  the
     bill was introduced on june 30, and not on july 30.  the
     congressional record is here in ardis, and a reference to it
     shows mention of the bill on the following dates: june 30,
     december 9, 15, 16, and 17, 1902, and january 7 and 14,
     1903.  the ignorance evidenced by the business men at the
     dinner was nothing unusual.  very few people knew of the
     existence of this law.  e.  untermann, a revolutionist, in
     july, 1903, published a pamphlet at girard, kansas, on the
     “militia bill.”  this pamphlet had a small circulation among
     workingmen; but already had the segregation of classes
     proceeded so far, that the members of the middle class never
     heard of the pamphlet at all, and so remained in ignorance
     of the law.



chapter ix

the mathematics of a dream


in the midst of the consternation his revelation had produced, ernest
began again to speak.

“you have said, a dozen of you to-night, that socialism is impossible.
you have asserted the impossible, now let me demonstrate the inevitable.
not only is it inevitable that you small capitalists shall pass away,
but it is inevitable that the large capitalists, and the trusts also,
shall pass away. remember, the tide of evolution never flows backward.
it flows on and on, and it flows from competition to combination, and
from little combination to large combination, and from large combination
to colossal combination, and it flows on to socialism, which is the most
colossal combination of all.

“you tell me that i dream. very good. i'll give you the mathematics
of my dream; and here, in advance, i challenge you to show that
my mathematics are wrong. i shall develop the inevitability of
the breakdown of the capitalist system, and i shall demonstrate
mathematically why it must break down. here goes, and bear with me if at
first i seem irrelevant.

“let us, first of all, investigate a particular industrial process, and
whenever i state something with which you disagree, please interrupt
me. here is a shoe factory. this factory takes leather and makes it into
shoes. here is one hundred dollars' worth of leather. it goes through
the factory and comes out in the form of shoes, worth, let us say, two
hundred dollars. what has happened? one hundred dollars has been added
to the value of the leather. how was it added? let us see.

“capital and labor added this value of one hundred dollars. capital
furnished the factory, the machines, and paid all the expenses. labor
furnished labor. by the joint effort of capital and labor one hundred
dollars of value was added. are you all agreed so far?”

heads nodded around the table in affirmation.

“labor and capital having produced this one hundred dollars, now proceed
to divide it. the statistics of this division are fractional; so let
us, for the sake of convenience, make them roughly approximate. capital
takes fifty dollars as its share, and labor gets in wages fifty dollars
as its share. we will not enter into the squabbling over the division.*
no matter how much squabbling takes place, in one percentage or another
the division is arranged. and take notice here, that what is true of
this particular industrial process is true of all industrial processes.
am i right?”

     * everhard here clearly develops the cause of all the labor
     troubles of that time.  in the division of the joint-product,
     capital wanted all it could get, and labor wanted
     all it could get. this quarrel over the division was
     irreconcilable.  so long as the system of capitalistic
     production existed, labor and capital continued to quarrel
     over the division of the joint-product.  it is a ludicrous
     spectacle to us, but we must not forget that we have seven
     centuries' advantage over those that lived in that time.

again the whole table agreed with ernest.

“now, suppose labor, having received its fifty dollars, wanted to buy
back shoes. it could only buy back fifty dollars' worth. that's clear,
isn't it?

“and now we shift from this particular process to the sum total of all
industrial processes in the united states, which includes the leather
itself, raw material, transportation, selling, everything. we will say,
for the sake of round figures, that the total production of wealth in
the united states is one year is four billion dollars. then labor has
received in wages, during the same period, two billion dollars. four
billion dollars has been produced. how much of this can labor buy
back? two billions. there is no discussion of this, i am sure. for that
matter, my percentages are mild. because of a thousand capitalistic
devices, labor cannot buy back even half of the total product.

“but to return. we will say labor buys back two billions. then it stands
to reason that labor can consume only two billions. there are still two
billions to be accounted for, which labor cannot buy back and consume.”

“labor does not consume its two billions, even,” mr. kowalt spoke up.
“if it did, it would not have any deposits in the savings banks.”

“labor's deposits in the savings banks are only a sort of reserve fund
that is consumed as fast as it accumulates. these deposits are saved
for old age, for sickness and accident, and for funeral expenses. the
savings bank deposit is simply a piece of the loaf put back on the shelf
to be eaten next day. no, labor consumes all of the total product that
its wages will buy back.

“two billions are left to capital. after it has paid its expenses, does
it consume the remainder? does capital consume all of its two billions?”

ernest stopped and put the question point blank to a number of the men.
they shook their heads.

“i don't know,” one of them frankly said.

“of course you do,” ernest went on. “stop and think a moment. if capital
consumed its share, the sum total of capital could not increase. it
would remain constant. if you will look at the economic history of
the united states, you will see that the sum total of capital has
continually increased. therefore capital does not consume its share. do
you remember when england owned so much of our railroad bonds? as the
years went by, we bought back those bonds. what does that mean? that
part of capital's unconsumed share bought back the bonds. what is the
meaning of the fact that to-day the capitalists of the united states own
hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars of mexican bonds, russian
bonds, italian bonds, grecian bonds? the meaning is that those hundreds
and hundreds of millions were part of capital's share which capital
did not consume. furthermore, from the very beginning of the capitalist
system, capital has never consumed all of its share.

“and now we come to the point. four billion dollars of wealth is
produced in one year in the united states. labor buys back and consumes
two billions. capital does not consume the remaining two billions. there
is a large balance left over unconsumed. what is done with this balance?
what can be done with it? labor cannot consume any of it, for labor
has already spent all its wages. capital will not consume this balance,
because, already, according to its nature, it has consumed all it can.
and still remains the balance. what can be done with it? what is done
with it?”

“it is sold abroad,” mr. kowalt volunteered.

“the very thing,” ernest agreed. “because of this balance arises our
need for a foreign market. this is sold abroad. it has to be sold
abroad. there is no other way of getting rid of it. and that unconsumed
surplus, sold abroad, becomes what we call our favorable balance of
trade. are we all agreed so far?”

“surely it is a waste of time to elaborate these a b c's of commerce,”
 mr. calvin said tartly. “we all understand them.”

“and it is by these a b c's i have so carefully elaborated that i shall
confound you,” ernest retorted. “there's the beauty of it. and i'm going
to confound you with them right now. here goes.

“the united states is a capitalist country that has developed its
resources. according to its capitalist system of industry, it has an
unconsumed surplus that must be got rid of, and that must be got rid
of abroad.* what is true of the united states is true of every other
capitalist country with developed resources. every one of such countries
has an unconsumed surplus. don't forget that they have already traded
with one another, and that these surpluses yet remain. labor in all
these countries has spent its wages, and cannot buy any of the surpluses.
capital in all these countries has already consumed all it is able
according to its nature. and still remain the surpluses. they cannot
dispose of these surpluses to one another. how are they going to get rid
of them?”

     * theodore roosevelt, president of the united states a few
     years prior to this time, made the following public
     declaration: “a more liberal and extensive reciprocity in
     the purchase and sale of commodities is necessary, so that
     the overproduction of the united states can be
     satisfactorily disposed of to foreign countries.”  of
     course, this overproduction he mentions was the profits of
     the capitalist system over and beyond the consuming power of
     the capitalists.  it was at this time that senator mark
     hanna said: “the production of wealth in the united states
     is one-third larger annually than its consumption.”  also a
     fellow-senator, chauncey depew, said: “the american people
     produce annually two billions more wealth than they
     consume.”

“sell them to countries with undeveloped resources,” mr. kowalt
suggested.

“the very thing. you see, my argument is so clear and simple that
in your own minds you carry it on for me. and now for the next step.
suppose the united states disposes of its surplus to a country with
undeveloped resources like, say, brazil. remember this surplus is over
and above trade, which articles of trade have been consumed. what, then,
does the united states get in return from brazil?”

“gold,” said mr. kowalt.

“but there is only so much gold, and not much of it, in the world,”
 ernest objected.

“gold in the form of securities and bonds and so forth,” mr. kowalt
amended.

“now you've struck it,” ernest said. “from brazil the united states, in
return for her surplus, gets bonds and securities. and what does that
mean? it means that the united states is coming to own railroads in
brazil, factories, mines, and lands in brazil. and what is the meaning
of that in turn?”

mr. kowalt pondered and shook his head.

“i'll tell you,” ernest continued. “it means that the resources of
brazil are being developed. and now, the next point. when brazil, under
the capitalist system, has developed her resources, she will herself
have an unconsumed surplus. can she get rid of this surplus to the
united states? no, because the united states has herself a surplus. can
the united states do what she previously did--get rid of her surplus to
brazil? no, for brazil now has a surplus, too.

“what happens? the united states and brazil must both seek out other
countries with undeveloped resources, in order to unload the surpluses
on them. but by the very process of unloading the surpluses, the
resources of those countries are in turn developed. soon they have
surpluses, and are seeking other countries on which to unload. now,
gentlemen, follow me. the planet is only so large. there are only so
many countries in the world. what will happen when every country in
the world, down to the smallest and last, with a surplus in its hands,
stands confronting every other country with surpluses in their hands?”

he paused and regarded his listeners. the bepuzzlement in their faces
was delicious. also, there was awe in their faces. out of abstractions
ernest had conjured a vision and made them see it. they were seeing it
then, as they sat there, and they were frightened by it.

“we started with a b c, mr. calvin,” ernest said slyly. “i have now
given you the rest of the alphabet. it is very simple. that is the
beauty of it. you surely have the answer forthcoming. what, then, when
every country in the world has an unconsumed surplus? where will your
capitalist system be then?”

but mr. calvin shook a troubled head. he was obviously questing back
through ernest's reasoning in search of an error.

“let me briefly go over the ground with you again,” ernest said. “we
began with a particular industrial process, the shoe factory. we found
that the division of the joint product that took place there was similar
to the division that took place in the sum total of all industrial
processes. we found that labor could buy back with its wages only
so much of the product, and that capital did not consume all of the
remainder of the product. we found that when labor had consumed to the
full extent of its wages, and when capital had consumed all it wanted,
there was still left an unconsumed surplus. we agreed that this surplus
could only be disposed of abroad. we agreed, also, that the effect
of unloading this surplus on another country would be to develop the
resources of that country, and that in a short time that country
would have an unconsumed surplus. we extended this process to all the
countries on the planet, till every country was producing every year,
and every day, an unconsumed surplus, which it could dispose of to no
other country. and now i ask you again, what are we going to do with
those surpluses?”

still no one answered.

“mr. calvin?” ernest queried.

“it beats me,” mr. calvin confessed.

“i never dreamed of such a thing,” mr. asmunsen said. “and yet it does
seem clear as print.”

it was the first time i had ever heard karl marx's* doctrine of surplus
value elaborated, and ernest had done it so simply that i, too, sat
puzzled and dumbfounded.

     * karl marx--the great intellectual hero of socialism.  a
     german jew of the nineteenth century.  a contemporary of
     john stuart mill. it seems incredible to us that whole
     generations should have elapsed after the enunciation of
     marx's economic discoveries, in which time he was sneered at
     by the world's accepted thinkers and scholars.  because of
     his discoveries he was banished from his native country, and
     he died an exile in england.

“i'll tell you a way to get rid of the surplus,” ernest said. “throw it
into the sea. throw every year hundreds of millions of dollars' worth
of shoes and wheat and clothing and all the commodities of commerce into
the sea. won't that fix it?”

“it will certainly fix it,” mr. calvin answered. “but it is absurd for
you to talk that way.”

ernest was upon him like a flash.

“is it a bit more absurd than what you advocate, you machine-breaker,
returning to the antediluvian ways of your forefathers? what do you
propose in order to get rid of the surplus? you would escape the problem
of the surplus by not producing any surplus. and how do you propose
to avoid producing a surplus? by returning to a primitive method of
production, so confused and disorderly and irrational, so wasteful and
costly, that it will be impossible to produce a surplus.”

mr. calvin swallowed. the point had been driven home. he swallowed again
and cleared his throat.

“you are right,” he said. “i stand convicted. it is absurd. but we've
got to do something. it is a case of life and death for us of the middle
class. we refuse to perish. we elect to be absurd and to return to the
truly crude and wasteful methods of our forefathers. we will put back
industry to its pre-trust stage. we will break the machines. and what
are you going to do about it?”

“but you can't break the machines,” ernest replied. “you cannot make the
tide of evolution flow backward. opposed to you are two great forces,
each of which is more powerful than you of the middle class. the large
capitalists, the trusts, in short, will not let you turn back. they
don't want the machines destroyed. and greater than the trusts, and
more powerful, is labor. it will not let you destroy the machines. the
ownership of the world, along with the machines, lies between the
trusts and labor. that is the battle alignment. neither side wants
the destruction of the machines. but each side wants to possess the
machines. in this battle the middle class has no place. the middle class
is a pygmy between two giants. don't you see, you poor perishing middle
class, you are caught between the upper and nether millstones, and even
now has the grinding begun.

“i have demonstrated to you mathematically the inevitable breakdown of
the capitalist system. when every country stands with an unconsumed and
unsalable surplus on its hands, the capitalist system will break down
under the terrific structure of profits that it itself has reared. and
in that day there won't be any destruction of the machines. the struggle
then will be for the ownership of the machines. if labor wins, your way
will be easy. the united states, and the whole world for that matter,
will enter upon a new and tremendous era. instead of being crushed by
the machines, life will be made fairer, and happier, and nobler by
them. you of the destroyed middle class, along with labor--there will
be nothing but labor then; so you, and all the rest of labor, will
participate in the equitable distribution of the products of the
wonderful machines. and we, all of us, will make new and more wonderful
machines. and there won't be any unconsumed surplus, because there won't
be any profits.”

“but suppose the trusts win in this battle over the ownership of the
machines and the world?” mr. kowalt asked.

“then,” ernest answered, “you, and labor, and all of us, will be crushed
under the iron heel of a despotism as relentless and terrible as any
despotism that has blackened the pages of the history of man. that will
be a good name for that despotism, the iron heel.” *

     * the earliest known use of that name to designate the
     oligarchy.

there was a long pause, and every man at the table meditated in ways
unwonted and profound.

“but this socialism of yours is a dream,” mr. calvin said; and repeated,
“a dream.”

“i'll show you something that isn't a dream, then,” ernest answered.
“and that something i shall call the oligarchy. you call it the
plutocracy. we both mean the same thing, the large capitalists or the
trusts. let us see where the power lies today. and in order to do so,
let us apportion society into its class divisions.

“there are three big classes in society. first comes the plutocracy,
which is composed of wealthy bankers, railway magnates, corporation
directors, and trust magnates. second, is the middle class, your class,
gentlemen, which is composed of farmers, merchants, small manufacturers,
and professional men. and third and last comes my class, the
proletariat, which is composed of the wage-workers.*

     * this division of society made by everhard is in accordance
     with that made by lucien sanial, one of the statistical
     authorities of that time.  his calculation of the membership
     of these divisions by occupation, from the united states
     census of 1900, is as follows: plutocratic class, 250,251;
     middle class, 8,429,845; and proletariat class, 20,393,137.

“you cannot but grant that the ownership of wealth constitutes essential
power in the united states to-day. how is this wealth owned by these
three classes? here are the figures. the plutocracy owns sixty-seven
billions of wealth. of the total number of persons engaged in
occupations in the united states, only nine-tenths of one per cent are
from the plutocracy, yet the plutocracy owns seventy per cent of the
total wealth. the middle class owns twenty-four billions. twenty-nine
per cent of those in occupations are from the middle class, and they own
twenty-five per cent of the total wealth. remains the proletariat. it
owns four billions. of all persons in occupations, seventy per cent
come from the proletariat; and the proletariat owns four per cent of the
total wealth. where does the power lie, gentlemen?”

“from your own figures, we of the middle class are more powerful than
labor,” mr. asmunsen remarked.

“calling us weak does not make you stronger in the face of the strength
of the plutocracy,” ernest retorted. “and furthermore, i'm not done with
you. there is a greater strength than wealth, and it is greater because
it cannot be taken away. our strength, the strength of the proletariat,
is in our muscles, in our hands to cast ballots, in our fingers to pull
triggers. this strength we cannot be stripped of. it is the primitive
strength, it is the strength that is to life germane, it is the strength
that is stronger than wealth, and that wealth cannot take away.

“but your strength is detachable. it can be taken away from you. even
now the plutocracy is taking it away from you. in the end it will take
it all away from you. and then you will cease to be the middle class.
you will descend to us. you will become proletarians. and the beauty of
it is that you will then add to our strength. we will hail you brothers,
and we will fight shoulder to shoulder in the cause of humanity.

“you see, labor has nothing concrete of which to be despoiled. its
share of the wealth of the country consists of clothes and household
furniture, with here and there, in very rare cases, an unencumbered
home. but you have the concrete wealth, twenty-four billions of it, and
the plutocracy will take it away from you. of course, there is the large
likelihood that the proletariat will take it away first. don't you
see your position, gentlemen? the middle class is a wobbly little lamb
between a lion and a tiger. if one doesn't get you, the other will. and
if the plutocracy gets you first, why it's only a matter of time when
the proletariat gets the plutocracy.

“even your present wealth is not a true measure of your power. the
strength of your wealth at this moment is only an empty shell. that is
why you are crying out your feeble little battle-cry, 'return to the
ways of our fathers.' you are aware of your impotency. you know that
your strength is an empty shell. and i'll show you the emptiness of it.

“what power have the farmers? over fifty per cent are thralls by virtue
of the fact that they are merely tenants or are mortgaged. and all of
them are thralls by virtue of the fact that the trusts already own or
control (which is the same thing only better)--own and control all
the means of marketing the crops, such as cold storage, railroads,
elevators, and steamship lines. and, furthermore, the trusts control
the markets. in all this the farmers are without power. as regards their
political and governmental power, i'll take that up later, along with
the political and governmental power of the whole middle class.

“day by day the trusts squeeze out the farmers as they squeezed out mr.
calvin and the rest of the dairymen. and day by day are the merchants
squeezed out in the same way. do you remember how, in six months, the
tobacco trust squeezed out over four hundred cigar stores in new york
city alone? where are the old-time owners of the coal fields? you know
today, without my telling you, that the railroad trust owns or controls
the entire anthracite and bituminous coal fields. doesn't the standard
oil trust* own a score of the ocean lines? and does it not also control
copper, to say nothing of running a smelter trust as a little side
enterprise? there are ten thousand cities in the united states to-night
lighted by the companies owned or controlled by standard oil, and in
as many cities all the electric transportation,--urban, suburban, and
interurban,--is in the hands of standard oil. the small capitalists who
were in these thousands of enterprises are gone. you know that. it's the
same way that you are going.

     * standard oil and rockefeller--see upcoming footnote:
     “rockefeller began as a member . . .”

“the small manufacturer is like the farmer; and small manufacturers
and farmers to-day are reduced, to all intents and purposes, to feudal
tenure. for that matter, the professional men and the artists are
at this present moment villeins in everything but name, while the
politicians are henchmen. why do you, mr. calvin, work all your nights
and days to organize the farmers, along with the rest of the middle
class, into a new political party? because the politicians of the old
parties will have nothing to do with your atavistic ideas; and with your
atavistic ideas, they will have nothing to do because they are what i
said they are, henchmen, retainers of the plutocracy.

“i spoke of the professional men and the artists as villeins. what else
are they? one and all, the professors, the preachers, and the editors,
hold their jobs by serving the plutocracy, and their service consists of
propagating only such ideas as are either harmless to or commendatory
of the plutocracy. whenever they propagate ideas that menace the
plutocracy, they lose their jobs, in which case, if they have not
provided for the rainy day, they descend into the proletariat and either
perish or become working-class agitators. and don't forget that it is
the press, the pulpit, and the university that mould public opinion, set
the thought-pace of the nation. as for the artists, they merely pander
to the little less than ignoble tastes of the plutocracy.

“but after all, wealth in itself is not the real power; it is the means
to power, and power is governmental. who controls the government to-day?
the proletariat with its twenty millions engaged in occupations? even
you laugh at the idea. does the middle class, with its eight million
occupied members? no more than the proletariat. who, then, controls
the government? the plutocracy, with its paltry quarter of a million
of occupied members. but this quarter of a million does not control the
government, though it renders yeoman service. it is the brain of the
plutocracy that controls the government, and this brain consists of
seven* small and powerful groups of men. and do not forget that these
groups are working to-day practically in unison.

     * even as late as 1907, it was considered that eleven groups
     dominated the country, but this number was reduced by the
     amalgamation of the five railroad groups into a supreme
     combination of all the railroads.  these five groups so
     amalgamated, along with their financial and political
     allies, were (1) james j. hill with his control of the
     northwest; (2) the pennsylvania railway group, schiff
     financial manager, with big banking firms of philadelphia
     and new york; (3) harriman, with frick for counsel and odell
     as political lieutenant, controlling the central
     continental, southwestern and southern pacific coast lines
     of transportation; (4) the gould family railway interests;
     and (5) moore, reid, and leeds, known as the “rock island
     crowd.”  these strong oligarchs arose out of the conflict of
     competition and travelled the inevitable road toward
     combination.

“let me point out the power of but one of them, the railroad group. it
employs forty thousand lawyers to defeat the people in the courts. it
issues countless thousands of free passes to judges, bankers, editors,
ministers, university men, members of state legislatures, and of
congress. it maintains luxurious lobbies* at every state capital, and
at the national capital; and in all the cities and towns of the land
it employs an immense army of pettifoggers and small politicians whose
business is to attend primaries, pack conventions, get on juries, bribe
judges, and in every way to work for its interests.**

     * lobby--a peculiar institution for bribing, bulldozing, and
     corrupting the legislators who were supposed to represent
     the people's interests.

     ** a decade before this speech of everhard's, the new york
     board of trade issued a report from which the following is
     quoted: “the railroads control absolutely the legislatures
     of a majority of the states of the union; they make and
     unmake united states senators, congressmen, and governors,
     and are practically dictators of the governmental policy of
     the united states.”

“gentlemen, i have merely sketched the power of one of the seven groups
that constitute the brain of the plutocracy.* your twenty-four billions
of wealth does not give you twenty-five cents' worth of governmental
power. it is an empty shell, and soon even the empty shell will be taken
away from you. the plutocracy has all power in its hands to-day. it
to-day makes the laws, for it owns the senate, congress, the courts, and
the state legislatures. and not only that. behind law must be force to
execute the law. to-day the plutocracy makes the law, and to enforce the
law it has at its beck and call the, police, the army, the navy, and,
lastly, the militia, which is you, and me, and all of us.”

     * rockefeller began as a member of the proletariat, and
     through thrift and cunning succeeded in developing the first
     perfect trust, namely that known as standard oil.  we cannot
     forbear giving the following remarkable page from the
     history of the times, to show how the need for reinvestment
     of the standard oil surplus crushed out small capitalists
     and hastened the breakdown of the capitalist system.  david
     graham phillips was a radical writer of the period, and the
     quotation, by him, is taken from a copy of the saturday
     evening post, dated october 4, 1902 a.d.  this is the only
     copy of this publication that has come down to us, and yet,
     from its appearance and content, we cannot but conclude that
     it was one of the popular periodicals with a large
     circulation.  the quotation here follows:

     “about ten years ago rockefeller's income was given as
     thirty millions by an excellent authority.  he had reached
     the limit of profitable investment of profits in the oil
     industry.  here, then, were these enormous sums in cash
     pouring in--more than $2,000,000 a month for john davison
     rockefeller alone.  the problem of reinvestment became more
     serious.  it became a nightmare.  the oil income was
     swelling, swelling, and the number of sound investments
     limited, even more limited than it is now.  it was through
     no special eagerness for more gains that the rockefellers
     began to branch out from oil into other things.  they were
     forced, swept on by this inrolling tide of wealth which
     their monopoly magnet irresistibly attracted.  they
     developed a staff of investment seekers and investigators.
     it is said that the chief of this staff has a salary of
     $125,000 a year.

     “the first conspicuous excursion and incursion of the
     rockefellers was into the railway field.  by 1895 they
     controlled one-fifth of the railway mileage of the country.
     what do they own or, through dominant ownership, control
     to-day?  they are powerful in all the great railways of new
     york, north, east, and west, except one, where their share
     is only a few millions.  they are in most of the great
     railways radiating from chicago.  they dominate in several
     of the systems that extend to the pacific.  it is their
     votes that make mr. morgan so potent, though, it may be
     added, they need his brains more than he needs their votes--
     at present, and the combination of the two constitutes in
     large measure the 'community of interest.'

     “but railways could not alone absorb rapidly enough those
     mighty floods of gold.  presently john d. rockefeller's
     $2,500,000 a month had increased to four, to five, to six
     millions a month, to $75,000,000 a year.  illuminating oil
     was becoming all profit.  the reinvestments of income were
     adding their mite of many annual millions.

     “the rockefellers went into gas and electricity when those
     industries had developed to the safe investment stage.  and
     now a large part of the american people must begin to enrich
     the rockefellers as soon as the sun goes down, no matter
     what form of illuminant they use.  they went into farm
     mortgages.  it is said that when prosperity a few years ago
     enabled the farmers to rid themselves of their mortgages,
     john d. rockefeller was moved almost to tears; eight
     millions which he had thought taken care of for years to
     come at a good interest were suddenly dumped upon his
     doorstep and there set up a-squawking for a new home.  this
     unexpected addition to his worriments in finding places for
     the progeny of his petroleum and their progeny and their
     progeny's progeny was too much for the equanimity of a man
     without a digestion. . . .

     “the rockefellers went into mines--iron and coal and copper
     and lead; into other industrial companies; into street
     railways, into national, state, and municipal bonds; into
     steamships and steamboats and telegraphy; into real estate,
     into skyscrapers and residences and hotels and business
     blocks; into life insurance, into banking.  there was soon
     literally no field of industry where their millions were not
     at work. . . .

     “the rockefeller bank--the national city bank--is by itself
     far and away the biggest bank in the united states.  it is
     exceeded in the world only by the bank of england and the
     bank of france.  the deposits average more than one hundred
     millions a day; and it dominates the call loan market on
     wall street and the stock market. but it is not alone; it is
     the head of the rockefeller chain of banks, which includes
     fourteen banks and trust companies in new york city, and
     banks of great strength and influence in every large money
     center in the country.

     “john d. rockefeller owns standard oil stock worth between
     four and five hundred millions at the market quotations.  he
     has a hundred millions in the steel trust, almost as much in
     a single western railway system, half as much in a second,
     and so on and on and on until the mind wearies of the
     cataloguing.  his income last year was about $100,000,000--
     it is doubtful if the incomes of all the rothschilds
     together make a greater sum.  and it is going up by leaps
     and bounds.”


     little discussion took place after this, and the dinner soon broke
     up.  all were quiet and subdued, and leave-taking was done with low
     voices.  it seemed almost that they were scared by the vision of
     the times they had seen.

     “the situation is, indeed, serious,” mr. calvin said to ernest.  “i
     have little quarrel with the way you have depicted it.  only i
     disagree with you about the doom of the middle class.  we shall
     survive, and we shall overthrow the trusts.”

     “and return to the ways of your fathers,” ernest finished for him.

     “even so,” mr. calvin answered gravely.  “i know it's a sort of
     machine-breaking, and that it is absurd.  but then life seems
     absurd to-day, what of the machinations of the plutocracy.  and at
     any rate, our sort of machine-breaking is at least practical and
     possible, which your dream is not.  your socialistic dream is . . .
     well, a dream.  we cannot follow you.”

     “i only wish you fellows knew a little something about evolution
     and sociology,” ernest said wistfully, as they shook hands.  “we
     would be saved so much trouble if you did.”



chapter x

the vortex


following like thunder claps upon the business men's dinner, occurred
event after event of terrifying moment; and i, little i, who had lived
so placidly all my days in the quiet university town, found myself and
my personal affairs drawn into the vortex of the great world-affairs.
whether it was my love for ernest, or the clear sight he had given me of
the society in which i lived, that made me a revolutionist, i know not;
but a revolutionist i became, and i was plunged into a whirl of
happenings that would have been inconceivable three short months before.

the crisis in my own fortunes came simultaneously with great crises in
society. first of all, father was discharged from the university. oh,
he was not technically discharged. his resignation was demanded, that
was all. this, in itself, did not amount to much. father, in fact, was
delighted. he was especially delighted because his discharge had been
precipitated by the publication of his book, “economics and education.”
 it clinched his argument, he contended. what better evidence could be
advanced to prove that education was dominated by the capitalist class?

but this proof never got anywhere. nobody knew he had been forced to
resign from the university. he was so eminent a scientist that such an
announcement, coupled with the reason for his enforced resignation,
would have created somewhat of a furor all over the world. the
newspapers showered him with praise and honor, and commended him for
having given up the drudgery of the lecture room in order to devote his
whole time to scientific research.

at first father laughed. then he became angry--tonic angry. then came
the suppression of his book. this suppression was performed secretly,
so secretly that at first we could not comprehend. the publication of
the book had immediately caused a bit of excitement in the country.
father had been politely abused in the capitalist press, the tone of the
abuse being to the effect that it was a pity so great a scientist should
leave his field and invade the realm of sociology, about which he knew
nothing and wherein he had promptly become lost. this lasted for a
week, while father chuckled and said the book had touched a sore spot on
capitalism. and then, abruptly, the newspapers and the critical
magazines ceased saying anything about the book at all. also, and with
equal suddenness, the book disappeared from the market. not a copy was
obtainable from any bookseller. father wrote to the publishers and was
informed that the plates had been accidentally injured. an
unsatisfactory correspondence followed. driven finally to an
unequivocal stand, the publishers stated that they could not see their
way to putting the book into type again, but that they were willing to
relinquish their rights in it.

“and you won't find another publishing house in the country to touch
it,” ernest said. “and if i were you, i'd hunt cover right now. you've
merely got a foretaste of the iron heel.”

but father was nothing if not a scientist. he never believed in jumping
to conclusions. a laboratory experiment was no experiment if it were
not carried through in all its details. so he patiently went the round
of the publishing houses. they gave a multitude of excuses, but not one
house would consider the book.

when father became convinced that the book had actually been suppressed,
he tried to get the fact into the newspapers; but his communications
were ignored. at a political meeting of the socialists, where many
reporters were present, father saw his chance. he arose and related the
history of the suppression of the book. he laughed next day when he
read the newspapers, and then he grew angry to a degree that eliminated
all tonic qualities. the papers made no mention of the book, but they
misreported him beautifully. they twisted his words and phrases away
from the context, and turned his subdued and controlled remarks into a
howling anarchistic speech. it was done artfully. one instance, in
particular, i remember. he had used the phrase “social revolution.”
 the reporter merely dropped out “social.” this was sent out all over
the country in an associated press despatch, and from all over the
country arose a cry of alarm. father was branded as a nihilist and an
anarchist, and in one cartoon that was copied widely he was portrayed
waving a red flag at the head of a mob of long-haired, wild-eyed men who
bore in their hands torches, knives, and dynamite bombs.

he was assailed terribly in the press, in long and abusive editorials,
for his anarchy, and hints were made of mental breakdown on his part.
this behavior, on the part of the capitalist press, was nothing new,
ernest told us. it was the custom, he said, to send reporters to all
the socialist meetings for the express purpose of misreporting and
distorting what was said, in order to frighten the middle class away
from any possible affiliation with the proletariat. and repeatedly
ernest warned father to cease fighting and to take to cover.

the socialist press of the country took up the fight, however, and
throughout the reading portion of the working class it was known that
the book had been suppressed. but this knowledge stopped with the
working class. next, the “appeal to reason,” a big socialist publishing
house, arranged with father to bring out the book. father was jubilant,
but ernest was alarmed.

“i tell you we are on the verge of the unknown,” he insisted. “big
things are happening secretly all around us. we can feel them. we do
not know what they are, but they are there. the whole fabric of society
is a-tremble with them. don't ask me. i don't know myself. but out of
this flux of society something is about to crystallize. it is
crystallizing now. the suppression of the book is a precipitation. how
many books have been suppressed? we haven't the least idea. we are in
the dark. we have no way of learning. watch out next for the
suppression of the socialist press and socialist publishing houses. i'm
afraid it's coming. we are going to be throttled.”

ernest had his hand on the pulse of events even more closely than the
rest of the socialists, and within two days the first blow was struck.
the appeal to reason was a weekly, and its regular circulation amongst
the proletariat was seven hundred and fifty thousand. also, it very
frequently got out special editions of from two to five millions. these
great editions were paid for and distributed by the small army of
voluntary workers who had marshalled around the appeal. the first blow
was aimed at these special editions, and it was a crushing one. by an
arbitrary ruling of the post office, these editions were decided to be
not the regular circulation of the paper, and for that reason were
denied admission to the mails.

a week later the post office department ruled that the paper was
seditious, and barred it entirely from the mails. this was a fearful
blow to the socialist propaganda. the appeal was desperate. it devised
a plan of reaching its subscribers through the express companies, but
they declined to handle it. this was the end of the appeal. but not
quite. it prepared to go on with its book publishing. twenty thousand
copies of father's book were in the bindery, and the presses were
turning off more. and then, without warning, a mob arose one night,
and, under a waving american flag, singing patriotic songs, set fire to
the great plant of the appeal and totally destroyed it.

now girard, kansas, was a quiet, peaceable town. there had never been
any labor troubles there. the appeal paid union wages; and, in fact,
was the backbone of the town, giving employment to hundreds of men and
women. it was not the citizens of girard that composed the mob. this
mob had risen up out of the earth apparently, and to all intents and
purposes, its work done, it had gone back into the earth. ernest saw in
the affair the most sinister import.

“the black hundreds* are being organized in the united states,” he said.
“this is the beginning. there will be more of it. the iron heel is
getting bold.”

     * the black hundreds were reactionary mobs organized by the
     perishing autocracy in the russian revolution.  these
     reactionary groups attacked the revolutionary groups, and
     also, at needed moments, rioted and destroyed property so as
     to afford the autocracy the pretext of calling out the
     cossacks.

and so perished father's book. we were to see much of the black hundreds
as the days went by. week by week more of the socialist papers were
barred from the mails, and in a number of instances the black hundreds
destroyed the socialist presses. of course, the newspapers of the
land lived up to the reactionary policy of the ruling class, and the
destroyed socialist press was misrepresented and vilified, while
the black hundreds were represented as true patriots and saviours of
society. so convincing was all this misrepresentation that even sincere
ministers in the pulpit praised the black hundreds while regretting the
necessity of violence.

history was making fast. the fall elections were soon to occur, and
ernest was nominated by the socialist party to run for congress. his
chance for election was most favorable. the street-car strike in san
francisco had been broken. and following upon it the teamsters' strike
had been broken. these two defeats had been very disastrous to organized
labor. the whole water front federation, along with its allies in the
structural trades, had backed up the teamsters, and all had been smashed
down ingloriously. it had been a bloody strike. the police had broken
countless heads with their riot clubs; and the death list had been
augmented by the turning loose of a machine-gun on the strikers from the
barns of the marsden special delivery company.

in consequence, the men were sullen and vindictive. they wanted blood,
and revenge. beaten on their chosen field, they were ripe to seek
revenge by means of political action. they still maintained their labor
organization, and this gave them strength in the political struggle that
was on. ernest's chance for election grew stronger and stronger. day by
day unions and more unions voted their support to the socialists, until
even ernest laughed when the undertakers' assistants and the chicken
pickers fell into line. labor became mulish. while it packed the
socialist meetings with mad enthusiasm, it was impervious to the wiles
of the old-party politicians. the old-party orators were usually greeted
with empty halls, though occasionally they encountered full halls where
they were so roughly handled that more than once it was necessary to
call out the police reserves.

history was making fast. the air was vibrant with things happening and
impending. the country was on the verge of hard times,* caused by a
series of prosperous years wherein the difficulty of disposing abroad
of the unconsumed surplus had become increasingly difficult. industries
were working short time; many great factories were standing idle against
the time when the surplus should be gone; and wages were being cut right
and left.

     * under the capitalist regime these periods of hard times
     were as inevitable as they were absurd.  prosperity always
     brought calamity.  this, of course, was due to the excess of
     unconsumed profits that was piled up.

also, the great machinist strike had been broken. two hundred thousand
machinists, along with their five hundred thousand allies in the
metalworking trades, had been defeated in as bloody a strike as had ever
marred the united states. pitched battles had been fought with the small
armies of armed strike-breakers* put in the field by the employers'
associations; the black hundreds, appearing in scores of wide-scattered
places, had destroyed property; and, in consequence, a hundred thousand
regular soldiers of the united states has been called out to put a
frightful end to the whole affair. a number of the labor leaders had
been executed; many others had been sentenced to prison, while thousands
of the rank and file of the strikers had been herded into bull-pens**
and abominably treated by the soldiers.

     * strike-breakers--these were, in purpose and practice and
     everything except name, the private soldiers of the
     capitalists. they were thoroughly organized and well armed,
     and they were held in readiness to be hurled in special
     trains to any part of the country where labor went on strike
     or was locked out by the employers.  only those curious
     times could have given rise to the amazing spectacle of one,
     farley, a notorious commander of strike-breakers, who, in
     1906, swept across the united states in special trains from
     new york to san francisco with an army of twenty-five
     hundred men, fully armed and equipped, to break a strike of
     the san francisco street-car men.  such an act was in direct
     violation of the laws of the land.  the fact that this act,
     and thousands of similar acts, went unpunished, goes to show
     how completely the judiciary was the creature of the
     plutocracy.

     ** bull-pen--in a miners' strike in idaho, in the latter
     part of the nineteenth century, it happened that many of the
     strikers were confined in a bull-pen by the troops.  the
     practice and the name continued in the twentieth century.

the years of prosperity were now to be paid for. all markets were
glutted; all markets were falling; and amidst the general crumble
of prices the price of labor crumbled fastest of all. the land was
convulsed with industrial dissensions. labor was striking here, there,
and everywhere; and where it was not striking, it was being turned out
by the capitalists. the papers were filled with tales of violence and
blood. and through it all the black hundreds played their part. riot,
arson, and wanton destruction of property was their function, and well
they performed it. the whole regular army was in the field, called there
by the actions of the black hundreds.* all cities and towns were like
armed camps, and laborers were shot down like dogs. out of the vast
army of the unemployed the strike-breakers were recruited; and when
the strike-breakers were worsted by the labor unions, the troops always
appeared and crushed the unions. then there was the militia. as yet, it
was not necessary to have recourse to the secret militia law. only the
regularly organized militia was out, and it was out everywhere. and
in this time of terror, the regular army was increased an additional
hundred thousand by the government.

     * the name only, and not the idea, was imported from russia.
     the black hundreds were a development out of the secret
     agents of the capitalists, and their use arose in the labor
     struggles of the nineteenth century.  there is no discussion
     of this.  no less an authority of the times than carroll d.
     wright, united states commissioner of labor, is responsible
     for the statement.  from his book, entitled “the battles of
     labor,” is quoted the declaration that “in some of the great
     historic strikes the employers themselves have instigated
     acts of violence;” that manufacturers have deliberately
     provoked strikes in order to get rid of surplus stock; and
     that freight cars have been burned by employers' agents
     during railroad strikes in order to increase disorder.  it
     was out of these secret agents of the employers that the
     black hundreds arose; and it was they, in turn, that later
     became that terrible weapon of the oligarchy, the agents-
     provocateurs.

never had labor received such an all-around beating. the great captains
of industry, the oligarchs, had for the first time thrown their full
weight into the breach the struggling employers' associations had made.
these associations were practically middle-class affairs, and now,
compelled by hard times and crashing markets, and aided by the great
captains of industry, they gave organized labor an awful and decisive
defeat. it was an all-powerful alliance, but it was an alliance of the
lion and the lamb, as the middle class was soon to learn.

labor was bloody and sullen, but crushed. yet its defeat did not put
an end to the hard times. the banks, themselves constituting one of the
most important forces of the oligarchy, continued to call in credits.
the wall street* group turned the stock market into a maelstrom where
the values of all the land crumbled away almost to nothingness. and
out of all the rack and ruin rose the form of the nascent oligarchy,
imperturbable, indifferent, and sure. its serenity and certitude was
terrifying. not only did it use its own vast power, but it used all the
power of the united states treasury to carry out its plans.

     * wall street--so named from a street in ancient new york,
     where was situated the stock exchange, and where the
     irrational organization of society permitted underhanded
     manipulation of all the industries of the country.

the captains of industry had turned upon the middle class. the
employers' associations, that had helped the captains of industry to
tear and rend labor, were now torn and rent by their quondam allies.
amidst the crashing of the middle men, the small business men and
manufacturers, the trusts stood firm. nay, the trusts did more than
stand firm. they were active. they sowed wind, and wind, and ever more
wind; for they alone knew how to reap the whirlwind and make a profit
out of it. and such profits! colossal profits! strong enough themselves
to weather the storm that was largely their own brewing, they turned
loose and plundered the wrecks that floated about them. values were
pitifully and inconceivably shrunken, and the trusts added hugely
to their holdings, even extending their enterprises into many new
fields--and always at the expense of the middle class.

thus the summer of 1912 witnessed the virtual death-thrust to the middle
class. even ernest was astounded at the quickness with which it had been
done. he shook his head ominously and looked forward without hope to the
fall elections.

“it's no use,” he said. “we are beaten. the iron heel is here. i had
hoped for a peaceable victory at the ballot-box. i was wrong. wickson
was right. we shall be robbed of our few remaining liberties; the iron
heel will walk upon our faces; nothing remains but a bloody revolution
of the working class. of course we will win, but i shudder to think of
it.”

and from then on ernest pinned his faith in revolution. in this he was
in advance of his party. his fellow-socialists could not agree with him.
they still insisted that victory could be gained through the elections.
it was not that they were stunned. they were too cool-headed and
courageous for that. they were merely incredulous, that was all. ernest
could not get them seriously to fear the coming of the oligarchy. they
were stirred by him, but they were too sure of their own strength. there
was no room in their theoretical social evolution for an oligarchy,
therefore the oligarchy could not be.

“we'll send you to congress and it will be all right,” they told him at
one of our secret meetings.

“and when they take me out of congress,” ernest replied coldly, “and put
me against a wall, and blow my brains out--what then?”

“then we'll rise in our might,” a dozen voices answered at once.

“then you'll welter in your gore,” was his retort. “i've heard that song
sung by the middle class, and where is it now in its might?”



chapter xi

the great adventure


mr. wickson did not send for father. they met by chance on the
ferry-boat to san francisco, so that the warning he gave father was not
premeditated. had they not met accidentally, there would not have been
any warning. not that the outcome would have been different, however.
father came of stout old mayflower* stock, and the blood was imperative
in him.

     * one of the first ships that carried colonies to america,
     after the discovery of the new world.  descendants of these
     original colonists were for a while inordinately proud of
     their genealogy; but in time the blood became so widely
     diffused that it ran in the veins practically of all
     americans.

“ernest was right,” he told me, as soon as he had returned home. “ernest
is a very remarkable young man, and i'd rather see you his wife than the
wife of rockefeller himself or the king of england.”

“what's the matter?” i asked in alarm.

“the oligarchy is about to tread upon our faces--yours and mine. wickson
as much as told me so. he was very kind--for an oligarch. he offered to
reinstate me in the university. what do you think of that? he, wickson,
a sordid money-grabber, has the power to determine whether i shall or
shall not teach in the university of the state. but he offered me even
better than that--offered to make me president of some great college of
physical sciences that is being planned--the oligarchy must get rid of
its surplus somehow, you see.

“'do you remember what i told that socialist lover of your daughter's?'
he said. 'i told him that we would walk upon the faces of the working
class. and so we shall. as for you, i have for you a deep respect as
a scientist; but if you throw your fortunes in with the working
class--well, watch out for your face, that is all.' and then he turned
and left me.”

“it means we'll have to marry earlier than you planned,” was ernest's
comment when we told him.

i could not follow his reasoning, but i was soon to learn it. it was at
this time that the quarterly dividend of the sierra mills was paid--or,
rather, should have been paid, for father did not receive his. after
waiting several days, father wrote to the secretary. promptly came
the reply that there was no record on the books of father's owning any
stock, and a polite request for more explicit information.

“i'll make it explicit enough, confound him,” father declared, and
departed for the bank to get the stock in question from his safe-deposit
box.

“ernest is a very remarkable man,” he said when he got back and while
i was helping him off with his overcoat. “i repeat, my daughter, that
young man of yours is a very remarkable young man.”

i had learned, whenever he praised ernest in such fashion, to expect
disaster.

“they have already walked upon my face,” father explained. “there was no
stock. the box was empty. you and ernest will have to get married pretty
quickly.”

father insisted on laboratory methods. he brought the sierra mills into
court, but he could not bring the books of the sierra mills into court.
he did not control the courts, and the sierra mills did. that explained
it all. he was thoroughly beaten by the law, and the bare-faced robbery
held good.

it is almost laughable now, when i look back on it, the way father was
beaten. he met wickson accidentally on the street in san francisco,
and he told wickson that he was a damned scoundrel. and then father was
arrested for attempted assault, fined in the police court, and bound
over to keep the peace. it was all so ridiculous that when he got
home he had to laugh himself. but what a furor was raised in the
local papers! there was grave talk about the bacillus of violence that
infected all men who embraced socialism; and father, with his long and
peaceful life, was instanced as a shining example of how the bacillus
of violence worked. also, it was asserted by more than one paper that
father's mind had weakened under the strain of scientific study, and
confinement in a state asylum for the insane was suggested. nor was this
merely talk. it was an imminent peril. but father was wise enough to see
it. he had the bishop's experience to lesson from, and he lessoned
well. he kept quiet no matter what injustice was perpetrated on him, and
really, i think, surprised his enemies.

there was the matter of the house--our home. a mortgage was foreclosed
on it, and we had to give up possession. of course there wasn't any
mortgage, and never had been any mortgage. the ground had been bought
outright, and the house had been paid for when it was built. and house
and lot had always been free and unencumbered. nevertheless there was
the mortgage, properly and legally drawn up and signed, with a record
of the payments of interest through a number of years. father made no
outcry. as he had been robbed of his money, so was he now robbed of his
home. and he had no recourse. the machinery of society was in the hands
of those who were bent on breaking him. he was a philosopher at heart,
and he was no longer even angry.

“i am doomed to be broken,” he said to me; “but that is no reason that i
should not try to be shattered as little as possible. these old bones of
mine are fragile, and i've learned my lesson. god knows i don't want to
spend my last days in an insane asylum.”

which reminds me of bishop morehouse, whom i have neglected for many
pages. but first let me tell of my marriage. in the play of events, my
marriage sinks into insignificance, i know, so i shall barely mention
it.

“now we shall become real proletarians,” father said, when we were
driven from our home. “i have often envied that young man of yours for
his actual knowledge of the proletariat. now i shall see and learn for
myself.”

father must have had strong in him the blood of adventure. he looked
upon our catastrophe in the light of an adventure. no anger nor
bitterness possessed him. he was too philosophic and simple to be
vindictive, and he lived too much in the world of mind to miss the
creature comforts we were giving up. so it was, when we moved to san
francisco into four wretched rooms in the slum south of market street,
that he embarked upon the adventure with the joy and enthusiasm of
a child--combined with the clear sight and mental grasp of an
extraordinary intellect. he really never crystallized mentally. he had
no false sense of values. conventional or habitual values meant nothing
to him. the only values he recognized were mathematical and scientific
facts. my father was a great man. he had the mind and the soul that only
great men have. in ways he was even greater than ernest, than whom i
have known none greater.

even i found some relief in our change of living. if nothing else, i
was escaping from the organized ostracism that had been our increasing
portion in the university town ever since the enmity of the nascent
oligarchy had been incurred. and the change was to me likewise
adventure, and the greatest of all, for it was love-adventure. the
change in our fortunes had hastened my marriage, and it was as a
wife that i came to live in the four rooms on pell street, in the san
francisco slum.

and this out of all remains: i made ernest happy. i came into his stormy
life, not as a new perturbing force, but as one that made toward peace
and repose. i gave him rest. it was the guerdon of my love for him.
it was the one infallible token that i had not failed. to bring
forgetfulness, or the light of gladness, into those poor tired eyes of
his--what greater joy could have blessed me than that?

those dear tired eyes. he toiled as few men ever toiled, and all his
lifetime he toiled for others. that was the measure of his manhood. he
was a humanist and a lover. and he, with his incarnate spirit of battle,
his gladiator body and his eagle spirit--he was as gentle and tender to
me as a poet. he was a poet. a singer in deeds. and all his life he sang
the song of man. and he did it out of sheer love of man, and for man he
gave his life and was crucified.

and all this he did with no hope of future reward. in his conception of
things there was no future life. he, who fairly burnt with immortality,
denied himself immortality--such was the paradox of him. he, so warm
in spirit, was dominated by that cold and forbidding philosophy,
materialistic monism. i used to refute him by telling him that i
measured his immortality by the wings of his soul, and that i should
have to live endless aeons in order to achieve the full measurement.
whereat he would laugh, and his arms would leap out to me, and he would
call me his sweet metaphysician; and the tiredness would pass out of his
eyes, and into them would flood the happy love-light that was in itself
a new and sufficient advertisement of his immortality.

also, he used to call me his dualist, and he would explain how kant, by
means of pure reason, had abolished reason, in order to worship god. and
he drew the parallel and included me guilty of a similar act. and when i
pleaded guilty, but defended the act as highly rational, he but pressed
me closer and laughed as only one of god's own lovers could laugh. i
was wont to deny that heredity and environment could explain his own
originality and genius, any more than could the cold groping finger of
science catch and analyze and classify that elusive essence that lurked
in the constitution of life itself.

i held that space was an apparition of god, and that soul was a
projection of the character of god; and when he called me his sweet
metaphysician, i called him my immortal materialist. and so we loved and
were happy; and i forgave him his materialism because of his tremendous
work in the world, performed without thought of soul-gain thereby, and
because of his so exceeding modesty of spirit that prevented him from
having pride and regal consciousness of himself and his soul.

but he had pride. how could he have been an eagle and not have pride?
his contention was that it was finer for a finite mortal speck of life
to feel godlike, than for a god to feel godlike; and so it was that he
exalted what he deemed his mortality. he was fond of quoting a fragment
from a certain poem. he had never seen the whole poem, and he had tried
vainly to learn its authorship. i here give the fragment, not alone
because he loved it, but because it epitomized the paradox that he was
in the spirit of him, and his conception of his spirit. for how can a
man, with thrilling, and burning, and exaltation, recite the following
and still be mere mortal earth, a bit of fugitive force, an evanescent
form? here it is:

     “joy upon joy and gain upon gain
     are the destined rights of my birth,
     and i shout the praise of my endless days
     to the echoing edge of the earth.
     though i suffer all deaths that a man can die
     to the uttermost end of time,
     i have deep-drained this, my cup of bliss,
     in every age and clime--

     “the froth of pride, the tang of power,
     the sweet of womanhood!
     i drain the lees upon my knees,
     for oh, the draught is good;
     i drink to life, i drink to death,
     and smack my lips with song,
     for when i die, another 'i' shall pass the cup along.

     “the man you drove from eden's grove
              was i, my lord, was i,
     and i shall be there when the earth and the air
              are rent from sea to sky;
     for it is my world, my gorgeous world,
              the world of my dearest woes,
     from the first faint cry of the newborn
              to the rack of the woman's throes.

     “packed with the pulse of an unborn race,
     torn with a world's desire,
     the surging flood of my wild young blood
     would quench the judgment fire.
     i am man, man, man, from the tingling flesh
     to the dust of my earthly goal,
     from the nestling gloom of the pregnant womb
     to the sheen of my naked soul.
     bone of my bone and flesh of my flesh
     the whole world leaps to my will,
     and the unslaked thirst of an eden cursed
     shall harrow the earth for its fill.
     almighty god, when i drain life's glass
     of all its rainbow gleams,
     the hapless plight of eternal night
     shall be none too long for my dreams.

     “the man you drove from eden's grove
              was i, my lord, was i,
     and i shall be there when the earth and the air
              are rent from sea to sky;
     for it is my world, my gorgeous world,
              the world of my dear delight,
     from the brightest gleam of the arctic stream
              to the dusk of my own love-night.”

ernest always overworked. his wonderful constitution kept him up; but
even that constitution could not keep the tired look out of his eyes.
his dear, tired eyes! he never slept more than four and one-half hours
a night; yet he never found time to do all the work he wanted to do.
he never ceased from his activities as a propagandist, and was always
scheduled long in advance for lectures to workingmen's organizations.
then there was the campaign. he did a man's full work in that alone.
with the suppression of the socialist publishing houses, his meagre
royalties ceased, and he was hard-put to make a living; for he had to
make a living in addition to all his other labor. he did a great deal
of translating for the magazines on scientific and philosophic subjects;
and, coming home late at night, worn out from the strain of the
campaign, he would plunge into his translating and toil on well into the
morning hours. and in addition to everything, there was his studying.
to the day of his death he kept up his studies, and he studied
prodigiously.

and yet he found time in which to love me and make me happy. but this
was accomplished only through my merging my life completely into his. i
learned shorthand and typewriting, and became his secretary. he insisted
that i succeeded in cutting his work in half; and so it was that i
schooled myself to understand his work. our interests became mutual, and
we worked together and played together.

and then there were our sweet stolen moments in the midst of our
work--just a word, or caress, or flash of love-light; and our moments
were sweeter for being stolen. for we lived on the heights, where the
air was keen and sparkling, where the toil was for humanity, and where
sordidness and selfishness never entered. we loved love, and our love
was never smirched by anything less than the best. and this out of all
remains: i did not fail. i gave him rest--he who worked so hard for
others, my dear, tired-eyed mortalist.



chapter xii

the bishop


it was after my marriage that i chanced upon bishop morehouse. but i
must give the events in their proper sequence. after his outbreak at the
i. p. h. convention, the bishop, being a gentle soul, had yielded to
the friendly pressure brought to bear upon him, and had gone away on a
vacation. but he returned more fixed than ever in his determination
to preach the message of the church. to the consternation of his
congregation, his first sermon was quite similar to the address he
had given before the convention. again he said, and at length and with
distressing detail, that the church had wandered away from the master's
teaching, and that mammon had been instated in the place of christ.

and the result was, willy-nilly, that he was led away to a private
sanitarium for mental disease, while in the newspapers appeared
pathetic accounts of his mental breakdown and of the saintliness of
his character. he was held a prisoner in the sanitarium. i called
repeatedly, but was denied access to him; and i was terribly impressed
by the tragedy of a sane, normal, saintly man being crushed by the
brutal will of society. for the bishop was sane, and pure, and noble. as
ernest said, all that was the matter with him was that he had incorrect
notions of biology and sociology, and because of his incorrect notions
he had not gone about it in the right way to rectify matters.

what terrified me was the bishop's helplessness. if he persisted in the
truth as he saw it, he was doomed to an insane ward. and he could do
nothing. his money, his position, his culture, could not save him. his
views were perilous to society, and society could not conceive that such
perilous views could be the product of a sane mind. or, at least, it
seems to me that such was society's attitude.

but the bishop, in spite of the gentleness and purity of his spirit, was
possessed of guile. he apprehended clearly his danger. he saw himself
caught in the web, and he tried to escape from it. denied help from his
friends, such as father and ernest and i could have given, he was
left to battle for himself alone. and in the enforced solitude of the
sanitarium he recovered. he became again sane. his eyes ceased to see
visions; his brain was purged of the fancy that it was the duty of
society to feed the master's lambs.

as i say, he became well, quite well, and the newspapers and the church
people hailed his return with joy. i went once to his church. the sermon
was of the same order as the ones he had preached long before his eyes
had seen visions. i was disappointed, shocked. had society then beaten
him into submission? was he a coward? had he been bulldozed into
recanting? or had the strain been too great for him, and had he meekly
surrendered to the juggernaut of the established?

i called upon him in his beautiful home. he was woefully changed. he was
thinner, and there were lines on his face which i had never seen before.
he was manifestly distressed by my coming. he plucked nervously at his
sleeve as we talked; and his eyes were restless, fluttering here, there,
and everywhere, and refusing to meet mine. his mind seemed preoccupied,
and there were strange pauses in his conversation, abrupt changes of
topic, and an inconsecutiveness that was bewildering. could this, then,
be the firm-poised, christ-like man i had known, with pure, limpid eyes
and a gaze steady and unfaltering as his soul? he had been man-handled;
he had been cowed into subjection. his spirit was too gentle. it had not
been mighty enough to face the organized wolf-pack of society.

i felt sad, unutterably sad. he talked ambiguously, and was so
apprehensive of what i might say that i had not the heart to catechise
him. he spoke in a far-away manner of his illness, and we talked
disjointedly about the church, the alterations in the organ, and about
petty charities; and he saw me depart with such evident relief that i
should have laughed had not my heart been so full of tears.

the poor little hero! if i had only known! he was battling like a giant,
and i did not guess it. alone, all alone, in the midst of millions of
his fellow-men, he was fighting his fight. torn by his horror of the
asylum and his fidelity to truth and the right, he clung steadfastly to
truth and the right; but so alone was he that he did not dare to trust
even me. he had learned his lesson well--too well.

but i was soon to know. one day the bishop disappeared. he had told
nobody that he was going away; and as the days went by and he did not
reappear, there was much gossip to the effect that he had committed
suicide while temporarily deranged. but this idea was dispelled when it
was learned that he had sold all his possessions,--his city mansion, his
country house at menlo park, his paintings, and collections, and even
his cherished library. it was patent that he had made a clean and secret
sweep of everything before he disappeared.

this happened during the time when calamity had overtaken us in our own
affairs; and it was not till we were well settled in our new home that
we had opportunity really to wonder and speculate about the bishop's
doings. and then, everything was suddenly made clear. early one evening,
while it was yet twilight, i had run across the street and into the
butcher-shop to get some chops for ernest's supper. we called the last
meal of the day “supper” in our new environment.

just at the moment i came out of the butcher-shop, a man emerged from
the corner grocery that stood alongside. a queer sense familiarity made
me look again. but the man had turned and was walking rapidly away.
there was something about the slope of the shoulders and the fringe
of silver hair between coat collar and slouch hat that aroused vague
memories. instead of crossing the street, i hurried after the man. i
quickened my pace, trying not to think the thoughts that formed unbidden
in my brain. no, it was impossible. it could not be--not in those faded
overalls, too long in the legs and frayed at the bottoms.

i paused, laughed at myself, and almost abandoned the chase. but the
haunting familiarity of those shoulders and that silver hair! again
i hurried on. as i passed him, i shot a keen look at his face; then i
whirled around abruptly and confronted--the bishop.

he halted with equal abruptness, and gasped. a large paper bag in his
right hand fell to the sidewalk. it burst, and about his feet and mine
bounced and rolled a flood of potatoes. he looked at me with surprise
and alarm, then he seemed to wilt away; the shoulders drooped with
dejection, and he uttered a deep sigh.

i held out my hand. he shook it, but his hand felt clammy. he cleared
his throat in embarrassment, and i could see the sweat starting out on
his forehead. it was evident that he was badly frightened.

“the potatoes,” he murmured faintly. “they are precious.”

between us we picked them up and replaced them in the broken bag, which
he now held carefully in the hollow of his arm. i tried to tell him my
gladness at meeting him and that he must come right home with me.

“father will be rejoiced to see you,” i said. “we live only a stone's
throw away.

“i can't,” he said, “i must be going. good-by.”

he looked apprehensively about him, as though dreading discovery, and
made an attempt to walk on.

“tell me where you live, and i shall call later,” he said, when he saw
that i walked beside him and that it was my intention to stick to him
now that he was found.

“no,” i answered firmly. “you must come now.”

he looked at the potatoes spilling on his arm, and at the small parcels
on his other arm.

“really, it is impossible,” he said. “forgive me for my rudeness. if you
only knew.”

he looked as if he were going to break down, but the next moment he had
himself in control.

“besides, this food,” he went on. “it is a sad case. it is terrible. she
is an old woman. i must take it to her at once. she is suffering from
want of it. i must go at once. you understand. then i will return. i
promise you.”

“let me go with you,” i volunteered. “is it far?”

he sighed again, and surrendered.

“only two blocks,” he said. “let us hasten.”

under the bishop's guidance i learned something of my own neighborhood.
i had not dreamed such wretchedness and misery existed in it. of course,
this was because i did not concern myself with charity. i had become
convinced that ernest was right when he sneered at charity as a
poulticing of an ulcer. remove the ulcer, was his remedy; give to the
worker his product; pension as soldiers those who grow honorably old in
their toil, and there will be no need for charity. convinced of this,
i toiled with him at the revolution, and did not exhaust my energy in
alleviating the social ills that continuously arose from the injustice
of the system.

i followed the bishop into a small room, ten by twelve, in a rear
tenement. and there we found a little old german woman--sixty-four years
old, the bishop said. she was surprised at seeing me, but she nodded a
pleasant greeting and went on sewing on the pair of men's trousers in
her lap. beside her, on the floor, was a pile of trousers. the bishop
discovered there was neither coal nor kindling, and went out to buy
some.

i took up a pair of trousers and examined her work.

“six cents, lady,” she said, nodding her head gently while she went on
stitching. she stitched slowly, but never did she cease from stitching.
she seemed mastered by the verb “to stitch.”

“for all that work?” i asked. “is that what they pay? how long does it
take you?”

“yes,” she answered, “that is what they pay. six cents for finishing.
two hours' sewing on each pair.”

“but the boss doesn't know that,” she added quickly, betraying a fear
of getting him into trouble. “i'm slow. i've got the rheumatism in my
hands. girls work much faster. they finish in half that time. the boss
is kind. he lets me take the work home, now that i am old and the noise
of the machine bothers my head. if it wasn't for his kindness, i'd
starve.

“yes, those who work in the shop get eight cents. but what can you do?
there is not enough work for the young. the old have no chance. often
one pair is all i can get. sometimes, like to-day, i am given eight pair
to finish before night.”

i asked her the hours she worked, and she said it depended on the
season.

“in the summer, when there is a rush order, i work from five in the
morning to nine at night. but in the winter it is too cold. the hands do
not early get over the stiffness. then you must work later--till after
midnight sometimes.

“yes, it has been a bad summer. the hard times. god must be angry.
this is the first work the boss has given me in a week. it is true, one
cannot eat much when there is no work. i am used to it. i have sewed
all my life, in the old country and here in san francisco--thirty-three
years.

“if you are sure of the rent, it is all right. the houseman is very
kind, but he must have his rent. it is fair. he only charges three
dollars for this room. that is cheap. but it is not easy for you to find
all of three dollars every month.”

she ceased talking, and, nodding her head, went on stitching.

“you have to be very careful as to how you spend your earnings,” i
suggested.

she nodded emphatically.

“after the rent it's not so bad. of course you can't buy meat. and there
is no milk for the coffee. but always there is one meal a day, and often
two.”

she said this last proudly. there was a smack of success in her words.
but as she stitched on in silence, i noticed the sadness in her pleasant
eyes and the droop of her mouth. the look in her eyes became far away.
she rubbed the dimness hastily out of them; it interfered with her
stitching.

“no, it is not the hunger that makes the heart ache,” she explained.
“you get used to being hungry. it is for my child that i cry. it was
the machine that killed her. it is true she worked hard, but i cannot
understand. she was strong. and she was young--only forty; and she
worked only thirty years. she began young, it is true; but my man died.
the boiler exploded down at the works. and what were we to do? she was
ten, but she was very strong. but the machine killed her. yes, it
did. it killed her, and she was the fastest worker in the shop. i have
thought about it often, and i know. that is why i cannot work in the
shop. the machine bothers my head. always i hear it saying, 'i did it, i
did it.' and it says that all day long. and then i think of my daughter,
and i cannot work.”

the moistness was in her old eyes again, and she had to wipe it away
before she could go on stitching.

i heard the bishop stumbling up the stairs, and i opened the door. what
a spectacle he was. on his back he carried half a sack of coal, with
kindling on top. some of the coal dust had coated his face, and the
sweat from his exertions was running in streaks. he dropped his burden
in the corner by the stove and wiped his face on a coarse bandana
handkerchief. i could scarcely accept the verdict of my senses. the
bishop, black as a coal-heaver, in a workingman's cheap cotton shirt
(one button was missing from the throat), and in overalls! that was the
most incongruous of all--the overalls, frayed at the bottoms, dragged
down at the heels, and held up by a narrow leather belt around the hips
such as laborers wear.

though the bishop was warm, the poor swollen hands of the old woman were
already cramping with the cold; and before we left her, the bishop had
built the fire, while i had peeled the potatoes and put them on to boil.
i was to learn, as time went by, that there were many cases similar
to hers, and many worse, hidden away in the monstrous depths of the
tenements in my neighborhood.

we got back to find ernest alarmed by my absence. after the first
surprise of greeting was over, the bishop leaned back in his chair,
stretched out his overall-covered legs, and actually sighed a
comfortable sigh. we were the first of his old friends he had met since
his disappearance, he told us; and during the intervening weeks he must
have suffered greatly from loneliness. he told us much, though he told
us more of the joy he had experienced in doing the master's bidding.

“for truly now,” he said, “i am feeding his lambs. and i have learned
a great lesson. the soul cannot be ministered to till the stomach is
appeased. his lambs must be fed bread and butter and potatoes and
meat; after that, and only after that, are their spirits ready for more
refined nourishment.”

he ate heartily of the supper i cooked. never had he had such an
appetite at our table in the old days. we spoke of it, and he said that
he had never been so healthy in his life.

“i walk always now,” he said, and a blush was on his cheek at the
thought of the time when he rode in his carriage, as though it were a
sin not lightly to be laid.

“my health is better for it,” he added hastily. “and i am very
happy--indeed, most happy. at last i am a consecrated spirit.”

and yet there was in his face a permanent pain, the pain of the world
that he was now taking to himself. he was seeing life in the raw, and it
was a different life from what he had known within the printed books of
his library.

“and you are responsible for all this, young man,” he said directly to
ernest.

ernest was embarrassed and awkward.

“i--i warned you,” he faltered.

“no, you misunderstand,” the bishop answered. “i speak not in reproach,
but in gratitude. i have you to thank for showing me my path. you led me
from theories about life to life itself. you pulled aside the veils from
the social shams. you were light in my darkness, but now i, too, see the
light. and i am very happy, only . . .” he hesitated painfully, and in
his eyes fear leaped large. “only the persecution. i harm no one. why
will they not let me alone? but it is not that. it is the nature of
the persecution. i shouldn't mind if they cut my flesh with stripes, or
burned me at the stake, or crucified me head--downward. but it is the
asylum that frightens me. think of it! of me--in an asylum for the
insane! it is revolting. i saw some of the cases at the sanitarium. they
were violent. my blood chills when i think of it. and to be imprisoned
for the rest of my life amid scenes of screaming madness! no! no! not
that! not that!”

it was pitiful. his hands shook, his whole body quivered and shrank away
from the picture he had conjured. but the next moment he was calm.

“forgive me,” he said simply. “it is my wretched nerves. and if the
master's work leads there, so be it. who am i to complain?”

i felt like crying aloud as i looked at him: “great bishop! o hero!
god's hero!”

as the evening wore on we learned more of his doings.

“i sold my house--my houses, rather,” he said, “all my other possessions.
i knew i must do it secretly, else they would have taken everything away
from me. that would have been terrible. i often marvel these days at the
immense quantity of potatoes two or three hundred thousand dollars will
buy, or bread, or meat, or coal and kindling.” he turned to ernest. “you
are right, young man. labor is dreadfully underpaid. i never did a
bit of work in my life, except to appeal aesthetically to pharisees--i
thought i was preaching the message--and yet i was worth half a million
dollars. i never knew what half a million dollars meant until i realized
how much potatoes and bread and butter and meat it could buy. and then
i realized something more. i realized that all those potatoes and that
bread and butter and meat were mine, and that i had not worked to make
them. then it was clear to me, some one else had worked and made them
and been robbed of them. and when i came down amongst the poor i found
those who had been robbed and who were hungry and wretched because they
had been robbed.”

we drew him back to his narrative.

“the money? i have it deposited in many different banks under different
names. it can never be taken away from me, because it can never be
found. and it is so good, that money. it buys so much food. i never knew
before what money was good for.”

“i wish we could get some of it for the propaganda,” ernest said
wistfully. “it would do immense good.”

“do you think so?” the bishop said. “i do not have much faith in
politics. in fact, i am afraid i do not understand politics.”

ernest was delicate in such matters. he did not repeat his suggestion,
though he knew only too well the sore straits the socialist party was in
through lack of money.

“i sleep in cheap lodging houses,” the bishop went on. “but i am afraid,
and never stay long in one place. also, i rent two rooms in workingmen's
houses in different quarters of the city. it is a great extravagance,
i know, but it is necessary. i make up for it in part by doing my own
cooking, though sometimes i get something to eat in cheap coffee-houses.
and i have made a discovery. tamales* are very good when the air grows
chilly late at night. only they are so expensive. but i have discovered
a place where i can get three for ten cents. they are not so good as the
others, but they are very warming.

     * a mexican dish, referred to occasionally in the literature
     of the times.  it is supposed that it was warmly seasoned.
     no recipe of it has come down to us.

“and so i have at last found my work in the world, thanks to you, young
man. it is the master's work.” he looked at me, and his eyes twinkled.
“you caught me feeding his lambs, you know. and of course you will all
keep my secret.”

he spoke carelessly enough, but there was real fear behind the speech.
he promised to call upon us again. but a week later we read in the
newspaper of the sad case of bishop morehouse, who had been committed to
the napa asylum and for whom there were still hopes held out. in vain
we tried to see him, to have his case reconsidered or investigated. nor
could we learn anything about him except the reiterated statements that
slight hopes were still held for his recovery.

“christ told the rich young man to sell all he had,” ernest said
bitterly. “the bishop obeyed christ's injunction and got locked up in a
madhouse. times have changed since christ's day. a rich man to-day who
gives all he has to the poor is crazy. there is no discussion. society
has spoken.”



chapter xiii

the general strike


of course ernest was elected to congress in the great socialist
landslide that took place in the fall of 1912. one great factor that
helped to swell the socialist vote was the destruction of hearst.*
this the plutocracy found an easy task. it cost hearst eighteen million
dollars a year to run his various papers, and this sum, and more, he got
back from the middle class in payment for advertising. the source of his
financial strength lay wholly in the middle class. the trusts did not
advertise.** to destroy hearst, all that was necessary was to take away
from him his advertising.

     * william randolph hearst--a young california millionaire
     who became the most powerful newspaper owner in the country.
     his newspapers were published in all the large cities, and
     they appealed to the perishing middle class and to the
     proletariat.  so large was his following that he managed to
     take possession of the empty shell of the old democratic
     party.  he occupied an anomalous position, preaching an
     emasculated socialism combined with a nondescript sort of
     petty bourgeois capitalism.  it was oil and water, and there
     was no hope for him, though for a short period he was a
     source of serious apprehension to the plutocrats.

     ** the cost of advertising was amazing in those helter-
     skelter times.  only the small capitalists competed, and
     therefore they did the advertising.  there being no
     competition where there was a trust, there was no need for
     the trusts to advertise.

the whole middle class had not yet been exterminated. the sturdy
skeleton of it remained; but it was without power. the small
manufacturers and small business men who still survived were at the
complete mercy of the plutocracy. they had no economic nor political
souls of their own. when the fiat of the plutocracy went forth, they
withdrew their advertisements from the hearst papers.

hearst made a gallant fight. he brought his papers out at a loss of
a million and a half each month. he continued to publish the
advertisements for which he no longer received pay. again the fiat of
the plutocracy went forth, and the small business men and manufacturers
swamped him with a flood of notices that he must discontinue running
their old advertisements. hearst persisted. injunctions were served
on him. still he persisted. he received six months' imprisonment for
contempt of court in disobeying the injunctions, while he was bankrupted
by countless damage suits. he had no chance. the plutocracy had passed
sentence on him. the courts were in the hands of the plutocracy to
carry the sentence out. and with hearst crashed also to destruction the
democratic party that he had so recently captured.

with the destruction of hearst and the democratic party, there were only
two paths for his following to take. one was into the socialist party;
the other was into the republican party. then it was that we socialists
reaped the fruit of hearst's pseudo-socialistic preaching; for the great
majority of his followers came over to us.

the expropriation of the farmers that took place at this time would also
have swelled our vote had it not been for the brief and futile rise of
the grange party. ernest and the socialist leaders fought fiercely to
capture the farmers; but the destruction of the socialist press
and publishing houses constituted too great a handicap, while the
mouth-to-mouth propaganda had not yet been perfected. so it was that
politicians like mr. calvin, who were themselves farmers long since
expropriated, captured the farmers and threw their political strength
away in a vain campaign.

“the poor farmers,” ernest once laughed savagely; “the trusts have them
both coming and going.”

and that was really the situation. the seven great trusts, working
together, had pooled their enormous surpluses and made a farm trust.
the railroads, controlling rates, and the bankers and stock exchange
gamesters, controlling prices, had long since bled the farmers into
indebtedness. the bankers, and all the trusts for that matter, had
likewise long since loaned colossal amounts of money to the farmers. the
farmers were in the net. all that remained to be done was the drawing in
of the net. this the farm trust proceeded to do.

the hard times of 1912 had already caused a frightful slump in the farm
markets. prices were now deliberately pressed down to bankruptcy,
while the railroads, with extortionate rates, broke the back of the
farmer-camel. thus the farmers were compelled to borrow more and more,
while they were prevented from paying back old loans. then ensued the
great foreclosing of mortgages and enforced collection of notes. the
farmers simply surrendered the land to the farm trust. there was nothing
else for them to do. and having surrendered the land, the farmers next
went to work for the farm trust, becoming managers, superintendents,
foremen, and common laborers. they worked for wages. they became
villeins, in short--serfs bound to the soil by a living wage. they could
not leave their masters, for their masters composed the plutocracy.
they could not go to the cities, for there, also, the plutocracy was
in control. they had but one alternative,--to leave the soil and become
vagrants, in brief, to starve. and even there they were frustrated, for
stringent vagrancy laws were passed and rigidly enforced.

of course, here and there, farmers, and even whole communities of
farmers, escaped expropriation by virtue of exceptional conditions. but
they were merely strays and did not count, and they were gathered in
anyway during the following year.*

     * the destruction of the roman yeomanry proceeded far less
     rapidly than the destruction of the american farmers and
     small capitalists. there was momentum in the twentieth
     century, while there was practically none in ancient rome.

     numbers of the farmers, impelled by an insane lust for the
     soil, and willing to show what beasts they could become,
     tried to escape expropriation by withdrawing from any and
     all market-dealing.  they sold nothing.  they bought
     nothing.  among themselves a primitive barter began to
     spring up.  their privation and hardships were terrible, but
     they persisted.  it became quite a movement, in fact. the
     manner in which they were beaten was unique and logical and
     simple.  the plutocracy, by virtue of its possession of the
     government, raised their taxes.  it was the weak joint in
     their armor.  neither buying nor selling, they had no money,
     and in the end their land was sold to pay the taxes.

thus it was that in the fall of 1912 the socialist leaders, with the
exception of ernest, decided that the end of capitalism had come. what
of the hard times and the consequent vast army of the unemployed; what
of the destruction of the farmers and the middle class; and what of the
decisive defeat administered all along the line to the labor unions; the
socialists were really justified in believing that the end of capitalism
had come and in themselves throwing down the gauntlet to the plutocracy.

alas, how we underestimated the strength of the enemy! everywhere the
socialists proclaimed their coming victory at the ballot-box, while, in
unmistakable terms, they stated the situation. the plutocracy accepted
the challenge. it was the plutocracy, weighing and balancing, that
defeated us by dividing our strength. it was the plutocracy, through its
secret agents, that raised the cry that socialism was sacrilegious
and atheistic; it was the plutocracy that whipped the churches, and
especially the catholic church, into line, and robbed us of a portion of
the labor vote. and it was the plutocracy, through its secret agents
of course, that encouraged the grange party and even spread it to the
cities into the ranks of the dying middle class.

nevertheless the socialist landslide occurred. but, instead of a
sweeping victory with chief executive officers and majorities in all
legislative bodies, we found ourselves in the minority. it is true, we
elected fifty congressmen; but when they took their seats in the spring
of 1913, they found themselves without power of any sort. yet they
were more fortunate than the grangers, who captured a dozen state
governments, and who, in the spring, were not permitted to take
possession of the captured offices. the incumbents refused to retire,
and the courts were in the hands of the oligarchy. but this is too far
in advance of events. i have yet to tell of the stirring times of the
winter of 1912.

the hard times at home had caused an immense decrease in consumption.
labor, out of work, had no wages with which to buy. the result was that
the plutocracy found a greater surplus than ever on its hands. this
surplus it was compelled to dispose of abroad, and, what of its colossal
plans, it needed money. because of its strenuous efforts to dispose of
the surplus in the world market, the plutocracy clashed with germany.
economic clashes were usually succeeded by wars, and this particular
clash was no exception. the great german war-lord prepared, and so did
the united states prepare.

the war-cloud hovered dark and ominous. the stage was set for a
world-catastrophe, for in all the world were hard times, labor troubles,
perishing middle classes, armies of unemployed, clashes of economic
interests in the world-market, and mutterings and rumblings of the
socialist revolution.*

     * for a long time these mutterings and rumblings had been
     heard. as far back as 1906 a.d., lord avebury, an
     englishman, uttered the following in the house of lords:
     “the unrest in europe, the spread of socialism, and the
     ominous rise of anarchism, are warnings to the governments
     and the ruling classes that the condition of the working
     classes in europe is becoming intolerable, and that if a
     revolution is to be avoided some steps must be taken to
     increase wages, reduce the hours of labor, and lower the
     prices of the necessaries of life.”  the wall street
     journal, a stock gamesters' publication, in commenting upon
     lord avebury's speech, said: “these words were spoken by an
     aristocrat and a member of the most conservative body in all
     europe.  that gives them all the more significance.  they
     contain more valuable political economy than is to be found
     in most of the books.  they sound a note of warning. take
     heed, gentlemen of the war and navy departments!”

     at the same time, sydney brooks, writing in america, in
     harper's weekly, said: “you will not hear the socialists
     mentioned in washington.  why should you?  the politicians
     are always the last people in this country to see what is
     going on under their noses. they will jeer at me when i
     prophesy, and prophesy with the utmost confidence, that at
     the next presidential election the socialists will poll over
     a million votes.”

the oligarchy wanted the war with germany. and it wanted the war for a
dozen reasons. in the juggling of events such a war would cause, in the
reshuffling of the international cards and the making of new treaties
and alliances, the oligarchy had much to gain. and, furthermore, the war
would consume many national surpluses, reduce the armies of unemployed
that menaced all countries, and give the oligarchy a breathing space
in which to perfect its plans and carry them out. such a war would
virtually put the oligarchy in possession of the world-market. also,
such a war would create a large standing army that need never be
disbanded, while in the minds of the people would be substituted
the issue, “america versus germany,” in place of “socialism versus
oligarchy.”

and truly the war would have done all these things had it not been for
the socialists. a secret meeting of the western leaders was held in our
four tiny rooms in pell street. here was first considered the stand the
socialists were to take. it was not the first time we had put our foot
down upon war,* but it was the first time we had done so in the united
states. after our secret meeting we got in touch with the national
organization, and soon our code cables were passing back and forth
across the atlantic between us and the international bureau.

     * it was at the very beginning of the twentieth century
     a.d., that the international organization of the socialists
     finally formulated their long-maturing policy on war.
     epitomized their doctrine was: “why should the workingmen of
     one country fight with the workingmen of another country for
     the benefit of their capitalist masters?”

     on may 21, 1905 a.d., when war threatened between austria
     and italy, the socialists of italy, austria, and hungary
     held a conference at trieste, and threatened a general
     strike of the workingmen of both countries in case war was
     declared.  this was repeated the following year, when the
     “morocco affair” threatened to involve france, germany, and
     england.

the german socialists were ready to act with us. there were over five
million of them, many of them in the standing army, and, in addition,
they were on friendly terms with the labor unions. in both countries the
socialists came out in bold declaration against the war and threatened
the general strike. and in the meantime they made preparation for the
general strike. furthermore, the revolutionary parties in all countries
gave public utterance to the socialist principle of international peace
that must be preserved at all hazards, even to the extent of revolt and
revolution at home.

the general strike was the one great victory we american socialists
won. on the 4th of december the american minister was withdrawn from
the german capital. that night a german fleet made a dash on honolulu,
sinking three american cruisers and a revenue cutter, and bombarding
the city. next day both germany and the united states declared war,
and within an hour the socialists called the general strike in both
countries.

for the first time the german war-lord faced the men of his empire
who made his empire go. without them he could not run his empire. the
novelty of the situation lay in that their revolt was passive. they
did not fight. they did nothing. and by doing nothing they tied their
war-lord's hands. he would have asked for nothing better than an
opportunity to loose his war-dogs on his rebellious proletariat. but
this was denied him. he could not loose his war-dogs. neither could
he mobilize his army to go forth to war, nor could he punish his
recalcitrant subjects. not a wheel moved in his empire. not a train ran,
not a telegraphic message went over the wires, for the telegraphers and
railroad men had ceased work along with the rest of the population.

and as it was in germany, so it was in the united states. at last
organized labor had learned its lesson. beaten decisively on its own
chosen field, it had abandoned that field and come over to the political
field of the socialists; for the general strike was a political strike.
besides, organized labor had been so badly beaten that it did not care.
it joined in the general strike out of sheer desperation. the workers
threw down their tools and left their tasks by the millions. especially
notable were the machinists. their heads were bloody, their organization
had apparently been destroyed, yet out they came, along with their
allies in the metal-working trades.

even the common laborers and all unorganized labor ceased work. the
strike had tied everything up so that nobody could work. besides, the
women proved to be the strongest promoters of the strike. they set their
faces against the war. they did not want their men to go forth to
die. then, also, the idea of the general strike caught the mood of the
people. it struck their sense of humor. the idea was infectious. the
children struck in all the schools, and such teachers as came, went home
again from deserted class rooms. the general strike took the form of
a great national picnic. and the idea of the solidarity of labor, so
evidenced, appealed to the imagination of all. and, finally, there was
no danger to be incurred by the colossal frolic. when everybody was
guilty, how was anybody to be punished?

the united states was paralyzed. no one knew what was happening. there
were no newspapers, no letters, no despatches. every community was as
completely isolated as though ten thousand miles of primeval wilderness
stretched between it and the rest of the world. for that matter, the
world had ceased to exist. and for a week this state of affairs was
maintained.

in san francisco we did not know what was happening even across the bay
in oakland or berkeley. the effect on one's sensibilities was weird,
depressing. it seemed as though some great cosmic thing lay dead. the
pulse of the land had ceased to beat. of a truth the nation had died.
there were no wagons rumbling on the streets, no factory whistles, no
hum of electricity in the air, no passing of street cars, no cries
of news-boys--nothing but persons who at rare intervals went by like
furtive ghosts, themselves oppressed and made unreal by the silence.

and during that week of silence the oligarchy was taught its lesson. and
well it learned the lesson. the general strike was a warning. it should
never occur again. the oligarchy would see to that.

at the end of the week, as had been prearranged, the telegraphers of
germany and the united states returned to their posts. through them the
socialist leaders of both countries presented their ultimatum to the
rulers. the war should be called off, or the general strike would
continue. it did not take long to come to an understanding. the war was
declared off, and the populations of both countries returned to their
tasks.

it was this renewal of peace that brought about the alliance between
germany and the united states. in reality, this was an alliance between
the emperor and the oligarchy, for the purpose of meeting their common
foe, the revolutionary proletariat of both countries. and it was this
alliance that the oligarchy afterward so treacherously broke when the
german socialists rose and drove the war-lord from his throne. it was
the very thing the oligarchy had played for--the destruction of its
great rival in the world-market. with the german emperor out of the way,
germany would have no surplus to sell abroad. by the very nature of
the socialist state, the german population would consume all that it
produced. of course, it would trade abroad certain things it produced
for things it did not produce; but this would be quite different from an
unconsumable surplus.

“i'll wager the oligarchy finds justification,” ernest said, when its
treachery to the german emperor became known. “as usual, the oligarchy
will believe it has done right.”

and sure enough. the oligarchy's public defence for the act was that it
had done it for the sake of the american people whose interests it was
looking out for. it had flung its hated rival out of the world-market
and enabled us to dispose of our surplus in that market.

“and the howling folly of it is that we are so helpless that such idiots
really are managing our interests,” was ernest's comment. “they have
enabled us to sell more abroad, which means that we'll be compelled to
consume less at home.”



chapter xiv

the beginning of the end


as early as january, 1913, ernest saw the true trend of affairs, but
he could not get his brother leaders to see the vision of the iron
heel that had arisen in his brain. they were too confident. events were
rushing too rapidly to culmination. a crisis had come in world
affairs. the american oligarchy was practically in possession of the
world-market, and scores of countries were flung out of that market with
unconsumable and unsalable surpluses on their hands. for such countries
nothing remained but reorganization. they could not continue their
method of producing surpluses. the capitalistic system, so far as they
were concerned, had hopelessly broken down.

the reorganization of these countries took the form of revolution.
it was a time of confusion and violence. everywhere institutions and
governments were crashing. everywhere, with the exception of two or
three countries, the erstwhile capitalist masters fought bitterly for
their possessions. but the governments were taken away from them by the
militant proletariat. at last was being realized karl marx's classic:
“the knell of private capitalist property sounds. the expropriators
are expropriated.” and as fast as capitalistic governments crashed,
cooperative commonwealths arose in their place.

“why does the united states lag behind?”; “get busy, you american
revolutionists!”; “what's the matter with america?”--were the messages
sent to us by our successful comrades in other lands. but we could not
keep up. the oligarchy stood in the way. its bulk, like that of some
huge monster, blocked our path.

“wait till we take office in the spring,” we answered. “then you'll
see.”

behind this lay our secret. we had won over the grangers, and in the
spring a dozen states would pass into their hands by virtue of the
elections of the preceding fall. at once would be instituted a dozen
cooperative commonwealth states. after that, the rest would be easy.

“but what if the grangers fail to get possession?” ernest demanded. and
his comrades called him a calamity howler.

but this failure to get possession was not the chief danger that ernest
had in mind. what he foresaw was the defection of the great labor unions
and the rise of the castes.

“ghent has taught the oligarchs how to do it,” ernest said. “i'll wager
they've made a text-book out of his 'benevolent feudalism.'”*

     * “our benevolent feudalism,” a book published in 1902 a.d.,
     by w. j. ghent.  it has always been insisted that ghent put
     the idea of the oligarchy into the minds of the great
     capitalists.  this belief persists throughout the literature
     of the three centuries of the iron heel, and even in the
     literature of the first century of the brotherhood of man.
     to-day we know better, but our knowledge does not overcome
     the fact that ghent remains the most abused innocent man in
     all history.

never shall i forget the night when, after a hot discussion with half a
dozen labor leaders, ernest turned to me and said quietly: “that settles
it. the iron heel has won. the end is in sight.”

this little conference in our home was unofficial; but ernest, like the
rest of his comrades, was working for assurances from the labor leaders
that they would call out their men in the next general strike. o'connor,
the president of the association of machinists, had been foremost of the
six leaders present in refusing to give such assurance.

“you have seen that you were beaten soundly at your old tactics of
strike and boycott,” ernest urged.

o'connor and the others nodded their heads.

“and you saw what a general strike would do,” ernest went on. “we
stopped the war with germany. never was there so fine a display of the
solidarity and the power of labor. labor can and will rule the world.
if you continue to stand with us, we'll put an end to the reign of
capitalism. it is your only hope. and what is more, you know it. there
is no other way out. no matter what you do under your old tactics, you
are doomed to defeat, if for no other reason because the masters control
the courts.” *

     * as a sample of the decisions of the courts adverse to
     labor, the following instances are given.  in the coal-
     mining regions the employment of children was notorious.  in
     1905 a.d., labor succeeded in getting a law passed in
     pennsylvania providing that proof of the age of the child
     and of certain educational qualifications must accompany the
     oath of the parent.  this was promptly declared
     unconstitutional by the luzerne county court, on the ground
     that it violated the fourteenth amendment in that it
     discriminated between individuals of the same class--namely,
     children above fourteen years of age and children below.
     the state court sustained the decision.  the new york court
     of special sessions, in 1905 a.d., declared unconstitutional
     the law prohibiting minors and women from working in
     factories after nine o'clock at night, the ground taken
     being that such a law was “class legislation.”  again, the
     bakers of that time were terribly overworked.  the new york
     legislature passed a law restricting work in bakeries to ten
     hours a day.  in 1906 a.d., the supreme court of the united
     states declared this law to be unconstitutional.  in part
     the decision read: “there is no reasonable ground for
     interfering with the liberty of persons or the right of free
     contract by determining the hours of labor in the occupation
     of a baker.”

“you run ahead too fast,” o'connor answered. “you don't know all the
ways out. there is another way out. we know what we're about. we're sick
of strikes. they've got us beaten that way to a frazzle. but i don't
think we'll ever need to call our men out again.”

“what is your way out?” ernest demanded bluntly.

o'connor laughed and shook his head. “i can tell you this much: we've
not been asleep. and we're not dreaming now.”

“there's nothing to be afraid of, or ashamed of, i hope,” ernest
challenged.

“i guess we know our business best,” was the retort.

“it's a dark business, from the way you hide it,” ernest said with
growing anger.

“we've paid for our experience in sweat and blood, and we've earned all
that's coming to us,” was the reply. “charity begins at home.”

“if you're afraid to tell me your way out, i'll tell it to you.”
 ernest's blood was up. “you're going in for grab-sharing. you've made
terms with the enemy, that's what you've done. you've sold out the cause
of labor, of all labor. you are leaving the battle-field like cowards.”

“i'm not saying anything,” o'connor answered sullenly. “only i guess we
know what's best for us a little bit better than you do.”

“and you don't care a cent for what is best for the rest of labor. you
kick it into the ditch.”

“i'm not saying anything,” o'connor replied, “except that i'm president
of the machinists' association, and it's my business to consider the
interests of the men i represent, that's all.”

and then, when the labor leaders had left, ernest, with the calmness of
defeat, outlined to me the course of events to come.

“the socialists used to foretell with joy,” he said, “the coming of the
day when organized labor, defeated on the industrial field, would come
over on to the political field. well, the iron heel has defeated
the labor unions on the industrial field and driven them over to the
political field; and instead of this being joyful for us, it will be
a source of grief. the iron heel learned its lesson. we showed it our
power in the general strike. it has taken steps to prevent another
general strike.”

“but how?” i asked.

“simply by subsidizing the great unions. they won't join in the next
general strike. therefore it won't be a general strike.”

“but the iron heel can't maintain so costly a programme forever,” i
objected.

“oh, it hasn't subsidized all of the unions. that's not necessary. here
is what is going to happen. wages are going to be advanced and hours
shortened in the railroad unions, the iron and steel workers unions,
and the engineer and machinist unions. in these unions more favorable
conditions will continue to prevail. membership in these unions will
become like seats in paradise.”

“still i don't see,” i objected. “what is to become of the other unions?
there are far more unions outside of this combination than in it.”

“the other unions will be ground out of existence--all of them. for,
don't you see, the railway men, machinists and engineers, iron and
steel workers, do all of the vitally essential work in our machine
civilization. assured of their faithfulness, the iron heel can snap
its fingers at all the rest of labor. iron, steel, coal, machinery, and
transportation constitute the backbone of the whole industrial fabric.”

“but coal?” i queried. “there are nearly a million coal miners.”

they are practically unskilled labor. they will not count. their wages
will go down and their hours will increase. they will be slaves like all
the rest of us, and they will become about the most bestial of all of
us. they will be compelled to work, just as the farmers are compelled
to work now for the masters who robbed them of their land. and the same
with all the other unions outside the combination. watch them wobble and
go to pieces, and their members become slaves driven to toil by empty
stomachs and the law of the land.

“do you know what will happen to farley* and his strike-breakers? i'll
tell you. strike-breaking as an occupation will cease. there won't be
any more strikes. in place of strikes will be slave revolts. farley and
his gang will be promoted to slave-driving. oh, it won't be called
that; it will be called enforcing the law of the land that compels the
laborers to work. it simply prolongs the fight, this treachery of the
big unions. heaven only knows now where and when the revolution will
triumph.”

     * james farley--a notorious strike-breaker of the period.  a
     man more courageous than ethical, and of undeniable ability.
     he rose high under the rule of the iron heel and finally was
     translated into the oligarch class.  he was assassinated in
     1932 by sarah jenkins, whose husband, thirty years before,
     had been killed by farley's strike-breakers.

“but with such a powerful combination as the oligarchy and the big
unions, is there any reason to believe that the revolution will ever
triumph?” i queried. “may not the combination endure forever?”

he shook his head. “one of our generalizations is that every system
founded upon class and caste contains within itself the germs of its own
decay. when a system is founded upon class, how can caste be prevented?
the iron heel will not be able to prevent it, and in the end caste will
destroy the iron heel. the oligarchs have already developed caste among
themselves; but wait until the favored unions develop caste. the iron
heel will use all its power to prevent it, but it will fail.

“in the favored unions are the flower of the american workingmen. they
are strong, efficient men. they have become members of those unions
through competition for place. every fit workman in the united states
will be possessed by the ambition to become a member of the favored
unions. the oligarchy will encourage such ambition and the consequent
competition. thus will the strong men, who might else be revolutionists,
be won away and their strength used to bolster the oligarchy.

“on the other hand, the labor castes, the members of the favored unions,
will strive to make their organizations into close corporations.
and they will succeed. membership in the labor castes will become
hereditary. sons will succeed fathers, and there will be no inflow of
new strength from that eternal reservoir of strength, the common people.
this will mean deterioration of the labor castes, and in the end they
will become weaker and weaker. at the same time, as an institution, they
will become temporarily all-powerful. they will be like the guards of
the palace in old rome, and there will be palace revolutions whereby
the labor castes will seize the reins of power. and there will be
counter-palace revolutions of the oligarchs, and sometimes the one, and
sometimes the other, will be in power. and through it all the inevitable
caste-weakening will go on, so that in the end the common people will
come into their own.”

this foreshadowing of a slow social evolution was made when ernest was
first depressed by the defection of the great unions. i never agreed
with him in it, and i disagree now, as i write these lines, more
heartily than ever; for even now, though ernest is gone, we are on the
verge of the revolt that will sweep all oligarchies away. yet i have
here given ernest's prophecy because it was his prophecy. in spite of
his belief in it, he worked like a giant against it, and he, more than
any man, has made possible the revolt that even now waits the signal to
burst forth.*

     * everhard's social foresight was remarkable.  as clearly as
     in the light of past events, he saw the defection of the
     favored unions, the rise and the slow decay of the labor
     castes, and the struggle between the decaying oligarchs and
     labor castes for control of the great governmental machine.

“but if the oligarchy persists,” i asked him that evening, “what will
become of the great surpluses that will fall to its share every year?”

“the surpluses will have to be expended somehow,” he answered; “and
trust the oligarchs to find a way. magnificent roads will be built.
there will be great achievements in science, and especially in art. when
the oligarchs have completely mastered the people, they will have time
to spare for other things. they will become worshippers of beauty.
they will become art-lovers. and under their direction and generously
rewarded, will toil the artists. the result will be great art; for no
longer, as up to yesterday, will the artists pander to the bourgeois
taste of the middle class. it will be great art, i tell you, and wonder
cities will arise that will make tawdry and cheap the cities of old
time. and in these cities will the oligarchs dwell and worship beauty.*

     * we cannot but marvel at everhard's foresight.  before ever
     the thought of wonder cities like ardis and asgard entered
     the minds of the oligarchs, everhard saw those cities and
     the inevitable necessity for their creation.

“thus will the surplus be constantly expended while labor does the work.
the building of these great works and cities will give a starvation
ration to millions of common laborers, for the enormous bulk of the
surplus will compel an equally enormous expenditure, and the oligarchs
will build for a thousand years--ay, for ten thousand years. they will
build as the egyptians and the babylonians never dreamed of building;
and when the oligarchs have passed away, their great roads and their
wonder cities will remain for the brotherhood of labor to tread upon and
dwell within.*

     * and since that day of prophecy, have passed away the three
     centuries of the iron heel and the four centuries of the
     brotherhood of man, and to-day we tread the roads and dwell
     in the cities that the oligarchs built.  it is true, we are
     even now building still more wonderful wonder cities, but
     the wonder cities of the oligarchs endure, and i write these
     lines in ardis, one of the most wonderful of them all.

“these things the oligarchs will do because they cannot help doing them.
these great works will be the form their expenditure of the surplus will
take, and in the same way that the ruling classes of egypt of long ago
expended the surplus they robbed from the people by the building of
temples and pyramids. under the oligarchs will flourish, not a priest
class, but an artist class. and in place of the merchant class of
bourgeoisie will be the labor castes. and beneath will be the abyss,
wherein will fester and starve and rot, and ever renew itself, the
common people, the great bulk of the population. and in the end, who
knows in what day, the common people will rise up out of the abyss; the
labor castes and the oligarchy will crumble away; and then, at last,
after the travail of the centuries, will it be the day of the common
man. i had thought to see that day; but now i know that i shall never
see it.”

he paused and looked at me, and added:

“social evolution is exasperatingly slow, isn't it, sweetheart?”

my arms were about him, and his head was on my breast.

“sing me to sleep,” he murmured whimsically. “i have had a visioning,
and i wish to forget.”



chapter xv

last days


it was near the end of january, 1913, that the changed attitude of the
oligarchy toward the favored unions was made public. the newspapers
published information of an unprecedented rise in wages and shortening
of hours for the railroad employees, the iron and steel workers, and
the engineers and machinists. but the whole truth was not told. the
oligarchs did not dare permit the telling of the whole truth. in
reality, the wages had been raised much higher, and the privileges were
correspondingly greater. all this was secret, but secrets will out.
members of the favored unions told their wives, and the wives gossiped,
and soon all the labor world knew what had happened.

it was merely the logical development of what in the nineteenth century
had been known as grab-sharing. in the industrial warfare of that time,
profit-sharing had been tried. that is, the capitalists had striven to
placate the workers by interesting them financially in their work.
but profit-sharing, as a system, was ridiculous and impossible.
profit-sharing could be successful only in isolated cases in the midst
of a system of industrial strife; for if all labor and all capital
shared profits, the same conditions would obtain as did obtain when
there was no profit-sharing.

so, out of the unpractical idea of profit-sharing, arose the practical
idea of grab-sharing. “give us more pay and charge it to the public,”
 was the slogan of the strong unions.* and here and there this selfish
policy worked successfully. in charging it to the public, it was charged
to the great mass of unorganized labor and of weakly organized labor.
these workers actually paid the increased wages of their stronger
brothers who were members of unions that were labor monopolies. this
idea, as i say, was merely carried to its logical conclusion, on a large
scale, by the combination of the oligarchs and the favored unions.

     * all the railroad unions entered into this combination with
     the oligarchs, and it is of interest to note that the first
     definite application of the policy of profit-grabbing was
     made by a railroad union in the nineteenth century a.d.,
     namely, the brotherhood of locomotive engineers.  p. m.
     arthur was for twenty years grand chief of the brotherhood.
     after the strike on the pennsylvania railroad in 1877, he
     broached a scheme to have the locomotive engineers make
     terms with the railroads and to “go it alone” so far as the
     rest of the labor unions were concerned.  this scheme was
     eminently successful.  it was as successful as it was
     selfish, and out of it was coined the word “arthurization,”
      to denote grab-sharing on the part of labor unions.  this
     word “arthurization” has long puzzled the etymologists, but
     its derivation, i hope, is now made clear.

as soon as the secret of the defection of the favored unions leaked
out, there were rumblings and mutterings in the labor world. next, the
favored unions withdrew from the international organizations and broke
off all affiliations. then came trouble and violence. the members of the
favored unions were branded as traitors, and in saloons and brothels, on
the streets and at work, and, in fact, everywhere, they were assaulted
by the comrades they had so treacherously deserted.

countless heads were broken, and there were many killed. no member of
the favored unions was safe. they gathered together in bands in order to
go to work or to return from work. they walked always in the middle
of the street. on the sidewalk they were liable to have their skulls
crushed by bricks and cobblestones thrown from windows and house-tops.
they were permitted to carry weapons, and the authorities aided them
in every way. their persecutors were sentenced to long terms in prison,
where they were harshly treated; while no man, not a member of the
favored unions, was permitted to carry weapons. violation of this law
was made a high misdemeanor and punished accordingly.

outraged labor continued to wreak vengeance on the traitors. caste lines
formed automatically. the children of the traitors were persecuted
by the children of the workers who had been betrayed, until it was
impossible for the former to play on the streets or to attend the public
schools. also, the wives and families of the traitors were ostracized,
while the corner groceryman who sold provisions to them was boycotted.

as a result, driven back upon themselves from every side, the traitors
and their families became clannish. finding it impossible to dwell in
safety in the midst of the betrayed proletariat, they moved into new
localities inhabited by themselves alone. in this they were favored by
the oligarchs. good dwellings, modern and sanitary, were built for them,
surrounded by spacious yards, and separated here and there by parks and
playgrounds. their children attended schools especially built for
them, and in these schools manual training and applied science were
specialized upon. thus, and unavoidably, at the very beginning, out of
this segregation arose caste. the members of the favored unions became
the aristocracy of labor. they were set apart from the rest of labor.
they were better housed, better clothed, better fed, better treated.
they were grab-sharing with a vengeance.

in the meantime, the rest of the working class was more harshly treated.
many little privileges were taken away from it, while its wages and its
standard of living steadily sank down. incidentally, its public schools
deteriorated, and education slowly ceased to be compulsory. the increase
in the younger generation of children who could not read nor write was
perilous.

the capture of the world-market by the united states had disrupted the
rest of the world. institutions and governments were everywhere crashing
or transforming. germany, italy, france, australia, and new zealand were
busy forming cooperative commonwealths. the british empire was falling
apart. england's hands were full. in india revolt was in full swing. the
cry in all asia was, “asia for the asiatics!” and behind this cry was
japan, ever urging and aiding the yellow and brown races against the
white. and while japan dreamed of continental empire and strove to
realize the dream, she suppressed her own proletarian revolution. it
was a simple war of the castes, coolie versus samurai, and the coolie
socialists were executed by tens of thousands. forty thousand were
killed in the street-fighting of tokio and in the futile assault on
the mikado's palace. kobe was a shambles; the slaughter of the cotton
operatives by machine-guns became classic as the most terrific execution
ever achieved by modern war machines. most savage of all was the
japanese oligarchy that arose. japan dominated the east, and took
to herself the whole asiatic portion of the world-market, with the
exception of india.

england managed to crush her own proletarian revolution and to hold on
to india, though she was brought to the verge of exhaustion. also, she
was compelled to let her great colonies slip away from her. so it was
that the socialists succeeded in making australia and new zealand into
cooperative commonwealths. and it was for the same reason that canada
was lost to the mother country. but canada crushed her own socialist
revolution, being aided in this by the iron heel. at the same time, the
iron heel helped mexico and cuba to put down revolt. the result was that
the iron heel was firmly established in the new world. it had welded
into one compact political mass the whole of north america from the
panama canal to the arctic ocean.

and england, at the sacrifice of her great colonies, had succeeded only
in retaining india. but this was no more than temporary. the struggle
with japan and the rest of asia for india was merely delayed. england
was destined shortly to lose india, while behind that event loomed the
struggle between a united asia and the world.

and while all the world was torn with conflict, we of the united states
were not placid and peaceful. the defection of the great unions had
prevented our proletarian revolt, but violence was everywhere. in
addition to the labor troubles, and the discontent of the farmers and of
the remnant of the middle class, a religious revival had blazed up. an
offshoot of the seventh day adventists sprang into sudden prominence,
proclaiming the end of the world.

“confusion thrice confounded!” ernest cried. “how can we hope for
solidarity with all these cross purposes and conflicts?”

and truly the religious revival assumed formidable proportions. the
people, what of their wretchedness, and of their disappointment in
all things earthly, were ripe and eager for a heaven where industrial
tyrants entered no more than camels passed through needle-eyes.
wild-eyed itinerant preachers swarmed over the land; and despite
the prohibition of the civil authorities, and the persecution for
disobedience, the flames of religious frenzy were fanned by countless
camp-meetings.

it was the last days, they claimed, the beginning of the end of the
world. the four winds had been loosed. god had stirred the nations
to strife. it was a time of visions and miracles, while seers and
prophetesses were legion. the people ceased work by hundreds of
thousands and fled to the mountains, there to await the imminent coming
of god and the rising of the hundred and forty and four thousand to
heaven. but in the meantime god did not come, and they starved to death
in great numbers. in their desperation they ravaged the farms for food,
and the consequent tumult and anarchy in the country districts but
increased the woes of the poor expropriated farmers.

also, the farms and warehouses were the property of the iron heel.
armies of troops were put into the field, and the fanatics were herded
back at the bayonet point to their tasks in the cities. there they broke
out in ever recurring mobs and riots. their leaders were executed for
sedition or confined in madhouses. those who were executed went to their
deaths with all the gladness of martyrs. it was a time of madness. the
unrest spread. in the swamps and deserts and waste places, from florida
to alaska, the small groups of indians that survived were dancing ghost
dances and waiting the coming of a messiah of their own.

and through it all, with a serenity and certitude that was terrifying,
continued to rise the form of that monster of the ages, the oligarchy.
with iron hand and iron heel it mastered the surging millions, out
of confusion brought order, out of the very chaos wrought its own
foundation and structure.

“just wait till we get in,” the grangers said--calvin said it to us in
our pell street quarters. “look at the states we've captured. with you
socialists to back us, we'll make them sing another song when we take
office.”

“the millions of the discontented and the impoverished are ours,” the
socialists said. “the grangers have come over to us, the farmers, the
middle class, and the laborers. the capitalist system will fall to
pieces. in another month we send fifty men to congress. two years
hence every office will be ours, from the president down to the local
dog-catcher.”

to all of which ernest would shake his head and say:

“how many rifles have you got? do you know where you can get plenty
of lead? when it comes to powder, chemical mixtures are better than
mechanical mixtures, you take my word.”



chapter xvi

the end


when it came time for ernest and me to go to washington, father did not
accompany us. he had become enamoured of proletarian life. he looked
upon our slum neighborhood as a great sociological laboratory, and
he had embarked upon an apparently endless orgy of investigation. he
chummed with the laborers, and was an intimate in scores of homes.
also, he worked at odd jobs, and the work was play as well as learned
investigation, for he delighted in it and was always returning home with
copious notes and bubbling over with new adventures. he was the perfect
scientist.

there was no need for his working at all, because ernest managed to earn
enough from his translating to take care of the three of us. but father
insisted on pursuing his favorite phantom, and a protean phantom it was,
judging from the jobs he worked at. i shall never forget the evening he
brought home his street pedler's outfit of shoe-laces and suspenders,
nor the time i went into the little corner grocery to make some purchase
and had him wait on me. after that i was not surprised when he tended
bar for a week in the saloon across the street. he worked as a night
watchman, hawked potatoes on the street, pasted labels in a cannery
warehouse, was utility man in a paper-box factory, and water-carrier
for a street railway construction gang, and even joined the dishwashers'
union just before it fell to pieces.

i think the bishop's example, so far as wearing apparel was concerned,
must have fascinated father, for he wore the cheap cotton shirt of the
laborer and the overalls with the narrow strap about the hips. yet one
habit remained to him from the old life; he always dressed for dinner,
or supper, rather.

i could be happy anywhere with ernest; and father's happiness in our
changed circumstances rounded out my own happiness.

“when i was a boy,” father said, “i was very curious. i wanted to know
why things were and how they came to pass. that was why i became a
physicist. the life in me to-day is just as curious as it was in my
boyhood, and it's the being curious that makes life worth living.”

sometimes he ventured north of market street into the shopping and
theatre district, where he sold papers, ran errands, and opened cabs.
there, one day, closing a cab, he encountered mr. wickson. in high glee
father described the incident to us that evening.

“wickson looked at me sharply when i closed the door on him, and
muttered, 'well, i'll be damned.' just like that he said it, 'well, i'll
be damned.' his face turned red and he was so confused that he forgot to
tip me. but he must have recovered himself quickly, for the cab hadn't
gone fifty feet before it turned around and came back. he leaned out of
the door.

“'look here, professor,' he said, 'this is too much. what can i do for
you?'

“'i closed the cab door for you,' i answered. 'according to common
custom you might give me a dime.'

“'bother that!' he snorted. 'i mean something substantial.'

“he was certainly serious--a twinge of ossified conscience or something;
and so i considered with grave deliberation for a moment.

“his face was quite expectant when i began my answer, but you should
have seen it when i finished.

“'you might give me back my home,' i said, 'and my stock in the sierra
mills.'”

father paused.

“what did he say?” i questioned eagerly.

“what could he say? he said nothing. but i said. 'i hope you are happy.'
he looked at me curiously. 'tell me, are you happy?'” i asked.

“he ordered the cabman to drive on, and went away swearing horribly. and
he didn't give me the dime, much less the home and stock; so you see, my
dear, your father's street-arab career is beset with disappointments.”

and so it was that father kept on at our pell street quarters, while
ernest and i went to washington. except for the final consummation, the
old order had passed away, and the final consummation was nearer than
i dreamed. contrary to our expectation, no obstacles were raised to
prevent the socialist congressmen from taking their seats. everything
went smoothly, and i laughed at ernest when he looked upon the very
smoothness as something ominous.

we found our socialist comrades confident, optimistic of their strength
and of the things they would accomplish. a few grangers who had been
elected to congress increased our strength, and an elaborate programme
of what was to be done was prepared by the united forces. in all of
which ernest joined loyally and energetically, though he could not
forbear, now and again, from saying, apropos of nothing in particular,
“when it comes to powder, chemical mixtures are better than mechanical
mixtures, you take my word.”

the trouble arose first with the grangers in the various states they had
captured at the last election. there were a dozen of these states, but
the grangers who had been elected were not permitted to take office. the
incumbents refused to get out. it was very simple. they merely charged
illegality in the elections and wrapped up the whole situation in the
interminable red tape of the law. the grangers were powerless. the
courts were in the hands of their enemies.

this was the moment of danger. if the cheated grangers became violent,
all was lost. how we socialists worked to hold them back! there were
days and nights when ernest never closed his eyes in sleep. the big
leaders of the grangers saw the peril and were with us to a man. but
it was all of no avail. the oligarchy wanted violence, and it set
its agents-provocateurs to work. without discussion, it was the
agents-provocateurs who caused the peasant revolt.

in a dozen states the revolt flared up. the expropriated farmers
took forcible possession of the state governments. of course this was
unconstitutional, and of course the united states put its soldiers into
the field. everywhere the agents-provocateurs urged the people on. these
emissaries of the iron heel disguised themselves as artisans, farmers,
and farm laborers. in sacramento, the capital of california, the
grangers had succeeded in maintaining order. thousands of secret agents
were rushed to the devoted city. in mobs composed wholly of themselves,
they fired and looted buildings and factories. they worked the people
up until they joined them in the pillage. liquor in large quantities was
distributed among the slum classes further to inflame their minds. and
then, when all was ready, appeared upon the scene the soldiers of the
united states, who were, in reality, the soldiers of the iron heel.
eleven thousand men, women, and children were shot down on the streets
of sacramento or murdered in their houses. the national government took
possession of the state government, and all was over for california.

and as with california, so elsewhere. every granger state was ravaged
with violence and washed in blood. first, disorder was precipitated by
the secret agents and the black hundreds, then the troops were called
out. rioting and mob-rule reigned throughout the rural districts. day
and night the smoke of burning farms, warehouses, villages, and cities
filled the sky. dynamite appeared. railroad bridges and tunnels were
blown up and trains were wrecked. the poor farmers were shot and hanged
in great numbers. reprisals were bitter, and many plutocrats and army
officers were murdered. blood and vengeance were in men's hearts. the
regular troops fought the farmers as savagely as had they been indians.
and the regular troops had cause. twenty-eight hundred of them had been
annihilated in a tremendous series of dynamite explosions in oregon,
and in a similar manner, a number of train loads, at different times and
places, had been destroyed. so it was that the regular troops fought for
their lives as well as did the farmers.

as for the militia, the militia law of 1903 was put into effect, and the
workers of one state were compelled, under pain of death, to shoot down
their comrade-workers in other states. of course, the militia law did
not work smoothly at first. many militia officers were murdered, and
many militiamen were executed by drumhead court martial. ernest's
prophecy was strikingly fulfilled in the cases of mr. kowalt and mr.
asmunsen. both were eligible for the militia, and both were drafted to
serve in the punitive expedition that was despatched from california
against the farmers of missouri. mr. kowalt and mr. asmunsen refused to
serve. they were given short shrift. drumhead court martial was their
portion, and military execution their end. they were shot with their
backs to the firing squad.

many young men fled into the mountains to escape serving in the militia.
there they became outlaws, and it was not until more peaceful times that
they received their punishment. it was drastic. the government issued a
proclamation for all law-abiding citizens to come in from the mountains
for a period of three months. when the proclaimed date arrived, half a
million soldiers were sent into the mountainous districts everywhere.
there was no investigation, no trial. wherever a man was encountered, he
was shot down on the spot. the troops operated on the basis that no
man not an outlaw remained in the mountains. some bands, in strong
positions, fought gallantly, but in the end every deserter from the
militia met death.

a more immediate lesson, however, was impressed on the minds of the
people by the punishment meted out to the kansas militia. the great
kansas mutiny occurred at the very beginning of military operations
against the grangers. six thousand of the militia mutinied. they had
been for several weeks very turbulent and sullen, and for that reason
had been kept in camp. their open mutiny, however, was without doubt
precipitated by the agents-provocateurs.

on the night of the 22d of april they arose and murdered their officers,
only a small remnant of the latter escaping. this was beyond the scheme
of the iron heel, for the agents-provocateurs had done their work too
well. but everything was grist to the iron heel. it had prepared for the
outbreak, and the killing of so many officers gave it justification for
what followed. as by magic, forty thousand soldiers of the regular army
surrounded the malcontents. it was a trap. the wretched militiamen found
that their machine-guns had been tampered with, and that the cartridges
from the captured magazines did not fit their rifles. they hoisted the
white flag of surrender, but it was ignored. there were no survivors.
the entire six thousand were annihilated. common shell and shrapnel were
thrown in upon them from a distance, and, when, in their desperation,
they charged the encircling lines, they were mowed down by the
machine-guns. i talked with an eye-witness, and he said that the nearest
any militiaman approached the machine-guns was a hundred and fifty
yards. the earth was carpeted with the slain, and a final charge of
cavalry, with trampling of horses' hoofs, revolvers, and sabres, crushed
the wounded into the ground.

simultaneously with the destruction of the grangers came the revolt
of the coal miners. it was the expiring effort of organized labor.
three-quarters of a million of miners went out on strike. but they
were too widely scattered over the country to advantage from their own
strength. they were segregated in their own districts and beaten into
submission. this was the first great slave-drive. pocock* won his spurs
as a slave-driver and earned the undying hatred of the proletariat.
countless attempts were made upon his life, but he seemed to bear a
charmed existence. it was he who was responsible for the introduction
of the russian passport system among the miners, and the denial of their
right of removal from one part of the country to another.

     * albert pocock, another of the notorious strike-breakers of
     earlier years, who, to the day of his death, successfully
     held all the coal-miners of the country to their task.  he
     was succeeded by his son, lewis pocock, and for five
     generations this remarkable line of slave-drivers handled
     the coal mines.  the elder pocock, known as pocock i., has
     been described as follows: “a long, lean head, semicircled
     by a fringe of brown and gray hair, with big cheek-bones and
     a heavy chin, . . . a pale face, lustreless gray eyes, a
     metallic voice, and a languid manner.”  he was born of
     humble parents, and began his career as a bartender.  he
     next became a private detective for a street railway
     corporation, and by successive steps developed into a
     professional strikebreaker. pocock v., the last of the line,
     was blown up in a pump-house by a bomb during a petty revolt
     of the miners in the indian territory. this occurred in 2073
     a.d.

in the meantime, the socialists held firm. while the grangers expired in
flame and blood, and organized labor was disrupted, the socialists
held their peace and perfected their secret organization. in vain the
grangers pleaded with us. we rightly contended that any revolt on our
part was virtually suicide for the whole revolution. the iron heel, at
first dubious about dealing with the entire proletariat at one time, had
found the work easier than it had expected, and would have asked nothing
better than an uprising on our part. but we avoided the issue, in spite
of the fact that agents-provocateurs swarmed in our midst. in those
early days, the agents of the iron heel were clumsy in their methods.
they had much to learn and in the meantime our fighting groups weeded
them out. it was bitter, bloody work, but we were fighting for life and
for the revolution, and we had to fight the enemy with its own weapons.
yet we were fair. no agent of the iron heel was executed without a
trial. we may have made mistakes, but if so, very rarely. the bravest,
and the most combative and self-sacrificing of our comrades went into
the fighting groups. once, after ten years had passed, ernest made a
calculation from figures furnished by the chiefs of the fighting groups,
and his conclusion was that the average life of a man or woman after
becoming a member was five years. the comrades of the fighting groups
were heroes all, and the peculiar thing about it was that they were
opposed to the taking of life. they violated their own natures, yet they
loved liberty and knew of no sacrifice too great to make for the cause.*

     * these fighting groups were modelled somewhat after the
     fighting organization of the russian revolution, and,
     despite the unceasing efforts of the iron heel, these groups
     persisted throughout the three centuries of its existence.
     composed of men and women actuated by lofty purpose and
     unafraid to die, the fighting groups exercised tremendous
     influence and tempered the savage brutality of the rulers.
     not alone was their work confined to unseen warfare with the
     secret agents of the oligarchy.  the oligarchs themselves
     were compelled to listen to the decrees of the groups, and
     often, when they disobeyed, were punished by death--and
     likewise with the subordinates of the oligarchs, with the
     officers of the army and the leaders of the labor castes.

     stern justice was meted out by these organized avengers, but
     most remarkable was their passionless and judicial
     procedure.  there were no snap judgments.  when a man was
     captured he was given fair trial and opportunity for
     defence.  of necessity, many men were tried and condemned by
     proxy, as in the case of general lampton. this occurred in
     2138 a.d.  possibly the most bloodthirsty and malignant of
     all the mercenaries that ever served the iron heel, he was
     informed by the fighting groups that they had tried him,
     found him guilty, and condemned him to death--and this,
     after three warnings for him to cease from his ferocious
     treatment of the proletariat.  after his condemnation he
     surrounded himself with a myriad protective devices.  years
     passed, and in vain the fighting groups strove to execute
     their decree.  comrade after comrade, men and women, failed
     in their attempts, and were cruelly executed by the
     oligarchy.  it was the case of general lampton that revived
     crucifixion as a legal method of execution.  but in the end
     the condemned man found his executioner in the form of a
     slender girl of seventeen, madeline provence, who, to
     accomplish her purpose, served two years in his palace as a
     seamstress to the household. she died in solitary
     confinement after horrible and prolonged torture; but to-day
     she stands in imperishable bronze in the pantheon of
     brotherhood in the wonder city of serles.

     we, who by personal experience know nothing of bloodshed,
     must not judge harshly the heroes of the fighting groups.
     they gave up their lives for humanity, no sacrifice was too
     great for them to accomplish, while inexorable necessity
     compelled them to bloody expression in an age of blood.  the
     fighting groups constituted the one thorn in the side of the
     iron heel that the iron heel could never remove.  everhard
     was the father of this curious army, and its accomplishments
     and successful persistence for three hundred years bear
     witness to the wisdom with which he organized and the solid
     foundation he laid for the succeeding generations to build
     upon.  in some respects, despite his great economic and
     sociological contributions, and his work as a general leader
     in the revolution, his organization of the fighting groups
     must be regarded as his greatest achievement.

the task we set ourselves was threefold. first, the weeding out from our
circles of the secret agents of the oligarchy. second, the organizing
of the fighting groups, and outside of them, of the general secret
organization of the revolution. and third, the introduction of our own
secret agents into every branch of the oligarchy--into the labor castes
and especially among the telegraphers and secretaries and clerks, into
the army, the agents-provocateurs, and the slave-drivers. it was slow
work, and perilous, and often were our efforts rewarded with costly
failures.

the iron heel had triumphed in open warfare, but we held our own in the
new warfare, strange and awful and subterranean, that we instituted.
all was unseen, much was unguessed; the blind fought the blind; and
yet through it all was order, purpose, control. we permeated the
entire organization of the iron heel with our agents, while our own
organization was permeated with the agents of the iron heel. it was
warfare dark and devious, replete with intrigue and conspiracy, plot
and counterplot. and behind all, ever menacing, was death, violent and
terrible. men and women disappeared, our nearest and dearest comrades.
we saw them to-day. to-morrow they were gone; we never saw them again,
and we knew that they had died.

there was no trust, no confidence anywhere. the man who plotted beside
us, for all we knew, might be an agent of the iron heel. we mined the
organization of the iron heel with our secret agents, and the iron heel
countermined with its secret agents inside its own organization. and
it was the same with our organization. and despite the absence of
confidence and trust we were compelled to base our every effort on
confidence and trust. often were we betrayed. men were weak. the iron
heel could offer money, leisure, the joys and pleasures that waited
in the repose of the wonder cities. we could offer nothing but the
satisfaction of being faithful to a noble ideal. as for the rest, the
wages of those who were loyal were unceasing peril, torture, and death.

men were weak, i say, and because of their weakness we were compelled to
make the only other reward that was within our power. it was the reward
of death. out of necessity we had to punish our traitors. for every man
who betrayed us, from one to a dozen faithful avengers were loosed upon
his heels. we might fail to carry out our decrees against our enemies,
such as the pococks, for instance; but the one thing we could not afford
to fail in was the punishment of our own traitors. comrades turned
traitor by permission, in order to win to the wonder cities and there
execute our sentences on the real traitors. in fact, so terrible did
we make ourselves, that it became a greater peril to betray us than to
remain loyal to us.

the revolution took on largely the character of religion. we worshipped
at the shrine of the revolution, which was the shrine of liberty. it was
the divine flashing through us. men and women devoted their lives to
the cause, and new-born babes were sealed to it as of old they had been
sealed to the service of god. we were lovers of humanity.



chapter xvii

the scarlet livery


with the destruction of the granger states, the grangers in congress
disappeared. they were being tried for high treason, and their places
were taken by the creatures of the iron heel. the socialists were in a
pitiful minority, and they knew that their end was near. congress and
the senate were empty pretences, farces. public questions were gravely
debated and passed upon according to the old forms, while in reality all
that was done was to give the stamp of constitutional procedure to the
mandates of the oligarchy.

ernest was in the thick of the fight when the end came. it was in the
debate on the bill to assist the unemployed. the hard times of the
preceding year had thrust great masses of the proletariat beneath the
starvation line, and the continued and wide-reaching disorder had but
sunk them deeper. millions of people were starving, while the oligarchs
and their supporters were surfeiting on the surplus.* we called these
wretched people the people of the abyss,** and it was to alleviate their
awful suffering that the socialists had introduced the unemployed bill.
but this was not to the fancy of the iron heel. in its own way it was
preparing to set these millions to work, but the way was not our way,
wherefore it had issued its orders that our bill should be voted down.
ernest and his fellows knew that their effort was futile, but they
were tired of the suspense. they wanted something to happen. they were
accomplishing nothing, and the best they hoped for was the putting of an
end to the legislative farce in which they were unwilling players.
they knew not what end would come, but they never anticipated a more
disastrous end than the one that did come.

     * the same conditions obtained in the nineteenth century
     a.d. under british rule in india.  the natives died of
     starvation by the million, while their rulers robbed them of
     the fruits of their toil and expended it on magnificent
     pageants and mumbo-jumbo fooleries. perforce, in this
     enlightened age, we have much to blush for in the acts of
     our ancestors.  our only consolation is philosophic.  we
     must accept the capitalistic stage in social evolution as
     about on a par with the earlier monkey stage.  the human had
     to pass through those stages in its rise from the mire and
     slime of low organic life.  it was inevitable that much of
     the mire and slime should cling and be not easily shaken
     off.

     ** the people of the abyss--this phrase was struck out by
     the genius of h. g. wells in the late nineteenth century
     a.d.  wells was a sociological seer, sane and normal as well
     as warm human. many fragments of his work have come down to
     us, while two of his greatest achievements, “anticipations”
      and “mankind in the making,” have come down intact.  before
     the oligarchs, and before everhard, wells speculated upon
     the building of the wonder cities, though in his writings
     they are referred to as “pleasure cities.”

i sat in the gallery that day. we all knew that something terrible was
imminent. it was in the air, and its presence was made visible by the
armed soldiers drawn up in lines in the corridors, and by the officers
grouped in the entrances to the house itself. the oligarchy was about
to strike. ernest was speaking. he was describing the sufferings of
the unemployed, as if with the wild idea of in some way touching their
hearts and consciences; but the republican and democratic members
sneered and jeered at him, and there was uproar and confusion. ernest
abruptly changed front.

“i know nothing that i may say can influence you,” he said. “you have no
souls to be influenced. you are spineless, flaccid things. you pompously
call yourselves republicans and democrats. there is no republican party.
there is no democratic party. there are no republicans nor democrats in
this house. you are lick-spittlers and panderers, the creatures of the
plutocracy. you talk verbosely in antiquated terminology of your love
of liberty, and all the while you wear the scarlet livery of the iron
heel.”

here the shouting and the cries of “order! order!” drowned his voice,
and he stood disdainfully till the din had somewhat subsided. he waved
his hand to include all of them, turned to his own comrades, and said:

“listen to the bellowing of the well-fed beasts.”

pandemonium broke out again. the speaker rapped for order and glanced
expectantly at the officers in the doorways. there were cries of
“sedition!” and a great, rotund new york member began shouting
“anarchist!” at ernest. and ernest was not pleasant to look at. every
fighting fibre of him was quivering, and his face was the face of a
fighting animal, withal he was cool and collected.

“remember,” he said, in a voice that made itself heard above the din,
“that as you show mercy now to the proletariat, some day will that same
proletariat show mercy to you.”

the cries of “sedition!” and “anarchist!” redoubled.

“i know that you will not vote for this bill,” ernest went on. “you have
received the command from your masters to vote against it. and yet you
call me anarchist. you, who have destroyed the government of the people,
and who shamelessly flaunt your scarlet shame in public places, call me
anarchist. i do not believe in hell-fire and brimstone; but in moments
like this i regret my unbelief. nay, in moments like this i almost do
believe. surely there must be a hell, for in no less place could it be
possible for you to receive punishment adequate to your crimes. so long
as you exist, there is a vital need for hell-fire in the cosmos.”

there was movement in the doorways. ernest, the speaker, all the members
turned to see.

“why do you not call your soldiers in, mr. speaker, and bid them do
their work?” ernest demanded. “they should carry out your plan with
expedition.”

“there are other plans afoot,” was the retort. “that is why the soldiers
are present.”

“our plans, i suppose,” ernest sneered. “assassination or something
kindred.”

but at the word “assassination” the uproar broke out again. ernest could
not make himself heard, but he remained on his feet waiting for a lull.
and then it happened. from my place in the gallery i saw nothing except
the flash of the explosion. the roar of it filled my ears and i saw
ernest reeling and falling in a swirl of smoke, and the soldiers rushing
up all the aisles. his comrades were on their feet, wild with anger,
capable of any violence. but ernest steadied himself for a moment, and
waved his arms for silence.

“it is a plot!” his voice rang out in warning to his comrades. “do
nothing, or you will be destroyed.”

then he slowly sank down, and the soldiers reached him. the next moment
soldiers were clearing the galleries and i saw no more.

though he was my husband, i was not permitted to get to him. when i
announced who i was, i was promptly placed under arrest. and at the same
time were arrested all socialist congressmen in washington, including
the unfortunate simpson, who lay ill with typhoid fever in his hotel.

the trial was prompt and brief. the men were foredoomed. the wonder
was that ernest was not executed. this was a blunder on the part of
the oligarchy, and a costly one. but the oligarchy was too confident in
those days. it was drunk with success, and little did it dream that
that small handful of heroes had within them the power to rock it to
its foundations. to-morrow, when the great revolt breaks out and all
the world resounds with the tramp, tramp of the millions, the oligarchy,
will realize, and too late, how mightily that band of heroes has grown.*

     * avis everhard took for granted that her narrative would be
     read in her own day, and so omits to mention the outcome of
     the trial for high treason.  many other similar
     disconcerting omissions will be noticed in the manuscript.
     fifty-two socialist congressmen were tried, and all were
     found guilty.  strange to relate, not one received the death
     sentence.  everhard and eleven others, among whom were
     theodore donnelson and matthew kent, received life
     imprisonment.  the remaining forty received sentences
     varying from thirty to forty-five years; while arthur
     simpson, referred to in the manuscript as being ill of
     typhoid fever at the time of the explosion, received only
     fifteen years.  it is the tradition that he died of
     starvation in solitary confinement, and this harsh treatment
     is explained as having been caused by his uncompromising
     stubbornness and his fiery and tactless hatred for all men
     that served the despotism.  he died in cabanas in cuba,
     where three of his comrades were also confined.  the fifty-
     two socialist congressmen were confined in military
     fortresses scattered all over the united states.  thus, du
     bois and woods were held in porto rico, while everhard and
     merryweather were placed in alcatraz, an island in san
     francisco bay that had already seen long service as a
     military prison.

as a revolutionist myself, as one on the inside who knew the hopes and
fears and secret plans of the revolutionists, i am fitted to answer, as
very few are, the charge that they were guilty of exploding the bomb in
congress. and i can say flatly, without qualification or doubt of any
sort, that the socialists, in congress and out, had no hand in the
affair. who threw the bomb we do not know, but the one thing we are
absolutely sure of is that we did not throw it.

on the other hand, there is evidence to show that the iron heel was
responsible for the act. of course, we cannot prove this. our conclusion
is merely presumptive. but here are such facts as we do know. it had
been reported to the speaker of the house, by secret-service agents of
the government, that the socialist congressmen were about to resort to
terroristic tactics, and that they had decided upon the day when
their tactics would go into effect. this day was the very day of
the explosion. wherefore the capitol had been packed with troops in
anticipation. since we knew nothing about the bomb, and since a bomb
actually was exploded, and since the authorities had prepared in advance
for the explosion, it is only fair to conclude that the iron heel
did know. furthermore, we charge that the iron heel was guilty of the
outrage, and that the iron heel planned and perpetrated the outrage for
the purpose of foisting the guilt on our shoulders and so bringing about
our destruction.

from the speaker the warning leaked out to all the creatures in
the house that wore the scarlet livery. they knew, while ernest was
speaking, that some violent act was to be committed. and to do them
justice, they honestly believed that the act was to be committed by
the socialists. at the trial, and still with honest belief, several
testified to having seen ernest prepare to throw the bomb, and that it
exploded prematurely. of course they saw nothing of the sort. in the
fevered imagination of fear they thought they saw, that was all.

as ernest said at the trial: “does it stand to reason, if i were going
to throw a bomb, that i should elect to throw a feeble little squib like
the one that was thrown? there wasn't enough powder in it. it made a lot
of smoke, but hurt no one except me. it exploded right at my feet, and
yet it did not kill me. believe me, when i get to throwing bombs, i'll
do damage. there'll be more than smoke in my petards.”

in return it was argued by the prosecution that the weakness of the
bomb was a blunder on the part of the socialists, just as its premature
explosion, caused by ernest's losing his nerve and dropping it, was a
blunder. and to clinch the argument, there were the several congressmen
who testified to having seen ernest fumble and drop the bomb.

as for ourselves, not one of us knew how the bomb was thrown. ernest
told me that the fraction of an instant before it exploded he both heard
and saw it strike at his feet. he testified to this at the trial, but
no one believed him. besides, the whole thing, in popular slang, was
“cooked up.” the iron heel had made up its mind to destroy us, and there
was no withstanding it.

there is a saying that truth will out. i have come to doubt that saying.
nineteen years have elapsed, and despite our untiring efforts, we have
failed to find the man who really did throw the bomb. undoubtedly he was
some emissary of the iron heel, but he has escaped detection. we have
never got the slightest clew to his identity. and now, at this late
date, nothing remains but for the affair to take its place among the
mysteries of history.*

     * avis everhard would have had to live for many generations
     ere she could have seen the clearing up of this particular
     mystery.  a little less than a hundred years ago, and a
     little more than six hundred years after the death, the
     confession of pervaise was discovered in the secret archives
     of the vatican.  it is perhaps well to tell a little
     something about this obscure document, which, in the main,
     is of interest to the historian only.

     pervaise was an american, of french descent, who in 1913
     a.d., was lying in the tombs prison, new york city, awaiting
     trial for murder.  from his confession we learn that he was
     not a criminal. he was warm-blooded, passionate, emotional.
     in an insane fit of jealousy he killed his wife--a very
     common act in those times. pervaise was mastered by the fear
     of death, all of which is recounted at length in his
     confession.  to escape death he would have done anything,
     and the police agents prepared him by assuring him that he
     could not possibly escape conviction of murder in the first
     degree when his trial came off.  in those days, murder in
     the first degree was a capital offense.  the guilty man or
     woman was placed in a specially constructed death-chair,
     and, under the supervision of competent physicians, was
     destroyed by a current of electricity.  this was called
     electrocution, and it was very popular during that period.
     anaesthesia, as a mode of compulsory death, was not
     introduced until later.

     this man, good at heart but with a ferocious animalism close
     at the surface of his being, lying in jail and expectant of
     nothing less than death, was prevailed upon by the agents of
     the iron heel to throw the bomb in the house of
     representatives.  in his confession he states explicitly
     that he was informed that the bomb was to be a feeble thing
     and that no lives would be lost.  this is directly in line
     with the fact that the bomb was lightly charged, and that
     its explosion at everhard's feet was not deadly.

     pervaise was smuggled into one of the galleries ostensibly
     closed for repairs.  he was to select the moment for the
     throwing of the bomb, and he naively confesses that in his
     interest in everhard's tirade and the general commotion
     raised thereby, he nearly forgot his mission.

     not only was he released from prison in reward for his deed,
     but he was granted an income for life.  this he did not long
     enjoy.  in 1914 a.d., in september, he was stricken with
     rheumatism of the heart and lived for three days.  it was
     then that he sent for the catholic priest, father peter
     durban, and to him made confession. so important did it seem
     to the priest, that he had the confession taken down in
     writing and sworn to.  what happened after this we can only
     surmise.  the document was certainly important enough to
     find its way to rome.  powerful influences must have been
     brought to bear, hence its suppression.  for centuries no
     hint of its existence reached the world.  it was not until
     in the last century that lorbia, the brilliant italian
     scholar, stumbled upon it quite by chance during his
     researches in the vatican.

     there is to-day no doubt whatever that the iron heel was
     responsible for the bomb that exploded in the house of
     representatives in 1913 a.d.  even though the pervaise
     confession had never come to light, no reasonable doubt
     could obtain; for the act in question, that sent fifty-two
     congressmen to prison, was on a par with countless other
     acts committed by the oligarchs, and, before them, by the
     capitalists.

     there is the classic instance of the ferocious and wanton
     judicial murder of the innocent and so-called haymarket
     anarchists in chicago in the penultimate decade of the
     nineteenth century a.d. in a category by itself is the
     deliberate burning and destruction of capitalist property by
     the capitalists themselves.  for such destruction of
     property innocent men were frequently punished--“railroaded”
      in the parlance of the times.

     in the labor troubles of the first decade of the twentieth
     century a.d., between the capitalists and the western
     federation of miners, similar but more bloody tactics were
     employed.  the railroad station at independence was blown up
     by the agents of the capitalists.  thirteen men were killed,
     and many more were wounded. and then the capitalists,
     controlling the legislative and judicial machinery of the
     state of colorado, charged the miners with the crime and
     came very near to convicting them.  romaines, one of the
     tools in this affair, like pervaise, was lying in jail in
     another state, kansas, awaiting trial, when he was
     approached by the agents of the capitalists.  but, unlike
     pervaise the confession of romaines was made public in his
     own time.

     then, during this same period, there was the case of moyer
     and haywood, two strong, fearless leaders of labor.  one was
     president and the other was secretary of the western
     federation of miners. the ex-governor of idaho had been
     mysteriously murdered.  the crime, at the time, was openly
     charged to the mine owners by the socialists and miners.
     nevertheless, in violation of the national and state
     constitutions, and by means of conspiracy on the parts of
     the governors of idaho and colorado, moyer and haywood were
     kidnapped, thrown into jail, and charged with the murder.
     it was this instance that provoked from eugene v. debs,
     national leader of the american socialists at the time, the
     following words: “the labor leaders that cannot be bribed
     nor bullied, must be ambushed and murdered.  the only crime
     of moyer and haywood is that they have been unswervingly
     true to the working class.  the capitalists have stolen our
     country, debauched our politics, defiled our judiciary, and
     ridden over us rough-shod, and now they propose to murder
     those who will not abjectly surrender to their brutal
     dominion.  the governors of colorado and idaho are but
     executing the mandates of their masters, the plutocracy.
     the issue is the workers versus the plutocracy.  if they
     strike the first violent blow, we will strike the last.”



chapter xviii

in the shadow of sonoma


of myself, during this period, there is not much to say. for six months
i was kept in prison, though charged with no crime. i was a suspect--a
word of fear that all revolutionists were soon to come to know. but
our own nascent secret service was beginning to work. by the end of
my second month in prison, one of the jailers made himself known as
a revolutionist in touch with the organization. several weeks later,
joseph parkhurst, the prison doctor who had just been appointed, proved
himself to be a member of one of the fighting groups.

thus, throughout the organization of the oligarchy, our own
organization, weblike and spidery, was insinuating itself. and so i
was kept in touch with all that was happening in the world without. and
furthermore, every one of our imprisoned leaders was in contact with
brave comrades who masqueraded in the livery of the iron heel. though
ernest lay in prison three thousand miles away, on the pacific coast, i
was in unbroken communication with him, and our letters passed regularly
back and forth.

the leaders, in prison and out, were able to discuss and direct the
campaign. it would have been possible, within a few months, to have
effected the escape of some of them; but since imprisonment proved
no bar to our activities, it was decided to avoid anything premature.
fifty-two congressmen were in prison, and fully three hundred more
of our leaders. it was planned that they should be delivered
simultaneously. if part of them escaped, the vigilance of the oligarchs
might be aroused so as to prevent the escape of the remainder. on the
other hand, it was held that a simultaneous jail-delivery all over the
land would have immense psychological influence on the proletariat. it
would show our strength and give confidence.

so it was arranged, when i was released at the end of six months, that
i was to disappear and prepare a secure hiding-place for ernest. to
disappear was in itself no easy thing. no sooner did i get my freedom
than my footsteps began to be dogged by the spies of the iron heel.
it was necessary that they should be thrown off the track, and that
i should win to california. it is laughable, the way this was
accomplished.

already the passport system, modelled on the russian, was developing. i
dared not cross the continent in my own character. it was necessary that
i should be completely lost if ever i was to see ernest again, for by
trailing me after he escaped, he would be caught once more. again, i
could not disguise myself as a proletarian and travel. there remained
the disguise of a member of the oligarchy. while the arch-oligarchs were
no more than a handful, there were myriads of lesser ones of the type,
say, of mr. wickson--men, worth a few millions, who were adherents of
the arch-oligarchs. the wives and daughters of these lesser oligarchs
were legion, and it was decided that i should assume the disguise of
such a one. a few years later this would have been impossible, because
the passport system was to become so perfect that no man, woman, nor
child in all the land was unregistered and unaccounted for in his or her
movements.

when the time was ripe, the spies were thrown off my track. an hour
later avis everhard was no more. at that time one felice van verdighan,
accompanied by two maids and a lap-dog, with another maid for the
lap-dog,* entered a drawing-room on a pullman,** and a few minutes later
was speeding west.

     * this ridiculous picture well illustrates the heartless
     conduct of the masters.  while people starved, lap-dogs were
     waited upon by maids.  this was a serious masquerade on the
     part of avis everhard. life and death and the cause were in
     the issue; therefore the picture must be accepted as a true
     picture.  it affords a striking commentary of the times.

     ** pullman--the designation of the more luxurious railway
     cars of the period and so named from the inventor.

the three maids who accompanied me were revolutionists. two were members
of the fighting groups, and the third, grace holbrook, entered a group
the following year, and six months later was executed by the iron heel.
she it was who waited upon the dog. of the other two, bertha stole
disappeared twelve years later, while anna roylston still lives and
plays an increasingly important part in the revolution.*

     * despite continual and almost inconceivable hazards, anna
     roylston lived to the royal age of ninety-one.  as the
     pococks defied the executioners of the fighting groups, so
     she defied the executioners of the iron heel.  she bore a
     charmed life and prospered amid dangers and alarms.  she
     herself was an executioner for the fighting groups, and,
     known as the red virgin, she became one of the inspired
     figures of the revolution.  when she was an old woman of
     sixty-nine she shot “bloody” halcliffe down in the midst of
     his armed escort and got away unscathed.  in the end she
     died peaceably of old age in a secret refuge of the
     revolutionists in the ozark mountains.

without adventure we crossed the united states to california. when the
train stopped at sixteenth street station, in oakland, we alighted, and
there felice van verdighan, with her two maids, her lap-dog, and
her lap-dog's maid, disappeared forever. the maids, guided by trusty
comrades, were led away. other comrades took charge of me. within half
an hour after leaving the train i was on board a small fishing boat
and out on the waters of san francisco bay. the winds baffled, and we
drifted aimlessly the greater part of the night. but i saw the lights of
alcatraz where ernest lay, and found comfort in the thought of nearness
to him. by dawn, what with the rowing of the fishermen, we made the
marin islands. here we lay in hiding all day, and on the following
night, swept on by a flood tide and a fresh wind, we crossed san pablo
bay in two hours and ran up petaluma creek.

here horses were ready and another comrade, and without delay we were
away through the starlight. to the north i could see the loom of sonoma
mountain, toward which we rode. we left the old town of sonoma to the
right and rode up a canyon that lay between outlying buttresses of the
mountain. the wagon-road became a wood-road, the wood-road became a
cow-path, and the cow-path dwindled away and ceased among the upland
pastures. straight over sonoma mountain we rode. it was the safest
route. there was no one to mark our passing.

dawn caught us on the northern brow, and in the gray light we dropped
down through chaparral into redwood canyons deep and warm with the
breath of passing summer. it was old country to me that i knew and
loved, and soon i became the guide. the hiding-place was mine. i had
selected it. we let down the bars and crossed an upland meadow. next, we
went over a low, oak-covered ridge and descended into a smaller meadow.
again we climbed a ridge, this time riding under red-limbed madronos and
manzanitas of deeper red. the first rays of the sun streamed upon
our backs as we climbed. a flight of quail thrummed off through the
thickets. a big jackrabbit crossed our path, leaping swiftly and
silently like a deer. and then a deer, a many-pronged buck, the sun
flashing red-gold from neck and shoulders, cleared the crest of the
ridge before us and was gone.

we followed in his wake a space, then dropped down a zigzag trail that
he disdained into a group of noble redwoods that stood about a pool of
water murky with minerals from the mountain side. i knew every inch of
the way. once a writer friend of mine had owned the ranch; but he, too,
had become a revolutionist, though more disastrously than i, for he was
already dead and gone, and none knew where nor how. he alone, in the
days he had lived, knew the secret of the hiding-place for which i was
bound. he had bought the ranch for beauty, and paid a round price for
it, much to the disgust of the local farmers. he used to tell with great
glee how they were wont to shake their heads mournfully at the price, to
accomplish ponderously a bit of mental arithmetic, and then to say, “but
you can't make six per cent on it.”

but he was dead now, nor did the ranch descend to his children. of all
men, it was now the property of mr. wickson, who owned the whole eastern
and northern slopes of sonoma mountain, running from the spreckels
estate to the divide of bennett valley. out of it he had made a
magnificent deer-park, where, over thousands of acres of sweet slopes
and glades and canyons, the deer ran almost in primitive wildness. the
people who had owned the soil had been driven away. a state home for the
feeble-minded had also been demolished to make room for the deer.

to cap it all, wickson's hunting lodge was a quarter of a mile from my
hiding-place. this, instead of being a danger, was an added security.
we were sheltered under the very aegis of one of the minor oligarchs.
suspicion, by the nature of the situation, was turned aside. the last
place in the world the spies of the iron heel would dream of looking for
me, and for ernest when he joined me, was wickson's deer-park.

we tied our horses among the redwoods at the pool. from a cache behind
a hollow rotting log my companion brought out a variety of things,--a
fifty-pound sack of flour, tinned foods of all sorts, cooking utensils,
blankets, a canvas tarpaulin, books and writing material, a great bundle
of letters, a five-gallon can of kerosene, an oil stove, and, last and
most important, a large coil of stout rope. so large was the supply of
things that a number of trips would be necessary to carry them to the
refuge.

but the refuge was very near. taking the rope and leading the way, i
passed through a glade of tangled vines and bushes that ran between two
wooded knolls. the glade ended abruptly at the steep bank of a stream.
it was a little stream, rising from springs, and the hottest summer
never dried it up. on every hand were tall wooded knolls, a group of
them, with all the seeming of having been flung there from some careless
titan's hand. there was no bed-rock in them. they rose from their bases
hundreds of feet, and they were composed of red volcanic earth, the
famous wine-soil of sonoma. through these the tiny stream had cut its
deep and precipitous channel.

it was quite a scramble down to the stream bed, and, once on the bed,
we went down stream perhaps for a hundred feet. and then we came to the
great hole. there was no warning of the existence of the hole, nor
was it a hole in the common sense of the word. one crawled through
tight-locked briers and branches, and found oneself on the very edge,
peering out and down through a green screen. a couple of hundred feet in
length and width, it was half of that in depth. possibly because of
some fault that had occurred when the knolls were flung together, and
certainly helped by freakish erosion, the hole had been scooped out in
the course of centuries by the wash of water. nowhere did the raw earth
appear. all was garmented by vegetation, from tiny maiden-hair and
gold-back ferns to mighty redwood and douglas spruces. these great trees
even sprang out from the walls of the hole. some leaned over at angles
as great as forty-five degrees, though the majority towered straight up
from the soft and almost perpendicular earth walls.

it was a perfect hiding-place. no one ever came there, not even the
village boys of glen ellen. had this hole existed in the bed of a canyon
a mile long, or several miles long, it would have been well known. but
this was no canyon. from beginning to end the length of the stream was
no more than five hundred yards. three hundred yards above the hole the
stream took its rise in a spring at the foot of a flat meadow. a hundred
yards below the hole the stream ran out into open country, joining the
main stream and flowing across rolling and grass-covered land.

my companion took a turn of the rope around a tree, and with me fast on
the other end lowered away. in no time i was on the bottom. and in but
a short while he had carried all the articles from the cache and lowered
them down to me. he hauled the rope up and hid it, and before he went
away called down to me a cheerful parting.

before i go on i want to say a word for this comrade, john carlson, a
humble figure of the revolution, one of the countless faithful ones in
the ranks. he worked for wickson, in the stables near the hunting lodge.
in fact, it was on wickson's horses that we had ridden over sonoma
mountain. for nearly twenty years now john carlson has been custodian
of the refuge. no thought of disloyalty, i am sure, has ever entered his
mind during all that time. to betray his trust would have been in his
mind a thing undreamed. he was phlegmatic, stolid to such a degree that
one could not but wonder how the revolution had any meaning to him at
all. and yet love of freedom glowed sombrely and steadily in his
dim soul. in ways it was indeed good that he was not flighty and
imaginative. he never lost his head. he could obey orders, and he was
neither curious nor garrulous. once i asked how it was that he was a
revolutionist.

“when i was a young man i was a soldier,” was his answer. “it was in
germany. there all young men must be in the army. so i was in the army.
there was another soldier there, a young man, too. his father was what
you call an agitator, and his father was in jail for lese majesty--what
you call speaking the truth about the emperor. and the young man, the
son, talked with me much about people, and work, and the robbery of
the people by the capitalists. he made me see things in new ways, and
i became a socialist. his talk was very true and good, and i have never
forgotten. when i came to the united states i hunted up the socialists.
i became a member of a section--that was in the day of the s. l. p.
then later, when the split came, i joined the local of the s. p. i was
working in a livery stable in san francisco then. that was before the
earthquake. i have paid my dues for twenty-two years. i am yet a member,
and i yet pay my dues, though it is very secret now. i will always pay
my dues, and when the cooperative commonwealth comes, i will be glad.”

left to myself, i proceeded to cook breakfast on the oil stove and to
prepare my home. often, in the early morning, or in the evening after
dark, carlson would steal down to the refuge and work for a couple of
hours. at first my home was the tarpaulin. later, a small tent was put
up. and still later, when we became assured of the perfect security of
the place, a small house was erected. this house was completely hidden
from any chance eye that might peer down from the edge of the hole. the
lush vegetation of that sheltered spot make a natural shield. also, the
house was built against the perpendicular wall; and in the wall itself,
shored by strong timbers, well drained and ventilated, we excavated two
small rooms. oh, believe me, we had many comforts. when biedenbach,
the german terrorist, hid with us some time later, he installed a
smoke-consuming device that enabled us to sit by crackling wood fires on
winter nights.

and here i must say a word for that gentle-souled terrorist, than whom
there is no comrade in the revolution more fearfully misunderstood.
comrade biedenbach did not betray the cause. nor was he executed by
the comrades as is commonly supposed. this canard was circulated by
the creatures of the oligarchy. comrade biedenbach was absent-minded,
forgetful. he was shot by one of our lookouts at the cave-refuge at
carmel, through failure on his part to remember the secret signals. it
was all a sad mistake. and that he betrayed his fighting group is an
absolute lie. no truer, more loyal man ever labored for the cause.*

     * search as we may through all the material of those times
     that has come down to us, we can find no clew to the
     biedenbach here referred to.  no mention is made of him
     anywhere save in the everhard manuscript.


for nineteen years now the refuge that i selected had been almost
continuously occupied, and in all that time, with one exception, it has
never been discovered by an outsider.  and yet it was only a quarter of
a mile from wickson's hunting-lodge, and a short mile from the village
of glen ellen.  i was able, always, to hear the morning and evening
trains arrive and depart, and i used to set my watch by the whistle at
the brickyards.*

     * if the curious traveller will turn south from glen ellen,
     he will find himself on a boulevard that is identical with
     the old country road seven centuries ago.  a quarter of a
     mile from glen ellen, after the second bridge is passed, to
     the right will be noticed a barranca that runs like a scar
     across the rolling land toward a group of wooded knolls.
     the barranca is the site of the ancient right of way that in
     the time of private property in land ran across the holding
     of one chauvet, a french pioneer of california who came from
     his native country in the fabled days of gold.  the wooded
     knolls are the same knolls referred to by avis everhard.

     the great earthquake of 2368 a.d. broke off the side of one
     of these knolls and toppled it into the hole where the
     everhards made their refuge.  since the finding of the
     manuscript excavations have been made, and the house, the
     two cave rooms, and all the accumulated rubbish of long
     occupancy have been brought to light. many valuable relics
     have been found, among which, curious to relate, is the
     smoke-consuming device of biedenbach's mentioned in the
     narrative.  students interested in such matters should read
     the brochure of arnold bentham soon to be published.

     a mile northwest from the wooded knolls brings one to the
     site of wake robin lodge at the junction of wild-water and
     sonoma creeks. it may be noticed, in passing, that wild-
     water was originally called graham creek and was so named on
     the early local maps.  but the later name sticks.  it was at
     wake robin lodge that avis everhard later lived for short
     periods, when, disguised as an agent-provocateur of the iron
     heel, she was enabled to play with impunity her part among
     men and events.  the official permission to occupy wake
     robin lodge is still on the records, signed by no less a man
     than wickson, the minor oligarch of the manuscript.


chapter xix

transformation


“you must make yourself over again,” ernest wrote to me. “you must cease
to be. you must become another woman--and not merely in the clothes you
wear, but inside your skin under the clothes. you must make yourself
over again so that even i would not know you--your voice, your gestures,
your mannerisms, your carriage, your walk, everything.”

this command i obeyed. every day i practised for hours in burying
forever the old avis everhard beneath the skin of another woman whom i
may call my other self. it was only by long practice that such results
could be obtained. in the mere detail of voice intonation i practised
almost perpetually till the voice of my new self became fixed,
automatic. it was this automatic assumption of a role that was
considered imperative. one must become so adept as to deceive oneself.
it was like learning a new language, say the french. at first speech in
french is self-conscious, a matter of the will. the student thinks
in english and then transmutes into french, or reads in french but
transmutes into english before he can understand. then later, becoming
firmly grounded, automatic, the student reads, writes, and thinks in
french, without any recourse to english at all.

and so with our disguises. it was necessary for us to practise until our
assumed roles became real; until to be our original selves would require
a watchful and strong exercise of will. of course, at first, much was
mere blundering experiment. we were creating a new art, and we had much
to discover. but the work was going on everywhere; masters in the
art were developing, and a fund of tricks and expedients was being
accumulated. this fund became a sort of text-book that was passed on, a
part of the curriculum, as it were, of the school of revolution.*

     * disguise did become a veritable art during that period.
     the revolutionists maintained schools of acting in all their
     refuges. they scorned accessories, such as wigs and beards,
     false eyebrows, and such aids of the theatrical actors.  the
     game of revolution was a game of life and death, and mere
     accessories were traps. disguise had to be fundamental,
     intrinsic, part and parcel of one's being, second nature.
     the red virgin is reported to have been one of the most
     adept in the art, to which must be ascribed her long and
     successful career.

it was at this time that my father disappeared. his letters, which had
come to me regularly, ceased. he no longer appeared at our pell street
quarters. our comrades sought him everywhere. through our secret service
we ransacked every prison in the land. but he was lost as completely as
if the earth had swallowed him up, and to this day no clew to his end
has been discovered.*

     * disappearance was one of the horrors of the time.  as a
     motif, in song and story, it constantly crops up.  it was an
     inevitable concomitant of the subterranean warfare that
     raged through those three centuries.  this phenomenon was
     almost as common in the oligarch class and the labor castes,
     as it was in the ranks of the revolutionists.  without
     warning, without trace, men and women, and even children,
     disappeared and were seen no more, their end shrouded in
     mystery.

six lonely months i spent in the refuge, but they were not idle months.
our organization went on apace, and there were mountains of work always
waiting to be done. ernest and his fellow-leaders, from their prisons,
decided what should be done; and it remained for us on the outside to
do it. there was the organization of the mouth-to-mouth propaganda;
the organization, with all its ramifications, of our spy system; the
establishment of our secret printing-presses; and the establishment of
our underground railways, which meant the knitting together of all our
myriads of places of refuge, and the formation of new refuges where
links were missing in the chains we ran over all the land.

so i say, the work was never done. at the end of six months my
loneliness was broken by the arrival of two comrades. they were young
girls, brave souls and passionate lovers of liberty: lora peterson, who
disappeared in 1922, and kate bierce, who later married du bois,* and
who is still with us with eyes lifted to to-morrow's sun, that heralds
in the new age.

     * du bois, the present librarian of ardis, is a lineal
     descendant of this revolutionary pair.

the two girls arrived in a flurry of excitement, danger, and sudden
death. in the crew of the fishing boat that conveyed them across san
pablo bay was a spy. a creature of the iron heel, he had successfully
masqueraded as a revolutionist and penetrated deep into the secrets
of our organization. without doubt he was on my trail, for we had long
since learned that my disappearance had been cause of deep concern to
the secret service of the oligarchy. luckily, as the outcome proved, he
had not divulged his discoveries to any one. he had evidently delayed
reporting, preferring to wait until he had brought things to a
successful conclusion by discovering my hiding-place and capturing me.
his information died with him. under some pretext, after the girls had
landed at petaluma creek and taken to the horses, he managed to get away
from the boat.

part way up sonoma mountain, john carlson let the girls go on, leading
his horse, while he went back on foot. his suspicions had been aroused.
he captured the spy, and as to what then happened, carlson gave us a
fair idea.

“i fixed him,” was carlson's unimaginative way of describing the affair.
“i fixed him,” he repeated, while a sombre light burnt in his eyes, and
his huge, toil-distorted hands opened and closed eloquently. “he made no
noise. i hid him, and tonight i will go back and bury him deep.”

during that period i used to marvel at my own metamorphosis. at times it
seemed impossible, either that i had ever lived a placid, peaceful life
in a college town, or else that i had become a revolutionist inured to
scenes of violence and death. one or the other could not be. one was
real, the other was a dream, but which was which? was this present
life of a revolutionist, hiding in a hole, a nightmare? or was i a
revolutionist who had somewhere, somehow, dreamed that in some former
existence i have lived in berkeley and never known of life more violent
than teas and dances, debating societies, and lectures rooms? but then i
suppose this was a common experience of all of us who had rallied under
the red banner of the brotherhood of man.

i often remembered figures from that other life, and, curiously enough,
they appeared and disappeared, now and again, in my new life. there was
bishop morehouse. in vain we searched for him after our organization had
developed. he had been transferred from asylum to asylum. we traced him
from the state hospital for the insane at napa to the one in stockton,
and from there to the one in the santa clara valley called agnews, and
there the trail ceased. there was no record of his death. in some way he
must have escaped. little did i dream of the awful manner in which i
was to see him once again--the fleeting glimpse of him in the whirlwind
carnage of the chicago commune.

jackson, who had lost his arm in the sierra mills and who had been the
cause of my own conversion into a revolutionist, i never saw again;
but we all knew what he did before he died. he never joined the
revolutionists. embittered by his fate, brooding over his wrongs, he
became an anarchist--not a philosophic anarchist, but a mere animal, mad
with hate and lust for revenge. and well he revenged himself. evading
the guards, in the nighttime while all were asleep, he blew the
pertonwaithe palace into atoms. not a soul escaped, not even the guards.
and in prison, while awaiting trial, he suffocated himself under his
blankets.

dr. hammerfield and dr. ballingford achieved quite different fates from
that of jackson. they have been faithful to their salt, and they have
been correspondingly rewarded with ecclesiastical palaces wherein they
dwell at peace with the world. both are apologists for the oligarchy.
both have grown very fat. “dr. hammerfield,” as ernest once said, “has
succeeded in modifying his metaphysics so as to give god's sanction to
the iron heel, and also to include much worship of beauty and to reduce
to an invisible wraith the gaseous vertebrate described by haeckel--the
difference between dr. hammerfield and dr. ballingford being that the
latter has made the god of the oligarchs a little more gaseous and a
little less vertebrate.”

peter donnelly, the scab foreman at the sierra mills whom i encountered
while investigating the case of jackson, was a surprise to all of us. in
1918 i was present at a meeting of the 'frisco reds. of all our fighting
groups this one was the most formidable, ferocious, and merciless. it
was really not a part of our organization. its members were fanatics,
madmen. we dared not encourage such a spirit. on the other hand, though
they did not belong to us, we remained on friendly terms with them. it
was a matter of vital importance that brought me there that night. i,
alone in the midst of a score of men, was the only person unmasked.
after the business that brought me there was transacted, i was led
away by one of them. in a dark passage this guide struck a match, and,
holding it close to his face, slipped back his mask. for a moment i
gazed upon the passion-wrought features of peter donnelly. then the
match went out.

“i just wanted you to know it was me,” he said in the darkness. “d'you
remember dallas, the superintendent?”

i nodded at recollection of the vulpine-face superintendent of the
sierra mills.

“well, i got him first,” donnelly said with pride. “'twas after that i
joined the reds.”

“but how comes it that you are here?” i queried. “your wife and
children?”

“dead,” he answered. “that's why. no,” he went on hastily, “'tis not
revenge for them. they died easily in their beds--sickness, you see,
one time and another. they tied my arms while they lived. and now that
they're gone, 'tis revenge for my blasted manhood i'm after. i was
once peter donnelly, the scab foreman. but to-night i'm number 27 of the
'frisco reds. come on now, and i'll get you out of this.”

more i heard of him afterward. in his own way he had told the truth
when he said all were dead. but one lived, timothy, and him his father
considered dead because he had taken service with the iron heel in the
mercenaries.* a member of the 'frisco reds pledged himself to twelve
annual executions. the penalty for failure was death. a member who
failed to complete his number committed suicide. these executions were
not haphazard. this group of madmen met frequently and passed wholesale
judgments upon offending members and servitors of the oligarchy. the
executions were afterward apportioned by lot.

     * in addition to the labor castes, there arose another
     caste, the military.  a standing army of professional
     soldiers was created, officered by members of the oligarchy
     and known as the mercenaries. this institution took the
     place of the militia, which had proved impracticable under
     the new regime.  outside the regular secret service of the
     iron heel, there was further established a secret service of
     the mercenaries, this latter forming a connecting link
     between the police and the military.

in fact, the business that brought me there the night of my visit was
such a trial. one of our own comrades, who for years had successfully
maintained himself in a clerical position in the local bureau of the
secret service of the iron heel, had fallen under the ban of the 'frisco
reds and was being tried. of course he was not present, and of course
his judges did not know that he was one of our men. my mission had been
to testify to his identity and loyalty. it may be wondered how we came
to know of the affair at all. the explanation is simple. one of our
secret agents was a member of the 'frisco reds. it was necessary for us
to keep an eye on friend as well as foe, and this group of madmen was
not too unimportant to escape our surveillance.

but to return to peter donnelly and his son. all went well with donnelly
until, in the following year, he found among the sheaf of executions
that fell to him the name of timothy donnelly. then it was that that
clannishness, which was his to so extraordinary a degree, asserted
itself. to save his son, he betrayed his comrades. in this he was
partially blocked, but a dozen of the 'frisco reds were executed, and
the group was well-nigh destroyed. in retaliation, the survivors meted
out to donnelly the death he had earned by his treason.

nor did timothy donnelly long survive. the 'frisco reds pledged
themselves to his execution. every effort was made by the oligarchy to
save him. he was transferred from one part of the country to another.
three of the reds lost their lives in vain efforts to get him. the group
was composed only of men. in the end they fell back on a woman, one
of our comrades, and none other than anna roylston. our inner
circle forbade her, but she had ever a will of her own and disdained
discipline. furthermore, she was a genius and lovable, and we could
never discipline her anyway. she is in a class by herself and not
amenable to the ordinary standards of the revolutionists.

despite our refusal to grant permission to do the deed, she went on with
it. now anna roylston was a fascinating woman. all she had to do was
to beckon a man to her. she broke the hearts of scores of our young
comrades, and scores of others she captured, and by their heart-strings
led into our organization. yet she steadfastly refused to marry. she
dearly loved children, but she held that a child of her own would claim
her from the cause, and that it was the cause to which her life was
devoted.

it was an easy task for anna roylston to win timothy donnelly. her
conscience did not trouble her, for at that very time occurred the
nashville massacre, when the mercenaries, donnelly in command, literally
murdered eight hundred weavers of that city. but she did not kill
donnelly. she turned him over, a prisoner, to the 'frisco reds.
this happened only last year, and now she had been renamed. the
revolutionists everywhere are calling her the “red virgin.” *

     * it was not until the second revolt was crushed, that the
     'frisco reds flourished again.  and for two generations the
     group flourished.  then an agent of the iron heel managed to
     become a member, penetrated all its secrets, and brought
     about its total annihilation.  this occurred in 2002 a.d.
     the members were executed one at a time, at intervals of
     three weeks, and their bodies exposed in the labor-ghetto of
     san francisco.

colonel ingram and colonel van gilbert are two more familiar figures
that i was later to encounter. colonel ingram rose high in the oligarchy
and became minister to germany. he was cordially detested by the
proletariat of both countries. it was in berlin that i met him, where,
as an accredited international spy of the iron heel, i was received by
him and afforded much assistance. incidentally, i may state that in my
dual role i managed a few important things for the revolution.

colonel van gilbert became known as “snarling” van gilbert. his
important part was played in drafting the new code after the chicago
commune. but before that, as trial judge, he had earned sentence of
death by his fiendish malignancy. i was one of those that tried him and
passed sentence upon him. anna roylston carried out the execution.

still another figure arises out of the old life--jackson's lawyer. least
of all would i have expected again to meet this man, joseph hurd. it was
a strange meeting. late at night, two years after the chicago commune,
ernest and i arrived together at the benton harbor refuge. this was
in michigan, across the lake from chicago. we arrived just at the
conclusion of the trial of a spy. sentence of death had been passed, and
he was being led away. such was the scene as we came upon it. the next
moment the wretched man had wrenched free from his captors and flung
himself at my feet, his arms clutching me about the knees in a vicelike
grip as he prayed in a frenzy for mercy. as he turned his agonized face
up to me, i recognized him as joseph hurd. of all the terrible things
i have witnessed, never have i been so unnerved as by this frantic
creature's pleading for life. he was mad for life. it was pitiable. he
refused to let go of me, despite the hands of a dozen comrades. and when
at last he was dragged shrieking away, i sank down fainting upon the
floor. it is far easier to see brave men die than to hear a coward beg
for life.*

     * the benton harbor refuge was a catacomb, the entrance of
     which was cunningly contrived by way of a well.  it has been
     maintained in a fair state of preservation, and the curious
     visitor may to-day tread its labyrinths to the assembly
     hall, where, without doubt, occurred the scene described by
     avis everhard.  farther on are the cells where the prisoners
     were confined, and the death chamber where the executions
     took place.  beyond is the cemetery--long, winding galleries
     hewn out of the solid rock, with recesses on either hand,
     wherein, tier above tier, lie the revolutionists just as
     they were laid away by their comrades long years agone.



chapter xx

a lost oligarch


but in remembering the old life i have run ahead of my story into the
new life. the wholesale jail delivery did not occur until well along
into 1915. complicated as it was, it was carried through without a
hitch, and as a very creditable achievement it cheered us on in our
work. from cuba to california, out of scores of jails, military prisons,
and fortresses, in a single night, we delivered fifty-one of our
fifty-two congressmen, and in addition over three hundred other leaders.
there was not a single instance of miscarriage. not only did they
escape, but every one of them won to the refuges as planned. the one
comrade congressman we did not get was arthur simpson, and he had
already died in cabanas after cruel tortures.

the eighteen months that followed was perhaps the happiest of my life
with ernest. during that time we were never apart. later, when we went
back into the world, we were separated much. not more impatiently do i
await the flame of to-morrow's revolt than did i that night await the
coming of ernest. i had not seen him for so long, and the thought of a
possible hitch or error in our plans that would keep him still in his
island prison almost drove me mad. the hours passed like ages. i was
all alone. biedenbach, and three young men who had been living in the
refuge, were out and over the mountain, heavily armed and prepared for
anything. the refuges all over the land were quite empty, i imagine, of
comrades that night.

just as the sky paled with the first warning of dawn, i heard the
signal from above and gave the answer. in the darkness i almost embraced
biedenbach, who came down first; but the next moment i was in ernest's
arms. and in that moment, so complete had been my transformation, i
discovered it was only by an effort of will that i could be the old avis
everhard, with the old mannerisms and smiles, phrases and intonations of
voice. it was by strong effort only that i was able to maintain my
old identity; i could not allow myself to forget for an instant, so
automatically imperative had become the new personality i had created.

once inside the little cabin, i saw ernest's face in the light. with the
exception of the prison pallor, there was no change in him--at least,
not much. he was my same lover-husband and hero. and yet there was a
certain ascetic lengthening of the lines of his face. but he could well
stand it, for it seemed to add a certain nobility of refinement to the
riotous excess of life that had always marked his features. he might
have been a trifle graver than of yore, but the glint of laughter still
was in his eyes. he was twenty pounds lighter, but in splendid
physical condition. he had kept up exercise during the whole period of
confinement, and his muscles were like iron. in truth, he was in better
condition than when he had entered prison. hours passed before his head
touched pillow and i had soothed him off to sleep. but there was no
sleep for me. i was too happy, and the fatigue of jail-breaking and
riding horseback had not been mine.

while ernest slept, i changed my dress, arranged my hair differently,
and came back to my new automatic self. then, when biedenbach and the
other comrades awoke, with their aid i concocted a little conspiracy.
all was ready, and we were in the cave-room that served for kitchen
and dining room when ernest opened the door and entered. at that moment
biedenbach addressed me as mary, and i turned and answered him. then i
glanced at ernest with curious interest, such as any young comrade might
betray on seeing for the first time so noted a hero of the revolution.
but ernest's glance took me in and questioned impatiently past and
around the room. the next moment i was being introduced to him as mary
holmes.

to complete the deception, an extra plate was laid, and when we sat down
to table one chair was not occupied. i could have cried with joy as i
noted ernest's increasing uneasiness and impatience. finally he could
stand it no longer.

“where's my wife?” he demanded bluntly.

“she is still asleep,” i answered.

it was the crucial moment. but my voice was a strange voice, and in it
he recognized nothing familiar. the meal went on. i talked a great
deal, and enthusiastically, as a hero-worshipper might talk, and it
was obvious that he was my hero. i rose to a climax of enthusiasm and
worship, and, before he could guess my intention, threw my arms around
his neck and kissed him on the lips. he held me from him at arm's length
and stared about in annoyance and perplexity. the four men greeted him
with roars of laughter, and explanations were made. at first he was
sceptical. he scrutinized me keenly and was half convinced, then shook
his head and would not believe. it was not until i became the old avis
everhard and whispered secrets in his ear that none knew but he and avis
everhard, that he accepted me as his really, truly wife.

it was later in the day that he took me in his arms, manifesting great
embarrassment and claiming polygamous emotions.

“you are my avis,” he said, “and you are also some one else. you are two
women, and therefore you are my harem. at any rate, we are safe now.
if the united states becomes too hot for us, why i have qualified for
citizenship in turkey.” *

     * at that time polygamy was still practised in turkey.

life became for me very happy in the refuge. it is true, we worked
hard and for long hours; but we worked together. we had each other for
eighteen precious months, and we were not lonely, for there was always
a coming and going of leaders and comrades--strange voices from the
under-world of intrigue and revolution, bringing stranger tales of
strife and war from all our battle-line. and there was much fun and
delight. we were not mere gloomy conspirators. we toiled hard and
suffered greatly, filled the gaps in our ranks and went on, and through
all the labour and the play and interplay of life and death we found
time to laugh and love. there were artists, scientists, scholars,
musicians, and poets among us; and in that hole in the ground culture
was higher and finer than in the palaces of wonder-cities of the
oligarchs. in truth, many of our comrades toiled at making beautiful
those same palaces and wonder-cities.*

     * this is not braggadocio on the part of avis everhard.  the
     flower of the artistic and intellectual world were
     revolutionists.  with the exception of a few of the
     musicians and singers, and of a few of the oligarchs, all
     the great creators of the period whose names have come down
     to us, were revolutionists.

nor were we confined to the refuge itself. often at night we rode over
the mountains for exercise, and we rode on wickson's horses. if only he
knew how many revolutionists his horses have carried! we even went on
picnics to isolated spots we knew, where we remained all day, going
before daylight and returning after dark. also, we used wickson's cream
and butter,* and ernest was not above shooting wickson's quail and
rabbits, and, on occasion, his young bucks.

     * even as late as that period, cream and butter were still
     crudely extracted from cow's milk.  the laboratory
     preparation of foods had not yet begun.

indeed, it was a safe refuge. i have said that it was discovered only
once, and this brings me to the clearing up of the mystery of the
disappearance of young wickson. now that he is dead, i am free to speak.
there was a nook on the bottom of the great hole where the sun shone for
several hours and which was hidden from above. here we had carried
many loads of gravel from the creek-bed, so that it was dry and warm,
a pleasant basking place; and here, one afternoon, i was drowsing, half
asleep, over a volume of mendenhall.* i was so comfortable and secure
that even his flaming lyrics failed to stir me.

     * in all the extant literature and documents of that period,
     continual reference is made to the poems of rudolph
     mendenhall.  by his comrades he was called “the flame.”  he
     was undoubtedly a great genius; yet, beyond weird and
     haunting fragments of his verse, quoted in the writings of
     others, nothing of his has come down to us.  he was executed
     by the iron heel in 1928 a.d.

i was aroused by a clod of earth striking at my feet. then from above,
i heard a sound of scrambling. the next moment a young man, with a
final slide down the crumbling wall, alighted at my feet. it was philip
wickson, though i did not know him at the time. he looked at me coolly
and uttered a low whistle of surprise.

“well,” he said; and the next moment, cap in hand, he was saying, “i beg
your pardon. i did not expect to find any one here.”

i was not so cool. i was still a tyro so far as concerned knowing how to
behave in desperate circumstances. later on, when i was an international
spy, i should have been less clumsy, i am sure. as it was, i scrambled
to my feet and cried out the danger call.

“why did you do that?” he asked, looking at me searchingly.

it was evident that he had no suspicion of our presence when making the
descent. i recognized this with relief.

“for what purpose do you think i did it?” i countered. i was indeed
clumsy in those days.

“i don't know,” he answered, shaking his head. “unless you've got
friends about. anyway, you've got some explanations to make. i don't
like the look of it. you are trespassing. this is my father's land,
and--”

but at that moment, biedenbach, every polite and gentle, said from
behind him in a low voice, “hands up, my young sir.”

young wickson put his hands up first, then turned to confront
biedenbach, who held a thirty-thirty automatic rifle on him. wickson was
imperturbable.

“oh, ho,” he said, “a nest of revolutionists--and quite a hornet's nest
it would seem. well, you won't abide here long, i can tell you.”

“maybe you'll abide here long enough to reconsider that statement,”
 biedenbach said quietly. “and in the meanwhile i must ask you to come
inside with me.”

“inside?” the young man was genuinely astonished. “have you a catacomb
here? i have heard of such things.”

“come and see,” biedenbach answered with his adorable accent.

“but it is unlawful,” was the protest.

“yes, by your law,” the terrorist replied significantly. “but by our
law, believe me, it is quite lawful. you must accustom yourself to
the fact that you are in another world than the one of oppression and
brutality in which you have lived.”

“there is room for argument there,” wickson muttered.

“then stay with us and discuss it.”

the young fellow laughed and followed his captor into the house. he
was led into the inner cave-room, and one of the young comrades left to
guard him, while we discussed the situation in the kitchen.

biedenbach, with tears in his eyes, held that wickson must die, and was
quite relieved when we outvoted him and his horrible proposition. on the
other hand, we could not dream of allowing the young oligarch to depart.

“i'll tell you what to do,” ernest said. “we'll keep him and give him an
education.”

“i bespeak the privilege, then, of enlightening him in jurisprudence,”
 biedenbach cried.

and so a decision was laughingly reached. we would keep philip wickson
a prisoner and educate him in our ethics and sociology. but in the
meantime there was work to be done. all trace of the young oligarch must
be obliterated. there were the marks he had left when descending the
crumbling wall of the hole. this task fell to biedenbach, and, slung on
a rope from above, he toiled cunningly for the rest of the day till no
sign remained. back up the canyon from the lip of the hole all marks
were likewise removed. then, at twilight, came john carlson, who
demanded wickson's shoes.

the young man did not want to give up his shoes, and even offered to
fight for them, till he felt the horseshoer's strength in ernest's
hands. carlson afterward reported several blisters and much grievous
loss of skin due to the smallness of the shoes, but he succeeded in
doing gallant work with them. back from the lip of the hole, where ended
the young man's obliterated trial, carlson put on the shoes and walked
away to the left. he walked for miles, around knolls, over ridges and
through canyons, and finally covered the trail in the running water of
a creek-bed. here he removed the shoes, and, still hiding trail for a
distance, at last put on his own shoes. a week later wickson got back
his shoes.

that night the hounds were out, and there was little sleep in the
refuge. next day, time and again, the baying hounds came down the
canyon, plunged off to the left on the trail carlson had made for them,
and were lost to ear in the farther canyons high up the mountain. and
all the time our men waited in the refuge, weapons in hand--automatic
revolvers and rifles, to say nothing of half a dozen infernal machines
of biedenbach's manufacture. a more surprised party of rescuers could
not be imagined, had they ventured down into our hiding-place.

i have now given the true disappearance of philip wickson, one-time
oligarch, and, later, comrade in the revolution. for we converted him
in the end. his mind was fresh and plastic, and by nature he was very
ethical. several months later we rode him, on one of his father's
horses, over sonoma mountains to petaluma creek and embarked him in
a small fishing-launch. by easy stages we smuggled him along our
underground railway to the carmel refuge.

there he remained eight months, at the end of which time, for two
reasons, he was loath to leave us. one reason was that he had fallen in
love with anna roylston, and the other was that he had become one of
us. it was not until he became convinced of the hopelessness of his
love affair that he acceded to our wishes and went back to his father.
ostensibly an oligarch until his death, he was in reality one of the
most valuable of our agents. often and often has the iron heel been
dumbfounded by the miscarriage of its plans and operations against us.
if it but knew the number of its own members who are our agents, it
would understand. young wickson never wavered in his loyalty to the
cause. in truth, his very death was incurred by his devotion to duty.
in the great storm of 1927, while attending a meeting of our leaders, he
contracted the pneumonia of which he died.*

     * the case of this young man was not unusual.  many young
     men of the oligarchy, impelled by sense of right conduct, or
     their imaginations captured by the glory of the revolution,
     ethically or romantically devoted their lives to it.  in
     similar way, many sons of the russian nobility played their
     parts in the earlier and protracted revolution in that
     country.


chapter xxi

the roaring abysmal beast


during the long period of our stay in the refuge, we were kept closely
in touch with what was happening in the world without, and we were
learning thoroughly the strength of the oligarchy with which we were
at war. out of the flux of transition the new institutions were
forming more definitely and taking on the appearance and attributes
of permanence. the oligarchs had succeeded in devising a governmental
machine, as intricate as it was vast, that worked--and this despite all
our efforts to clog and hamper.

this was a surprise to many of the revolutionists. they had not
conceived it possible. nevertheless the work of the country went on.
the men toiled in the mines and fields--perforce they were no more than
slaves. as for the vital industries, everything prospered. the members
of the great labor castes were contented and worked on merrily. for the
first time in their lives they knew industrial peace. no more were they
worried by slack times, strike and lockout, and the union label. they
lived in more comfortable homes and in delightful cities of their
own--delightful compared with the slums and ghettos in which they had
formerly dwelt. they had better food to eat, less hours of labor, more
holidays, and a greater amount and variety of interests and pleasures.
and for their less fortunate brothers and sisters, the unfavored
laborers, the driven people of the abyss, they cared nothing. an age
of selfishness was dawning upon mankind. and yet this is not altogether
true. the labor castes were honeycombed by our agents--men whose
eyes saw, beyond the belly-need, the radiant figure of liberty and
brotherhood.

another great institution that had taken form and was working smoothly
was the mercenaries. this body of soldiers had been evolved out of the
old regular army and was now a million strong, to say nothing of the
colonial forces. the mercenaries constituted a race apart. they dwelt in
cities of their own which were practically self-governed, and they
were granted many privileges. by them a large portion of the perplexing
surplus was consumed. they were losing all touch and sympathy with
the rest of the people, and, in fact, were developing their own class
morality and consciousness. and yet we had thousands of our agents among
them.*

     * the mercenaries, in the last days of the iron heel, played
     an important role.  they constituted the balance of power in
     the struggles between the labor castes and the oligarchs,
     and now to one side and now to the other, threw their
     strength according to the play of intrigue and conspiracy.

the oligarchs themselves were going through a remarkable and, it must
be confessed, unexpected development. as a class, they disciplined
themselves. every member had his work to do in the world, and this work
he was compelled to do. there were no more idle-rich young men. their
strength was used to give united strength to the oligarchy. they served
as leaders of troops and as lieutenants and captains of industry.
they found careers in applied science, and many of them became great
engineers. they went into the multitudinous divisions of the government,
took service in the colonial possessions, and by tens of thousands went
into the various secret services. they were, i may say, apprenticed
to education, to art, to the church, to science, to literature; and
in those fields they served the important function of moulding the
thought-processes of the nation in the direction of the perpetuity of
the oligarchy.

they were taught, and later they in turn taught, that what they were
doing was right. they assimilated the aristocratic idea from the moment
they began, as children, to receive impressions of the world. the
aristocratic idea was woven into the making of them until it became bone
of them and flesh of them. they looked upon themselves as wild-animal
trainers, rulers of beasts. from beneath their feet rose always the
subterranean rumbles of revolt. violent death ever stalked in their
midst; bomb and knife and bullet were looked upon as so many fangs
of the roaring abysmal beast they must dominate if humanity were
to persist. they were the saviours of humanity, and they regarded
themselves as heroic and sacrificing laborers for the highest good.

they, as a class, believed that they alone maintained civilization.
it was their belief that if ever they weakened, the great beast would
ingulf them and everything of beauty and wonder and joy and good in its
cavernous and slime-dripping maw. without them, anarchy would reign and
humanity would drop backward into the primitive night out of which it
had so painfully emerged. the horrid picture of anarchy was held
always before their child's eyes until they, in turn, obsessed by this
cultivated fear, held the picture of anarchy before the eyes of the
children that followed them. this was the beast to be stamped upon, and
the highest duty of the aristocrat was to stamp upon it. in short,
they alone, by their unremitting toil and sacrifice, stood between
weak humanity and the all-devouring beast; and they believed it, firmly
believed it.

i cannot lay too great stress upon this high ethical righteousness of
the whole oligarch class. this has been the strength of the iron heel,
and too many of the comrades have been slow or loath to realize it. many
of them have ascribed the strength of the iron heel to its system of
reward and punishment. this is a mistake. heaven and hell may be the
prime factors of zeal in the religion of a fanatic; but for the great
majority of the religious, heaven and hell are incidental to right
and wrong. love of the right, desire for the right, unhappiness with
anything less than the right--in short, right conduct, is the prime
factor of religion. and so with the oligarchy. prisons, banishment and
degradation, honors and palaces and wonder-cities, are all incidental.
the great driving force of the oligarchs is the belief that they are
doing right. never mind the exceptions, and never mind the oppression
and injustice in which the iron heel was conceived. all is granted. the
point is that the strength of the oligarchy today lies in its satisfied
conception of its own righteousness.*

     * out of the ethical incoherency and inconsistency of
     capitalism, the oligarchs emerged with a new ethics,
     coherent and definite, sharp and severe as steel, the most
     absurd and unscientific and at the same time the most potent
     ever possessed by any tyrant class. the oligarchs believed
     their ethics, in spite of the fact that biology and
     evolution gave them the lie; and, because of their faith,
     for three centuries they were able to hold back the mighty
     tide of human progress--a spectacle, profound, tremendous,
     puzzling to the metaphysical moralist, and one that to the
     materialist is the cause of many doubts and
     reconsiderations.

for that matter, the strength of the revolution, during these
frightful twenty years, has resided in nothing else than the sense
of righteousness. in no other way can be explained our sacrifices and
martyrdoms. for no other reason did rudolph mendenhall flame out his
soul for the cause and sing his wild swan-song that last night of life.
for no other reason did hurlbert die under torture, refusing to the last
to betray his comrades. for no other reason has anna roylston refused
blessed motherhood. for no other reason has john carlson been the
faithful and unrewarded custodian of the glen ellen refuge. it does
not matter, young or old, man or woman, high or low, genius or clod,
go where one will among the comrades of the revolution, the motor-force
will be found to be a great and abiding desire for the right.

but i have run away from my narrative. ernest and i well understood,
before we left the refuge, how the strength of the iron heel was
developing. the labor castes, the mercenaries, and the great hordes
of secret agents and police of various sorts were all pledged to the
oligarchy. in the main, and ignoring the loss of liberty, they were
better off than they had been. on the other hand, the great helpless
mass of the population, the people of the abyss, was sinking into a
brutish apathy of content with misery. whenever strong proletarians
asserted their strength in the midst of the mass, they were drawn away
from the mass by the oligarchs and given better conditions by being made
members of the labor castes or of the mercenaries. thus discontent was
lulled and the proletariat robbed of its natural leaders.

the condition of the people of the abyss was pitiable. common school
education, so far as they were concerned, had ceased. they lived
like beasts in great squalid labor-ghettos, festering in misery and
degradation. all their old liberties were gone. they were labor-slaves.
choice of work was denied them. likewise was denied them the right to
move from place to place, or the right to bear or possess arms. they
were not land serfs like the farmers. they were machine-serfs and
labor-serfs. when unusual needs arose for them, such as the building
of the great highways and air-lines, of canals, tunnels, subways, and
fortifications, levies were made on the labor-ghettos, and tens of
thousands of serfs, willy-nilly, were transported to the scene of
operations. great armies of them are toiling now at the building of
ardis, housed in wretched barracks where family life cannot exist, and
where decency is displaced by dull bestiality. in all truth, there in
the labor-ghettos is the roaring abysmal beast the oligarchs fear so
dreadfully--but it is the beast of their own making. in it they will not
let the ape and tiger die.

and just now the word has gone forth that new levies are being imposed
for the building of asgard, the projected wonder-city that will far
exceed ardis when the latter is completed.* we of the revolution will go
on with that great work, but it will not be done by the miserable serfs.
the walls and towers and shafts of that fair city will arise to the
sound of singing, and into its beauty and wonder will be woven, not
sighs and groans, but music and laughter.

     * ardis was completed in 1942 a.d., asgard was not completed
     until 1984 a.d.  it was fifty-two years in the building,
     during which time a permanent army of half a million serfs
     was employed.  at times these numbers swelled to over a
     million--without any account being taken of the hundreds of
     thousands of the labor castes and the artists.

ernest was madly impatient to be out in the world and doing, for our
ill-fated first revolt, that had miscarried in the chicago commune, was
ripening fast. yet he possessed his soul with patience, and during this
time of his torment, when hadly, who had been brought for the purpose
from illinois, made him over into another man* he revolved great plans
in his head for the organization of the learned proletariat, and for the
maintenance of at least the rudiments of education amongst the people of
the abyss--all this of course in the event of the first revolt being a
failure.

     * among the revolutionists were many surgeons, and in
     vivisection they attained marvellous proficiency.  in avis
     everhard's words, they could literally make a man over.  to
     them the elimination of scars and disfigurements was a
     trivial detail.  they changed the features with such
     microscopic care that no traces were left of their
     handiwork.  the nose was a favorite organ to work upon.
     skin-grafting and hair-transplanting were among their
     commonest devices.  the changes in expression they
     accomplished were wizard-like.  eyes and eyebrows, lips,
     mouths, and ears, were radically altered.  by cunning
     operations on tongue, throat, larynx, and nasal cavities a
     man's whole enunciation and manner of speech could be
     changed.  desperate times give need for desperate remedies,
     and the surgeons of the revolution rose to the need.  among
     other things, they could increase an adult's stature by as
     much as four or five inches and decrease it by one or two
     inches.  what they did is to-day a lost art.  we have no
     need for it.

it was not until january, 1917, that we left the refuge. all had been
arranged. we took our place at once as agents-provocateurs in the scheme
of the iron heel. i was supposed to be ernest's sister. by oligarchs and
comrades on the inside who were high in authority, place had been made
for us, we were in possession of all necessary documents, and our pasts
were accounted for. with help on the inside, this was not difficult,
for in that shadow-world of secret service identity was nebulous. like
ghosts the agents came and went, obeying commands, fulfilling duties,
following clews, making their reports often to officers they never saw
or cooperating with other agents they had never seen before and would
never see again.



chapter xxii

the chicago commune


as agents-provocateurs, not alone were we able to travel a great deal,
but our very work threw us in contact with the proletariat and with our
comrades, the revolutionists. thus we were in both camps at the same
time, ostensibly serving the iron heel and secretly working with all
our might for the cause. there were many of us in the various
secret services of the oligarchy, and despite the shakings-up and
reorganizations the secret services have undergone, they have never been
able to weed all of us out.

ernest had largely planned the first revolt, and the date set had been
somewhere early in the spring of 1918. in the fall of 1917 we were not
ready; much remained to be done, and when the revolt was precipitated,
of course it was doomed to failure. the plot of necessity was
frightfully intricate, and anything premature was sure to destroy it.
this the iron heel foresaw and laid its schemes accordingly.

we had planned to strike our first blow at the nervous system of the
oligarchy. the latter had remembered the general strike, and had
guarded against the defection of the telegraphers by installing wireless
stations, in the control of the mercenaries. we, in turn, had countered
this move. when the signal was given, from every refuge, all over the
land, and from the cities, and towns, and barracks, devoted comrades
were to go forth and blow up the wireless stations. thus at the first
shock would the iron heel be brought to earth and lie practically
dismembered.

at the same moment, other comrades were to blow up the bridges and
tunnels and disrupt the whole network of railroads. still further, other
groups of comrades, at the signal, were to seize the officers of the
mercenaries and the police, as well as all oligarchs of unusual ability
or who held executive positions. thus would the leaders of the enemy
be removed from the field of the local battles that would inevitably be
fought all over the land.

many things were to occur simultaneously when the signal went forth. the
canadian and mexican patriots, who were far stronger than the iron heel
dreamed, were to duplicate our tactics. then there were comrades (these
were the women, for the men would be busy elsewhere) who were to post
the proclamations from our secret presses. those of us in the higher
employ of the iron heel were to proceed immediately to make confusion
and anarchy in all our departments. inside the mercenaries were
thousands of our comrades. their work was to blow up the magazines
and to destroy the delicate mechanism of all the war machinery. in the
cities of the mercenaries and of the labor castes similar programmes of
disruption were to be carried out.

in short, a sudden, colossal, stunning blow was to be struck. before the
paralyzed oligarchy could recover itself, its end would have come.
it would have meant terrible times and great loss of life, but no
revolutionist hesitates at such things. why, we even depended much, in
our plan, on the unorganized people of the abyss. they were to be loosed
on the palaces and cities of the masters. never mind the destruction
of life and property. let the abysmal brute roar and the police and
mercenaries slay. the abysmal brute would roar anyway, and the police
and mercenaries would slay anyway. it would merely mean that various
dangers to us were harmlessly destroying one another. in the meantime we
would be doing our own work, largely unhampered, and gaining control of
all the machinery of society.

such was our plan, every detail of which had to be worked out in secret,
and, as the day drew near, communicated to more and more comrades.
this was the danger point, the stretching of the conspiracy. but that
danger-point was never reached. through its spy-system the iron heel
got wind of the revolt and prepared to teach us another of its bloody
lessons. chicago was the devoted city selected for the instruction, and
well were we instructed.

chicago* was the ripest of all--chicago which of old time was the city
of blood and which was to earn anew its name. there the revolutionary
spirit was strong. too many bitter strikes had been curbed there in the
days of capitalism for the workers to forget and forgive. even the
labor castes of the city were alive with revolt. too many heads had
been broken in the early strikes. despite their changed and favorable
conditions, their hatred for the master class had not died. this spirit
had infected the mercenaries, of which three regiments in particular
were ready to come over to us en masse.

     * chicago was the industrial inferno of the nineteenth
     century a.d. a curious anecdote has come down to us of john
     burns, a great english labor leader and one time member of
     the british cabinet. in chicago, while on a visit to the
     united states, he was asked by a newspaper reporter for his
     opinion of that city.  “chicago,” he answered, “is a pocket
     edition of hell.”  some time later, as he was going aboard
     his steamer to sail to england, he was approached by another
     reporter, who wanted to know if he had changed his opinion
     of chicago.  “yes, i have,” was his reply.  “my present
     opinion is that hell is a pocket edition of chicago.”

chicago had always been the storm-centre of the conflict between
labor and capital, a city of street-battles and violent death, with a
class-conscious capitalist organization and a class-conscious workman
organization, where, in the old days, the very school-teachers were
formed into labor unions and affiliated with the hod-carriers and
brick-layers in the american federation of labor. and chicago became the
storm-centre of the premature first revolt.

the trouble was precipitated by the iron heel. it was cleverly done. the
whole population, including the favored labor castes, was given a course
of outrageous treatment. promises and agreements were broken, and most
drastic punishments visited upon even petty offenders. the people of
the abyss were tormented out of their apathy. in fact, the iron heel was
preparing to make the abysmal beast roar. and hand in hand with this, in
all precautionary measures in chicago, the iron heel was inconceivably
careless. discipline was relaxed among the mercenaries that remained,
while many regiments had been withdrawn and sent to various parts of the
country.

it did not take long to carry out this programme--only several weeks. we
of the revolution caught vague rumors of the state of affairs, but had
nothing definite enough for an understanding. in fact, we thought it was
a spontaneous spirit of revolt that would require careful curbing on our
part, and never dreamed that it was deliberately manufactured--and it
had been manufactured so secretly, from the very innermost circle of
the iron heel, that we had got no inkling. the counter-plot was an able
achievement, and ably carried out.

i was in new york when i received the order to proceed immediately to
chicago. the man who gave me the order was one of the oligarchs, i could
tell that by his speech, though i did not know his name nor see his
face. his instructions were too clear for me to make a mistake. plainly
i read between the lines that our plot had been discovered, that we had
been countermined. the explosion was ready for the flash of powder, and
countless agents of the iron heel, including me, either on the ground
or being sent there, were to supply that flash. i flatter myself that i
maintained my composure under the keen eye of the oligarch, but my heart
was beating madly. i could almost have shrieked and flown at his throat
with my naked hands before his final, cold-blooded instructions were
given.

once out of his presence, i calculated the time. i had just the moments
to spare, if i were lucky, to get in touch with some local leader before
catching my train. guarding against being trailed, i made a rush of it
for the emergency hospital. luck was with me, and i gained access at
once to comrade galvin, the surgeon-in-chief. i started to gasp out my
information, but he stopped me.

“i already know,” he said quietly, though his irish eyes were flashing.
“i knew what you had come for. i got the word fifteen minutes ago, and i
have already passed it along. everything shall be done here to keep the
comrades quiet. chicago is to be sacrificed, but it shall be chicago
alone.”

“have you tried to get word to chicago?” i asked.

he shook his head. “no telegraphic communication. chicago is shut off.
it's going to be hell there.”

he paused a moment, and i saw his white hands clinch. then he burst out:

“by god! i wish i were going to be there!”

“there is yet a chance to stop it,” i said, “if nothing happens to
the train and i can get there in time. or if some of the other
secret-service comrades who have learned the truth can get there in
time.”

“you on the inside were caught napping this time,” he said.

i nodded my head humbly.

“it was very secret,” i answered. “only the inner chiefs could have
known up to to-day. we haven't yet penetrated that far, so we couldn't
escape being kept in the dark. if only ernest were here. maybe he is in
chicago now, and all is well.”

dr. galvin shook his head. “the last news i heard of him was that he had
been sent to boston or new haven. this secret service for the enemy must
hamper him a lot, but it's better than lying in a refuge.”

i started to go, and galvin wrung my hand.

“keep a stout heart,” were his parting words. “what if the first revolt
is lost? there will be a second, and we will be wiser then. good-by and
good luck. i don't know whether i'll ever see you again. it's going to
be hell there, but i'd give ten years of my life for your chance to be
in it.”

the twentieth century* left new york at six in the evening, and was
supposed to arrive at chicago at seven next morning. but it lost time
that night. we were running behind another train. among the travellers
in my pullman was comrade hartman, like myself in the secret service
of the iron heel. he it was who told me of the train that immediately
preceded us. it was an exact duplicate of our train, though it contained
no passengers. the idea was that the empty train should receive the
disaster were an attempt made to blow up the twentieth century. for that
matter there were very few people on the train--only a baker's dozen in
our car.

     * this was reputed to be the fastest train in the world
     then.  it was quite a famous train.

“there must be some big men on board,” hartman concluded. “i noticed a
private car on the rear.”

night had fallen when we made our first change of engine, and i walked
down the platform for a breath of fresh air and to see what i could see.
through the windows of the private car i caught a glimpse of three
men whom i recognized. hartman was right. one of the men was general
altendorff; and the other two were mason and vanderbold, the brains of
the inner circle of the oligarchy's secret service.

it was a quiet moonlight night, but i tossed restlessly and could not
sleep. at five in the morning i dressed and abandoned my bed.

i asked the maid in the dressing-room how late the train was, and she
told me two hours. she was a mulatto woman, and i noticed that her
face was haggard, with great circles under the eyes, while the eyes
themselves were wide with some haunting fear.

“what is the matter?” i asked.

“nothing, miss; i didn't sleep well, i guess,” was her reply.

i looked at her closely, and tried her with one of our signals. she
responded, and i made sure of her.

“something terrible is going to happen in chicago,” she said. “there's
that fake* train in front of us. that and the troop-trains have made us
late.”

     * false.

“troop-trains?” i queried.

she nodded her head. “the line is thick with them. we've been passing
them all night. and they're all heading for chicago. and bringing them
over the air-line--that means business.

“i've a lover in chicago,” she added apologetically. “he's one of us,
and he's in the mercenaries, and i'm afraid for him.”

poor girl. her lover was in one of the three disloyal regiments.

hartman and i had breakfast together in the dining car, and i forced
myself to eat. the sky had clouded, and the train rushed on like a
sullen thunderbolt through the gray pall of advancing day. the very
negroes that waited on us knew that something terrible was impending.
oppression sat heavily upon them; the lightness of their natures had
ebbed out of them; they were slack and absent-minded in their service,
and they whispered gloomily to one another in the far end of the car
next to the kitchen. hartman was hopeless over the situation.

“what can we do?” he demanded for the twentieth time, with a helpless
shrug of the shoulders.

he pointed out of the window. “see, all is ready. you can depend upon it
that they're holding them like this, thirty or forty miles outside the
city, on every road.”

he had reference to troop-trains on the side-track. the soldiers were
cooking their breakfasts over fires built on the ground beside the
track, and they looked up curiously at us as we thundered past without
slackening our terrific speed.

all was quiet as we entered chicago. it was evident nothing had happened
yet. in the suburbs the morning papers came on board the train. there
was nothing in them, and yet there was much in them for those skilled
in reading between the lines that it was intended the ordinary reader
should read into the text. the fine hand of the iron heel was apparent
in every column. glimmerings of weakness in the armor of the oligarchy
were given. of course, there was nothing definite. it was intended that
the reader should feel his way to these glimmerings. it was
cleverly done. as fiction, those morning papers of october 27th were
masterpieces.

the local news was missing. this in itself was a masterstroke. it
shrouded chicago in mystery, and it suggested to the average chicago
reader that the oligarchy did not dare give the local news. hints that
were untrue, of course, were given of insubordination all over the land,
crudely disguised with complacent references to punitive measures to be
taken. there were reports of numerous wireless stations that had
been blown up, with heavy rewards offered for the detection of the
perpetrators. of course no wireless stations had been blown up. many
similar outrages, that dovetailed with the plot of the revolutionists,
were given. the impression to be made on the minds of the chicago
comrades was that the general revolt was beginning, albeit with a
confusing miscarriage in many details. it was impossible for one
uninformed to escape the vague yet certain feeling that all the land was
ripe for the revolt that had already begun to break out.

it was reported that the defection of the mercenaries in california had
become so serious that half a dozen regiments had been disbanded and
broken, and that their members with their families had been driven
from their own city and on into the labor-ghettos. and the california
mercenaries were in reality the most faithful of all to their salt!
but how was chicago, shut off from the rest of the world, to know? then
there was a ragged telegram describing an outbreak of the populace in
new york city, in which the labor castes were joining, concluding with
the statement (intended to be accepted as a bluff*) that the troops had
the situation in hand.

     * a lie.

and as the oligarchs had done with the morning papers, so had they done
in a thousand other ways. these we learned afterward, as, for example,
the secret messages of the oligarchs, sent with the express purpose of
leaking to the ears of the revolutionists, that had come over the wires,
now and again, during the first part of the night.

“i guess the iron heel won't need our services,” hartman remarked,
putting down the paper he had been reading, when the train pulled into
the central depot. “they wasted their time sending us here. their plans
have evidently prospered better than they expected. hell will break
loose any second now.”

he turned and looked down the train as we alighted.

“i thought so,” he muttered. “they dropped that private car when the
papers came aboard.”

hartman was hopelessly depressed. i tried to cheer him up, but he
ignored my effort and suddenly began talking very hurriedly, in a
low voice, as we passed through the station. at first i could not
understand.

“i have not been sure,” he was saying, “and i have told no one. i have
been working on it for weeks, and i cannot make sure. watch out for
knowlton. i suspect him. he knows the secrets of a score of our refuges.
he carries the lives of hundreds of us in his hands, and i think he is
a traitor. it's more a feeling on my part than anything else. but i
thought i marked a change in him a short while back. there is the danger
that he has sold us out, or is going to sell us out. i am almost sure
of it. i wouldn't whisper my suspicions to a soul, but, somehow, i don't
think i'll leave chicago alive. keep your eye on knowlton. trap him.
find out. i don't know anything more. it is only an intuition, and so
far i have failed to find the slightest clew.” we were just stepping out
upon the sidewalk. “remember,” hartman concluded earnestly. “keep your
eyes upon knowlton.”

and hartman was right. before a month went by knowlton paid for his
treason with his life. he was formally executed by the comrades in
milwaukee.

all was quiet on the streets--too quiet. chicago lay dead. there was no
roar and rumble of traffic. there were not even cabs on the streets. the
surface cars and the elevated were not running. only occasionally, on
the sidewalks, were there stray pedestrians, and these pedestrians did
not loiter. they went their ways with great haste and definiteness,
withal there was a curious indecision in their movements, as though they
expected the buildings to topple over on them or the sidewalks to sink
under their feet or fly up in the air. a few gamins, however, were
around, in their eyes a suppressed eagerness in anticipation of
wonderful and exciting things to happen.

from somewhere, far to the south, the dull sound of an explosion came to
our ears. that was all. then quiet again, though the gamins had startled
and listened, like young deer, at the sound. the doorways to all the
buildings were closed; the shutters to the shops were up. but there
were many police and watchmen in evidence, and now and again automobile
patrols of the mercenaries slipped swiftly past.

hartman and i agreed that it was useless to report ourselves to the
local chiefs of the secret service. our failure so to report would be
excused, we knew, in the light of subsequent events. so we headed for
the great labor-ghetto on the south side in the hope of getting in
contact with some of the comrades. too late! we knew it. but we could
not stand still and do nothing in those ghastly, silent streets. where
was ernest? i was wondering. what was happening in the cities of the
labor castes and mercenaries? in the fortresses?

as if in answer, a great screaming roar went up, dim with distance,
punctuated with detonation after detonation.

“it's the fortresses,” hartman said. “god pity those three regiments!”

at a crossing we noticed, in the direction of the stockyards, a gigantic
pillar of smoke. at the next crossing several similar smoke pillars were
rising skyward in the direction of the west side. over the city of the
mercenaries we saw a great captive war-balloon that burst even as we
looked at it, and fell in flaming wreckage toward the earth. there was
no clew to that tragedy of the air. we could not determine whether the
balloon had been manned by comrades or enemies. a vague sound came to
our ears, like the bubbling of a gigantic caldron a long way off, and
hartman said it was machine-guns and automatic rifles.

and still we walked in immediate quietude. nothing was happening where
we were. the police and the automobile patrols went by, and once half
a dozen fire-engines, returning evidently from some conflagration. a
question was called to the fireman by an officer in an automobile, and
we heard one shout in reply: “no water! they've blown up the mains!”

“we've smashed the water supply,” hartman cried excitedly to me. “if we
can do all this in a premature, isolated, abortive attempt, what can't
we do in a concerted, ripened effort all over the land?”

the automobile containing the officer who had asked the question darted
on. suddenly there was a deafening roar. the machine, with its human
freight, lifted in an upburst of smoke, and sank down a mass of wreckage
and death.

hartman was jubilant. “well done! well done!” he was repeating, over
and over, in a whisper. “the proletariat gets its lesson to-day, but it
gives one, too.”

police were running for the spot. also, another patrol machine had
halted. as for myself, i was in a daze. the suddenness of it was
stunning. how had it happened? i knew not how, and yet i had been
looking directly at it. so dazed was i for the moment that i was
scarcely aware of the fact that we were being held up by the police. i
abruptly saw that a policeman was in the act of shooting hartman. but
hartman was cool and was giving the proper passwords. i saw the levelled
revolver hesitate, then sink down, and heard the disgusted grunt of the
policeman. he was very angry, and was cursing the whole secret service.
it was always in the way, he was averring, while hartman was talking
back to him and with fitting secret-service pride explaining to him the
clumsiness of the police.

the next moment i knew how it had happened. there was quite a group
about the wreck, and two men were just lifting up the wounded officer
to carry him to the other machine. a panic seized all of them, and
they scattered in every direction, running in blind terror, the wounded
officer, roughly dropped, being left behind. the cursing policeman
alongside of me also ran, and hartman and i ran, too, we knew not why,
obsessed with the same blind terror to get away from that particular
spot.

nothing really happened then, but everything was explained. the flying
men were sheepishly coming back, but all the while their eyes were
raised apprehensively to the many-windowed, lofty buildings that towered
like the sheer walls of a canyon on each side of the street. from one
of those countless windows the bomb had been thrown, but which window?
there had been no second bomb, only a fear of one.

thereafter we looked with speculative comprehension at the windows.
any of them contained possible death. each building was a possible
ambuscade. this was warfare in that modern jungle, a great city. every
street was a canyon, every building a mountain. we had not changed much
from primitive man, despite the war automobiles that were sliding by.

turning a corner, we came upon a woman. she was lying on the pavement,
in a pool of blood. hartman bent over and examined her. as for myself,
i turned deathly sick. i was to see many dead that day, but the total
carnage was not to affect me as did this first forlorn body lying
there at my feet abandoned on the pavement. “shot in the breast,” was
hartman's report. clasped in the hollow of her arm, as a child might be
clasped, was a bundle of printed matter. even in death she seemed loath
to part with that which had caused her death; for when hartman had
succeeded in withdrawing the bundle, we found that it consisted of large
printed sheets, the proclamations of the revolutionists.

“a comrade,” i said.

but hartman only cursed the iron heel, and we passed on. often we
were halted by the police and patrols, but our passwords enabled us
to proceed. no more bombs fell from the windows, the last pedestrians
seemed to have vanished from the streets, and our immediate quietude
grew more profound; though the gigantic caldron continued to bubble in
the distance, dull roars of explosions came to us from all directions,
and the smoke-pillars were towering more ominously in the heavens.



chapter xxiii

the people of the abyss


suddenly a change came over the face of things. a tingle of excitement
ran along the air. automobiles fled past, two, three, a dozen, and from
them warnings were shouted to us. one of the machines swerved wildly
at high speed half a block down, and the next moment, already left well
behind it, the pavement was torn into a great hole by a bursting bomb.
we saw the police disappearing down the cross-streets on the run, and
knew that something terrible was coming. we could hear the rising roar
of it.

“our brave comrades are coming,” hartman said.

we could see the front of their column filling the street from gutter to
gutter, as the last war-automobile fled past. the machine stopped for a
moment just abreast of us. a soldier leaped from it, carrying something
carefully in his hands. this, with the same care, he deposited in the
gutter. then he leaped back to his seat and the machine dashed on, took
the turn at the corner, and was gone from sight. hartman ran to the
gutter and stooped over the object.

“keep back,” he warned me.

i could see he was working rapidly with his hands. when he returned to
me the sweat was heavy on his forehead.

“i disconnected it,” he said, “and just in the nick of time. the soldier
was clumsy. he intended it for our comrades, but he didn't give it
enough time. it would have exploded prematurely. now it won't explode at
all.”

everything was happening rapidly now. across the street and half a block
down, high up in a building, i could see heads peering out. i had just
pointed them out to hartman, when a sheet of flame and smoke ran along
that portion of the face of the building where the heads had appeared,
and the air was shaken by the explosion. in places the stone facing of
the building was torn away, exposing the iron construction beneath. the
next moment similar sheets of flame and smoke smote the front of the
building across the street opposite it. between the explosions we could
hear the rattle of the automatic pistols and rifles. for several minutes
this mid-air battle continued, then died out. it was patent that our
comrades were in one building, that mercenaries were in the other, and
that they were fighting across the street. but we could not tell
which was which--which building contained our comrades and which the
mercenaries.

by this time the column on the street was almost on us. as the front of
it passed under the warring buildings, both went into action again--one
building dropping bombs into the street, being attacked from across the
street, and in return replying to that attack. thus we learned which
building was held by our comrades, and they did good work, saving those
in the street from the bombs of the enemy.

hartman gripped my arm and dragged me into a wide entrance.

“they're not our comrades,” he shouted in my ear.

the inner doors to the entrance were locked and bolted. we could not
escape. the next moment the front of the column went by. it was not a
column, but a mob, an awful river that filled the street, the people
of the abyss, mad with drink and wrong, up at last and roaring for the
blood of their masters. i had seen the people of the abyss before, gone
through its ghettos, and thought i knew it; but i found that i was now
looking on it for the first time. dumb apathy had vanished. it was now
dynamic--a fascinating spectacle of dread. it surged past my vision in
concrete waves of wrath, snarling and growling, carnivorous, drunk with
whiskey from pillaged warehouses, drunk with hatred, drunk with lust
for blood--men, women, and children, in rags and tatters, dim ferocious
intelligences with all the godlike blotted from their features and all
the fiendlike stamped in, apes and tigers, anaemic consumptives and
great hairy beasts of burden, wan faces from which vampire society had
sucked the juice of life, bloated forms swollen with physical grossness
and corruption, withered hags and death's-heads bearded like patriarchs,
festering youth and festering age, faces of fiends, crooked, twisted,
misshapen monsters blasted with the ravages of disease and all the
horrors of chronic innutrition--the refuse and the scum of life, a
raging, screaming, screeching, demoniacal horde.

and why not? the people of the abyss had nothing to lose but the misery
and pain of living. and to gain?--nothing, save one final, awful glut of
vengeance. and as i looked the thought came to me that in that rushing
stream of human lava were men, comrades and heroes, whose mission had
been to rouse the abysmal beast and to keep the enemy occupied in coping
with it.

and now a strange thing happened to me. a transformation came over me.
the fear of death, for myself and for others, left me. i was strangely
exalted, another being in another life. nothing mattered. the cause for
this one time was lost, but the cause would be here to-morrow, the
same cause, ever fresh and ever burning. and thereafter, in the orgy
of horror that raged through the succeeding hours, i was able to take
a calm interest. death meant nothing, life meant nothing. i was an
interested spectator of events, and, sometimes swept on by the rush,
was myself a curious participant. for my mind had leaped to a star-cool
altitude and grasped a passionless transvaluation of values. had it not
done this, i know that i should have died.

half a mile of the mob had swept by when we were discovered. a woman
in fantastic rags, with cheeks cavernously hollow and with narrow black
eyes like burning gimlets, caught a glimpse of hartman and me. she
let out a shrill shriek and bore in upon us. a section of the mob tore
itself loose and surged in after her. i can see her now, as i write
these lines, a leap in advance, her gray hair flying in thin tangled
strings, the blood dripping down her forehead from some wound in the
scalp, in her right hand a hatchet, her left hand, lean and wrinkled, a
yellow talon, gripping the air convulsively. hartman sprang in front of
me. this was no time for explanations. we were well dressed, and that
was enough. his fist shot out, striking the woman between her burning
eyes. the impact of the blow drove her backward, but she struck the wall
of her on-coming fellows and bounced forward again, dazed and helpless,
the brandished hatchet falling feebly on hartman's shoulder.

the next moment i knew not what was happening. i was overborne by the
crowd. the confined space was filled with shrieks and yells and curses.
blows were falling on me. hands were ripping and tearing at my flesh
and garments. i felt that i was being torn to pieces. i was being borne
down, suffocated. some strong hand gripped my shoulder in the thick of
the press and was dragging fiercely at me. between pain and pressure i
fainted. hartman never came out of that entrance. he had shielded me and
received the first brunt of the attack. this had saved me, for the jam
had quickly become too dense for anything more than the mad gripping and
tearing of hands.

i came to in the midst of wild movement. all about me was the same
movement. i had been caught up in a monstrous flood that was sweeping me
i knew not whither. fresh air was on my cheek and biting sweetly in my
lungs. faint and dizzy, i was vaguely aware of a strong arm around my
body under the arms, and half-lifting me and dragging me along. feebly
my own limbs were helping me. in front of me i could see the moving back
of a man's coat. it had been slit from top to bottom along the centre
seam, and it pulsed rhythmically, the slit opening and closing regularly
with every leap of the wearer. this phenomenon fascinated me for a time,
while my senses were coming back to me. next i became aware of stinging
cheeks and nose, and could feel blood dripping on my face. my hat was
gone. my hair was down and flying, and from the stinging of the scalp i
managed to recollect a hand in the press of the entrance that had torn
at my hair. my chest and arms were bruised and aching in a score of
places.

my brain grew clearer, and i turned as i ran and looked at the man who
was holding me up. he it was who had dragged me out and saved me. he
noticed my movement.

“it's all right!” he shouted hoarsely. “i knew you on the instant.”

i failed to recognize him, but before i could speak i trod upon
something that was alive and that squirmed under my foot. i was swept on
by those behind and could not look down and see, and yet i knew that it
was a woman who had fallen and who was being trampled into the pavement
by thousands of successive feet.

“it's all right,” he repeated. “i'm garthwaite.”

he was bearded and gaunt and dirty, but i succeeded in remembering him
as the stalwart youth that had spent several months in our glen ellen
refuge three years before. he passed me the signals of the iron heel's
secret service, in token that he, too, was in its employ.

“i'll get you out of this as soon as i can get a chance,” he assured me.
“but watch your footing. on your life don't stumble and go down.”

all things happened abruptly on that day, and with an abruptness that
was sickening the mob checked itself. i came in violent collision with
a large woman in front of me (the man with the split coat had vanished),
while those behind collided against me. a devilish pandemonium
reigned,--shrieks, curses, and cries of death, while above all rose the
churning rattle of machine-guns and the put-a-put, put-a-put of rifles.
at first i could make out nothing. people were falling about me right
and left. the woman in front doubled up and went down, her hands on her
abdomen in a frenzied clutch. a man was quivering against my legs in a
death-struggle.

it came to me that we were at the head of the column. half a mile of it
had disappeared--where or how i never learned. to this day i do not know
what became of that half-mile of humanity--whether it was blotted out
by some frightful bolt of war, whether it was scattered and destroyed
piecemeal, or whether it escaped. but there we were, at the head of the
column instead of in its middle, and we were being swept out of life by
a torrent of shrieking lead.

as soon as death had thinned the jam, garthwaite, still grasping my arm,
led a rush of survivors into the wide entrance of an office building.
here, at the rear, against the doors, we were pressed by a panting,
gasping mass of creatures. for some time we remained in this position
without a change in the situation.

“i did it beautifully,” garthwaite was lamenting to me. “ran you right
into a trap. we had a gambler's chance in the street, but in here
there is no chance at all. it's all over but the shouting. vive la
revolution!”

then, what he expected, began. the mercenaries were killing without
quarter. at first, the surge back upon us was crushing, but as the
killing continued the pressure was eased. the dead and dying went down
and made room. garthwaite put his mouth to my ear and shouted, but in
the frightful din i could not catch what he said. he did not wait. he
seized me and threw me down. next he dragged a dying woman over on top
of me, and, with much squeezing and shoving, crawled in beside me and
partly over me. a mound of dead and dying began to pile up over us, and
over this mound, pawing and moaning, crept those that still survived.
but these, too, soon ceased, and a semi-silence settled down, broken by
groans and sobs and sounds of strangulation.

i should have been crushed had it not been for garthwaite. as it was,
it seemed inconceivable that i could bear the weight i did and live. and
yet, outside of pain, the only feeling i possessed was one of curiosity.
how was it going to end? what would death be like? thus did i receive
my red baptism in that chicago shambles. prior to that, death to me had
been a theory; but ever afterward death has been a simple fact that does
not matter, it is so easy.

but the mercenaries were not content with what they had done. they
invaded the entrance, killing the wounded and searching out the unhurt
that, like ourselves, were playing dead. i remember one man they dragged
out of a heap, who pleaded abjectly until a revolver shot cut him short.
then there was a woman who charged from a heap, snarling and shooting.
she fired six shots before they got her, though what damage she did we
could not know. we could follow these tragedies only by the sound. every
little while flurries like this occurred, each flurry culminating in the
revolver shot that put an end to it. in the intervals we could hear
the soldiers talking and swearing as they rummaged among the carcasses,
urged on by their officers to hurry up.

at last they went to work on our heap, and we could feel the pressure
diminish as they dragged away the dead and wounded. garthwaite began
uttering aloud the signals. at first he was not heard. then he raised
his voice.

“listen to that,” we heard a soldier say. and next the sharp voice of an
officer. “hold on there! careful as you go!”

oh, that first breath of air as we were dragged out! garthwaite did the
talking at first, but i was compelled to undergo a brief examination to
prove service with the iron heel.

“agents-provocateurs all right,” was the officer's conclusion. he was
a beardless young fellow, a cadet, evidently, of some great oligarch
family.

“it's a hell of a job,” garthwaite grumbled. “i'm going to try and
resign and get into the army. you fellows have a snap.”

“you've earned it,” was the young officer's answer. “i've got some pull,
and i'll see if it can be managed. i can tell them how i found you.”

he took garthwaite's name and number, then turned to me.

“and you?”

“oh, i'm going to be married,” i answered lightly, “and then i'll be out
of it all.”

and so we talked, while the killing of the wounded went on. it is all
a dream, now, as i look back on it; but at the time it was the most
natural thing in the world. garthwaite and the young officer fell into
an animated conversation over the difference between so-called modern
warfare and the present street-fighting and sky-scraper fighting that
was taking place all over the city. i followed them intently, fixing up
my hair at the same time and pinning together my torn skirts. and all
the time the killing of the wounded went on. sometimes the revolver
shots drowned the voices of garthwaite and the officer, and they were
compelled to repeat what they had been saying.

i lived through three days of the chicago commune, and the vastness of
it and of the slaughter may be imagined when i say that in all that time
i saw practically nothing outside the killing of the people of the abyss
and the mid-air fighting between sky-scrapers. i really saw nothing of
the heroic work done by the comrades. i could hear the explosions of
their mines and bombs, and see the smoke of their conflagrations, and
that was all. the mid-air part of one great deed i saw, however, and
that was the balloon attacks made by our comrades on the fortresses.
that was on the second day. the three disloyal regiments had been
destroyed in the fortresses to the last man. the fortresses were crowded
with mercenaries, the wind blew in the right direction, and up went our
balloons from one of the office buildings in the city.

now biedenbach, after he left glen ellen, had invented a most powerful
explosive--“expedite” he called it. this was the weapon the balloons
used. they were only hot-air balloons, clumsily and hastily made, but
they did the work. i saw it all from the top of an office building. the
first balloon missed the fortresses completely and disappeared into the
country; but we learned about it afterward. burton and o'sullivan were
in it. as they were descending they swept across a railroad directly
over a troop-train that was heading at full speed for chicago. they
dropped their whole supply of expedite upon the locomotive. the
resulting wreck tied the line up for days. and the best of it was that,
released from the weight of expedite, the balloon shot up into the
air and did not come down for half a dozen miles, both heroes escaping
unharmed.

the second balloon was a failure. its flight was lame. it floated too
low and was shot full of holes before it could reach the fortresses.
herford and guinness were in it, and they were blown to pieces along
with the field into which they fell. biedenbach was in despair--we heard
all about it afterward--and he went up alone in the third balloon. he,
too, made a low flight, but he was in luck, for they failed seriously to
puncture his balloon. i can see it now as i did then, from the lofty top
of the building--that inflated bag drifting along the air, and that tiny
speck of a man clinging on beneath. i could not see the fortress, but
those on the roof with me said he was directly over it. i did not
see the expedite fall when he cut it loose. but i did see the balloon
suddenly leap up into the sky. an appreciable time after that the great
column of the explosion towered in the air, and after that, in turn, i
heard the roar of it. biedenbach the gentle had destroyed a fortress.
two other balloons followed at the same time. one was blown to pieces
in the air, the expedite exploding, and the shock of it disrupted the
second balloon, which fell prettily into the remaining fortress.
it couldn't have been better planned, though the two comrades in it
sacrificed their lives.

but to return to the people of the abyss. my experiences were confined
to them. they raged and slaughtered and destroyed all over the city
proper, and were in turn destroyed; but never once did they succeed in
reaching the city of the oligarchs over on the west side. the oligarchs
had protected themselves well. no matter what destruction was wreaked in
the heart of the city, they, and their womenkind and children, were to
escape hurt. i am told that their children played in the parks during
those terrible days and that their favorite game was an imitation of
their elders stamping upon the proletariat.

but the mercenaries found it no easy task to cope with the people of the
abyss and at the same time fight with the comrades. chicago was true to
her traditions, and though a generation of revolutionists was wiped out,
it took along with it pretty close to a generation of its enemies.
of course, the iron heel kept the figures secret, but, at a very
conservative estimate, at least one hundred and thirty thousand
mercenaries were slain. but the comrades had no chance. instead of the
whole country being hand in hand in revolt, they were all alone, and the
total strength of the oligarchy could have been directed against them
if necessary. as it was, hour after hour, day after day, in endless
train-loads, by hundreds of thousands, the mercenaries were hurled into
chicago.

and there were so many of the people of the abyss! tiring of the
slaughter, a great herding movement was begun by the soldiers, the
intent of which was to drive the street mobs, like cattle, into lake
michigan. it was at the beginning of this movement that garthwaite and i
had encountered the young officer. this herding movement was practically
a failure, thanks to the splendid work of the comrades. instead of the
great host the mercenaries had hoped to gather together, they succeeded
in driving no more than forty thousand of the wretches into the lake.
time and again, when a mob of them was well in hand and being driven
along the streets to the water, the comrades would create a diversion,
and the mob would escape through the consequent hole torn in the
encircling net.

garthwaite and i saw an example of this shortly after meeting with the
young officer. the mob of which we had been a part, and which had been
put in retreat, was prevented from escaping to the south and east by
strong bodies of troops. the troops we had fallen in with had held it
back on the west. the only outlet was north, and north it went toward
the lake, driven on from east and west and south by machine-gun fire and
automatics. whether it divined that it was being driven toward the lake,
or whether it was merely a blind squirm of the monster, i do not know;
but at any rate the mob took a cross street to the west, turned down
the next street, and came back upon its track, heading south toward the
great ghetto.

garthwaite and i at that time were trying to make our way westward to
get out of the territory of street-fighting, and we were caught right in
the thick of it again. as we came to the corner we saw the howling mob
bearing down upon us. garthwaite seized my arm and we were just starting
to run, when he dragged me back from in front of the wheels of half a
dozen war automobiles, equipped with machine-guns, that were rushing for
the spot. behind them came the soldiers with their automatic rifles.
by the time they took position, the mob was upon them, and it looked as
though they would be overwhelmed before they could get into action.

here and there a soldier was discharging his rifle, but this scattered
fire had no effect in checking the mob. on it came, bellowing with brute
rage. it seemed the machine-guns could not get started. the automobiles
on which they were mounted blocked the street, compelling the soldiers
to find positions in, between, and on the sidewalks. more and more
soldiers were arriving, and in the jam we were unable to get away.
garthwaite held me by the arm, and we pressed close against the front of
a building.

the mob was no more than twenty-five feet away when the machine-guns
opened up; but before that flaming sheet of death nothing could live.
the mob came on, but it could not advance. it piled up in a heap, a
mound, a huge and growing wave of dead and dying. those behind urged on,
and the column, from gutter to gutter, telescoped upon itself. wounded
creatures, men and women, were vomited over the top of that awful wave
and fell squirming down the face of it till they threshed about under
the automobiles and against the legs of the soldiers. the latter
bayoneted the struggling wretches, though one i saw who gained his feet
and flew at a soldier's throat with his teeth. together they went down,
soldier and slave, into the welter.

the firing ceased. the work was done. the mob had been stopped in its
wild attempt to break through. orders were being given to clear the
wheels of the war-machines. they could not advance over that wave of
dead, and the idea was to run them down the cross street. the soldiers
were dragging the bodies away from the wheels when it happened. we
learned afterward how it happened. a block distant a hundred of our
comrades had been holding a building. across roofs and through buildings
they made their way, till they found themselves looking down upon the
close-packed soldiers. then it was counter-massacre.

without warning, a shower of bombs fell from the top of the building.
the automobiles were blown to fragments, along with many soldiers. we,
with the survivors, swept back in mad retreat. half a block down another
building opened fire on us. as the soldiers had carpeted the street with
dead slaves, so, in turn, did they themselves become carpet. garthwaite
and i bore charmed lives. as we had done before, so again we sought
shelter in an entrance. but he was not to be caught napping this time.
as the roar of the bombs died away, he began peering out.

“the mob's coming back!” he called to me. “we've got to get out of
this!”

we fled, hand in hand, down the bloody pavement, slipping and sliding,
and making for the corner. down the cross street we could see a few
soldiers still running. nothing was happening to them. the way was
clear. so we paused a moment and looked back. the mob came on slowly.
it was busy arming itself with the rifles of the slain and killing the
wounded. we saw the end of the young officer who had rescued us.
he painfully lifted himself on his elbow and turned loose with his
automatic pistol.

“there goes my chance of promotion,” garthwaite laughed, as a woman bore
down on the wounded man, brandishing a butcher's cleaver. “come on. it's
the wrong direction, but we'll get out somehow.”

and we fled eastward through the quiet streets, prepared at every cross
street for anything to happen. to the south a monster conflagration was
filling the sky, and we knew that the great ghetto was burning. at last
i sank down on the sidewalk. i was exhausted and could go no farther.
i was bruised and sore and aching in every limb; yet i could not escape
smiling at garthwaite, who was rolling a cigarette and saying:

“i know i'm making a mess of rescuing you, but i can't get head nor
tail of the situation. it's all a mess. every time we try to break out,
something happens and we're turned back. we're only a couple of blocks
now from where i got you out of that entrance. friend and foe are all
mixed up. it's chaos. you can't tell who is in those darned buildings.
try to find out, and you get a bomb on your head. try to go peaceably on
your way, and you run into a mob and are killed by machine-guns, or
you run into the mercenaries and are killed by your own comrades from a
roof. and on the top of it all the mob comes along and kills you, too.”

he shook his head dolefully, lighted his cigarette, and sat down beside
me.

“and i'm that hungry,” he added, “i could eat cobblestones.”

the next moment he was on his feet again and out in the street prying up
a cobblestone. he came back with it and assaulted the window of a store
behind us.

“it's ground floor and no good,” he explained as he helped me through
the hole he had made; “but it's the best we can do. you get a nap and
i'll reconnoitre. i'll finish this rescue all right, but i want time,
time, lots of it--and something to eat.”

it was a harness store we found ourselves in, and he fixed me up a couch
of horse blankets in the private office well to the rear. to add to my
wretchedness a splitting headache was coming on, and i was only too glad
to close my eyes and try to sleep.

“i'll be back,” were his parting words. “i don't hope to get an auto,
but i'll surely bring some grub,* anyway.”

     * food.

and that was the last i saw of garthwaite for three years. instead of
coming back, he was carried away to a hospital with a bullet through his
lungs and another through the fleshy part of his neck.



chapter xxiv

nightmare


i had not closed my eyes the night before on the twentieth century, and
what of that and of my exhaustion i slept soundly. when i first awoke,
it was night. garthwaite had not returned. i had lost my watch and had
no idea of the time. as i lay with my eyes closed, i heard the same
dull sound of distant explosions. the inferno was still raging. i crept
through the store to the front. the reflection from the sky of vast
conflagrations made the street almost as light as day. one could have
read the finest print with ease. from several blocks away came the
crackle of small hand-bombs and the churning of machine-guns, and from a
long way off came a long series of heavy explosions. i crept back to my
horse blankets and slept again.

when next i awoke, a sickly yellow light was filtering in on me. it was
dawn of the second day. i crept to the front of the store. a smoke pall,
shot through with lurid gleams, filled the sky. down the opposite
side of the street tottered a wretched slave. one hand he held tightly
against his side, and behind him he left a bloody trail. his eyes roved
everywhere, and they were filled with apprehension and dread. once he
looked straight across at me, and in his face was all the dumb pathos
of the wounded and hunted animal. he saw me, but there was no kinship
between us, and with him, at least, no sympathy of understanding; for
he cowered perceptibly and dragged himself on. he could expect no aid
in all god's world. he was a helot in the great hunt of helots that the
masters were making. all he could hope for, all he sought, was some hole
to crawl away in and hide like any animal. the sharp clang of a passing
ambulance at the corner gave him a start. ambulances were not for such
as he. with a groan of pain he threw himself into a doorway. a minute
later he was out again and desperately hobbling on.

i went back to my horse blankets and waited an hour for garthwaite. my
headache had not gone away. on the contrary, it was increasing. it was
by an effort of will only that i was able to open my eyes and look
at objects. and with the opening of my eyes and the looking came
intolerable torment. also, a great pulse was beating in my brain. weak
and reeling, i went out through the broken window and down the street,
seeking to escape, instinctively and gropingly, from the awful shambles.
and thereafter i lived nightmare. my memory of what happened in the
succeeding hours is the memory one would have of nightmare. many events
are focussed sharply on my brain, but between these indelible pictures
i retain are intervals of unconsciousness. what occurred in those
intervals i know not, and never shall know.

i remember stumbling at the corner over the legs of a man. it was the
poor hunted wretch that had dragged himself past my hiding-place. how
distinctly do i remember his poor, pitiful, gnarled hands as he lay
there on the pavement--hands that were more hoof and claw than hands,
all twisted and distorted by the toil of all his days, with on the palms
a horny growth of callous a half inch thick. and as i picked myself
up and started on, i looked into the face of the thing and saw that it
still lived; for the eyes, dimly intelligent, were looking at me and
seeing me.

after that came a kindly blank. i knew nothing, saw nothing, merely
tottered on in my quest for safety. my next nightmare vision was a
quiet street of the dead. i came upon it abruptly, as a wanderer in the
country would come upon a flowing stream. only this stream i gazed upon
did not flow. it was congealed in death. from pavement to pavement, and
covering the sidewalks, it lay there, spread out quite evenly, with
only here and there a lump or mound of bodies to break the surface. poor
driven people of the abyss, hunted helots--they lay there as the rabbits
in california after a drive.* up the street and down i looked. there was
no movement, no sound. the quiet buildings looked down upon the scene
from their many windows. and once, and once only, i saw an arm that
moved in that dead stream. i swear i saw it move, with a strange
writhing gesture of agony, and with it lifted a head, gory with nameless
horror, that gibbered at me and then lay down again and moved no more.

     * in those days, so sparsely populated was the land that
     wild animals often became pests.  in california the custom
     of rabbit-driving obtained.  on a given day all the farmers
     in a locality would assemble and sweep across the country in
     converging lines, driving the rabbits by scores of thousands
     into a prepared enclosure, where they were clubbed to death
     by men and boys.

i remember another street, with quiet buildings on either side, and the
panic that smote me into consciousness as again i saw the people of the
abyss, but this time in a stream that flowed and came on. and then i saw
there was nothing to fear. the stream moved slowly, while from it arose
groans and lamentations, cursings, babblings of senility, hysteria, and
insanity; for these were the very young and the very old, the feeble and
the sick, the helpless and the hopeless, all the wreckage of the ghetto.
the burning of the great ghetto on the south side had driven them forth
into the inferno of the street-fighting, and whither they wended and
whatever became of them i did not know and never learned.*

     * it was long a question of debate, whether the burning of
     the south side ghetto was accidental, or whether it was done
     by the mercenaries; but it is definitely settled now that
     the ghetto was fired by the mercenaries under orders from
     their chiefs.

i have faint memories of breaking a window and hiding in some shop to
escape a street mob that was pursued by soldiers. also, a bomb burst
near me, once, in some still street, where, look as i would, up and
down, i could see no human being. but my next sharp recollection begins
with the crack of a rifle and an abrupt becoming aware that i am being
fired at by a soldier in an automobile. the shot missed, and the next
moment i was screaming and motioning the signals. my memory of riding in
the automobile is very hazy, though this ride, in turn, is broken by one
vivid picture. the crack of the rifle of the soldier sitting beside me
made me open my eyes, and i saw george milford, whom i had known in the
pell street days, sinking slowly down to the sidewalk. even as he sank
the soldier fired again, and milford doubled in, then flung his body
out, and fell sprawling. the soldier chuckled, and the automobile sped
on.

the next i knew after that i was awakened out of a sound sleep by a man
who walked up and down close beside me. his face was drawn and strained,
and the sweat rolled down his nose from his forehead. one hand was
clutched tightly against his chest by the other hand, and blood
dripped down upon the floor as he walked. he wore the uniform of the
mercenaries. from without, as through thick walls, came the muffled roar
of bursting bombs. i was in some building that was locked in combat with
some other building.

a surgeon came in to dress the wounded soldier, and i learned that it
was two in the afternoon. my headache was no better, and the surgeon
paused from his work long enough to give me a powerful drug that would
depress the heart and bring relief. i slept again, and the next i knew i
was on top of the building. the immediate fighting had ceased, and i
was watching the balloon attack on the fortresses. some one had an arm
around me and i was leaning close against him. it came to me quite as a
matter of course that this was ernest, and i found myself wondering how
he had got his hair and eyebrows so badly singed.

it was by the merest chance that we had found each other in that
terrible city. he had had no idea that i had left new york, and, coming
through the room where i lay asleep, could not at first believe that
it was i. little more i saw of the chicago commune. after watching the
balloon attack, ernest took me down into the heart of the building,
where i slept the afternoon out and the night. the third day we spent
in the building, and on the fourth, ernest having got permission and an
automobile from the authorities, we left chicago.

my headache was gone, but, body and soul, i was very tired. i lay back
against ernest in the automobile, and with apathetic eyes watched the
soldiers trying to get the machine out of the city. fighting was
still going on, but only in isolated localities. here and there whole
districts were still in possession of the comrades, but such districts
were surrounded and guarded by heavy bodies of troops. in a hundred
segregated traps were the comrades thus held while the work of
subjugating them went on. subjugation meant death, for no quarter was
given, and they fought heroically to the last man.*

     * numbers of the buildings held out over a week, while one
     held out eleven days.  each building had to be stormed like
     a fort, and the mercenaries fought their way upward floor by
     floor.  it was deadly fighting.  quarter was neither given
     nor taken, and in the fighting the revolutionists had the
     advantage of being above.  while the revolutionists were
     wiped out, the loss was not one-sided.  the proud chicago
     proletariat lived up to its ancient boast.  for as many of
     itself as were killed, it killed that many of the enemy.

whenever we approached such localities, the guards turned us back and
sent us around. once, the only way past two strong positions of the
comrades was through a burnt section that lay between. from either side
we could hear the rattle and roar of war, while the automobile picked
its way through smoking ruins and tottering walls. often the streets
were blocked by mountains of debris that compelled us to go around. we
were in a labyrinth of ruin, and our progress was slow.

the stockyards (ghetto, plant, and everything) were smouldering ruins.
far off to the right a wide smoke haze dimmed the sky,--the town of
pullman, the soldier chauffeur told us, or what had been the town of
pullman, for it was utterly destroyed. he had driven the machine out
there, with despatches, on the afternoon of the third day. some of the
heaviest fighting had occurred there, he said, many of the streets being
rendered impassable by the heaps of the dead.

swinging around the shattered walls of a building, in the stockyards
district, the automobile was stopped by a wave of dead. it was for all
the world like a wave tossed up by the sea. it was patent to us what
had happened. as the mob charged past the corner, it had been swept, at
right angles and point-blank range, by the machine-guns drawn up on the
cross street. but disaster had come to the soldiers. a chance bomb must
have exploded among them, for the mob, checked until its dead and dying
formed the wave, had white-capped and flung forward its foam of living,
fighting slaves. soldiers and slaves lay together, torn and mangled,
around and over the wreckage of the automobiles and guns.

ernest sprang out. a familiar pair of shoulders in a cotton shirt and a
familiar fringe of white hair had caught his eye. i did not watch him,
and it was not until he was back beside me and we were speeding on that
he said:

“it was bishop morehouse.”

soon we were in the green country, and i took one last glance back at
the smoke-filled sky. faint and far came the low thud of an explosion.
then i turned my face against ernest's breast and wept softly for the
cause that was lost. ernest's arm about me was eloquent with love.

“for this time lost, dear heart,” he said, “but not forever. we have
learned. to-morrow the cause will rise again, strong with wisdom and
discipline.”

the automobile drew up at a railroad station. here we would catch a
train to new york. as we waited on the platform, three trains thundered
past, bound west to chicago. they were crowded with ragged, unskilled
laborers, people of the abyss.

“slave-levies for the rebuilding of chicago,” ernest said. “you see, the
chicago slaves are all killed.”



chapter xxv

the terrorists


it was not until ernest and i were back in new york, and after weeks had
elapsed, that we were able to comprehend thoroughly the full sweep of
the disaster that had befallen the cause. the situation was bitter and
bloody. in many places, scattered over the country, slave revolts and
massacres had occurred. the roll of the martyrs increased mightily.
countless executions took place everywhere. the mountains and waste
regions were filled with outlaws and refugees who were being hunted down
mercilessly. our own refuges were packed with comrades who had prices on
their heads. through information furnished by its spies, scores of our
refuges were raided by the soldiers of the iron heel.

many of the comrades were disheartened, and they retaliated with
terroristic tactics. the set-back to their hopes made them despairing
and desperate. many terrorist organizations unaffiliated with us sprang
into existence and caused us much trouble.* these misguided people
sacrificed their own lives wantonly, very often made our own plans go
astray, and retarded our organization.

     * the annals of this short-lived era of despair make bloody
     reading.  revenge was the ruling motive, and the members of
     the terroristic organizations were careless of their own
     lives and hopeless about the future.  the danites, taking
     their name from the avenging angels of the mormon mythology,
     sprang up in the mountains of the great west and spread over
     the pacific coast from panama to alaska.  the valkyries were
     women.  they were the most terrible of all.  no woman was
     eligible for membership who had not lost near relatives at
     the hands of the oligarchy.  they were guilty of torturing
     their prisoners to death.  another famous organization of
     women was the widows of war.  a companion organization to
     the valkyries was the berserkers.  these men placed no value
     whatever upon their own lives, and it was they who totally
     destroyed the great mercenary city of bellona along with its
     population of over a hundred thousand souls.  the bedlamites
     and the helldamites were twin slave organizations, while a
     new religious sect that did not flourish long was called the
     wrath of god.  among others, to show the whimsicality of
     their deadly seriousness, may be mentioned the following:
     the bleeding hearts, sons of the morning, the morning stars,
     the flamingoes, the triple triangles, the three bars, the
     rubonics, the vindicators, the comanches, and the
     erebusites.

and through it all moved the iron heel, impassive and deliberate,
shaking up the whole fabric of the social structure in its search for
the comrades, combing out the mercenaries, the labor castes, and all its
secret services, punishing without mercy and without malice, suffering
in silence all retaliations that were made upon it, and filling the gaps
in its fighting line as fast as they appeared. and hand in hand with
this, ernest and the other leaders were hard at work reorganizing the
forces of the revolution. the magnitude of the task may be understood
when it is taken into.*

     * this is the end of the everhard manuscript.  it breaks off
     abruptly in the middle of a sentence.  she must have
     received warning of the coming of the mercenaries, for she
     had time safely to hide the manuscript before she fled or
     was captured.  it is to be regretted that she did not live
     to complete her narrative, for then, undoubtedly, would have
     been cleared away the mystery that has shrouded for seven
     centuries the execution of ernest everhard.

chapter i. into the primitive

“old longings nomadic leap,
chafing at custom’s chain;
again from its brumal sleep
wakens the ferine strain.”


buck did not read the newspapers, or he would have known that trouble
was brewing, not alone for himself, but for every tide-water dog,
strong of muscle and with warm, long hair, from puget sound to san
diego. because men, groping in the arctic darkness, had found a yellow
metal, and because steamship and transportation companies were booming
the find, thousands of men were rushing into the northland. these men
wanted dogs, and the dogs they wanted were heavy dogs, with strong
muscles by which to toil, and furry coats to protect them from the
frost.

buck lived at a big house in the sun-kissed santa clara valley. judge
miller’s place, it was called. it stood back from the road, half hidden
among the trees, through which glimpses could be caught of the wide
cool veranda that ran around its four sides. the house was approached
by gravelled driveways which wound about through wide-spreading lawns
and under the interlacing boughs of tall poplars. at the rear things
were on even a more spacious scale than at the front. there were great
stables, where a dozen grooms and boys held forth, rows of vine-clad
servants’ cottages, an endless and orderly array of outhouses, long
grape arbors, green pastures, orchards, and berry patches. then there
was the pumping plant for the artesian well, and the big cement tank
where judge miller’s boys took their morning plunge and kept cool in
the hot afternoon.

and over this great demesne buck ruled. here he was born, and here he
had lived the four years of his life. it was true, there were other
dogs, there could not but be other dogs on so vast a place, but they
did not count. they came and went, resided in the populous kennels, or
lived obscurely in the recesses of the house after the fashion of
toots, the japanese pug, or ysabel, the mexican hairless,—strange
creatures that rarely put nose out of doors or set foot to ground. on
the other hand, there were the fox terriers, a score of them at least,
who yelped fearful promises at toots and ysabel looking out of the
windows at them and protected by a legion of housemaids armed with
brooms and mops.

but buck was neither house-dog nor kennel-dog. the whole realm was his.
he plunged into the swimming tank or went hunting with the judge’s
sons; he escorted mollie and alice, the judge’s daughters, on long
twilight or early morning rambles; on wintry nights he lay at the
judge’s feet before the roaring library fire; he carried the judge’s
grandsons on his back, or rolled them in the grass, and guarded their
footsteps through wild adventures down to the fountain in the stable
yard, and even beyond, where the paddocks were, and the berry patches.
among the terriers he stalked imperiously, and toots and ysabel he
utterly ignored, for he was king,—king over all creeping, crawling,
flying things of judge miller’s place, humans included.

his father, elmo, a huge st. bernard, had been the judge’s inseparable
companion, and buck bid fair to follow in the way of his father. he was
not so large,—he weighed only one hundred and forty pounds,—for his
mother, shep, had been a scotch shepherd dog. nevertheless, one hundred
and forty pounds, to which was added the dignity that comes of good
living and universal respect, enabled him to carry himself in right
royal fashion. during the four years since his puppyhood he had lived
the life of a sated aristocrat; he had a fine pride in himself, was
even a trifle egotistical, as country gentlemen sometimes become
because of their insular situation. but he had saved himself by not
becoming a mere pampered house-dog. hunting and kindred outdoor
delights had kept down the fat and hardened his muscles; and to him, as
to the cold-tubbing races, the love of water had been a tonic and a
health preserver.

and this was the manner of dog buck was in the fall of 1897, when the
klondike strike dragged men from all the world into the frozen north.
but buck did not read the newspapers, and he did not know that manuel,
one of the gardener’s helpers, was an undesirable acquaintance. manuel
had one besetting sin. he loved to play chinese lottery. also, in his
gambling, he had one besetting weakness—faith in a system; and this
made his damnation certain. for to play a system requires money, while
the wages of a gardener’s helper do not lap over the needs of a wife
and numerous progeny.

the judge was at a meeting of the raisin growers’ association, and the
boys were busy organizing an athletic club, on the memorable night of
manuel’s treachery. no one saw him and buck go off through the orchard
on what buck imagined was merely a stroll. and with the exception of a
solitary man, no one saw them arrive at the little flag station known
as college park. this man talked with manuel, and money chinked between
them.

“you might wrap up the goods before you deliver ’m,” the stranger said
gruffly, and manuel doubled a piece of stout rope around buck’s neck
under the collar.

“twist it, an’ you’ll choke ’m plentee,” said manuel, and the stranger
grunted a ready affirmative.

buck had accepted the rope with quiet dignity. to be sure, it was an
unwonted performance: but he had learned to trust in men he knew, and
to give them credit for a wisdom that outreached his own. but when the
ends of the rope were placed in the stranger’s hands, he growled
menacingly. he had merely intimated his displeasure, in his pride
believing that to intimate was to command. but to his surprise the rope
tightened around his neck, shutting off his breath. in quick rage he
sprang at the man, who met him halfway, grappled him close by the
throat, and with a deft twist threw him over on his back. then the rope
tightened mercilessly, while buck struggled in a fury, his tongue
lolling out of his mouth and his great chest panting futilely. never in
all his life had he been so vilely treated, and never in all his life
had he been so angry. but his strength ebbed, his eyes glazed, and he
knew nothing when the train was flagged and the two men threw him into
the baggage car.

the next he knew, he was dimly aware that his tongue was hurting and
that he was being jolted along in some kind of a conveyance. the hoarse
shriek of a locomotive whistling a crossing told him where he was. he
had travelled too often with the judge not to know the sensation of
riding in a baggage car. he opened his eyes, and into them came the
unbridled anger of a kidnapped king. the man sprang for his throat, but
buck was too quick for him. his jaws closed on the hand, nor did they
relax till his senses were choked out of him once more.

“yep, has fits,” the man said, hiding his mangled hand from the
baggageman, who had been attracted by the sounds of struggle. “i’m
takin’ ’m up for the boss to ’frisco. a crack dog-doctor there thinks
that he can cure ’m.”

concerning that night’s ride, the man spoke most eloquently for
himself, in a little shed back of a saloon on the san francisco water
front.

“all i get is fifty for it,” he grumbled; “an’ i wouldn’t do it over
for a thousand, cold cash.”

his hand was wrapped in a bloody handkerchief, and the right trouser
leg was ripped from knee to ankle.

“how much did the other mug get?” the saloon-keeper demanded.

“a hundred,” was the reply. “wouldn’t take a sou less, so help me.”

“that makes a hundred and fifty,” the saloon-keeper calculated; “and
he’s worth it, or i’m a squarehead.”

the kidnapper undid the bloody wrappings and looked at his lacerated
hand. “if i don’t get the hydrophoby—”

“it’ll be because you was born to hang,” laughed the saloon-keeper.
“here, lend me a hand before you pull your freight,” he added.

dazed, suffering intolerable pain from throat and tongue, with the life
half throttled out of him, buck attempted to face his tormentors. but
he was thrown down and choked repeatedly, till they succeeded in filing
the heavy brass collar from off his neck. then the rope was removed,
and he was flung into a cagelike crate.

there he lay for the remainder of the weary night, nursing his wrath
and wounded pride. he could not understand what it all meant. what did
they want with him, these strange men? why were they keeping him pent
up in this narrow crate? he did not know why, but he felt oppressed by
the vague sense of impending calamity. several times during the night
he sprang to his feet when the shed door rattled open, expecting to see
the judge, or the boys at least. but each time it was the bulging face
of the saloon-keeper that peered in at him by the sickly light of a
tallow candle. and each time the joyful bark that trembled in buck’s
throat was twisted into a savage growl.

but the saloon-keeper let him alone, and in the morning four men
entered and picked up the crate. more tormentors, buck decided, for
they were evil-looking creatures, ragged and unkempt; and he stormed
and raged at them through the bars. they only laughed and poked sticks
at him, which he promptly assailed with his teeth till he realized that
that was what they wanted. whereupon he lay down sullenly and allowed
the crate to be lifted into a wagon. then he, and the crate in which he
was imprisoned, began a passage through many hands. clerks in the
express office took charge of him; he was carted about in another
wagon; a truck carried him, with an assortment of boxes and parcels,
upon a ferry steamer; he was trucked off the steamer into a great
railway depot, and finally he was deposited in an express car.

for two days and nights this express car was dragged along at the tail
of shrieking locomotives; and for two days and nights buck neither ate
nor drank. in his anger he had met the first advances of the express
messengers with growls, and they had retaliated by teasing him. when he
flung himself against the bars, quivering and frothing, they laughed at
him and taunted him. they growled and barked like detestable dogs,
mewed, and flapped their arms and crowed. it was all very silly, he
knew; but therefore the more outrage to his dignity, and his anger
waxed and waxed. he did not mind the hunger so much, but the lack of
water caused him severe suffering and fanned his wrath to fever-pitch.
for that matter, high-strung and finely sensitive, the ill treatment
had flung him into a fever, which was fed by the inflammation of his
parched and swollen throat and tongue.

he was glad for one thing: the rope was off his neck. that had given
them an unfair advantage; but now that it was off, he would show them.
they would never get another rope around his neck. upon that he was
resolved. for two days and nights he neither ate nor drank, and during
those two days and nights of torment, he accumulated a fund of wrath
that boded ill for whoever first fell foul of him. his eyes turned
blood-shot, and he was metamorphosed into a raging fiend. so changed
was he that the judge himself would not have recognized him; and the
express messengers breathed with relief when they bundled him off the
train at seattle.

four men gingerly carried the crate from the wagon into a small,
high-walled back yard. a stout man, with a red sweater that sagged
generously at the neck, came out and signed the book for the driver.
that was the man, buck divined, the next tormentor, and he hurled
himself savagely against the bars. the man smiled grimly, and brought a
hatchet and a club.

“you ain’t going to take him out now?” the driver asked.

“sure,” the man replied, driving the hatchet into the crate for a pry.

there was an instantaneous scattering of the four men who had carried
it in, and from safe perches on top the wall they prepared to watch the
performance.

buck rushed at the splintering wood, sinking his teeth into it, surging
and wrestling with it. wherever the hatchet fell on the outside, he was
there on the inside, snarling and growling, as furiously anxious to get
out as the man in the red sweater was calmly intent on getting him out.

“now, you red-eyed devil,” he said, when he had made an opening
sufficient for the passage of buck’s body. at the same time he dropped
the hatchet and shifted the club to his right hand.

and buck was truly a red-eyed devil, as he drew himself together for
the spring, hair bristling, mouth foaming, a mad glitter in his
blood-shot eyes. straight at the man he launched his one hundred and
forty pounds of fury, surcharged with the pent passion of two days and
nights. in mid air, just as his jaws were about to close on the man, he
received a shock that checked his body and brought his teeth together
with an agonizing clip. he whirled over, fetching the ground on his
back and side. he had never been struck by a club in his life, and did
not understand. with a snarl that was part bark and more scream he was
again on his feet and launched into the air. and again the shock came
and he was brought crushingly to the ground. this time he was aware
that it was the club, but his madness knew no caution. a dozen times he
charged, and as often the club broke the charge and smashed him down.

after a particularly fierce blow, he crawled to his feet, too dazed to
rush. he staggered limply about, the blood flowing from nose and mouth
and ears, his beautiful coat sprayed and flecked with bloody slaver.
then the man advanced and deliberately dealt him a frightful blow on
the nose. all the pain he had endured was as nothing compared with the
exquisite agony of this. with a roar that was almost lionlike in its
ferocity, he again hurled himself at the man. but the man, shifting the
club from right to left, coolly caught him by the under jaw, at the
same time wrenching downward and backward. buck described a complete
circle in the air, and half of another, then crashed to the ground on
his head and chest.

for the last time he rushed. the man struck the shrewd blow he had
purposely withheld for so long, and buck crumpled up and went down,
knocked utterly senseless.

“he’s no slouch at dog-breakin’, that’s wot i say,” one of the men on
the wall cried enthusiastically.

“druther break cayuses any day, and twice on sundays,” was the reply of
the driver, as he climbed on the wagon and started the horses.

buck’s senses came back to him, but not his strength. he lay where he
had fallen, and from there he watched the man in the red sweater.

“‘answers to the name of buck,’” the man soliloquized, quoting from the
saloon-keeper’s letter which had announced the consignment of the crate
and contents. “well, buck, my boy,” he went on in a genial voice,
“we’ve had our little ruction, and the best thing we can do is to let
it go at that. you’ve learned your place, and i know mine. be a good
dog and all ’ll go well and the goose hang high. be a bad dog, and i’ll
whale the stuffin’ outa you. understand?”

as he spoke he fearlessly patted the head he had so mercilessly
pounded, and though buck’s hair involuntarily bristled at touch of the
hand, he endured it without protest. when the man brought him water he
drank eagerly, and later bolted a generous meal of raw meat, chunk by
chunk, from the man’s hand.

he was beaten (he knew that); but he was not broken. he saw, once for
all, that he stood no chance against a man with a club. he had learned
the lesson, and in all his after life he never forgot it. that club was
a revelation. it was his introduction to the reign of primitive law,
and he met the introduction halfway. the facts of life took on a
fiercer aspect; and while he faced that aspect uncowed, he faced it
with all the latent cunning of his nature aroused. as the days went by,
other dogs came, in crates and at the ends of ropes, some docilely, and
some raging and roaring as he had come; and, one and all, he watched
them pass under the dominion of the man in the red sweater. again and
again, as he looked at each brutal performance, the lesson was driven
home to buck: a man with a club was a lawgiver, a master to be obeyed,
though not necessarily conciliated. of this last buck was never guilty,
though he did see beaten dogs that fawned upon the man, and wagged
their tails, and licked his hand. also he saw one dog, that would
neither conciliate nor obey, finally killed in the struggle for
mastery.

now and again men came, strangers, who talked excitedly, wheedlingly,
and in all kinds of fashions to the man in the red sweater. and at such
times that money passed between them the strangers took one or more of
the dogs away with them. buck wondered where they went, for they never
came back; but the fear of the future was strong upon him, and he was
glad each time when he was not selected.

yet his time came, in the end, in the form of a little weazened man who
spat broken english and many strange and uncouth exclamations which
buck could not understand.

“sacredam!” he cried, when his eyes lit upon buck. “dat one dam bully
dog! eh? how moch?”

“three hundred, and a present at that,” was the prompt reply of the man
in the red sweater. “and seem’ it’s government money, you ain’t got no
kick coming, eh, perrault?”

perrault grinned. considering that the price of dogs had been boomed
skyward by the unwonted demand, it was not an unfair sum for so fine an
animal. the canadian government would be no loser, nor would its
despatches travel the slower. perrault knew dogs, and when he looked at
buck he knew that he was one in a thousand—“one in ten t’ousand,” he
commented mentally.

buck saw money pass between them, and was not surprised when curly, a
good-natured newfoundland, and he were led away by the little weazened
man. that was the last he saw of the man in the red sweater, and as
curly and he looked at receding seattle from the deck of the _narwhal_,
it was the last he saw of the warm southland. curly and he were taken
below by perrault and turned over to a black-faced giant called
françois. perrault was a french-canadian, and swarthy; but françois was
a french-canadian half-breed, and twice as swarthy. they were a new
kind of men to buck (of which he was destined to see many more), and
while he developed no affection for them, he none the less grew
honestly to respect them. he speedily learned that perrault and
françois were fair men, calm and impartial in administering justice,
and too wise in the way of dogs to be fooled by dogs.

in the ’tween-decks of the _narwhal_, buck and curly joined two other
dogs. one of them was a big, snow-white fellow from spitzbergen who had
been brought away by a whaling captain, and who had later accompanied a
geological survey into the barrens. he was friendly, in a treacherous
sort of way, smiling into one’s face the while he meditated some
underhand trick, as, for instance, when he stole from buck’s food at
the first meal. as buck sprang to punish him, the lash of françois’s
whip sang through the air, reaching the culprit first; and nothing
remained to buck but to recover the bone. that was fair of françois, he
decided, and the half-breed began his rise in buck’s estimation.

the other dog made no advances, nor received any; also, he did not
attempt to steal from the newcomers. he was a gloomy, morose fellow,
and he showed curly plainly that all he desired was to be left alone,
and further, that there would be trouble if he were not left alone.
“dave” he was called, and he ate and slept, or yawned between times,
and took interest in nothing, not even when the _narwhal_ crossed queen
charlotte sound and rolled and pitched and bucked like a thing
possessed. when buck and curly grew excited, half wild with fear, he
raised his head as though annoyed, favored them with an incurious
glance, yawned, and went to sleep again.

day and night the ship throbbed to the tireless pulse of the propeller,
and though one day was very like another, it was apparent to buck that
the weather was steadily growing colder. at last, one morning, the
propeller was quiet, and the _narwhal_ was pervaded with an atmosphere
of excitement. he felt it, as did the other dogs, and knew that a
change was at hand. françois leashed them and brought them on deck. at
the first step upon the cold surface, buck’s feet sank into a white
mushy something very like mud. he sprang back with a snort. more of
this white stuff was falling through the air. he shook himself, but
more of it fell upon him. he sniffed it curiously, then licked some up
on his tongue. it bit like fire, and the next instant was gone. this
puzzled him. he tried it again, with the same result. the onlookers
laughed uproariously, and he felt ashamed, he knew not why, for it was
his first snow.



chapter ii. the law of club and fang

buck’s first day on the dyea beach was like a nightmare. every hour was
filled with shock and surprise. he had been suddenly jerked from the
heart of civilization and flung into the heart of things primordial. no
lazy, sun-kissed life was this, with nothing to do but loaf and be
bored. here was neither peace, nor rest, nor a moment’s safety. all was
confusion and action, and every moment life and limb were in peril.
there was imperative need to be constantly alert; for these dogs and
men were not town dogs and men. they were savages, all of them, who
knew no law but the law of club and fang.

he had never seen dogs fight as these wolfish creatures fought, and his
first experience taught him an unforgetable lesson. it is true, it was
a vicarious experience, else he would not have lived to profit by it.
curly was the victim. they were camped near the log store, where she,
in her friendly way, made advances to a husky dog the size of a
full-grown wolf, though not half so large as she. there was no warning,
only a leap in like a flash, a metallic clip of teeth, a leap out
equally swift, and curly’s face was ripped open from eye to jaw.

it was the wolf manner of fighting, to strike and leap away; but there
was more to it than this. thirty or forty huskies ran to the spot and
surrounded the combatants in an intent and silent circle. buck did not
comprehend that silent intentness, nor the eager way with which they
were licking their chops. curly rushed her antagonist, who struck again
and leaped aside. he met her next rush with his chest, in a peculiar
fashion that tumbled her off her feet. she never regained them, this
was what the onlooking huskies had waited for. they closed in upon her,
snarling and yelping, and she was buried, screaming with agony, beneath
the bristling mass of bodies.

so sudden was it, and so unexpected, that buck was taken aback. he saw
spitz run out his scarlet tongue in a way he had of laughing; and he
saw françois, swinging an axe, spring into the mess of dogs. three men
with clubs were helping him to scatter them. it did not take long. two
minutes from the time curly went down, the last of her assailants were
clubbed off. but she lay there limp and lifeless in the bloody,
trampled snow, almost literally torn to pieces, the swart half-breed
standing over her and cursing horribly. the scene often came back to
buck to trouble him in his sleep. so that was the way. no fair play.
once down, that was the end of you. well, he would see to it that he
never went down. spitz ran out his tongue and laughed again, and from
that moment buck hated him with a bitter and deathless hatred.

before he had recovered from the shock caused by the tragic passing of
curly, he received another shock. françois fastened upon him an
arrangement of straps and buckles. it was a harness, such as he had
seen the grooms put on the horses at home. and as he had seen horses
work, so he was set to work, hauling françois on a sled to the forest
that fringed the valley, and returning with a load of firewood. though
his dignity was sorely hurt by thus being made a draught animal, he was
too wise to rebel. he buckled down with a will and did his best, though
it was all new and strange. françois was stern, demanding instant
obedience, and by virtue of his whip receiving instant obedience; while
dave, who was an experienced wheeler, nipped buck’s hind quarters
whenever he was in error. spitz was the leader, likewise experienced,
and while he could not always get at buck, he growled sharp reproof now
and again, or cunningly threw his weight in the traces to jerk buck
into the way he should go. buck learned easily, and under the combined
tuition of his two mates and françois made remarkable progress. ere
they returned to camp he knew enough to stop at “ho,” to go ahead at
“mush,” to swing wide on the bends, and to keep clear of the wheeler
when the loaded sled shot downhill at their heels.

“t’ree vair’ good dogs,” françois told perrault. “dat buck, heem pool
lak hell. i tich heem queek as anyt’ing.”

by afternoon, perrault, who was in a hurry to be on the trail with his
despatches, returned with two more dogs. “billee” and “joe” he called
them, two brothers, and true huskies both. sons of the one mother
though they were, they were as different as day and night. billee’s one
fault was his excessive good nature, while joe was the very opposite,
sour and introspective, with a perpetual snarl and a malignant eye.
buck received them in comradely fashion, dave ignored them, while spitz
proceeded to thrash first one and then the other. billee wagged his
tail appeasingly, turned to run when he saw that appeasement was of no
avail, and cried (still appeasingly) when spitz’s sharp teeth scored
his flank. but no matter how spitz circled, joe whirled around on his
heels to face him, mane bristling, ears laid back, lips writhing and
snarling, jaws clipping together as fast as he could snap, and eyes
diabolically gleaming—the incarnation of belligerent fear. so terrible
was his appearance that spitz was forced to forego disciplining him;
but to cover his own discomfiture he turned upon the inoffensive and
wailing billee and drove him to the confines of the camp.

by evening perrault secured another dog, an old husky, long and lean
and gaunt, with a battle-scarred face and a single eye which flashed a
warning of prowess that commanded respect. he was called sol-leks,
which means the angry one. like dave, he asked nothing, gave nothing,
expected nothing; and when he marched slowly and deliberately into
their midst, even spitz left him alone. he had one peculiarity which
buck was unlucky enough to discover. he did not like to be approached
on his blind side. of this offence buck was unwittingly guilty, and the
first knowledge he had of his indiscretion was when sol-leks whirled
upon him and slashed his shoulder to the bone for three inches up and
down. forever after buck avoided his blind side, and to the last of
their comradeship had no more trouble. his only apparent ambition, like
dave’s, was to be left alone; though, as buck was afterward to learn,
each of them possessed one other and even more vital ambition.

that night buck faced the great problem of sleeping. the tent,
illumined by a candle, glowed warmly in the midst of the white plain;
and when he, as a matter of course, entered it, both perrault and
françois bombarded him with curses and cooking utensils, till he
recovered from his consternation and fled ignominiously into the outer
cold. a chill wind was blowing that nipped him sharply and bit with
especial venom into his wounded shoulder. he lay down on the snow and
attempted to sleep, but the frost soon drove him shivering to his feet.
miserable and disconsolate, he wandered about among the many tents,
only to find that one place was as cold as another. here and there
savage dogs rushed upon him, but he bristled his neck-hair and snarled
(for he was learning fast), and they let him go his way unmolested.

finally an idea came to him. he would return and see how his own
team-mates were making out. to his astonishment, they had disappeared.
again he wandered about through the great camp, looking for them, and
again he returned. were they in the tent? no, that could not be, else
he would not have been driven out. then where could they possibly be?
with drooping tail and shivering body, very forlorn indeed, he
aimlessly circled the tent. suddenly the snow gave way beneath his fore
legs and he sank down. something wriggled under his feet. he sprang
back, bristling and snarling, fearful of the unseen and unknown. but a
friendly little yelp reassured him, and he went back to investigate. a
whiff of warm air ascended to his nostrils, and there, curled up under
the snow in a snug ball, lay billee. he whined placatingly, squirmed
and wriggled to show his good will and intentions, and even ventured,
as a bribe for peace, to lick buck’s face with his warm wet tongue.

another lesson. so that was the way they did it, eh? buck confidently
selected a spot, and with much fuss and waste effort proceeded to dig a
hole for himself. in a trice the heat from his body filled the confined
space and he was asleep. the day had been long and arduous, and he
slept soundly and comfortably, though he growled and barked and
wrestled with bad dreams.

nor did he open his eyes till roused by the noises of the waking camp.
at first he did not know where he was. it had snowed during the night
and he was completely buried. the snow walls pressed him on every side,
and a great surge of fear swept through him—the fear of the wild thing
for the trap. it was a token that he was harking back through his own
life to the lives of his forebears; for he was a civilized dog, an
unduly civilized dog, and of his own experience knew no trap and so
could not of himself fear it. the muscles of his whole body contracted
spasmodically and instinctively, the hair on his neck and shoulders
stood on end, and with a ferocious snarl he bounded straight up into
the blinding day, the snow flying about him in a flashing cloud. ere he
landed on his feet, he saw the white camp spread out before him and
knew where he was and remembered all that had passed from the time he
went for a stroll with manuel to the hole he had dug for himself the
night before.

a shout from françois hailed his appearance. “wot i say?” the
dog-driver cried to perrault. “dat buck for sure learn queek as
anyt’ing.”

perrault nodded gravely. as courier for the canadian government,
bearing important despatches, he was anxious to secure the best dogs,
and he was particularly gladdened by the possession of buck.

three more huskies were added to the team inside an hour, making a
total of nine, and before another quarter of an hour had passed they
were in harness and swinging up the trail toward the dyea cañon. buck
was glad to be gone, and though the work was hard he found he did not
particularly despise it. he was surprised at the eagerness which
animated the whole team and which was communicated to him; but still
more surprising was the change wrought in dave and sol-leks. they were
new dogs, utterly transformed by the harness. all passiveness and
unconcern had dropped from them. they were alert and active, anxious
that the work should go well, and fiercely irritable with whatever, by
delay or confusion, retarded that work. the toil of the traces seemed
the supreme expression of their being, and all that they lived for and
the only thing in which they took delight.

dave was wheeler or sled dog, pulling in front of him was buck, then
came sol-leks; the rest of the team was strung out ahead, single file,
to the leader, which position was filled by spitz.

buck had been purposely placed between dave and sol-leks so that he
might receive instruction. apt scholar that he was, they were equally
apt teachers, never allowing him to linger long in error, and enforcing
their teaching with their sharp teeth. dave was fair and very wise. he
never nipped buck without cause, and he never failed to nip him when he
stood in need of it. as françois’s whip backed him up, buck found it to
be cheaper to mend his ways than to retaliate. once, during a brief
halt, when he got tangled in the traces and delayed the start, both
dave and sol-leks flew at him and administered a sound trouncing. the
resulting tangle was even worse, but buck took good care to keep the
traces clear thereafter; and ere the day was done, so well had he
mastered his work, his mates about ceased nagging him. françois’s whip
snapped less frequently, and perrault even honored buck by lifting up
his feet and carefully examining them.

it was a hard day’s run, up the cañon, through sheep camp, past the
scales and the timber line, across glaciers and snowdrifts hundreds of
feet deep, and over the great chilcoot divide, which stands between the
salt water and the fresh and guards forbiddingly the sad and lonely
north. they made good time down the chain of lakes which fills the
craters of extinct volcanoes, and late that night pulled into the huge
camp at the head of lake bennett, where thousands of goldseekers were
building boats against the break-up of the ice in the spring. buck made
his hole in the snow and slept the sleep of the exhausted just, but all
too early was routed out in the cold darkness and harnessed with his
mates to the sled.

that day they made forty miles, the trail being packed; but the next
day, and for many days to follow, they broke their own trail, worked
harder, and made poorer time. as a rule, perrault travelled ahead of
the team, packing the snow with webbed shoes to make it easier for
them. françois, guiding the sled at the gee-pole, sometimes exchanged
places with him, but not often. perrault was in a hurry, and he prided
himself on his knowledge of ice, which knowledge was indispensable, for
the fall ice was very thin, and where there was swift water, there was
no ice at all.

day after day, for days unending, buck toiled in the traces. always,
they broke camp in the dark, and the first gray of dawn found them
hitting the trail with fresh miles reeled off behind them. and always
they pitched camp after dark, eating their bit of fish, and crawling to
sleep into the snow. buck was ravenous. the pound and a half of
sun-dried salmon, which was his ration for each day, seemed to go
nowhere. he never had enough, and suffered from perpetual hunger pangs.
yet the other dogs, because they weighed less and were born to the
life, received a pound only of the fish and managed to keep in good
condition.

he swiftly lost the fastidiousness which had characterized his old
life. a dainty eater, he found that his mates, finishing first, robbed
him of his unfinished ration. there was no defending it. while he was
fighting off two or three, it was disappearing down the throats of the
others. to remedy this, he ate as fast as they; and, so greatly did
hunger compel him, he was not above taking what did not belong to him.
he watched and learned. when he saw pike, one of the new dogs, a clever
malingerer and thief, slyly steal a slice of bacon when perrault’s back
was turned, he duplicated the performance the following day, getting
away with the whole chunk. a great uproar was raised, but he was
unsuspected; while dub, an awkward blunderer who was always getting
caught, was punished for buck’s misdeed.

this first theft marked buck as fit to survive in the hostile northland
environment. it marked his adaptability, his capacity to adjust himself
to changing conditions, the lack of which would have meant swift and
terrible death. it marked, further, the decay or going to pieces of his
moral nature, a vain thing and a handicap in the ruthless struggle for
existence. it was all well enough in the southland, under the law of
love and fellowship, to respect private property and personal feelings;
but in the northland, under the law of club and fang, whoso took such
things into account was a fool, and in so far as he observed them he
would fail to prosper.

not that buck reasoned it out. he was fit, that was all, and
unconsciously he accommodated himself to the new mode of life. all his
days, no matter what the odds, he had never run from a fight. but the
club of the man in the red sweater had beaten into him a more
fundamental and primitive code. civilized, he could have died for a
moral consideration, say the defence of judge miller’s riding-whip; but
the completeness of his decivilization was now evidenced by his ability
to flee from the defence of a moral consideration and so save his hide.
he did not steal for joy of it, but because of the clamor of his
stomach. he did not rob openly, but stole secretly and cunningly, out
of respect for club and fang. in short, the things he did were done
because it was easier to do them than not to do them.

his development (or retrogression) was rapid. his muscles became hard
as iron, and he grew callous to all ordinary pain. he achieved an
internal as well as external economy. he could eat anything, no matter
how loathsome or indigestible; and, once eaten, the juices of his
stomach extracted the last least particle of nutriment; and his blood
carried it to the farthest reaches of his body, building it into the
toughest and stoutest of tissues. sight and scent became remarkably
keen, while his hearing developed such acuteness that in his sleep he
heard the faintest sound and knew whether it heralded peace or peril.
he learned to bite the ice out with his teeth when it collected between
his toes; and when he was thirsty and there was a thick scum of ice
over the water hole, he would break it by rearing and striking it with
stiff fore legs. his most conspicuous trait was an ability to scent the
wind and forecast it a night in advance. no matter how breathless the
air when he dug his nest by tree or bank, the wind that later blew
inevitably found him to leeward, sheltered and snug.

and not only did he learn by experience, but instincts long dead became
alive again. the domesticated generations fell from him. in vague ways
he remembered back to the youth of the breed, to the time the wild dogs
ranged in packs through the primeval forest and killed their meat as
they ran it down. it was no task for him to learn to fight with cut and
slash and the quick wolf snap. in this manner had fought forgotten
ancestors. they quickened the old life within him, and the old tricks
which they had stamped into the heredity of the breed were his tricks.
they came to him without effort or discovery, as though they had been
his always. and when, on the still cold nights, he pointed his nose at
a star and howled long and wolflike, it was his ancestors, dead and
dust, pointing nose at star and howling down through the centuries and
through him. and his cadences were their cadences, the cadences which
voiced their woe and what to them was the meaning of the stiffness, and
the cold, and dark.

thus, as token of what a puppet thing life is, the ancient song surged
through him and he came into his own again; and he came because men had
found a yellow metal in the north, and because manuel was a gardener’s
helper whose wages did not lap over the needs of his wife and divers
small copies of himself.



chapter iii. the dominant primordial beast

the dominant primordial beast was strong in buck, and under the fierce
conditions of trail life it grew and grew. yet it was a secret growth.
his newborn cunning gave him poise and control. he was too busy
adjusting himself to the new life to feel at ease, and not only did he
not pick fights, but he avoided them whenever possible. a certain
deliberateness characterized his attitude. he was not prone to rashness
and precipitate action; and in the bitter hatred between him and spitz
he betrayed no impatience, shunned all offensive acts.

on the other hand, possibly because he divined in buck a dangerous
rival, spitz never lost an opportunity of showing his teeth. he even
went out of his way to bully buck, striving constantly to start the
fight which could end only in the death of one or the other. early in
the trip this might have taken place had it not been for an unwonted
accident. at the end of this day they made a bleak and miserable camp
on the shore of lake le barge. driving snow, a wind that cut like a
white-hot knife, and darkness had forced them to grope for a camping
place. they could hardly have fared worse. at their backs rose a
perpendicular wall of rock, and perrault and françois were compelled to
make their fire and spread their sleeping robes on the ice of the lake
itself. the tent they had discarded at dyea in order to travel light. a
few sticks of driftwood furnished them with a fire that thawed down
through the ice and left them to eat supper in the dark.

close in under the sheltering rock buck made his nest. so snug and warm
was it, that he was loath to leave it when françois distributed the
fish which he had first thawed over the fire. but when buck finished
his ration and returned, he found his nest occupied. a warning snarl
told him that the trespasser was spitz. till now buck had avoided
trouble with his enemy, but this was too much. the beast in him roared.
he sprang upon spitz with a fury which surprised them both, and spitz
particularly, for his whole experience with buck had gone to teach him
that his rival was an unusually timid dog, who managed to hold his own
only because of his great weight and size.

françois was surprised, too, when they shot out in a tangle from the
disrupted nest and he divined the cause of the trouble. “a-a-ah!” he
cried to buck. “gif it to heem, by gar! gif it to heem, the dirty
t’eef!”

spitz was equally willing. he was crying with sheer rage and eagerness
as he circled back and forth for a chance to spring in. buck was no
less eager, and no less cautious, as he likewise circled back and forth
for the advantage. but it was then that the unexpected happened, the
thing which projected their struggle for supremacy far into the future,
past many a weary mile of trail and toil.

an oath from perrault, the resounding impact of a club upon a bony
frame, and a shrill yelp of pain, heralded the breaking forth of
pandemonium. the camp was suddenly discovered to be alive with skulking
furry forms,—starving huskies, four or five score of them, who had
scented the camp from some indian village. they had crept in while buck
and spitz were fighting, and when the two men sprang among them with
stout clubs they showed their teeth and fought back. they were crazed
by the smell of the food. perrault found one with head buried in the
grub-box. his club landed heavily on the gaunt ribs, and the grub-box
was capsized on the ground. on the instant a score of the famished
brutes were scrambling for the bread and bacon. the clubs fell upon
them unheeded. they yelped and howled under the rain of blows, but
struggled none the less madly till the last crumb had been devoured.

in the meantime the astonished team-dogs had burst out of their nests
only to be set upon by the fierce invaders. never had buck seen such
dogs. it seemed as though their bones would burst through their skins.
they were mere skeletons, draped loosely in draggled hides, with
blazing eyes and slavered fangs. but the hunger-madness made them
terrifying, irresistible. there was no opposing them. the team-dogs
were swept back against the cliff at the first onset. buck was beset by
three huskies, and in a trice his head and shoulders were ripped and
slashed. the din was frightful. billee was crying as usual. dave and
sol-leks, dripping blood from a score of wounds, were fighting bravely
side by side. joe was snapping like a demon. once, his teeth closed on
the fore leg of a husky, and he crunched down through the bone. pike,
the malingerer, leaped upon the crippled animal, breaking its neck with
a quick flash of teeth and a jerk, buck got a frothing adversary by the
throat, and was sprayed with blood when his teeth sank through the
jugular. the warm taste of it in his mouth goaded him to greater
fierceness. he flung himself upon another, and at the same time felt
teeth sink into his own throat. it was spitz, treacherously attacking
from the side.

perrault and françois, having cleaned out their part of the camp,
hurried to save their sled-dogs. the wild wave of famished beasts
rolled back before them, and buck shook himself free. but it was only
for a moment. the two men were compelled to run back to save the grub,
upon which the huskies returned to the attack on the team. billee,
terrified into bravery, sprang through the savage circle and fled away
over the ice. pike and dub followed on his heels, with the rest of the
team behind. as buck drew himself together to spring after them, out of
the tail of his eye he saw spitz rush upon him with the evident
intention of overthrowing him. once off his feet and under that mass of
huskies, there was no hope for him. but he braced himself to the shock
of spitz’s charge, then joined the flight out on the lake.

later, the nine team-dogs gathered together and sought shelter in the
forest. though unpursued, they were in a sorry plight. there was not
one who was not wounded in four or five places, while some were wounded
grievously. dub was badly injured in a hind leg; dolly, the last husky
added to the team at dyea, had a badly torn throat; joe had lost an
eye; while billee, the good-natured, with an ear chewed and rent to
ribbons, cried and whimpered throughout the night. at daybreak they
limped warily back to camp, to find the marauders gone and the two men
in bad tempers. fully half their grub supply was gone. the huskies had
chewed through the sled lashings and canvas coverings. in fact,
nothing, no matter how remotely eatable, had escaped them. they had
eaten a pair of perrault’s moose-hide moccasins, chunks out of the
leather traces, and even two feet of lash from the end of françois’s
whip. he broke from a mournful contemplation of it to look over his
wounded dogs.

“ah, my frien’s,” he said softly, “mebbe it mek you mad dog, dose many
bites. mebbe all mad dog, sacredam! wot you t’ink, eh, perrault?”

the courier shook his head dubiously. with four hundred miles of trail
still between him and dawson, he could ill afford to have madness break
out among his dogs. two hours of cursing and exertion got the harnesses
into shape, and the wound-stiffened team was under way, struggling
painfully over the hardest part of the trail they had yet encountered,
and for that matter, the hardest between them and dawson.

the thirty mile river was wide open. its wild water defied the frost,
and it was in the eddies only and in the quiet places that the ice held
at all. six days of exhausting toil were required to cover those thirty
terrible miles. and terrible they were, for every foot of them was
accomplished at the risk of life to dog and man. a dozen times,
perrault, nosing the way broke through the ice bridges, being saved by
the long pole he carried, which he so held that it fell each time
across the hole made by his body. but a cold snap was on, the
thermometer registering fifty below zero, and each time he broke
through he was compelled for very life to build a fire and dry his
garments.

nothing daunted him. it was because nothing daunted him that he had
been chosen for government courier. he took all manner of risks,
resolutely thrusting his little weazened face into the frost and
struggling on from dim dawn to dark. he skirted the frowning shores on
rim ice that bent and crackled under foot and upon which they dared not
halt. once, the sled broke through, with dave and buck, and they were
half-frozen and all but drowned by the time they were dragged out. the
usual fire was necessary to save them. they were coated solidly with
ice, and the two men kept them on the run around the fire, sweating and
thawing, so close that they were singed by the flames.

at another time spitz went through, dragging the whole team after him
up to buck, who strained backward with all his strength, his fore paws
on the slippery edge and the ice quivering and snapping all around. but
behind him was dave, likewise straining backward, and behind the sled
was françois, pulling till his tendons cracked.

again, the rim ice broke away before and behind, and there was no
escape except up the cliff. perrault scaled it by a miracle, while
françois prayed for just that miracle; and with every thong and sled
lashing and the last bit of harness rove into a long rope, the dogs
were hoisted, one by one, to the cliff crest. françois came up last,
after the sled and load. then came the search for a place to descend,
which descent was ultimately made by the aid of the rope, and night
found them back on the river with a quarter of a mile to the day’s
credit.

by the time they made the hootalinqua and good ice, buck was played
out. the rest of the dogs were in like condition; but perrault, to make
up lost time, pushed them late and early. the first day they covered
thirty-five miles to the big salmon; the next day thirty-five more to
the little salmon; the third day forty miles, which brought them well
up toward the five fingers.

buck’s feet were not so compact and hard as the feet of the huskies.
his had softened during the many generations since the day his last
wild ancestor was tamed by a cave-dweller or river man. all day long he
limped in agony, and camp once made, lay down like a dead dog. hungry
as he was, he would not move to receive his ration of fish, which
françois had to bring to him. also, the dog-driver rubbed buck’s feet
for half an hour each night after supper, and sacrificed the tops of
his own moccasins to make four moccasins for buck. this was a great
relief, and buck caused even the weazened face of perrault to twist
itself into a grin one morning, when françois forgot the moccasins and
buck lay on his back, his four feet waving appealingly in the air, and
refused to budge without them. later his feet grew hard to the trail,
and the worn-out foot-gear was thrown away.

at the pelly one morning, as they were harnessing up, dolly, who had
never been conspicuous for anything, went suddenly mad. she announced
her condition by a long, heartbreaking wolf howl that sent every dog
bristling with fear, then sprang straight for buck. he had never seen a
dog go mad, nor did he have any reason to fear madness; yet he knew
that here was horror, and fled away from it in a panic. straight away
he raced, with dolly, panting and frothing, one leap behind; nor could
she gain on him, so great was his terror, nor could he leave her, so
great was her madness. he plunged through the wooded breast of the
island, flew down to the lower end, crossed a back channel filled with
rough ice to another island, gained a third island, curved back to the
main river, and in desperation started to cross it. and all the time,
though he did not look, he could hear her snarling just one leap
behind. françois called to him a quarter of a mile away and he doubled
back, still one leap ahead, gasping painfully for air and putting all
his faith in that françois would save him. the dog-driver held the axe
poised in his hand, and as buck shot past him the axe crashed down upon
mad dolly’s head.

buck staggered over against the sled, exhausted, sobbing for breath,
helpless. this was spitz’s opportunity. he sprang upon buck, and twice
his teeth sank into his unresisting foe and ripped and tore the flesh
to the bone. then françois’s lash descended, and buck had the
satisfaction of watching spitz receive the worst whipping as yet
administered to any of the teams.

“one devil, dat spitz,” remarked perrault. “some dam day heem keel dat
buck.”

“dat buck two devils,” was françois’s rejoinder. “all de tam i watch
dat buck i know for sure. lissen: some dam fine day heem get mad lak
hell an’ den heem chew dat spitz all up an’ spit heem out on de snow.
sure. i know.”

from then on it was war between them. spitz, as lead-dog and
acknowledged master of the team, felt his supremacy threatened by this
strange southland dog. and strange buck was to him, for of the many
southland dogs he had known, not one had shown up worthily in camp and
on trail. they were all too soft, dying under the toil, the frost, and
starvation. buck was the exception. he alone endured and prospered,
matching the husky in strength, savagery, and cunning. then he was a
masterful dog, and what made him dangerous was the fact that the club
of the man in the red sweater had knocked all blind pluck and rashness
out of his desire for mastery. he was preeminently cunning, and could
bide his time with a patience that was nothing less than primitive.

it was inevitable that the clash for leadership should come. buck
wanted it. he wanted it because it was his nature, because he had been
gripped tight by that nameless, incomprehensible pride of the trail and
trace—that pride which holds dogs in the toil to the last gasp, which
lures them to die joyfully in the harness, and breaks their hearts if
they are cut out of the harness. this was the pride of dave as
wheel-dog, of sol-leks as he pulled with all his strength; the pride
that laid hold of them at break of camp, transforming them from sour
and sullen brutes into straining, eager, ambitious creatures; the pride
that spurred them on all day and dropped them at pitch of camp at
night, letting them fall back into gloomy unrest and uncontent. this
was the pride that bore up spitz and made him thrash the sled-dogs who
blundered and shirked in the traces or hid away at harness-up time in
the morning. likewise it was this pride that made him fear buck as a
possible lead-dog. and this was buck’s pride, too.

he openly threatened the other’s leadership. he came between him and
the shirks he should have punished. and he did it deliberately. one
night there was a heavy snowfall, and in the morning pike, the
malingerer, did not appear. he was securely hidden in his nest under a
foot of snow. françois called him and sought him in vain. spitz was
wild with wrath. he raged through the camp, smelling and digging in
every likely place, snarling so frightfully that pike heard and
shivered in his hiding-place.

but when he was at last unearthed, and spitz flew at him to punish him,
buck flew, with equal rage, in between. so unexpected was it, and so
shrewdly managed, that spitz was hurled backward and off his feet.
pike, who had been trembling abjectly, took heart at this open mutiny,
and sprang upon his overthrown leader. buck, to whom fair play was a
forgotten code, likewise sprang upon spitz. but françois, chuckling at
the incident while unswerving in the administration of justice, brought
his lash down upon buck with all his might. this failed to drive buck
from his prostrate rival, and the butt of the whip was brought into
play. half-stunned by the blow, buck was knocked backward and the lash
laid upon him again and again, while spitz soundly punished the many
times offending pike.

in the days that followed, as dawson grew closer and closer, buck still
continued to interfere between spitz and the culprits; but he did it
craftily, when françois was not around, with the covert mutiny of buck,
a general insubordination sprang up and increased. dave and sol-leks
were unaffected, but the rest of the team went from bad to worse.
things no longer went right. there was continual bickering and
jangling. trouble was always afoot, and at the bottom of it was buck.
he kept françois busy, for the dog-driver was in constant apprehension
of the life-and-death struggle between the two which he knew must take
place sooner or later; and on more than one night the sounds of
quarrelling and strife among the other dogs turned him out of his
sleeping robe, fearful that buck and spitz were at it.

but the opportunity did not present itself, and they pulled into dawson
one dreary afternoon with the great fight still to come. here were many
men, and countless dogs, and buck found them all at work. it seemed the
ordained order of things that dogs should work. all day they swung up
and down the main street in long teams, and in the night their jingling
bells still went by. they hauled cabin logs and firewood, freighted up
to the mines, and did all manner of work that horses did in the santa
clara valley. here and there buck met southland dogs, but in the main
they were the wild wolf husky breed. every night, regularly, at nine,
at twelve, at three, they lifted a nocturnal song, a weird and eerie
chant, in which it was buck’s delight to join.

with the aurora borealis flaming coldly overhead, or the stars leaping
in the frost dance, and the land numb and frozen under its pall of
snow, this song of the huskies might have been the defiance of life,
only it was pitched in minor key, with long-drawn wailings and
half-sobs, and was more the pleading of life, the articulate travail of
existence. it was an old song, old as the breed itself—one of the first
songs of the younger world in a day when songs were sad. it was
invested with the woe of unnumbered generations, this plaint by which
buck was so strangely stirred. when he moaned and sobbed, it was with
the pain of living that was of old the pain of his wild fathers, and
the fear and mystery of the cold and dark that was to them fear and
mystery. and that he should be stirred by it marked the completeness
with which he harked back through the ages of fire and roof to the raw
beginnings of life in the howling ages.

seven days from the time they pulled into dawson, they dropped down the
steep bank by the barracks to the yukon trail, and pulled for dyea and
salt water. perrault was carrying despatches if anything more urgent
than those he had brought in; also, the travel pride had gripped him,
and he purposed to make the record trip of the year. several things
favored him in this. the week’s rest had recuperated the dogs and put
them in thorough trim. the trail they had broken into the country was
packed hard by later journeyers. and further, the police had arranged
in two or three places deposits of grub for dog and man, and he was
travelling light.

they made sixty mile, which is a fifty-mile run, on the first day; and
the second day saw them booming up the yukon well on their way to
pelly. but such splendid running was achieved not without great trouble
and vexation on the part of françois. the insidious revolt led by buck
had destroyed the solidarity of the team. it no longer was as one dog
leaping in the traces. the encouragement buck gave the rebels led them
into all kinds of petty misdemeanors. no more was spitz a leader
greatly to be feared. the old awe departed, and they grew equal to
challenging his authority. pike robbed him of half a fish one night,
and gulped it down under the protection of buck. another night dub and
joe fought spitz and made him forego the punishment they deserved. and
even billee, the good-natured, was less good-natured, and whined not
half so placatingly as in former days. buck never came near spitz
without snarling and bristling menacingly. in fact, his conduct
approached that of a bully, and he was given to swaggering up and down
before spitz’s very nose.

the breaking down of discipline likewise affected the dogs in their
relations with one another. they quarrelled and bickered more than ever
among themselves, till at times the camp was a howling bedlam. dave and
sol-leks alone were unaltered, though they were made irritable by the
unending squabbling. françois swore strange barbarous oaths, and
stamped the snow in futile rage, and tore his hair. his lash was always
singing among the dogs, but it was of small avail. directly his back
was turned they were at it again. he backed up spitz with his whip,
while buck backed up the remainder of the team. françois knew he was
behind all the trouble, and buck knew he knew; but buck was too clever
ever again to be caught red-handed. he worked faithfully in the
harness, for the toil had become a delight to him; yet it was a greater
delight slyly to precipitate a fight amongst his mates and tangle the
traces.

at the mouth of the tahkeena, one night after supper, dub turned up a
snowshoe rabbit, blundered it, and missed. in a second the whole team
was in full cry. a hundred yards away was a camp of the northwest
police, with fifty dogs, huskies all, who joined the chase. the rabbit
sped down the river, turned off into a small creek, up the frozen bed
of which it held steadily. it ran lightly on the surface of the snow,
while the dogs ploughed through by main strength. buck led the pack,
sixty strong, around bend after bend, but he could not gain. he lay
down low to the race, whining eagerly, his splendid body flashing
forward, leap by leap, in the wan white moonlight. and leap by leap,
like some pale frost wraith, the snowshoe rabbit flashed on ahead.

all that stirring of old instincts which at stated periods drives men
out from the sounding cities to forest and plain to kill things by
chemically propelled leaden pellets, the blood lust, the joy to
kill—all this was buck’s, only it was infinitely more intimate. he was
ranging at the head of the pack, running the wild thing down, the
living meat, to kill with his own teeth and wash his muzzle to the eyes
in warm blood.

there is an ecstasy that marks the summit of life, and beyond which
life cannot rise. and such is the paradox of living, this ecstasy comes
when one is most alive, and it comes as a complete forgetfulness that
one is alive. this ecstasy, this forgetfulness of living, comes to the
artist, caught up and out of himself in a sheet of flame; it comes to
the soldier, war-mad on a stricken field and refusing quarter; and it
came to buck, leading the pack, sounding the old wolf-cry, straining
after the food that was alive and that fled swiftly before him through
the moonlight. he was sounding the deeps of his nature, and of the
parts of his nature that were deeper than he, going back into the womb
of time. he was mastered by the sheer surging of life, the tidal wave
of being, the perfect joy of each separate muscle, joint, and sinew in
that it was everything that was not death, that it was aglow and
rampant, expressing itself in movement, flying exultantly under the
stars and over the face of dead matter that did not move.

but spitz, cold and calculating even in his supreme moods, left the
pack and cut across a narrow neck of land where the creek made a long
bend around. buck did not know of this, and as he rounded the bend, the
frost wraith of a rabbit still flitting before him, he saw another and
larger frost wraith leap from the overhanging bank into the immediate
path of the rabbit. it was spitz. the rabbit could not turn, and as the
white teeth broke its back in mid air it shrieked as loudly as a
stricken man may shriek. at sound of this, the cry of life plunging
down from life’s apex in the grip of death, the fall pack at buck’s
heels raised a hell’s chorus of delight.

buck did not cry out. he did not check himself, but drove in upon
spitz, shoulder to shoulder, so hard that he missed the throat. they
rolled over and over in the powdery snow. spitz gained his feet almost
as though he had not been overthrown, slashing buck down the shoulder
and leaping clear. twice his teeth clipped together, like the steel
jaws of a trap, as he backed away for better footing, with lean and
lifting lips that writhed and snarled.

in a flash buck knew it. the time had come. it was to the death. as
they circled about, snarling, ears laid back, keenly watchful for the
advantage, the scene came to buck with a sense of familiarity. he
seemed to remember it all,—the white woods, and earth, and moonlight,
and the thrill of battle. over the whiteness and silence brooded a
ghostly calm. there was not the faintest whisper of air—nothing moved,
not a leaf quivered, the visible breaths of the dogs rising slowly and
lingering in the frosty air. they had made short work of the snowshoe
rabbit, these dogs that were ill-tamed wolves; and they were now drawn
up in an expectant circle. they, too, were silent, their eyes only
gleaming and their breaths drifting slowly upward. to buck it was
nothing new or strange, this scene of old time. it was as though it had
always been, the wonted way of things.

spitz was a practised fighter. from spitzbergen through the arctic, and
across canada and the barrens, he had held his own with all manner of
dogs and achieved to mastery over them. bitter rage was his, but never
blind rage. in passion to rend and destroy, he never forgot that his
enemy was in like passion to rend and destroy. he never rushed till he
was prepared to receive a rush; never attacked till he had first
defended that attack.

in vain buck strove to sink his teeth in the neck of the big white dog.
wherever his fangs struck for the softer flesh, they were countered by
the fangs of spitz. fang clashed fang, and lips were cut and bleeding,
but buck could not penetrate his enemy’s guard. then he warmed up and
enveloped spitz in a whirlwind of rushes. time and time again he tried
for the snow-white throat, where life bubbled near to the surface, and
each time and every time spitz slashed him and got away. then buck took
to rushing, as though for the throat, when, suddenly drawing back his
head and curving in from the side, he would drive his shoulder at the
shoulder of spitz, as a ram by which to overthrow him. but instead,
buck’s shoulder was slashed down each time as spitz leaped lightly
away.

spitz was untouched, while buck was streaming with blood and panting
hard. the fight was growing desperate. and all the while the silent and
wolfish circle waited to finish off whichever dog went down. as buck
grew winded, spitz took to rushing, and he kept him staggering for
footing. once buck went over, and the whole circle of sixty dogs
started up; but he recovered himself, almost in mid air, and the circle
sank down again and waited.

but buck possessed a quality that made for greatness—imagination. he
fought by instinct, but he could fight by head as well. he rushed, as
though attempting the old shoulder trick, but at the last instant swept
low to the snow and in. his teeth closed on spitz’s left fore leg.
there was a crunch of breaking bone, and the white dog faced him on
three legs. thrice he tried to knock him over, then repeated the trick
and broke the right fore leg. despite the pain and helplessness, spitz
struggled madly to keep up. he saw the silent circle, with gleaming
eyes, lolling tongues, and silvery breaths drifting upward, closing in
upon him as he had seen similar circles close in upon beaten
antagonists in the past. only this time he was the one who was beaten.

there was no hope for him. buck was inexorable. mercy was a thing
reserved for gentler climes. he manœuvred for the final rush. the
circle had tightened till he could feel the breaths of the huskies on
his flanks. he could see them, beyond spitz and to either side, half
crouching for the spring, their eyes fixed upon him. a pause seemed to
fall. every animal was motionless as though turned to stone. only spitz
quivered and bristled as he staggered back and forth, snarling with
horrible menace, as though to frighten off impending death. then buck
sprang in and out; but while he was in, shoulder had at last squarely
met shoulder. the dark circle became a dot on the moon-flooded snow as
spitz disappeared from view. buck stood and looked on, the successful
champion, the dominant primordial beast who had made his kill and found
it good.



chapter iv. who has won to mastership

“eh? wot i say? i spik true w’en i say dat buck two devils.” this was
françois’s speech next morning when he discovered spitz missing and
buck covered with wounds. he drew him to the fire and by its light
pointed them out.

“dat spitz fight lak hell,” said perrault, as he surveyed the gaping
rips and cuts.

“an’ dat buck fight lak two hells,” was françois’s answer. “an’ now we
make good time. no more spitz, no more trouble, sure.”

while perrault packed the camp outfit and loaded the sled, the
dog-driver proceeded to harness the dogs. buck trotted up to the place
spitz would have occupied as leader; but françois, not noticing him,
brought sol-leks to the coveted position. in his judgment, sol-leks was
the best lead-dog left. buck sprang upon sol-leks in a fury, driving
him back and standing in his place.

“eh? eh?” françois cried, slapping his thighs gleefully. “look at dat
buck. heem keel dat spitz, heem t’ink to take de job.”

“go ’way, chook!” he cried, but buck refused to budge.

he took buck by the scruff of the neck, and though the dog growled
threateningly, dragged him to one side and replaced sol-leks. the old
dog did not like it, and showed plainly that he was afraid of buck.
françois was obdurate, but when he turned his back buck again displaced
sol-leks, who was not at all unwilling to go.

françois was angry. “now, by gar, i feex you!” he cried, coming back
with a heavy club in his hand.

buck remembered the man in the red sweater, and retreated slowly; nor
did he attempt to charge in when sol-leks was once more brought
forward. but he circled just beyond the range of the club, snarling
with bitterness and rage; and while he circled he watched the club so
as to dodge it if thrown by françois, for he was become wise in the way
of clubs. the driver went about his work, and he called to buck when he
was ready to put him in his old place in front of dave. buck retreated
two or three steps. françois followed him up, whereupon he again
retreated. after some time of this, françois threw down the club,
thinking that buck feared a thrashing. but buck was in open revolt. he
wanted, not to escape a clubbing, but to have the leadership. it was
his by right. he had earned it, and he would not be content with less.

perrault took a hand. between them they ran him about for the better
part of an hour. they threw clubs at him. he dodged. they cursed him,
and his fathers and mothers before him, and all his seed to come after
him down to the remotest generation, and every hair on his body and
drop of blood in his veins; and he answered curse with snarl and kept
out of their reach. he did not try to run away, but retreated around
and around the camp, advertising plainly that when his desire was met,
he would come in and be good.

françois sat down and scratched his head. perrault looked at his watch
and swore. time was flying, and they should have been on the trail an
hour gone. françois scratched his head again. he shook it and grinned
sheepishly at the courier, who shrugged his shoulders in sign that they
were beaten. then françois went up to where sol-leks stood and called
to buck. buck laughed, as dogs laugh, yet kept his distance. françois
unfastened sol-leks’s traces and put him back in his old place. the
team stood harnessed to the sled in an unbroken line, ready for the
trail. there was no place for buck save at the front. once more
françois called, and once more buck laughed and kept away.

“t’row down de club,” perrault commanded.

françois complied, whereupon buck trotted in, laughing triumphantly,
and swung around into position at the head of the team. his traces were
fastened, the sled broken out, and with both men running they dashed
out on to the river trail.

highly as the dog-driver had forevalued buck, with his two devils, he
found, while the day was yet young, that he had undervalued. at a bound
buck took up the duties of leadership; and where judgment was required,
and quick thinking and quick acting, he showed himself the superior
even of spitz, of whom françois had never seen an equal.

but it was in giving the law and making his mates live up to it, that
buck excelled. dave and sol-leks did not mind the change in leadership.
it was none of their business. their business was to toil, and toil
mightily, in the traces. so long as that were not interfered with, they
did not care what happened. billee, the good-natured, could lead for
all they cared, so long as he kept order. the rest of the team,
however, had grown unruly during the last days of spitz, and their
surprise was great now that buck proceeded to lick them into shape.

pike, who pulled at buck’s heels, and who never put an ounce more of
his weight against the breast-band than he was compelled to do, was
swiftly and repeatedly shaken for loafing; and ere the first day was
done he was pulling more than ever before in his life. the first night
in camp, joe, the sour one, was punished roundly—a thing that spitz had
never succeeded in doing. buck simply smothered him by virtue of
superior weight, and cut him up till he ceased snapping and began to
whine for mercy.

the general tone of the team picked up immediately. it recovered its
old-time solidarity, and once more the dogs leaped as one dog in the
traces. at the rink rapids two native huskies, teek and koona, were
added; and the celerity with which buck broke them in took away
françois’s breath.

“nevaire such a dog as dat buck!” he cried. “no, nevaire! heem worth
one t’ousan’ dollair, by gar! eh? wot you say, perrault?”

and perrault nodded. he was ahead of the record then, and gaining day
by day. the trail was in excellent condition, well packed and hard, and
there was no new-fallen snow with which to contend. it was not too
cold. the temperature dropped to fifty below zero and remained there
the whole trip. the men rode and ran by turn, and the dogs were kept on
the jump, with but infrequent stoppages.

the thirty mile river was comparatively coated with ice, and they
covered in one day going out what had taken them ten days coming in. in
one run they made a sixty-mile dash from the foot of lake le barge to
the white horse rapids. across marsh, tagish, and bennett (seventy
miles of lakes), they flew so fast that the man whose turn it was to
run towed behind the sled at the end of a rope. and on the last night
of the second week they topped white pass and dropped down the sea
slope with the lights of skaguay and of the shipping at their feet.

it was a record run. each day for fourteen days they had averaged forty
miles. for three days perrault and françois threw chests up and down
the main street of skaguay and were deluged with invitations to drink,
while the team was the constant centre of a worshipful crowd of
dog-busters and mushers. then three or four western bad men aspired to
clean out the town, were riddled like pepper-boxes for their pains, and
public interest turned to other idols. next came official orders.
françois called buck to him, threw his arms around him, wept over him.
and that was the last of françois and perrault. like other men, they
passed out of buck’s life for good.

a scotch half-breed took charge of him and his mates, and in company
with a dozen other dog-teams he started back over the weary trail to
dawson. it was no light running now, nor record time, but heavy toil
each day, with a heavy load behind; for this was the mail train,
carrying word from the world to the men who sought gold under the
shadow of the pole.

buck did not like it, but he bore up well to the work, taking pride in
it after the manner of dave and sol-leks, and seeing that his mates,
whether they prided in it or not, did their fair share. it was a
monotonous life, operating with machine-like regularity. one day was
very like another. at a certain time each morning the cooks turned out,
fires were built, and breakfast was eaten. then, while some broke camp,
others harnessed the dogs, and they were under way an hour or so before
the darkness fell which gave warning of dawn. at night, camp was made.
some pitched the flies, others cut firewood and pine boughs for the
beds, and still others carried water or ice for the cooks. also, the
dogs were fed. to them, this was the one feature of the day, though it
was good to loaf around, after the fish was eaten, for an hour or so
with the other dogs, of which there were fivescore and odd. there were
fierce fighters among them, but three battles with the fiercest brought
buck to mastery, so that when he bristled and showed his teeth they got
out of his way.

best of all, perhaps, he loved to lie near the fire, hind legs crouched
under him, fore legs stretched out in front, head raised, and eyes
blinking dreamily at the flames. sometimes he thought of judge miller’s
big house in the sun-kissed santa clara valley, and of the cement
swimming-tank, and ysabel, the mexican hairless, and toots, the
japanese pug; but oftener he remembered the man in the red sweater, the
death of curly, the great fight with spitz, and the good things he had
eaten or would like to eat. he was not homesick. the sunland was very
dim and distant, and such memories had no power over him. far more
potent were the memories of his heredity that gave things he had never
seen before a seeming familiarity; the instincts (which were but the
memories of his ancestors become habits) which had lapsed in later
days, and still later, in him, quickened and become alive again.

sometimes as he crouched there, blinking dreamily at the flames, it
seemed that the flames were of another fire, and that as he crouched by
this other fire he saw another and different man from the half-breed
cook before him. this other man was shorter of leg and longer of arm,
with muscles that were stringy and knotty rather than rounded and
swelling. the hair of this man was long and matted, and his head
slanted back under it from the eyes. he uttered strange sounds, and
seemed very much afraid of the darkness, into which he peered
continually, clutching in his hand, which hung midway between knee and
foot, a stick with a heavy stone made fast to the end. he was all but
naked, a ragged and fire-scorched skin hanging part way down his back,
but on his body there was much hair. in some places, across the chest
and shoulders and down the outside of the arms and thighs, it was
matted into almost a thick fur. he did not stand erect, but with trunk
inclined forward from the hips, on legs that bent at the knees. about
his body there was a peculiar springiness, or resiliency, almost
catlike, and a quick alertness as of one who lived in perpetual fear of
things seen and unseen.

at other times this hairy man squatted by the fire with head between
his legs and slept. on such occasions his elbows were on his knees, his
hands clasped above his head as though to shed rain by the hairy arms.
and beyond that fire, in the circling darkness, buck could see many
gleaming coals, two by two, always two by two, which he knew to be the
eyes of great beasts of prey. and he could hear the crashing of their
bodies through the undergrowth, and the noises they made in the night.
and dreaming there by the yukon bank, with lazy eyes blinking at the
fire, these sounds and sights of another world would make the hair to
rise along his back and stand on end across his shoulders and up his
neck, till he whimpered low and suppressedly, or growled softly, and
the half-breed cook shouted at him, “hey, you buck, wake up!” whereupon
the other world would vanish and the real world come into his eyes, and
he would get up and yawn and stretch as though he had been asleep.

it was a hard trip, with the mail behind them, and the heavy work wore
them down. they were short of weight and in poor condition when they
made dawson, and should have had a ten days’ or a week’s rest at least.
but in two days’ time they dropped down the yukon bank from the
barracks, loaded with letters for the outside. the dogs were tired, the
drivers grumbling, and to make matters worse, it snowed every day. this
meant a soft trail, greater friction on the runners, and heavier
pulling for the dogs; yet the drivers were fair through it all, and did
their best for the animals.

each night the dogs were attended to first. they ate before the drivers
ate, and no man sought his sleeping-robe till he had seen to the feet
of the dogs he drove. still, their strength went down. since the
beginning of the winter they had travelled eighteen hundred miles,
dragging sleds the whole weary distance; and eighteen hundred miles
will tell upon life of the toughest. buck stood it, keeping his mates
up to their work and maintaining discipline, though he, too, was very
tired. billee cried and whimpered regularly in his sleep each night.
joe was sourer than ever, and sol-leks was unapproachable, blind side
or other side.

but it was dave who suffered most of all. something had gone wrong with
him. he became more morose and irritable, and when camp was pitched at
once made his nest, where his driver fed him. once out of the harness
and down, he did not get on his feet again till harness-up time in the
morning. sometimes, in the traces, when jerked by a sudden stoppage of
the sled, or by straining to start it, he would cry out with pain. the
driver examined him, but could find nothing. all the drivers became
interested in his case. they talked it over at meal-time, and over
their last pipes before going to bed, and one night they held a
consultation. he was brought from his nest to the fire and was pressed
and prodded till he cried out many times. something was wrong inside,
but they could locate no broken bones, could not make it out.

by the time cassiar bar was reached, he was so weak that he was falling
repeatedly in the traces. the scotch half-breed called a halt and took
him out of the team, making the next dog, sol-leks, fast to the sled.
his intention was to rest dave, letting him run free behind the sled.
sick as he was, dave resented being taken out, grunting and growling
while the traces were unfastened, and whimpering broken-heartedly when
he saw sol-leks in the position he had held and served so long. for the
pride of trace and trail was his, and, sick unto death, he could not
bear that another dog should do his work.

when the sled started, he floundered in the soft snow alongside the
beaten trail, attacking sol-leks with his teeth, rushing against him
and trying to thrust him off into the soft snow on the other side,
striving to leap inside his traces and get between him and the sled,
and all the while whining and yelping and crying with grief and pain.
the half-breed tried to drive him away with the whip; but he paid no
heed to the stinging lash, and the man had not the heart to strike
harder. dave refused to run quietly on the trail behind the sled, where
the going was easy, but continued to flounder alongside in the soft
snow, where the going was most difficult, till exhausted. then he fell,
and lay where he fell, howling lugubriously as the long train of sleds
churned by.

with the last remnant of his strength he managed to stagger along
behind till the train made another stop, when he floundered past the
sleds to his own, where he stood alongside sol-leks. his driver
lingered a moment to get a light for his pipe from the man behind. then
he returned and started his dogs. they swung out on the trail with
remarkable lack of exertion, turned their heads uneasily, and stopped
in surprise. the driver was surprised, too; the sled had not moved. he
called his comrades to witness the sight. dave had bitten through both
of sol-leks’s traces, and was standing directly in front of the sled in
his proper place.

he pleaded with his eyes to remain there. the driver was perplexed. his
comrades talked of how a dog could break its heart through being denied
the work that killed it, and recalled instances they had known, where
dogs, too old for the toil, or injured, had died because they were cut
out of the traces. also, they held it a mercy, since dave was to die
anyway, that he should die in the traces, heart-easy and content. so he
was harnessed in again, and proudly he pulled as of old, though more
than once he cried out involuntarily from the bite of his inward hurt.
several times he fell down and was dragged in the traces, and once the
sled ran upon him so that he limped thereafter in one of his hind legs.

but he held out till camp was reached, when his driver made a place for
him by the fire. morning found him too weak to travel. at harness-up
time he tried to crawl to his driver. by convulsive efforts he got on
his feet, staggered, and fell. then he wormed his way forward slowly
toward where the harnesses were being put on his mates. he would
advance his fore legs and drag up his body with a sort of hitching
movement, when he would advance his fore legs and hitch ahead again for
a few more inches. his strength left him, and the last his mates saw of
him he lay gasping in the snow and yearning toward them. but they could
hear him mournfully howling till they passed out of sight behind a belt
of river timber.

here the train was halted. the scotch half-breed slowly retraced his
steps to the camp they had left. the men ceased talking. a
revolver-shot rang out. the man came back hurriedly. the whips snapped,
the bells tinkled merrily, the sleds churned along the trail; but buck
knew, and every dog knew, what had taken place behind the belt of river
trees.



chapter v. the toil of trace and trail

thirty days from the time it left dawson, the salt water mail, with
buck and his mates at the fore, arrived at skaguay. they were in a
wretched state, worn out and worn down. buck’s one hundred and forty
pounds had dwindled to one hundred and fifteen. the rest of his mates,
though lighter dogs, had relatively lost more weight than he. pike, the
malingerer, who, in his lifetime of deceit, had often successfully
feigned a hurt leg, was now limping in earnest. sol-leks was limping,
and dub was suffering from a wrenched shoulder-blade.

they were all terribly footsore. no spring or rebound was left in them.
their feet fell heavily on the trail, jarring their bodies and doubling
the fatigue of a day’s travel. there was nothing the matter with them
except that they were dead tired. it was not the dead-tiredness that
comes through brief and excessive effort, from which recovery is a
matter of hours; but it was the dead-tiredness that comes through the
slow and prolonged strength drainage of months of toil. there was no
power of recuperation left, no reserve strength to call upon. it had
been all used, the last least bit of it. every muscle, every fibre,
every cell, was tired, dead tired. and there was reason for it. in less
than five months they had travelled twenty-five hundred miles, during
the last eighteen hundred of which they had had but five days’ rest.
when they arrived at skaguay they were apparently on their last legs.
they could barely keep the traces taut, and on the down grades just
managed to keep out of the way of the sled.

“mush on, poor sore feets,” the driver encouraged them as they tottered
down the main street of skaguay. “dis is de las’. den we get one long
res’. eh? for sure. one bully long res’.”

the drivers confidently expected a long stopover. themselves, they had
covered twelve hundred miles with two days’ rest, and in the nature of
reason and common justice they deserved an interval of loafing. but so
many were the men who had rushed into the klondike, and so many were
the sweethearts, wives, and kin that had not rushed in, that the
congested mail was taking on alpine proportions; also, there were
official orders. fresh batches of hudson bay dogs were to take the
places of those worthless for the trail. the worthless ones were to be
got rid of, and, since dogs count for little against dollars, they were
to be sold.

three days passed, by which time buck and his mates found how really
tired and weak they were. then, on the morning of the fourth day, two
men from the states came along and bought them, harness and all, for a
song. the men addressed each other as “hal” and “charles.” charles was
a middle-aged, lightish-colored man, with weak and watery eyes and a
mustache that twisted fiercely and vigorously up, giving the lie to the
limply drooping lip it concealed. hal was a youngster of nineteen or
twenty, with a big colt’s revolver and a hunting-knife strapped about
him on a belt that fairly bristled with cartridges. this belt was the
most salient thing about him. it advertised his callowness—a callowness
sheer and unutterable. both men were manifestly out of place, and why
such as they should adventure the north is part of the mystery of
things that passes understanding.

buck heard the chaffering, saw the money pass between the man and the
government agent, and knew that the scotch half-breed and the
mail-train drivers were passing out of his life on the heels of
perrault and françois and the others who had gone before. when driven
with his mates to the new owners’ camp, buck saw a slipshod and
slovenly affair, tent half stretched, dishes unwashed, everything in
disorder; also, he saw a woman. “mercedes” the men called her. she was
charles’s wife and hal’s sister—a nice family party.

buck watched them apprehensively as they proceeded to take down the
tent and load the sled. there was a great deal of effort about their
manner, but no businesslike method. the tent was rolled into an awkward
bundle three times as large as it should have been. the tin dishes were
packed away unwashed. mercedes continually fluttered in the way of her
men and kept up an unbroken chattering of remonstrance and advice. when
they put a clothes-sack on the front of the sled, she suggested it
should go on the back; and when they had put it on the back, and
covered it over with a couple of other bundles, she discovered
overlooked articles which could abide nowhere else but in that very
sack, and they unloaded again.

three men from a neighboring tent came out and looked on, grinning and
winking at one another.

“you’ve got a right smart load as it is,” said one of them; “and it’s
not me should tell you your business, but i wouldn’t tote that tent
along if i was you.”

“undreamed of!” cried mercedes, throwing up her hands in dainty dismay.
“however in the world could i manage without a tent?”

“it’s springtime, and you won’t get any more cold weather,” the man
replied.

she shook her head decidedly, and charles and hal put the last odds and
ends on top the mountainous load.

“think it’ll ride?” one of the men asked.

“why shouldn’t it?” charles demanded rather shortly.

“oh, that’s all right, that’s all right,” the man hastened meekly to
say. “i was just a-wonderin’, that is all. it seemed a mite top-heavy.”

charles turned his back and drew the lashings down as well as he could,
which was not in the least well.

“an’ of course the dogs can hike along all day with that contraption
behind them,” affirmed a second of the men.

“certainly,” said hal, with freezing politeness, taking hold of the
gee-pole with one hand and swinging his whip from the other. “mush!” he
shouted. “mush on there!”

the dogs sprang against the breast-bands, strained hard for a few
moments, then relaxed. they were unable to move the sled.

“the lazy brutes, i’ll show them,” he cried, preparing to lash out at
them with the whip.

but mercedes interfered, crying, “oh, hal, you mustn’t,” as she caught
hold of the whip and wrenched it from him. “the poor dears! now you
must promise you won’t be harsh with them for the rest of the trip, or
i won’t go a step.”

“precious lot you know about dogs,” her brother sneered; “and i wish
you’d leave me alone. they’re lazy, i tell you, and you’ve got to whip
them to get anything out of them. that’s their way. you ask any one.
ask one of those men.”

mercedes looked at them imploringly, untold repugnance at sight of pain
written in her pretty face.

“they’re weak as water, if you want to know,” came the reply from one
of the men. “plum tuckered out, that’s what’s the matter. they need a
rest.”

“rest be blanked,” said hal, with his beardless lips; and mercedes
said, “oh!” in pain and sorrow at the oath.

but she was a clannish creature, and rushed at once to the defence of
her brother. “never mind that man,” she said pointedly. “you’re driving
our dogs, and you do what you think best with them.”

again hal’s whip fell upon the dogs. they threw themselves against the
breast-bands, dug their feet into the packed snow, got down low to it,
and put forth all their strength. the sled held as though it were an
anchor. after two efforts, they stood still, panting. the whip was
whistling savagely, when once more mercedes interfered. she dropped on
her knees before buck, with tears in her eyes, and put her arms around
his neck.

“you poor, poor dears,” she cried sympathetically, “why don’t you pull
hard?—then you wouldn’t be whipped.” buck did not like her, but he was
feeling too miserable to resist her, taking it as part of the day’s
miserable work.

one of the onlookers, who had been clenching his teeth to suppress hot
speech, now spoke up:—

“it’s not that i care a whoop what becomes of you, but for the dogs’
sakes i just want to tell you, you can help them a mighty lot by
breaking out that sled. the runners are froze fast. throw your weight
against the gee-pole, right and left, and break it out.”

a third time the attempt was made, but this time, following the advice,
hal broke out the runners which had been frozen to the snow. the
overloaded and unwieldy sled forged ahead, buck and his mates
struggling frantically under the rain of blows. a hundred yards ahead
the path turned and sloped steeply into the main street. it would have
required an experienced man to keep the top-heavy sled upright, and hal
was not such a man. as they swung on the turn the sled went over,
spilling half its load through the loose lashings. the dogs never
stopped. the lightened sled bounded on its side behind them. they were
angry because of the ill treatment they had received and the unjust
load. buck was raging. he broke into a run, the team following his
lead. hal cried “whoa! whoa!” but they gave no heed. he tripped and was
pulled off his feet. the capsized sled ground over him, and the dogs
dashed on up the street, adding to the gayety of skaguay as they
scattered the remainder of the outfit along its chief thoroughfare.

kind-hearted citizens caught the dogs and gathered up the scattered
belongings. also, they gave advice. half the load and twice the dogs,
if they ever expected to reach dawson, was what was said. hal and his
sister and brother-in-law listened unwillingly, pitched tent, and
overhauled the outfit. canned goods were turned out that made men
laugh, for canned goods on the long trail is a thing to dream about.
“blankets for a hotel” quoth one of the men who laughed and helped.
“half as many is too much; get rid of them. throw away that tent, and
all those dishes,—who’s going to wash them, anyway? good lord, do you
think you’re travelling on a pullman?”

and so it went, the inexorable elimination of the superfluous. mercedes
cried when her clothes-bags were dumped on the ground and article after
article was thrown out. she cried in general, and she cried in
particular over each discarded thing. she clasped hands about knees,
rocking back and forth broken-heartedly. she averred she would not go
an inch, not for a dozen charleses. she appealed to everybody and to
everything, finally wiping her eyes and proceeding to cast out even
articles of apparel that were imperative necessaries. and in her zeal,
when she had finished with her own, she attacked the belongings of her
men and went through them like a tornado.

this accomplished, the outfit, though cut in half, was still a
formidable bulk. charles and hal went out in the evening and bought six
outside dogs. these, added to the six of the original team, and teek
and koona, the huskies obtained at the rink rapids on the record trip,
brought the team up to fourteen. but the outside dogs, though
practically broken in since their landing, did not amount to much.
three were short-haired pointers, one was a newfoundland, and the other
two were mongrels of indeterminate breed. they did not seem to know
anything, these newcomers. buck and his comrades looked upon them with
disgust, and though he speedily taught them their places and what not
to do, he could not teach them what to do. they did not take kindly to
trace and trail. with the exception of the two mongrels, they were
bewildered and spirit-broken by the strange savage environment in which
they found themselves and by the ill treatment they had received. the
two mongrels were without spirit at all; bones were the only things
breakable about them.

with the newcomers hopeless and forlorn, and the old team worn out by
twenty-five hundred miles of continuous trail, the outlook was anything
but bright. the two men, however, were quite cheerful. and they were
proud, too. they were doing the thing in style, with fourteen dogs.
they had seen other sleds depart over the pass for dawson, or come in
from dawson, but never had they seen a sled with so many as fourteen
dogs. in the nature of arctic travel there was a reason why fourteen
dogs should not drag one sled, and that was that one sled could not
carry the food for fourteen dogs. but charles and hal did not know
this. they had worked the trip out with a pencil, so much to a dog, so
many dogs, so many days, q.e.d. mercedes looked over their shoulders
and nodded comprehensively, it was all so very simple.

late next morning buck led the long team up the street. there was
nothing lively about it, no snap or go in him and his fellows. they
were starting dead weary. four times he had covered the distance
between salt water and dawson, and the knowledge that, jaded and tired,
he was facing the same trail once more, made him bitter. his heart was
not in the work, nor was the heart of any dog. the outsides were timid
and frightened, the insides without confidence in their masters.

buck felt vaguely that there was no depending upon these two men and
the woman. they did not know how to do anything, and as the days went
by it became apparent that they could not learn. they were slack in all
things, without order or discipline. it took them half the night to
pitch a slovenly camp, and half the morning to break that camp and get
the sled loaded in fashion so slovenly that for the rest of the day
they were occupied in stopping and rearranging the load. some days they
did not make ten miles. on other days they were unable to get started
at all. and on no day did they succeed in making more than half the
distance used by the men as a basis in their dog-food computation.

it was inevitable that they should go short on dog-food. but they
hastened it by overfeeding, bringing the day nearer when underfeeding
would commence. the outside dogs, whose digestions had not been trained
by chronic famine to make the most of little, had voracious appetites.
and when, in addition to this, the worn-out huskies pulled weakly, hal
decided that the orthodox ration was too small. he doubled it. and to
cap it all, when mercedes, with tears in her pretty eyes and a quaver
in her throat, could not cajole him into giving the dogs still more,
she stole from the fish-sacks and fed them slyly. but it was not food
that buck and the huskies needed, but rest. and though they were making
poor time, the heavy load they dragged sapped their strength severely.

then came the underfeeding. hal awoke one day to the fact that his
dog-food was half gone and the distance only quarter covered; further,
that for love or money no additional dog-food was to be obtained. so he
cut down even the orthodox ration and tried to increase the day’s
travel. his sister and brother-in-law seconded him; but they were
frustrated by their heavy outfit and their own incompetence. it was a
simple matter to give the dogs less food; but it was impossible to make
the dogs travel faster, while their own inability to get under way
earlier in the morning prevented them from travelling longer hours. not
only did they not know how to work dogs, but they did not know how to
work themselves.

the first to go was dub. poor blundering thief that he was, always
getting caught and punished, he had none the less been a faithful
worker. his wrenched shoulder-blade, untreated and unrested, went from
bad to worse, till finally hal shot him with the big colt’s revolver.
it is a saying of the country that an outside dog starves to death on
the ration of the husky, so the six outside dogs under buck could do no
less than die on half the ration of the husky. the newfoundland went
first, followed by the three short-haired pointers, the two mongrels
hanging more grittily on to life, but going in the end.

by this time all the amenities and gentlenesses of the southland had
fallen away from the three people. shorn of its glamour and romance,
arctic travel became to them a reality too harsh for their manhood and
womanhood. mercedes ceased weeping over the dogs, being too occupied
with weeping over herself and with quarrelling with her husband and
brother. to quarrel was the one thing they were never too weary to do.
their irritability arose out of their misery, increased with it,
doubled upon it, outdistanced it. the wonderful patience of the trail
which comes to men who toil hard and suffer sore, and remain sweet of
speech and kindly, did not come to these two men and the woman. they
had no inkling of such a patience. they were stiff and in pain; their
muscles ached, their bones ached, their very hearts ached; and because
of this they became sharp of speech, and hard words were first on their
lips in the morning and last at night.

charles and hal wrangled whenever mercedes gave them a chance. it was
the cherished belief of each that he did more than his share of the
work, and neither forbore to speak this belief at every opportunity.
sometimes mercedes sided with her husband, sometimes with her brother.
the result was a beautiful and unending family quarrel. starting from a
dispute as to which should chop a few sticks for the fire (a dispute
which concerned only charles and hal), presently would be lugged in the
rest of the family, fathers, mothers, uncles, cousins, people thousands
of miles away, and some of them dead. that hal’s views on art, or the
sort of society plays his mother’s brother wrote, should have anything
to do with the chopping of a few sticks of firewood, passes
comprehension; nevertheless the quarrel was as likely to tend in that
direction as in the direction of charles’s political prejudices. and
that charles’s sister’s tale-bearing tongue should be relevant to the
building of a yukon fire, was apparent only to mercedes, who
disburdened herself of copious opinions upon that topic, and
incidentally upon a few other traits unpleasantly peculiar to her
husband’s family. in the meantime the fire remained unbuilt, the camp
half pitched, and the dogs unfed.

mercedes nursed a special grievance—the grievance of sex. she was
pretty and soft, and had been chivalrously treated all her days. but
the present treatment by her husband and brother was everything save
chivalrous. it was her custom to be helpless. they complained. upon
which impeachment of what to her was her most essential
sex-prerogative, she made their lives unendurable. she no longer
considered the dogs, and because she was sore and tired, she persisted
in riding on the sled. she was pretty and soft, but she weighed one
hundred and twenty pounds—a lusty last straw to the load dragged by the
weak and starving animals. she rode for days, till they fell in the
traces and the sled stood still. charles and hal begged her to get off
and walk, pleaded with her, entreated, the while she wept and
importuned heaven with a recital of their brutality.

on one occasion they took her off the sled by main strength. they never
did it again. she let her legs go limp like a spoiled child, and sat
down on the trail. they went on their way, but she did not move. after
they had travelled three miles they unloaded the sled, came back for
her, and by main strength put her on the sled again.

in the excess of their own misery they were callous to the suffering of
their animals. hal’s theory, which he practised on others, was that one
must get hardened. he had started out preaching it to his sister and
brother-in-law. failing there, he hammered it into the dogs with a
club. at the five fingers the dog-food gave out, and a toothless old
squaw offered to trade them a few pounds of frozen horse-hide for the
colt’s revolver that kept the big hunting-knife company at hal’s hip. a
poor substitute for food was this hide, just as it had been stripped
from the starved horses of the cattlemen six months back. in its frozen
state it was more like strips of galvanized iron, and when a dog
wrestled it into his stomach it thawed into thin and innutritious
leathery strings and into a mass of short hair, irritating and
indigestible.

and through it all buck staggered along at the head of the team as in a
nightmare. he pulled when he could; when he could no longer pull, he
fell down and remained down till blows from whip or club drove him to
his feet again. all the stiffness and gloss had gone out of his
beautiful furry coat. the hair hung down, limp and draggled, or matted
with dried blood where hal’s club had bruised him. his muscles had
wasted away to knotty strings, and the flesh pads had disappeared, so
that each rib and every bone in his frame were outlined cleanly through
the loose hide that was wrinkled in folds of emptiness. it was
heartbreaking, only buck’s heart was unbreakable. the man in the red
sweater had proved that.

as it was with buck, so was it with his mates. they were perambulating
skeletons. there were seven all together, including him. in their very
great misery they had become insensible to the bite of the lash or the
bruise of the club. the pain of the beating was dull and distant, just
as the things their eyes saw and their ears heard seemed dull and
distant. they were not half living, or quarter living. they were simply
so many bags of bones in which sparks of life fluttered faintly. when a
halt was made, they dropped down in the traces like dead dogs, and the
spark dimmed and paled and seemed to go out. and when the club or whip
fell upon them, the spark fluttered feebly up, and they tottered to
their feet and staggered on.

there came a day when billee, the good-natured, fell and could not
rise. hal had traded off his revolver, so he took the axe and knocked
billee on the head as he lay in the traces, then cut the carcass out of
the harness and dragged it to one side. buck saw, and his mates saw,
and they knew that this thing was very close to them. on the next day
koona went, and but five of them remained: joe, too far gone to be
malignant; pike, crippled and limping, only half conscious and not
conscious enough longer to malinger; sol-leks, the one-eyed, still
faithful to the toil of trace and trail, and mournful in that he had so
little strength with which to pull; teek, who had not travelled so far
that winter and who was now beaten more than the others because he was
fresher; and buck, still at the head of the team, but no longer
enforcing discipline or striving to enforce it, blind with weakness
half the time and keeping the trail by the loom of it and by the dim
feel of his feet.

it was beautiful spring weather, but neither dogs nor humans were aware
of it. each day the sun rose earlier and set later. it was dawn by
three in the morning, and twilight lingered till nine at night. the
whole long day was a blaze of sunshine. the ghostly winter silence had
given way to the great spring murmur of awakening life. this murmur
arose from all the land, fraught with the joy of living. it came from
the things that lived and moved again, things which had been as dead
and which had not moved during the long months of frost. the sap was
rising in the pines. the willows and aspens were bursting out in young
buds. shrubs and vines were putting on fresh garbs of green. crickets
sang in the nights, and in the days all manner of creeping, crawling
things rustled forth into the sun. partridges and woodpeckers were
booming and knocking in the forest. squirrels were chattering, birds
singing, and overhead honked the wild-fowl driving up from the south in
cunning wedges that split the air.

from every hill slope came the trickle of running water, the music of
unseen fountains. all things were thawing, bending, snapping. the yukon
was straining to break loose the ice that bound it down. it ate away
from beneath; the sun ate from above. air-holes formed, fissures sprang
and spread apart, while thin sections of ice fell through bodily into
the river. and amid all this bursting, rending, throbbing of awakening
life, under the blazing sun and through the soft-sighing breezes, like
wayfarers to death, staggered the two men, the woman, and the huskies.

with the dogs falling, mercedes weeping and riding, hal swearing
innocuously, and charles’s eyes wistfully watering, they staggered into
john thornton’s camp at the mouth of white river. when they halted, the
dogs dropped down as though they had all been struck dead. mercedes
dried her eyes and looked at john thornton. charles sat down on a log
to rest. he sat down very slowly and painstakingly what of his great
stiffness. hal did the talking. john thornton was whittling the last
touches on an axe-handle he had made from a stick of birch. he whittled
and listened, gave monosyllabic replies, and, when it was asked, terse
advice. he knew the breed, and he gave his advice in the certainty that
it would not be followed.

“they told us up above that the bottom was dropping out of the trail
and that the best thing for us to do was to lay over,” hal said in
response to thornton’s warning to take no more chances on the rotten
ice. “they told us we couldn’t make white river, and here we are.” this
last with a sneering ring of triumph in it.

“and they told you true,” john thornton answered. “the bottom’s likely
to drop out at any moment. only fools, with the blind luck of fools,
could have made it. i tell you straight, i wouldn’t risk my carcass on
that ice for all the gold in alaska.”

“that’s because you’re not a fool, i suppose,” said hal. “all the same,
we’ll go on to dawson.” he uncoiled his whip. “get up there, buck! hi!
get up there! mush on!”

thornton went on whittling. it was idle, he knew, to get between a fool
and his folly; while two or three fools more or less would not alter
the scheme of things.

but the team did not get up at the command. it had long since passed
into the stage where blows were required to rouse it. the whip flashed
out, here and there, on its merciless errands. john thornton compressed
his lips. sol-leks was the first to crawl to his feet. teek followed.
joe came next, yelping with pain. pike made painful efforts. twice he
fell over, when half up, and on the third attempt managed to rise. buck
made no effort. he lay quietly where he had fallen. the lash bit into
him again and again, but he neither whined nor struggled. several times
thornton started, as though to speak, but changed his mind. a moisture
came into his eyes, and, as the whipping continued, he arose and walked
irresolutely up and down.

this was the first time buck had failed, in itself a sufficient reason
to drive hal into a rage. he exchanged the whip for the customary club.
buck refused to move under the rain of heavier blows which now fell
upon him. like his mates, he was barely able to get up, but, unlike
them, he had made up his mind not to get up. he had a vague feeling of
impending doom. this had been strong upon him when he pulled in to the
bank, and it had not departed from him. what of the thin and rotten ice
he had felt under his feet all day, it seemed that he sensed disaster
close at hand, out there ahead on the ice where his master was trying
to drive him. he refused to stir. so greatly had he suffered, and so
far gone was he, that the blows did not hurt much. and as they
continued to fall upon him, the spark of life within flickered and went
down. it was nearly out. he felt strangely numb. as though from a great
distance, he was aware that he was being beaten. the last sensations of
pain left him. he no longer felt anything, though very faintly he could
hear the impact of the club upon his body. but it was no longer his
body, it seemed so far away.

and then, suddenly, without warning, uttering a cry that was
inarticulate and more like the cry of an animal, john thornton sprang
upon the man who wielded the club. hal was hurled backward, as though
struck by a falling tree. mercedes screamed. charles looked on
wistfully, wiped his watery eyes, but did not get up because of his
stiffness.

john thornton stood over buck, struggling to control himself, too
convulsed with rage to speak.

“if you strike that dog again, i’ll kill you,” he at last managed to
say in a choking voice.

“it’s my dog,” hal replied, wiping the blood from his mouth as he came
back. “get out of my way, or i’ll fix you. i’m going to dawson.”

thornton stood between him and buck, and evinced no intention of
getting out of the way. hal drew his long hunting-knife. mercedes
screamed, cried, laughed, and manifested the chaotic abandonment of
hysteria. thornton rapped hal’s knuckles with the axe-handle, knocking
the knife to the ground. he rapped his knuckles again as he tried to
pick it up. then he stooped, picked it up himself, and with two strokes
cut buck’s traces.

hal had no fight left in him. besides, his hands were full with his
sister, or his arms, rather; while buck was too near dead to be of
further use in hauling the sled. a few minutes later they pulled out
from the bank and down the river. buck heard them go and raised his
head to see, pike was leading, sol-leks was at the wheel, and between
were joe and teek. they were limping and staggering. mercedes was
riding the loaded sled. hal guided at the gee-pole, and charles
stumbled along in the rear.

as buck watched them, thornton knelt beside him and with rough, kindly
hands searched for broken bones. by the time his search had disclosed
nothing more than many bruises and a state of terrible starvation, the
sled was a quarter of a mile away. dog and man watched it crawling
along over the ice. suddenly, they saw its back end drop down, as into
a rut, and the gee-pole, with hal clinging to it, jerk into the air.
mercedes’s scream came to their ears. they saw charles turn and make
one step to run back, and then a whole section of ice give way and dogs
and humans disappear. a yawning hole was all that was to be seen. the
bottom had dropped out of the trail.

john thornton and buck looked at each other.

“you poor devil,” said john thornton, and buck licked his hand.



chapter vi. for the love of a man

when john thornton froze his feet in the previous december his partners
had made him comfortable and left him to get well, going on themselves
up the river to get out a raft of saw-logs for dawson. he was still
limping slightly at the time he rescued buck, but with the continued
warm weather even the slight limp left him. and here, lying by the
river bank through the long spring days, watching the running water,
listening lazily to the songs of birds and the hum of nature, buck
slowly won back his strength.

a rest comes very good after one has travelled three thousand miles,
and it must be confessed that buck waxed lazy as his wounds healed, his
muscles swelled out, and the flesh came back to cover his bones. for
that matter, they were all loafing,—buck, john thornton, and skeet and
nig,—waiting for the raft to come that was to carry them down to
dawson. skeet was a little irish setter who early made friends with
buck, who, in a dying condition, was unable to resent her first
advances. she had the doctor trait which some dogs possess; and as a
mother cat washes her kittens, so she washed and cleansed buck’s
wounds. regularly, each morning after he had finished his breakfast,
she performed her self-appointed task, till he came to look for her
ministrations as much as he did for thornton’s. nig, equally friendly,
though less demonstrative, was a huge black dog, half bloodhound and
half deerhound, with eyes that laughed and a boundless good nature.

to buck’s surprise these dogs manifested no jealousy toward him. they
seemed to share the kindliness and largeness of john thornton. as buck
grew stronger they enticed him into all sorts of ridiculous games, in
which thornton himself could not forbear to join; and in this fashion
buck romped through his convalescence and into a new existence. love,
genuine passionate love, was his for the first time. this he had never
experienced at judge miller’s down in the sun-kissed santa clara
valley. with the judge’s sons, hunting and tramping, it had been a
working partnership; with the judge’s grandsons, a sort of pompous
guardianship; and with the judge himself, a stately and dignified
friendship. but love that was feverish and burning, that was adoration,
that was madness, it had taken john thornton to arouse.

this man had saved his life, which was something; but, further, he was
the ideal master. other men saw to the welfare of their dogs from a
sense of duty and business expediency; he saw to the welfare of his as
if they were his own children, because he could not help it. and he saw
further. he never forgot a kindly greeting or a cheering word, and to
sit down for a long talk with them (“gas” he called it) was as much his
delight as theirs. he had a way of taking buck’s head roughly between
his hands, and resting his own head upon buck’s, of shaking him back
and forth, the while calling him ill names that to buck were love
names. buck knew no greater joy than that rough embrace and the sound
of murmured oaths, and at each jerk back and forth it seemed that his
heart would be shaken out of his body so great was its ecstasy. and
when, released, he sprang to his feet, his mouth laughing, his eyes
eloquent, his throat vibrant with unuttered sound, and in that fashion
remained without movement, john thornton would reverently exclaim,
“god! you can all but speak!”

buck had a trick of love expression that was akin to hurt. he would
often seize thornton’s hand in his mouth and close so fiercely that the
flesh bore the impress of his teeth for some time afterward. and as
buck understood the oaths to be love words, so the man understood this
feigned bite for a caress.

for the most part, however, buck’s love was expressed in adoration.
while he went wild with happiness when thornton touched him or spoke to
him, he did not seek these tokens. unlike skeet, who was wont to shove
her nose under thornton’s hand and nudge and nudge till petted, or nig,
who would stalk up and rest his great head on thornton’s knee, buck was
content to adore at a distance. he would lie by the hour, eager, alert,
at thornton’s feet, looking up into his face, dwelling upon it,
studying it, following with keenest interest each fleeting expression,
every movement or change of feature. or, as chance might have it, he
would lie farther away, to the side or rear, watching the outlines of
the man and the occasional movements of his body. and often, such was
the communion in which they lived, the strength of buck’s gaze would
draw john thornton’s head around, and he would return the gaze, without
speech, his heart shining out of his eyes as buck’s heart shone out.

for a long time after his rescue, buck did not like thornton to get out
of his sight. from the moment he left the tent to when he entered it
again, buck would follow at his heels. his transient masters since he
had come into the northland had bred in him a fear that no master could
be permanent. he was afraid that thornton would pass out of his life as
perrault and françois and the scotch half-breed had passed out. even in
the night, in his dreams, he was haunted by this fear. at such times he
would shake off sleep and creep through the chill to the flap of the
tent, where he would stand and listen to the sound of his master’s
breathing.

but in spite of this great love he bore john thornton, which seemed to
bespeak the soft civilizing influence, the strain of the primitive,
which the northland had aroused in him, remained alive and active.
faithfulness and devotion, things born of fire and roof, were his; yet
he retained his wildness and wiliness. he was a thing of the wild, come
in from the wild to sit by john thornton’s fire, rather than a dog of
the soft southland stamped with the marks of generations of
civilization. because of his very great love, he could not steal from
this man, but from any other man, in any other camp, he did not
hesitate an instant; while the cunning with which he stole enabled him
to escape detection.

his face and body were scored by the teeth of many dogs, and he fought
as fiercely as ever and more shrewdly. skeet and nig were too
good-natured for quarrelling,—besides, they belonged to john thornton;
but the strange dog, no matter what the breed or valor, swiftly
acknowledged buck’s supremacy or found himself struggling for life with
a terrible antagonist. and buck was merciless. he had learned well the
law of club and fang, and he never forewent an advantage or drew back
from a foe he had started on the way to death. he had lessoned from
spitz, and from the chief fighting dogs of the police and mail, and
knew there was no middle course. he must master or be mastered; while
to show mercy was a weakness. mercy did not exist in the primordial
life. it was misunderstood for fear, and such misunderstandings made
for death. kill or be killed, eat or be eaten, was the law; and this
mandate, down out of the depths of time, he obeyed.

he was older than the days he had seen and the breaths he had drawn. he
linked the past with the present, and the eternity behind him throbbed
through him in a mighty rhythm to which he swayed as the tides and
seasons swayed. he sat by john thornton’s fire, a broad-breasted dog,
white-fanged and long-furred; but behind him were the shades of all
manner of dogs, half-wolves and wild wolves, urgent and prompting,
tasting the savor of the meat he ate, thirsting for the water he drank,
scenting the wind with him, listening with him and telling him the
sounds made by the wild life in the forest, dictating his moods,
directing his actions, lying down to sleep with him when he lay down,
and dreaming with him and beyond him and becoming themselves the stuff
of his dreams.

so peremptorily did these shades beckon him, that each day mankind and
the claims of mankind slipped farther from him. deep in the forest a
call was sounding, and as often as he heard this call, mysteriously
thrilling and luring, he felt compelled to turn his back upon the fire
and the beaten earth around it, and to plunge into the forest, and on
and on, he knew not where or why; nor did he wonder where or why, the
call sounding imperiously, deep in the forest. but as often as he
gained the soft unbroken earth and the green shade, the love for john
thornton drew him back to the fire again.

thornton alone held him. the rest of mankind was as nothing. chance
travellers might praise or pet him; but he was cold under it all, and
from a too demonstrative man he would get up and walk away. when
thornton’s partners, hans and pete, arrived on the long-expected raft,
buck refused to notice them till he learned they were close to
thornton; after that he tolerated them in a passive sort of way,
accepting favors from them as though he favored them by accepting. they
were of the same large type as thornton, living close to the earth,
thinking simply and seeing clearly; and ere they swung the raft into
the big eddy by the saw-mill at dawson, they understood buck and his
ways, and did not insist upon an intimacy such as obtained with skeet
and nig.

for thornton, however, his love seemed to grow and grow. he, alone
among men, could put a pack upon buck’s back in the summer travelling.
nothing was too great for buck to do, when thornton commanded. one day
(they had grub-staked themselves from the proceeds of the raft and left
dawson for the head-waters of the tanana) the men and dogs were sitting
on the crest of a cliff which fell away, straight down, to naked
bed-rock three hundred feet below. john thornton was sitting near the
edge, buck at his shoulder. a thoughtless whim seized thornton, and he
drew the attention of hans and pete to the experiment he had in mind.
“jump, buck!” he commanded, sweeping his arm out and over the chasm.
the next instant he was grappling with buck on the extreme edge, while
hans and pete were dragging them back into safety.

“it’s uncanny,” pete said, after it was over and they had caught their
speech.

thornton shook his head. “no, it is splendid, and it is terrible, too.
do you know, it sometimes makes me afraid.”

“i’m not hankering to be the man that lays hands on you while he’s
around,” pete announced conclusively, nodding his head toward buck.

“py jingo!” was hans’s contribution. “not mineself either.”

it was at circle city, ere the year was out, that pete’s apprehensions
were realized. “black” burton, a man evil-tempered and malicious, had
been picking a quarrel with a tenderfoot at the bar, when thornton
stepped good-naturedly between. buck, as was his custom, was lying in a
corner, head on paws, watching his master’s every action. burton struck
out, without warning, straight from the shoulder. thornton was sent
spinning, and saved himself from falling only by clutching the rail of
the bar.

those who were looking on heard what was neither bark nor yelp, but a
something which is best described as a roar, and they saw buck’s body
rise up in the air as he left the floor for burton’s throat. the man
saved his life by instinctively throwing out his arm, but was hurled
backward to the floor with buck on top of him. buck loosed his teeth
from the flesh of the arm and drove in again for the throat. this time
the man succeeded only in partly blocking, and his throat was torn
open. then the crowd was upon buck, and he was driven off; but while a
surgeon checked the bleeding, he prowled up and down, growling
furiously, attempting to rush in, and being forced back by an array of
hostile clubs. a “miners’ meeting,” called on the spot, decided that
the dog had sufficient provocation, and buck was discharged. but his
reputation was made, and from that day his name spread through every
camp in alaska.

later on, in the fall of the year, he saved john thornton’s life in
quite another fashion. the three partners were lining a long and narrow
poling-boat down a bad stretch of rapids on the forty-mile creek. hans
and pete moved along the bank, snubbing with a thin manila rope from
tree to tree, while thornton remained in the boat, helping its descent
by means of a pole, and shouting directions to the shore. buck, on the
bank, worried and anxious, kept abreast of the boat, his eyes never off
his master.

at a particularly bad spot, where a ledge of barely submerged rocks
jutted out into the river, hans cast off the rope, and, while thornton
poled the boat out into the stream, ran down the bank with the end in
his hand to snub the boat when it had cleared the ledge. this it did,
and was flying down-stream in a current as swift as a mill-race, when
hans checked it with the rope and checked too suddenly. the boat
flirted over and snubbed in to the bank bottom up, while thornton,
flung sheer out of it, was carried down-stream toward the worst part of
the rapids, a stretch of wild water in which no swimmer could live.

buck had sprung in on the instant; and at the end of three hundred
yards, amid a mad swirl of water, he overhauled thornton. when he felt
him grasp his tail, buck headed for the bank, swimming with all his
splendid strength. but the progress shoreward was slow; the progress
down-stream amazingly rapid. from below came the fatal roaring where
the wild current went wilder and was rent in shreds and spray by the
rocks which thrust through like the teeth of an enormous comb. the suck
of the water as it took the beginning of the last steep pitch was
frightful, and thornton knew that the shore was impossible. he scraped
furiously over a rock, bruised across a second, and struck a third with
crushing force. he clutched its slippery top with both hands, releasing
buck, and above the roar of the churning water shouted: “go, buck! go!”

buck could not hold his own, and swept on down-stream, struggling
desperately, but unable to win back. when he heard thornton’s command
repeated, he partly reared out of the water, throwing his head high, as
though for a last look, then turned obediently toward the bank. he swam
powerfully and was dragged ashore by pete and hans at the very point
where swimming ceased to be possible and destruction began.

they knew that the time a man could cling to a slippery rock in the
face of that driving current was a matter of minutes, and they ran as
fast as they could up the bank to a point far above where thornton was
hanging on. they attached the line with which they had been snubbing
the boat to buck’s neck and shoulders, being careful that it should
neither strangle him nor impede his swimming, and launched him into the
stream. he struck out boldly, but not straight enough into the stream.
he discovered the mistake too late, when thornton was abreast of him
and a bare half-dozen strokes away while he was being carried
helplessly past.

hans promptly snubbed with the rope, as though buck were a boat. the
rope thus tightening on him in the sweep of the current, he was jerked
under the surface, and under the surface he remained till his body
struck against the bank and he was hauled out. he was half drowned, and
hans and pete threw themselves upon him, pounding the breath into him
and the water out of him. he staggered to his feet and fell down. the
faint sound of thornton’s voice came to them, and though they could not
make out the words of it, they knew that he was in his extremity. his
master’s voice acted on buck like an electric shock, he sprang to his
feet and ran up the bank ahead of the men to the point of his previous
departure.

again the rope was attached and he was launched, and again he struck
out, but this time straight into the stream. he had miscalculated once,
but he would not be guilty of it a second time. hans paid out the rope,
permitting no slack, while pete kept it clear of coils. buck held on
till he was on a line straight above thornton; then he turned, and with
the speed of an express train headed down upon him. thornton saw him
coming, and, as buck struck him like a battering ram, with the whole
force of the current behind him, he reached up and closed with both
arms around the shaggy neck. hans snubbed the rope around the tree, and
buck and thornton were jerked under the water. strangling, suffocating,
sometimes one uppermost and sometimes the other, dragging over the
jagged bottom, smashing against rocks and snags, they veered in to the
bank.

thornton came to, belly downward and being violently propelled back and
forth across a drift log by hans and pete. his first glance was for
buck, over whose limp and apparently lifeless body nig was setting up a
howl, while skeet was licking the wet face and closed eyes. thornton
was himself bruised and battered, and he went carefully over buck’s
body, when he had been brought around, finding three broken ribs.

“that settles it,” he announced. “we camp right here.” and camp they
did, till buck’s ribs knitted and he was able to travel.

that winter, at dawson, buck performed another exploit, not so heroic,
perhaps, but one that put his name many notches higher on the
totem-pole of alaskan fame. this exploit was particularly gratifying to
the three men; for they stood in need of the outfit which it furnished,
and were enabled to make a long-desired trip into the virgin east,
where miners had not yet appeared. it was brought about by a
conversation in the eldorado saloon, in which men waxed boastful of
their favorite dogs. buck, because of his record, was the target for
these men, and thornton was driven stoutly to defend him. at the end of
half an hour one man stated that his dog could start a sled with five
hundred pounds and walk off with it; a second bragged six hundred for
his dog; and a third, seven hundred.

“pooh! pooh!” said john thornton; “buck can start a thousand pounds.”

“and break it out? and walk off with it for a hundred yards?” demanded
matthewson, a bonanza king, he of the seven hundred vaunt.

“and break it out, and walk off with it for a hundred yards,” john
thornton said coolly.

“well,” matthewson said, slowly and deliberately, so that all could
hear, “i’ve got a thousand dollars that says he can’t. and there it
is.” so saying, he slammed a sack of gold dust of the size of a bologna
sausage down upon the bar.

nobody spoke. thornton’s bluff, if bluff it was, had been called. he
could feel a flush of warm blood creeping up his face. his tongue had
tricked him. he did not know whether buck could start a thousand
pounds. half a ton! the enormousness of it appalled him. he had great
faith in buck’s strength and had often thought him capable of starting
such a load; but never, as now, had he faced the possibility of it, the
eyes of a dozen men fixed upon him, silent and waiting. further, he had
no thousand dollars; nor had hans or pete.

“i’ve got a sled standing outside now, with twenty fiftypound sacks of
flour on it,” matthewson went on with brutal directness; “so don’t let
that hinder you.”

thornton did not reply. he did not know what to say. he glanced from
face to face in the absent way of a man who has lost the power of
thought and is seeking somewhere to find the thing that will start it
going again. the face of jim o’brien, a mastodon king and old-time
comrade, caught his eyes. it was as a cue to him, seeming to rouse him
to do what he would never have dreamed of doing.

“can you lend me a thousand?” he asked, almost in a whisper.

“sure,” answered o’brien, thumping down a plethoric sack by the side of
matthewson’s. “though it’s little faith i’m having, john, that the
beast can do the trick.”

the eldorado emptied its occupants into the street to see the test. the
tables were deserted, and the dealers and gamekeepers came forth to see
the outcome of the wager and to lay odds. several hundred men, furred
and mittened, banked around the sled within easy distance. matthewson’s
sled, loaded with a thousand pounds of flour, had been standing for a
couple of hours, and in the intense cold (it was sixty below zero) the
runners had frozen fast to the hard-packed snow. men offered odds of
two to one that buck could not budge the sled. a quibble arose
concerning the phrase “break out.” o’brien contended it was thornton’s
privilege to knock the runners loose, leaving buck to “break it out”
from a dead standstill. matthewson insisted that the phrase included
breaking the runners from the frozen grip of the snow. a majority of
the men who had witnessed the making of the bet decided in his favor,
whereat the odds went up to three to one against buck.

there were no takers. not a man believed him capable of the feat.
thornton had been hurried into the wager, heavy with doubt; and now
that he looked at the sled itself, the concrete fact, with the regular
team of ten dogs curled up in the snow before it, the more impossible
the task appeared. matthewson waxed jubilant.

“three to one!” he proclaimed. “i’ll lay you another thousand at that
figure, thornton. what d’ye say?”

thornton’s doubt was strong in his face, but his fighting spirit was
aroused—the fighting spirit that soars above odds, fails to recognize
the impossible, and is deaf to all save the clamor for battle. he
called hans and pete to him. their sacks were slim, and with his own
the three partners could rake together only two hundred dollars. in the
ebb of their fortunes, this sum was their total capital; yet they laid
it unhesitatingly against matthewson’s six hundred.

the team of ten dogs was unhitched, and buck, with his own harness, was
put into the sled. he had caught the contagion of the excitement, and
he felt that in some way he must do a great thing for john thornton.
murmurs of admiration at his splendid appearance went up. he was in
perfect condition, without an ounce of superfluous flesh, and the one
hundred and fifty pounds that he weighed were so many pounds of grit
and virility. his furry coat shone with the sheen of silk. down the
neck and across the shoulders, his mane, in repose as it was, half
bristled and seemed to lift with every movement, as though excess of
vigor made each particular hair alive and active. the great breast and
heavy fore legs were no more than in proportion with the rest of the
body, where the muscles showed in tight rolls underneath the skin. men
felt these muscles and proclaimed them hard as iron, and the odds went
down to two to one.

“gad, sir! gad, sir!” stuttered a member of the latest dynasty, a king
of the skookum benches. “i offer you eight hundred for him, sir, before
the test, sir; eight hundred just as he stands.”

thornton shook his head and stepped to buck’s side.

“you must stand off from him,” matthewson protested. “free play and
plenty of room.”

the crowd fell silent; only could be heard the voices of the gamblers
vainly offering two to one. everybody acknowledged buck a magnificent
animal, but twenty fifty-pound sacks of flour bulked too large in their
eyes for them to loosen their pouch-strings.

thornton knelt down by buck’s side. he took his head in his two hands
and rested cheek on cheek. he did not playfully shake him, as was his
wont, or murmur soft love curses; but he whispered in his ear. “as you
love me, buck. as you love me,” was what he whispered. buck whined with
suppressed eagerness.

the crowd was watching curiously. the affair was growing mysterious. it
seemed like a conjuration. as thornton got to his feet, buck seized his
mittened hand between his jaws, pressing in with his teeth and
releasing slowly, half-reluctantly. it was the answer, in terms, not of
speech, but of love. thornton stepped well back.

“now, buck,” he said.

buck tightened the traces, then slacked them for a matter of several
inches. it was the way he had learned.

“gee!” thornton’s voice rang out, sharp in the tense silence.

buck swung to the right, ending the movement in a plunge that took up
the slack and with a sudden jerk arrested his one hundred and fifty
pounds. the load quivered, and from under the runners arose a crisp
crackling.

“haw!” thornton commanded.

buck duplicated the manœuvre, this time to the left. the crackling
turned into a snapping, the sled pivoting and the runners slipping and
grating several inches to the side. the sled was broken out. men were
holding their breaths, intensely unconscious of the fact.

“now, mush!”

thornton’s command cracked out like a pistol-shot. buck threw himself
forward, tightening the traces with a jarring lunge. his whole body was
gathered compactly together in the tremendous effort, the muscles
writhing and knotting like live things under the silky fur. his great
chest was low to the ground, his head forward and down, while his feet
were flying like mad, the claws scarring the hard-packed snow in
parallel grooves. the sled swayed and trembled, half-started forward.
one of his feet slipped, and one man groaned aloud. then the sled
lurched ahead in what appeared a rapid succession of jerks, though it
never really came to a dead stop again...half an inch...an inch... two
inches... the jerks perceptibly diminished; as the sled gained
momentum, he caught them up, till it was moving steadily along.

men gasped and began to breathe again, unaware that for a moment they
had ceased to breathe. thornton was running behind, encouraging buck
with short, cheery words. the distance had been measured off, and as he
neared the pile of firewood which marked the end of the hundred yards,
a cheer began to grow and grow, which burst into a roar as he passed
the firewood and halted at command. every man was tearing himself
loose, even matthewson. hats and mittens were flying in the air. men
were shaking hands, it did not matter with whom, and bubbling over in a
general incoherent babel.

but thornton fell on his knees beside buck. head was against head, and
he was shaking him back and forth. those who hurried up heard him
cursing buck, and he cursed him long and fervently, and softly and
lovingly.

“gad, sir! gad, sir!” spluttered the skookum bench king. “i’ll give you
a thousand for him, sir, a thousand, sir—twelve hundred, sir.”

thornton rose to his feet. his eyes were wet. the tears were streaming
frankly down his cheeks. “sir,” he said to the skookum bench king, “no,
sir. you can go to hell, sir. it’s the best i can do for you, sir.”

buck seized thornton’s hand in his teeth. thornton shook him back and
forth. as though animated by a common impulse, the onlookers drew back
to a respectful distance; nor were they again indiscreet enough to
interrupt.



chapter vii. the sounding of the call

when buck earned sixteen hundred dollars in five minutes for john
thornton, he made it possible for his master to pay off certain debts
and to journey with his partners into the east after a fabled lost
mine, the history of which was as old as the history of the country.
many men had sought it; few had found it; and more than a few there
were who had never returned from the quest. this lost mine was steeped
in tragedy and shrouded in mystery. no one knew of the first man. the
oldest tradition stopped before it got back to him. from the beginning
there had been an ancient and ramshackle cabin. dying men had sworn to
it, and to the mine the site of which it marked, clinching their
testimony with nuggets that were unlike any known grade of gold in the
northland.

but no living man had looted this treasure house, and the dead were
dead; wherefore john thornton and pete and hans, with buck and half a
dozen other dogs, faced into the east on an unknown trail to achieve
where men and dogs as good as themselves had failed. they sledded
seventy miles up the yukon, swung to the left into the stewart river,
passed the mayo and the mcquestion, and held on until the stewart
itself became a streamlet, threading the upstanding peaks which marked
the backbone of the continent.

john thornton asked little of man or nature. he was unafraid of the
wild. with a handful of salt and a rifle he could plunge into the
wilderness and fare wherever he pleased and as long as he pleased.
being in no haste, indian fashion, he hunted his dinner in the course
of the day’s travel; and if he failed to find it, like the indian, he
kept on travelling, secure in the knowledge that sooner or later he
would come to it. so, on this great journey into the east, straight
meat was the bill of fare, ammunition and tools principally made up the
load on the sled, and the time-card was drawn upon the limitless
future.

to buck it was boundless delight, this hunting, fishing, and indefinite
wandering through strange places. for weeks at a time they would hold
on steadily, day after day; and for weeks upon end they would camp,
here and there, the dogs loafing and the men burning holes through
frozen muck and gravel and washing countless pans of dirt by the heat
of the fire. sometimes they went hungry, sometimes they feasted
riotously, all according to the abundance of game and the fortune of
hunting. summer arrived, and dogs and men packed on their backs, rafted
across blue mountain lakes, and descended or ascended unknown rivers in
slender boats whipsawed from the standing forest.

the months came and went, and back and forth they twisted through the
uncharted vastness, where no men were and yet where men had been if the
lost cabin were true. they went across divides in summer blizzards,
shivered under the midnight sun on naked mountains between the timber
line and the eternal snows, dropped into summer valleys amid swarming
gnats and flies, and in the shadows of glaciers picked strawberries and
flowers as ripe and fair as any the southland could boast. in the fall
of the year they penetrated a weird lake country, sad and silent, where
wildfowl had been, but where then there was no life nor sign of
life—only the blowing of chill winds, the forming of ice in sheltered
places, and the melancholy rippling of waves on lonely beaches.

and through another winter they wandered on the obliterated trails of
men who had gone before. once, they came upon a path blazed through the
forest, an ancient path, and the lost cabin seemed very near. but the
path began nowhere and ended nowhere, and it remained mystery, as the
man who made it and the reason he made it remained mystery. another
time they chanced upon the time-graven wreckage of a hunting lodge, and
amid the shreds of rotted blankets john thornton found a long-barrelled
flint-lock. he knew it for a hudson bay company gun of the young days
in the northwest, when such a gun was worth its height in beaver skins
packed flat, and that was all—no hint as to the man who in an early day
had reared the lodge and left the gun among the blankets.

spring came on once more, and at the end of all their wandering they
found, not the lost cabin, but a shallow placer in a broad valley where
the gold showed like yellow butter across the bottom of the
washing-pan. they sought no farther. each day they worked earned them
thousands of dollars in clean dust and nuggets, and they worked every
day. the gold was sacked in moose-hide bags, fifty pounds to the bag,
and piled like so much firewood outside the spruce-bough lodge. like
giants they toiled, days flashing on the heels of days like dreams as
they heaped the treasure up.

there was nothing for the dogs to do, save the hauling in of meat now
and again that thornton killed, and buck spent long hours musing by the
fire. the vision of the short-legged hairy man came to him more
frequently, now that there was little work to be done; and often,
blinking by the fire, buck wandered with him in that other world which
he remembered.

the salient thing of this other world seemed fear. when he watched the
hairy man sleeping by the fire, head between his knees and hands
clasped above, buck saw that he slept restlessly, with many starts and
awakenings, at which times he would peer fearfully into the darkness
and fling more wood upon the fire. did they walk by the beach of a sea,
where the hairy man gathered shellfish and ate them as he gathered, it
was with eyes that roved everywhere for hidden danger and with legs
prepared to run like the wind at its first appearance. through the
forest they crept noiselessly, buck at the hairy man’s heels; and they
were alert and vigilant, the pair of them, ears twitching and moving
and nostrils quivering, for the man heard and smelled as keenly as
buck. the hairy man could spring up into the trees and travel ahead as
fast as on the ground, swinging by the arms from limb to limb,
sometimes a dozen feet apart, letting go and catching, never falling,
never missing his grip. in fact, he seemed as much at home among the
trees as on the ground; and buck had memories of nights of vigil spent
beneath trees wherein the hairy man roosted, holding on tightly as he
slept.

and closely akin to the visions of the hairy man was the call still
sounding in the depths of the forest. it filled him with a great unrest
and strange desires. it caused him to feel a vague, sweet gladness, and
he was aware of wild yearnings and stirrings for he knew not what.
sometimes he pursued the call into the forest, looking for it as though
it were a tangible thing, barking softly or defiantly, as the mood
might dictate. he would thrust his nose into the cool wood moss, or
into the black soil where long grasses grew, and snort with joy at the
fat earth smells; or he would crouch for hours, as if in concealment,
behind fungus-covered trunks of fallen trees, wide-eyed and wide-eared
to all that moved and sounded about him. it might be, lying thus, that
he hoped to surprise this call he could not understand. but he did not
know why he did these various things. he was impelled to do them, and
did not reason about them at all.

irresistible impulses seized him. he would be lying in camp, dozing
lazily in the heat of the day, when suddenly his head would lift and
his ears cock up, intent and listening, and he would spring to his feet
and dash away, and on and on, for hours, through the forest aisles and
across the open spaces where the niggerheads bunched. he loved to run
down dry watercourses, and to creep and spy upon the bird life in the
woods. for a day at a time he would lie in the underbrush where he
could watch the partridges drumming and strutting up and down. but
especially he loved to run in the dim twilight of the summer midnights,
listening to the subdued and sleepy murmurs of the forest, reading
signs and sounds as man may read a book, and seeking for the mysterious
something that called—called, waking or sleeping, at all times, for him
to come.

one night he sprang from sleep with a start, eager-eyed, nostrils
quivering and scenting, his mane bristling in recurrent waves. from the
forest came the call (or one note of it, for the call was many noted),
distinct and definite as never before,—a long-drawn howl, like, yet
unlike, any noise made by husky dog. and he knew it, in the old
familiar way, as a sound heard before. he sprang through the sleeping
camp and in swift silence dashed through the woods. as he drew closer
to the cry he went more slowly, with caution in every movement, till he
came to an open place among the trees, and looking out saw, erect on
haunches, with nose pointed to the sky, a long, lean, timber wolf.

he had made no noise, yet it ceased from its howling and tried to sense
his presence. buck stalked into the open, half crouching, body gathered
compactly together, tail straight and stiff, feet falling with unwonted
care. every movement advertised commingled threatening and overture of
friendliness. it was the menacing truce that marks the meeting of wild
beasts that prey. but the wolf fled at sight of him. he followed, with
wild leapings, in a frenzy to overtake. he ran him into a blind
channel, in the bed of the creek where a timber jam barred the way. the
wolf whirled about, pivoting on his hind legs after the fashion of joe
and of all cornered husky dogs, snarling and bristling, clipping his
teeth together in a continuous and rapid succession of snaps.

buck did not attack, but circled him about and hedged him in with
friendly advances. the wolf was suspicious and afraid; for buck made
three of him in weight, while his head barely reached buck’s shoulder.
watching his chance, he darted away, and the chase was resumed. time
and again he was cornered, and the thing repeated, though he was in
poor condition, or buck could not so easily have overtaken him. he
would run till buck’s head was even with his flank, when he would whirl
around at bay, only to dash away again at the first opportunity.

but in the end buck’s pertinacity was rewarded; for the wolf, finding
that no harm was intended, finally sniffed noses with him. then they
became friendly, and played about in the nervous, half-coy way with
which fierce beasts belie their fierceness. after some time of this the
wolf started off at an easy lope in a manner that plainly showed he was
going somewhere. he made it clear to buck that he was to come, and they
ran side by side through the sombre twilight, straight up the creek
bed, into the gorge from which it issued, and across the bleak divide
where it took its rise.

on the opposite slope of the watershed they came down into a level
country where were great stretches of forest and many streams, and
through these great stretches they ran steadily, hour after hour, the
sun rising higher and the day growing warmer. buck was wildly glad. he
knew he was at last answering the call, running by the side of his wood
brother toward the place from where the call surely came. old memories
were coming upon him fast, and he was stirring to them as of old he
stirred to the realities of which they were the shadows. he had done
this thing before, somewhere in that other and dimly remembered world,
and he was doing it again, now, running free in the open, the unpacked
earth underfoot, the wide sky overhead.

they stopped by a running stream to drink, and, stopping, buck
remembered john thornton. he sat down. the wolf started on toward the
place from where the call surely came, then returned to him, sniffing
noses and making actions as though to encourage him. but buck turned
about and started slowly on the back track. for the better part of an
hour the wild brother ran by his side, whining softly. then he sat
down, pointed his nose upward, and howled. it was a mournful howl, and
as buck held steadily on his way he heard it grow faint and fainter
until it was lost in the distance.

john thornton was eating dinner when buck dashed into camp and sprang
upon him in a frenzy of affection, overturning him, scrambling upon
him, licking his face, biting his hand—“playing the general tom-fool,”
as john thornton characterized it, the while he shook buck back and
forth and cursed him lovingly.

for two days and nights buck never left camp, never let thornton out of
his sight. he followed him about at his work, watched him while he ate,
saw him into his blankets at night and out of them in the morning. but
after two days the call in the forest began to sound more imperiously
than ever. buck’s restlessness came back on him, and he was haunted by
recollections of the wild brother, and of the smiling land beyond the
divide and the run side by side through the wide forest stretches. once
again he took to wandering in the woods, but the wild brother came no
more; and though he listened through long vigils, the mournful howl was
never raised.

he began to sleep out at night, staying away from camp for days at a
time; and once he crossed the divide at the head of the creek and went
down into the land of timber and streams. there he wandered for a week,
seeking vainly for fresh sign of the wild brother, killing his meat as
he travelled and travelling with the long, easy lope that seems never
to tire. he fished for salmon in a broad stream that emptied somewhere
into the sea, and by this stream he killed a large black bear, blinded
by the mosquitoes while likewise fishing, and raging through the forest
helpless and terrible. even so, it was a hard fight, and it aroused the
last latent remnants of buck’s ferocity. and two days later, when he
returned to his kill and found a dozen wolverenes quarrelling over the
spoil, he scattered them like chaff; and those that fled left two
behind who would quarrel no more.

the blood-longing became stronger than ever before. he was a killer, a
thing that preyed, living on the things that lived, unaided, alone, by
virtue of his own strength and prowess, surviving triumphantly in a
hostile environment where only the strong survived. because of all this
he became possessed of a great pride in himself, which communicated
itself like a contagion to his physical being. it advertised itself in
all his movements, was apparent in the play of every muscle, spoke
plainly as speech in the way he carried himself, and made his glorious
furry coat if anything more glorious. but for the stray brown on his
muzzle and above his eyes, and for the splash of white hair that ran
midmost down his chest, he might well have been mistaken for a gigantic
wolf, larger than the largest of the breed. from his st. bernard father
he had inherited size and weight, but it was his shepherd mother who
had given shape to that size and weight. his muzzle was the long wolf
muzzle, save that it was larger than the muzzle of any wolf; and his
head, somewhat broader, was the wolf head on a massive scale.

his cunning was wolf cunning, and wild cunning; his intelligence,
shepherd intelligence and st. bernard intelligence; and all this, plus
an experience gained in the fiercest of schools, made him as formidable
a creature as any that roamed the wild. a carnivorous animal living on
a straight meat diet, he was in full flower, at the high tide of his
life, overspilling with vigor and virility. when thornton passed a
caressing hand along his back, a snapping and crackling followed the
hand, each hair discharging its pent magnetism at the contact. every
part, brain and body, nerve tissue and fibre, was keyed to the most
exquisite pitch; and between all the parts there was a perfect
equilibrium or adjustment. to sights and sounds and events which
required action, he responded with lightning-like rapidity. quickly as
a husky dog could leap to defend from attack or to attack, he could
leap twice as quickly. he saw the movement, or heard sound, and
responded in less time than another dog required to compass the mere
seeing or hearing. he perceived and determined and responded in the
same instant. in point of fact the three actions of perceiving,
determining, and responding were sequential; but so infinitesimal were
the intervals of time between them that they appeared simultaneous. his
muscles were surcharged with vitality, and snapped into play sharply,
like steel springs. life streamed through him in splendid flood, glad
and rampant, until it seemed that it would burst him asunder in sheer
ecstasy and pour forth generously over the world.

“never was there such a dog,” said john thornton one day, as the
partners watched buck marching out of camp.

“when he was made, the mould was broke,” said pete.

“py jingo! i t’ink so mineself,” hans affirmed.

they saw him marching out of camp, but they did not see the instant and
terrible transformation which took place as soon as he was within the
secrecy of the forest. he no longer marched. at once he became a thing
of the wild, stealing along softly, cat-footed, a passing shadow that
appeared and disappeared among the shadows. he knew how to take
advantage of every cover, to crawl on his belly like a snake, and like
a snake to leap and strike. he could take a ptarmigan from its nest,
kill a rabbit as it slept, and snap in mid air the little chipmunks
fleeing a second too late for the trees. fish, in open pools, were not
too quick for him; nor were beaver, mending their dams, too wary. he
killed to eat, not from wantonness; but he preferred to eat what he
killed himself. so a lurking humor ran through his deeds, and it was
his delight to steal upon the squirrels, and, when he all but had them,
to let them go, chattering in mortal fear to the treetops.

as the fall of the year came on, the moose appeared in greater
abundance, moving slowly down to meet the winter in the lower and less
rigorous valleys. buck had already dragged down a stray part-grown
calf; but he wished strongly for larger and more formidable quarry, and
he came upon it one day on the divide at the head of the creek. a band
of twenty moose had crossed over from the land of streams and timber,
and chief among them was a great bull. he was in a savage temper, and,
standing over six feet from the ground, was as formidable an antagonist
as even buck could desire. back and forth the bull tossed his great
palmated antlers, branching to fourteen points and embracing seven feet
within the tips. his small eyes burned with a vicious and bitter light,
while he roared with fury at sight of buck.

from the bull’s side, just forward of the flank, protruded a feathered
arrow-end, which accounted for his savageness. guided by that instinct
which came from the old hunting days of the primordial world, buck
proceeded to cut the bull out from the herd. it was no slight task. he
would bark and dance about in front of the bull, just out of reach of
the great antlers and of the terrible splay hoofs which could have
stamped his life out with a single blow. unable to turn his back on the
fanged danger and go on, the bull would be driven into paroxysms of
rage. at such moments he charged buck, who retreated craftily, luring
him on by a simulated inability to escape. but when he was thus
separated from his fellows, two or three of the younger bulls would
charge back upon buck and enable the wounded bull to rejoin the herd.

there is a patience of the wild—dogged, tireless, persistent as life
itself—that holds motionless for endless hours the spider in its web,
the snake in its coils, the panther in its ambuscade; this patience
belongs peculiarly to life when it hunts its living food; and it
belonged to buck as he clung to the flank of the herd, retarding its
march, irritating the young bulls, worrying the cows with their
half-grown calves, and driving the wounded bull mad with helpless rage.
for half a day this continued. buck multiplied himself, attacking from
all sides, enveloping the herd in a whirlwind of menace, cutting out
his victim as fast as it could rejoin its mates, wearing out the
patience of creatures preyed upon, which is a lesser patience than that
of creatures preying.

as the day wore along and the sun dropped to its bed in the northwest
(the darkness had come back and the fall nights were six hours long),
the young bulls retraced their steps more and more reluctantly to the
aid of their beset leader. the down-coming winter was harrying them on
to the lower levels, and it seemed they could never shake off this
tireless creature that held them back. besides, it was not the life of
the herd, or of the young bulls, that was threatened. the life of only
one member was demanded, which was a remoter interest than their lives,
and in the end they were content to pay the toll.

as twilight fell the old bull stood with lowered head, watching his
mates—the cows he had known, the calves he had fathered, the bulls he
had mastered—as they shambled on at a rapid pace through the fading
light. he could not follow, for before his nose leaped the merciless
fanged terror that would not let him go. three hundredweight more than
half a ton he weighed; he had lived a long, strong life, full of fight
and struggle, and at the end he faced death at the teeth of a creature
whose head did not reach beyond his great knuckled knees.

from then on, night and day, buck never left his prey, never gave it a
moment’s rest, never permitted it to browse the leaves of trees or the
shoots of young birch and willow. nor did he give the wounded bull
opportunity to slake his burning thirst in the slender trickling
streams they crossed. often, in desperation, he burst into long
stretches of flight. at such times buck did not attempt to stay him,
but loped easily at his heels, satisfied with the way the game was
played, lying down when the moose stood still, attacking him fiercely
when he strove to eat or drink.

the great head drooped more and more under its tree of horns, and the
shambling trot grew weak and weaker. he took to standing for long
periods, with nose to the ground and dejected ears dropped limply; and
buck found more time in which to get water for himself and in which to
rest. at such moments, panting with red lolling tongue and with eyes
fixed upon the big bull, it appeared to buck that a change was coming
over the face of things. he could feel a new stir in the land. as the
moose were coming into the land, other kinds of life were coming in.
forest and stream and air seemed palpitant with their presence. the
news of it was borne in upon him, not by sight, or sound, or smell, but
by some other and subtler sense. he heard nothing, saw nothing, yet
knew that the land was somehow different; that through it strange
things were afoot and ranging; and he resolved to investigate after he
had finished the business in hand.

at last, at the end of the fourth day, he pulled the great moose down.
for a day and a night he remained by the kill, eating and sleeping,
turn and turn about. then, rested, refreshed and strong, he turned his
face toward camp and john thornton. he broke into the long easy lope,
and went on, hour after hour, never at loss for the tangled way,
heading straight home through strange country with a certitude of
direction that put man and his magnetic needle to shame.

as he held on he became more and more conscious of the new stir in the
land. there was life abroad in it different from the life which had
been there throughout the summer. no longer was this fact borne in upon
him in some subtle, mysterious way. the birds talked of it, the
squirrels chattered about it, the very breeze whispered of it. several
times he stopped and drew in the fresh morning air in great sniffs,
reading a message which made him leap on with greater speed. he was
oppressed with a sense of calamity happening, if it were not calamity
already happened; and as he crossed the last watershed and dropped down
into the valley toward camp, he proceeded with greater caution.

three miles away he came upon a fresh trail that sent his neck hair
rippling and bristling, it led straight toward camp and john thornton.
buck hurried on, swiftly and stealthily, every nerve straining and
tense, alert to the multitudinous details which told a story—all but
the end. his nose gave him a varying description of the passage of the
life on the heels of which he was travelling. he remarked the pregnant
silence of the forest. the bird life had flitted. the squirrels were in
hiding. one only he saw,—a sleek gray fellow, flattened against a gray
dead limb so that he seemed a part of it, a woody excrescence upon the
wood itself.

as buck slid along with the obscureness of a gliding shadow, his nose
was jerked suddenly to the side as though a positive force had gripped
and pulled it. he followed the new scent into a thicket and found nig.
he was lying on his side, dead where he had dragged himself, an arrow
protruding, head and feathers, from either side of his body.

a hundred yards farther on, buck came upon one of the sled-dogs
thornton had bought in dawson. this dog was thrashing about in a
death-struggle, directly on the trail, and buck passed around him
without stopping. from the camp came the faint sound of many voices,
rising and falling in a sing-song chant. bellying forward to the edge
of the clearing, he found hans, lying on his face, feathered with
arrows like a porcupine. at the same instant buck peered out where the
spruce-bough lodge had been and saw what made his hair leap straight up
on his neck and shoulders. a gust of overpowering rage swept over him.
he did not know that he growled, but he growled aloud with a terrible
ferocity. for the last time in his life he allowed passion to usurp
cunning and reason, and it was because of his great love for john
thornton that he lost his head.

the yeehats were dancing about the wreckage of the spruce-bough lodge
when they heard a fearful roaring and saw rushing upon them an animal
the like of which they had never seen before. it was buck, a live
hurricane of fury, hurling himself upon them in a frenzy to destroy. he
sprang at the foremost man (it was the chief of the yeehats), ripping
the throat wide open till the rent jugular spouted a fountain of blood.
he did not pause to worry the victim, but ripped in passing, with the
next bound tearing wide the throat of a second man. there was no
withstanding him. he plunged about in their very midst, tearing,
rending, destroying, in constant and terrific motion which defied the
arrows they discharged at him. in fact, so inconceivably rapid were his
movements, and so closely were the indians tangled together, that they
shot one another with the arrows; and one young hunter, hurling a spear
at buck in mid air, drove it through the chest of another hunter with
such force that the point broke through the skin of the back and stood
out beyond. then a panic seized the yeehats, and they fled in terror to
the woods, proclaiming as they fled the advent of the evil spirit.

and truly buck was the fiend incarnate, raging at their heels and
dragging them down like deer as they raced through the trees. it was a
fateful day for the yeehats. they scattered far and wide over the
country, and it was not till a week later that the last of the
survivors gathered together in a lower valley and counted their losses.
as for buck, wearying of the pursuit, he returned to the desolated
camp. he found pete where he had been killed in his blankets in the
first moment of surprise. thornton’s desperate struggle was
fresh-written on the earth, and buck scented every detail of it down to
the edge of a deep pool. by the edge, head and fore feet in the water,
lay skeet, faithful to the last. the pool itself, muddy and discolored
from the sluice boxes, effectually hid what it contained, and it
contained john thornton; for buck followed his trace into the water,
from which no trace led away.

all day buck brooded by the pool or roamed restlessly about the camp.
death, as a cessation of movement, as a passing out and away from the
lives of the living, he knew, and he knew john thornton was dead. it
left a great void in him, somewhat akin to hunger, but a void which
ached and ached, and which food could not fill, at times, when he
paused to contemplate the carcasses of the yeehats, he forgot the pain
of it; and at such times he was aware of a great pride in himself,—a
pride greater than any he had yet experienced. he had killed man, the
noblest game of all, and he had killed in the face of the law of club
and fang. he sniffed the bodies curiously. they had died so easily. it
was harder to kill a husky dog than them. they were no match at all,
were it not for their arrows and spears and clubs. thenceforward he
would be unafraid of them except when they bore in their hands their
arrows, spears, and clubs.

night came on, and a full moon rose high over the trees into the sky,
lighting the land till it lay bathed in ghostly day. and with the
coming of the night, brooding and mourning by the pool, buck became
alive to a stirring of the new life in the forest other than that which
the yeehats had made, he stood up, listening and scenting. from far
away drifted a faint, sharp yelp, followed by a chorus of similar sharp
yelps. as the moments passed the yelps grew closer and louder. again
buck knew them as things heard in that other world which persisted in
his memory. he walked to the centre of the open space and listened. it
was the call, the many-noted call, sounding more luringly and
compellingly than ever before. and as never before, he was ready to
obey. john thornton was dead. the last tie was broken. man and the
claims of man no longer bound him.

hunting their living meat, as the yeehats were hunting it, on the
flanks of the migrating moose, the wolf pack had at last crossed over
from the land of streams and timber and invaded buck’s valley. into the
clearing where the moonlight streamed, they poured in a silvery flood;
and in the centre of the clearing stood buck, motionless as a statue,
waiting their coming. they were awed, so still and large he stood, and
a moment’s pause fell, till the boldest one leaped straight for him.
like a flash buck struck, breaking the neck. then he stood, without
movement, as before, the stricken wolf rolling in agony behind him.
three others tried it in sharp succession; and one after the other they
drew back, streaming blood from slashed throats or shoulders.

this was sufficient to fling the whole pack forward, pell-mell, crowded
together, blocked and confused by its eagerness to pull down the prey.
buck’s marvellous quickness and agility stood him in good stead.
pivoting on his hind legs, and snapping and gashing, he was everywhere
at once, presenting a front which was apparently unbroken so swiftly
did he whirl and guard from side to side. but to prevent them from
getting behind him, he was forced back, down past the pool and into the
creek bed, till he brought up against a high gravel bank. he worked
along to a right angle in the bank which the men had made in the course
of mining, and in this angle he came to bay, protected on three sides
and with nothing to do but face the front.

and so well did he face it, that at the end of half an hour the wolves
drew back discomfited. the tongues of all were out and lolling, the
white fangs showing cruelly white in the moonlight. some were lying
down with heads raised and ears pricked forward; others stood on their
feet, watching him; and still others were lapping water from the pool.
one wolf, long and lean and gray, advanced cautiously, in a friendly
manner, and buck recognized the wild brother with whom he had run for a
night and a day. he was whining softly, and, as buck whined, they
touched noses.

then an old wolf, gaunt and battle-scarred, came forward. buck writhed
his lips into the preliminary of a snarl, but sniffed noses with him,
whereupon the old wolf sat down, pointed nose at the moon, and broke
out the long wolf howl. the others sat down and howled. and now the
call came to buck in unmistakable accents. he, too, sat down and
howled. this over, he came out of his angle and the pack crowded around
him, sniffing in half-friendly, half-savage manner. the leaders lifted
the yelp of the pack and sprang away into the woods. the wolves swung
in behind, yelping in chorus. and buck ran with them, side by side with
the wild brother, yelping as he ran.


and here may well end the story of buck. the years were not many when
the yeehats noted a change in the breed of timber wolves; for some were
seen with splashes of brown on head and muzzle, and with a rift of
white centring down the chest. but more remarkable than this, the
yeehats tell of a ghost dog that runs at the head of the pack. they are
afraid of this ghost dog, for it has cunning greater than they,
stealing from their camps in fierce winters, robbing their traps,
slaying their dogs, and defying their bravest hunters.

nay, the tale grows worse. hunters there are who fail to return to the
camp, and hunters there have been whom their tribesmen found with
throats slashed cruelly open and with wolf prints about them in the
snow greater than the prints of any wolf. each fall, when the yeehats
follow the movement of the moose, there is a certain valley which they
never enter. and women there are who become sad when the word goes over
the fire of how the evil spirit came to select that valley for an
abiding-place.

in the summers there is one visitor, however, to that valley, of which
the yeehats do not know. it is a great, gloriously coated wolf, like,
and yet unlike, all other wolves. he crosses alone from the smiling
timber land and comes down into an open space among the trees. here a
yellow stream flows from rotted moose-hide sacks and sinks into the
ground, with long grasses growing through it and vegetable mould
overrunning it and hiding its yellow from the sun; and here he muses
for a time, howling once, long and mournfully, ere he departs.

but he is not always alone. when the long winter nights come on and the
wolves follow their meat into the lower valleys, he may be seen running
at the head of the pack through the pale moonlight or glimmering
borealis, leaping gigantic above his fellows, his great throat a-bellow
as he sings a song of the younger world, which is the song of the pack.

preface


the experiences related in this volume fell to me in the summer of 1902.
i went down into the under-world of london with an attitude of mind which
i may best liken to that of the explorer.  i was open to be convinced by
the evidence of my eyes, rather than by the teachings of those who had
not seen, or by the words of those who had seen and gone before.  further,
i took with me certain simple criteria with which to measure the life of
the under-world.  that which made for more life, for physical and
spiritual health, was good; that which made for less life, which hurt,
and dwarfed, and distorted life, was bad.

it will be readily apparent to the reader that i saw much that was bad.
yet it must not be forgotten that the time of which i write was
considered "good times" in england.  the starvation and lack of shelter i
encountered constituted a chronic condition of misery which is never
wiped out, even in the periods of greatest prosperity.

following the summer in question came a hard winter.  great numbers of
the unemployed formed into processions, as many as a dozen at a time, and
daily marched through the streets of london crying for bread.  mr. justin
mccarthy, writing in the month of january 1903, to the new york
_independent_, briefly epitomises the situation as follows:-

   "the workhouses have no space left in which to pack the starving
   crowds who are craving every day and night at their doors for food and
   shelter.  all the charitable institutions have exhausted their means
   in trying to raise supplies of food for the famishing residents of the
   garrets and cellars of london lanes and alleys.  the quarters of the
   salvation army in various parts of london are nightly besieged by
   hosts of the unemployed and the hungry for whom neither shelter nor
   the means of sustenance can be provided."

it has been urged that the criticism i have passed on things as they are
in england is too pessimistic.  i must say, in extenuation, that of
optimists i am the most optimistic.  but i measure manhood less by
political aggregations than by individuals.  society grows, while
political machines rack to pieces and become "scrap."  for the english,
so far as manhood and womanhood and health and happiness go, i see a
broad and smiling future.  but for a great deal of the political
machinery, which at present mismanages for them, i see nothing else than
the scrap heap.

chapter i--the descent


"but you can't do it, you know," friends said, to whom i applied for
assistance in the matter of sinking myself down into the east end of
london.  "you had better see the police for a guide," they added, on
second thought, painfully endeavouring to adjust themselves to the
psychological processes of a madman who had come to them with better
credentials than brains.

"but i don't want to see the police," i protested.  "what i wish to do is
to go down into the east end and see things for myself.  i wish to know
how those people are living there, and why they are living there, and
what they are living for.  in short, i am going to live there myself."

"you don't want to _live_ down there!" everybody said, with
disapprobation writ large upon their faces.  "why, it is said there are
places where a man's life isn't worth tu'pence."

"the very places i wish to see," i broke in.

"but you can't, you know," was the unfailing rejoinder.

"which is not what i came to see you about," i answered brusquely,
somewhat nettled by their incomprehension.  "i am a stranger here, and i
want you to tell me what you know of the east end, in order that i may
have something to start on."

"but we know nothing of the east end.  it is over there, somewhere."  and
they waved their hands vaguely in the direction where the sun on rare
occasions may be seen to rise.

"then i shall go to cook's," i announced.

"oh yes," they said, with relief.  "cook's will be sure to know."

but o cook, o thomas cook & son, path-finders and trail-clearers, living
sign-posts to all the world, and bestowers of first aid to bewildered
travellers--unhesitatingly and instantly, with ease and celerity, could
you send me to darkest africa or innermost thibet, but to the east end of
london, barely a stone's throw distant from ludgate circus, you know not
the way!

"you can't do it, you know," said the human emporium of routes and fares
at cook's cheapside branch.  "it is so--hem--so unusual."

"consult the police," he concluded authoritatively, when i had persisted.
"we are not accustomed to taking travellers to the east end; we receive
no call to take them there, and we know nothing whatsoever about the
place at all."

"never mind that," i interposed, to save myself from being swept out of
the office by his flood of negations.  "here's something you can do for
me.  i wish you to understand in advance what i intend doing, so that in
case of trouble you may be able to identify me."

"ah, i see! should you be murdered, we would be in position to identify
the corpse."

he said it so cheerfully and cold-bloodedly that on the instant i saw my
stark and mutilated cadaver stretched upon a slab where cool waters
trickle ceaselessly, and him i saw bending over and sadly and patiently
identifying it as the body of the insane american who _would_ see the
east end.

"no, no," i answered; "merely to identify me in case i get into a scrape
with the 'bobbies.'"  this last i said with a thrill; truly, i was
gripping hold of the vernacular.

"that," he said, "is a matter for the consideration of the chief office."

"it is so unprecedented, you know," he added apologetically.

the man at the chief office hemmed and hawed.  "we make it a rule," he
explained, "to give no information concerning our clients."

"but in this case," i urged, "it is the client who requests you to give
the information concerning himself."

again he hemmed and hawed.

"of course," i hastily anticipated, "i know it is unprecedented, but--"

"as i was about to remark," he went on steadily, "it is unprecedented,
and i don't think we can do anything for you."

however, i departed with the address of a detective who lived in the east
end, and took my way to the american consul-general.  and here, at last,
i found a man with whom i could "do business."  there was no hemming and
hawing, no lifted brows, open incredulity, or blank amazement.  in one
minute i explained myself and my project, which he accepted as a matter
of course.  in the second minute he asked my age, height, and weight, and
looked me over.  and in the third minute, as we shook hands at parting,
he said: "all right, jack.  i'll remember you and keep track."

i breathed a sigh of relief.  having burnt my ships behind me, i was now
free to plunge into that human wilderness of which nobody seemed to know
anything.  but at once i encountered a new difficulty in the shape of my
cabby, a grey-whiskered and eminently decorous personage who had
imperturbably driven me for several hours about the "city."

"drive me down to the east end," i ordered, taking my seat.

"where, sir?" he demanded with frank surprise.

"to the east end, anywhere.  go on."

the hansom pursued an aimless way for several minutes, then came to a
puzzled stop.  the aperture above my head was uncovered, and the cabman
peered down perplexedly at me.

"i say," he said, "wot plyce yer wanter go?"

"east end," i repeated.  "nowhere in particular.  just drive me around
anywhere."

"but wot's the haddress, sir?"

"see here!" i thundered.  "drive me down to the east end, and at once!"

it was evident that he did not understand, but he withdrew his head, and
grumblingly started his horse.

nowhere in the streets of london may one escape the sight of abject
poverty, while five minutes' walk from almost any point will bring one to
a slum; but the region my hansom was now penetrating was one unending
slum.  the streets were filled with a new and different race of people,
short of stature, and of wretched or beer-sodden appearance.  we rolled
along through miles of bricks and squalor, and from each cross street and
alley flashed long vistas of bricks and misery.  here and there lurched a
drunken man or woman, and the air was obscene with sounds of jangling and
squabbling.  at a market, tottery old men and women were searching in the
garbage thrown in the mud for rotten potatoes, beans, and vegetables,
while little children clustered like flies around a festering mass of
fruit, thrusting their arms to the shoulders into the liquid corruption,
and drawing forth morsels but partially decayed, which they devoured on
the spot.

not a hansom did i meet with in all my drive, while mine was like an
apparition from another and better world, the way the children ran after
it and alongside.  and as far as i could see were the solid walls of
brick, the slimy pavements, and the screaming streets; and for the first
time in my life the fear of the crowd smote me.  it was like the fear of
the sea; and the miserable multitudes, street upon street, seemed so many
waves of a vast and malodorous sea, lapping about me and threatening to
well up and over me.

"stepney, sir; stepney station," the cabby called down.

i looked about.  it was really a railroad station, and he had driven
desperately to it as the one familiar spot he had ever heard of in all
that wilderness.

"well," i said.

he spluttered unintelligibly, shook his head, and looked very miserable.
"i'm a strynger 'ere," he managed to articulate.  "an' if yer don't want
stepney station, i'm blessed if i know wotcher do want."

"i'll tell you what i want," i said.  "you drive along and keep your eye
out for a shop where old clothes are sold.  now, when you see such a
shop, drive right on till you turn the corner, then stop and let me out."

i could see that he was growing dubious of his fare, but not long
afterwards he pulled up to the curb and informed me that an old-clothes
shop was to be found a bit of the way back.

"won'tcher py me?" he pleaded.  "there's seven an' six owin' me."

"yes," i laughed, "and it would be the last i'd see of you."

"lord lumme, but it'll be the last i see of you if yer don't py me," he
retorted.

but a crowd of ragged onlookers had already gathered around the cab, and
i laughed again and walked back to the old-clothes shop.

here the chief difficulty was in making the shopman understand that i
really and truly wanted old clothes.  but after fruitless attempts to
press upon me new and impossible coats and trousers, he began to bring to
light heaps of old ones, looking mysterious the while and hinting darkly.
this he did with the palpable intention of letting me know that he had
"piped my lay," in order to bulldose me, through fear of exposure, into
paying heavily for my purchases.  a man in trouble, or a high-class
criminal from across the water, was what he took my measure for--in
either case, a person anxious to avoid the police.

but i disputed with him over the outrageous difference between prices and
values, till i quite disabused him of the notion, and he settled down to
drive a hard bargain with a hard customer.  in the end i selected a pair
of stout though well-worn trousers, a frayed jacket with one remaining
button, a pair of brogans which had plainly seen service where coal was
shovelled, a thin leather belt, and a very dirty cloth cap.  my
underclothing and socks, however, were new and warm, but of the sort that
any american waif, down in his luck, could acquire in the ordinary course
of events.

"i must sy yer a sharp 'un," he said, with counterfeit admiration, as i
handed over the ten shillings finally agreed upon for the outfit.
"blimey, if you ain't ben up an' down petticut lane afore now.  yer
trouseys is wuth five bob to hany man, an' a docker 'ud give two an' six
for the shoes, to sy nothin' of the coat an' cap an' new stoker's singlet
an' hother things."

"how much will you give me for them?" i demanded suddenly.  "i paid you
ten bob for the lot, and i'll sell them back to you, right now, for
eight!  come, it's a go!"

but he grinned and shook his head, and though i had made a good bargain,
i was unpleasantly aware that he had made a better one.

i found the cabby and a policeman with their heads together, but the
latter, after looking me over sharply, and particularly scrutinizing the
bundle under my arm, turned away and left the cabby to wax mutinous by
himself.  and not a step would he budge till i paid him the seven
shillings and sixpence owing him.  whereupon he was willing to drive me
to the ends of the earth, apologising profusely for his insistence, and
explaining that one ran across queer customers in london town.

but he drove me only to highbury vale, in north london, where my luggage
was waiting for me.  here, next day, i took off my shoes (not without
regret for their lightness and comfort), and my soft, grey travelling
suit, and, in fact, all my clothing; and proceeded to array myself in the
clothes of the other and unimaginable men, who must have been indeed
unfortunate to have had to part with such rags for the pitiable sums
obtainable from a dealer.

inside my stoker's singlet, in the armpit, i sewed a gold sovereign (an
emergency sum certainly of modest proportions); and inside my stoker's
singlet i put myself.  and then i sat down and moralised upon the fair
years and fat, which had made my skin soft and brought the nerves close
to the surface; for the singlet was rough and raspy as a hair shirt, and
i am confident that the most rigorous of ascetics suffer no more than i
did in the ensuing twenty-four hours.

the remainder of my costume was fairly easy to put on, though the
brogans, or brogues, were quite a problem.  as stiff and hard as if made
of wood, it was only after a prolonged pounding of the uppers with my
fists that i was able to get my feet into them at all.  then, with a few
shillings, a knife, a handkerchief, and some brown papers and flake
tobacco stowed away in my pockets, i thumped down the stairs and said
good-bye to my foreboding friends.  as i paused out of the door, the
"help," a comely middle-aged woman, could not conquer a grin that twisted
her lips and separated them till the throat, out of involuntary sympathy,
made the uncouth animal noises we are wont to designate as "laughter."

no sooner was i out on the streets than i was impressed by the difference
in status effected by my clothes.  all servility vanished from the
demeanour of the common people with whom i came in contact.  presto! in
the twinkling of an eye, so to say, i had become one of them.  my frayed
and out-at-elbows jacket was the badge and advertisement of my class,
which was their class.  it made me of like kind, and in place of the
fawning and too respectful attention i had hitherto received, i now
shared with them a comradeship.  the man in corduroy and dirty
neckerchief no longer addressed me as "sir" or "governor."  it was "mate"
now--and a fine and hearty word, with a tingle to it, and a warmth and
gladness, which the other term does not possess.  governor!  it smacks of
mastery, and power, and high authority--the tribute of the man who is
under to the man on top, delivered in the hope that he will let up a bit
and ease his weight, which is another way of saying that it is an appeal
for alms.

this brings me to a delight i experienced in my rags and tatters which is
denied the average american abroad.  the european traveller from the
states, who is not a croesus, speedily finds himself reduced to a chronic
state of self-conscious sordidness by the hordes of cringing robbers who
clutter his steps from dawn till dark, and deplete his pocket-book in a
way that puts compound interest to the blush.

in my rags and tatters i escaped the pestilence of tipping, and
encountered men on a basis of equality.  nay, before the day was out i
turned the tables, and said, most gratefully, "thank you, sir," to a
gentleman whose horse i held, and who dropped a penny into my eager palm.

other changes i discovered were wrought in my condition by my new garb.
in crossing crowded thoroughfares i found i had to be, if anything, more
lively in avoiding vehicles, and it was strikingly impressed upon me that
my life had cheapened in direct ratio with my clothes.  when before i
inquired the way of a policeman, i was usually asked, "bus or 'ansom,
sir?"  but now the query became, "walk or ride?"  also, at the railway
stations, a third-class ticket was now shoved out to me as a matter of
course.

but there was compensation for it all.  for the first time i met the
english lower classes face to face, and knew them for what they were.
when loungers and workmen, at street corners and in public-houses, talked
with me, they talked as one man to another, and they talked as natural
men should talk, without the least idea of getting anything out of me for
what they talked or the way they talked.

and when at last i made into the east end, i was gratified to find that
the fear of the crowd no longer haunted me.  i had become a part of it.
the vast and malodorous sea had welled up and over me, or i had slipped
gently into it, and there was nothing fearsome about it--with the one
exception of the stoker's singlet.




chapter ii--johnny upright


i shall not give you the address of johnny upright.  let it suffice that
he lives in the most respectable street in the east end--a street that
would be considered very mean in america, but a veritable oasis in the
desert of east london.  it is surrounded on every side by close-packed
squalor and streets jammed by a young and vile and dirty generation; but
its own pavements are comparatively bare of the children who have no
other place to play, while it has an air of desertion, so few are the
people that come and go.

each house in this street, as in all the streets, is shoulder to shoulder
with its neighbours.  to each house there is but one entrance, the front
door; and each house is about eighteen feet wide, with a bit of a brick-
walled yard behind, where, when it is not raining, one may look at a
slate-coloured sky.  but it must be understood that this is east end
opulence we are now considering.  some of the people in this street are
even so well-to-do as to keep a "slavey."  johnny upright keeps one, as i
well know, she being my first acquaintance in this particular portion of
the world.

to johnny upright's house i came, and to the door came the "slavey."  now,
mark you, her position in life was pitiable and contemptible, but it was
with pity and contempt that she looked at me.  she evinced a plain desire
that our conversation should be short.  it was sunday, and johnny upright
was not at home, and that was all there was to it.  but i lingered,
discussing whether or not it was all there was to it, till mrs. johnny
upright was attracted to the door, where she scolded the girl for not
having closed it before turning her attention to me.

no, mr. johnny upright was not at home, and further, he saw nobody on
sunday.  it is too bad, said i.  was i looking for work?  no, quite the
contrary; in fact, i had come to see johnny upright on business which
might be profitable to him.

a change came over the face of things at once.  the gentleman in question
was at church, but would be home in an hour or thereabouts, when no doubt
he could be seen.

would i kindly step in?--no, the lady did not ask me, though i fished for
an invitation by stating that i would go down to the corner and wait in a
public-house.  and down to the corner i went, but, it being church time,
the "pub" was closed.  a miserable drizzle was falling, and, in lieu of
better, i took a seat on a neighbourly doorstep and waited.

and here to the doorstep came the "slavey," very frowzy and very
perplexed, to tell me that the missus would let me come back and wait in
the kitchen.

"so many people come 'ere lookin' for work," mrs. johnny upright
apologetically explained.  "so i 'ope you won't feel bad the way i
spoke."

"not at all, not at all," i replied in my grandest manner, for the nonce
investing my rags with dignity.  "i quite understand, i assure you.  i
suppose people looking for work almost worry you to death?"

"that they do," she answered, with an eloquent and expressive glance; and
thereupon ushered me into, not the kitchen, but the dining room--a
favour, i took it, in recompense for my grand manner.

this dining-room, on the same floor as the kitchen, was about four feet
below the level of the ground, and so dark (it was midday) that i had to
wait a space for my eyes to adjust themselves to the gloom.  dirty light
filtered in through a window, the top of which was on a level with a
sidewalk, and in this light i found that i was able to read newspaper
print.

and here, while waiting the coming of johnny upright, let me explain my
errand.  while living, eating, and sleeping with the people of the east
end, it was my intention to have a port of refuge, not too far distant,
into which could run now and again to assure myself that good clothes and
cleanliness still existed.  also in such port i could receive my mail,
work up my notes, and sally forth occasionally in changed garb to
civilisation.

but this involved a dilemma.  a lodging where my property would be safe
implied a landlady apt to be suspicious of a gentleman leading a double
life; while a landlady who would not bother her head over the double life
of her lodgers would imply lodgings where property was unsafe.  to avoid
the dilemma was what had brought me to johnny upright.  a detective of
thirty-odd years' continuous service in the east end, known far and wide
by a name given him by a convicted felon in the dock, he was just the man
to find me an honest landlady, and make her rest easy concerning the
strange comings and goings of which i might be guilty.

his two daughters beat him home from church--and pretty girls they were
in their sunday dresses; withal it was the certain weak and delicate
prettiness which characterises the cockney lasses, a prettiness which is
no more than a promise with no grip on time, and doomed to fade quickly
away like the colour from a sunset sky.

they looked me over with frank curiosity, as though i were some sort of a
strange animal, and then ignored me utterly for the rest of my wait.  then
johnny upright himself arrived, and i was summoned upstairs to confer
with him.

"speak loud," he interrupted my opening words.  "i've got a bad cold, and
i can't hear well."

shades of old sleuth and sherlock holmes!  i wondered as to where the
assistant was located whose duty it was to take down whatever information
i might loudly vouchsafe.  and to this day, much as i have seen of johnny
upright and much as i have puzzled over the incident, i have never been
quite able to make up my mind as to whether or not he had a cold, or had
an assistant planted in the other room.  but of one thing i am sure:
though i gave johnny upright the facts concerning myself and project, he
withheld judgment till next day, when i dodged into his street
conventionally garbed and in a hansom.  then his greeting was cordial
enough, and i went down into the dining-room to join the family at tea.

"we are humble here," he said, "not given to the flesh, and you must take
us for what we are, in our humble way."

the girls were flushed and embarrassed at greeting me, while he did not
make it any the easier for them.

"ha! ha!" he roared heartily, slapping the table with his open hand till
the dishes rang.  "the girls thought yesterday you had come to ask for a
piece of bread!  ha! ha! ho! ho! ho!"

this they indignantly denied, with snapping eyes and guilty red cheeks,
as though it were an essential of true refinement to be able to discern
under his rags a man who had no need to go ragged.

and then, while i ate bread and marmalade, proceeded a play at cross
purposes, the daughters deeming it an insult to me that i should have
been mistaken for a beggar, and the father considering it as the highest
compliment to my cleverness to succeed in being so mistaken.  all of
which i enjoyed, and the bread, the marmalade, and the tea, till the time
came for johnny upright to find me a lodging, which he did, not half-a-
dozen doors away, in his own respectable and opulent street, in a house
as like to his own as a pea to its mate.




chapter iii--my lodging and some others


from an east london standpoint, the room i rented for six shillings, or a
dollar and a half, per week, was a most comfortable affair.  from the
american standpoint, on the other hand, it was rudely furnished,
uncomfortable, and small.  by the time i had added an ordinary typewriter
table to its scanty furnishing, i was hard put to turn around; at the
best, i managed to navigate it by a sort of vermicular progression
requiring great dexterity and presence of mind.

having settled myself, or my property rather, i put on my knockabout
clothes and went out for a walk.  lodgings being fresh in my mind, i
began to look them up, bearing in mind the hypothesis that i was a poor
young man with a wife and large family.

my first discovery was that empty houses were few and far between--so far
between, in fact, that though i walked miles in irregular circles over a
large area, i still remained between.  not one empty house could i find--a
conclusive proof that the district was "saturated."

it being plain that as a poor young man with a family i could rent no
houses at all in this most undesirable region, i next looked for rooms,
unfurnished rooms, in which i could store my wife and babies and
chattels.  there were not many, but i found them, usually in the
singular, for one appears to be considered sufficient for a poor man's
family in which to cook and eat and sleep.  when i asked for two rooms,
the sublettees looked at me very much in the manner, i imagine, that a
certain personage looked at oliver twist when he asked for more.

not only was one room deemed sufficient for a poor man and his family,
but i learned that many families, occupying single rooms, had so much
space to spare as to be able to take in a lodger or two.  when such rooms
can be rented for from three to six shillings per week, it is a fair
conclusion that a lodger with references should obtain floor space for,
say, from eightpence to a shilling.  he may even be able to board with
the sublettees for a few shillings more.  this, however, i failed to
inquire into--a reprehensible error on my part, considering that i was
working on the basis of a hypothetical family.

not only did the houses i investigated have no bath-tubs, but i learned
that there were no bath-tubs in all the thousands of houses i had seen.
under the circumstances, with my wife and babies and a couple of lodgers
suffering from the too great spaciousness of one room, taking a bath in a
tin wash-basin would be an unfeasible undertaking.  but, it seems, the
compensation comes in with the saving of soap, so all's well, and god's
still in heaven.

however, i rented no rooms, but returned to my own johnny upright's
street.  what with my wife, and babies, and lodgers, and the various
cubby-holes into which i had fitted them, my mind's eye had become narrow-
angled, and i could not quite take in all of my own room at once.  the
immensity of it was awe-inspiring.  could this be the room i had rented
for six shillings a week?  impossible!  but my landlady, knocking at the
door to learn if i were comfortable, dispelled my doubts.

"oh yes, sir," she said, in reply to a question.  "this street is the
very last.  all the other streets were like this eight or ten years ago,
and all the people were very respectable.  but the others have driven our
kind out.  those in this street are the only ones left.  it's shocking,
sir!"

and then she explained the process of saturation, by which the rental
value of a neighbourhood went up, while its tone went down.

"you see, sir, our kind are not used to crowding in the way the others
do.  we need more room.  the others, the foreigners and lower-class
people, can get five and six families into this house, where we only get
one.  so they can pay more rent for the house than we can afford.  it
_is_ shocking, sir; and just to think, only a few years ago all this
neighbourhood was just as nice as it could be."

i looked at her.  here was a woman, of the finest grade of the english
working-class, with numerous evidences of refinement, being slowly
engulfed by that noisome and rotten tide of humanity which the powers
that be are pouring eastward out of london town.  bank, factory, hotel,
and office building must go up, and the city poor folk are a nomadic
breed; so they migrate eastward, wave upon wave, saturating and degrading
neighbourhood by neighbourhood, driving the better class of workers
before them to pioneer, on the rim of the city, or dragging them down, if
not in the first generation, surely in the second and third.

it is only a question of months when johnny upright's street must go.  he
realises it himself.

"in a couple of years," he says, "my lease expires.  my landlord is one
of our kind.  he has not put up the rent on any of his houses here, and
this has enabled us to stay.  but any day he may sell, or any day he may
die, which is the same thing so far as we are concerned.  the house is
bought by a money breeder, who builds a sweat shop on the patch of ground
at the rear where my grapevine is, adds to the house, and rents it a room
to a family.  there you are, and johnny upright's gone!"

and truly i saw johnny upright, and his good wife and fair daughters, and
frowzy slavey, like so many ghosts flitting eastward through the gloom,
the monster city roaring at their heels.

but johnny upright is not alone in his flitting.  far, far out, on the
fringe of the city, live the small business men, little managers, and
successful clerks.  they dwell in cottages and semi-detached villas, with
bits of flower garden, and elbow room, and breathing space.  they inflate
themselves with pride, and throw out their chests when they contemplate
the abyss from which they have escaped, and they thank god that they are
not as other men.  and lo! down upon them comes johnny upright and the
monster city at his heels.  tenements spring up like magic, gardens are
built upon, villas are divided and subdivided into many dwellings, and
the black night of london settles down in a greasy pall.




chapter iv--a man and the abyss


"i say, can you let a lodging?"

these words i discharged carelessly over my shoulder at a stout and
elderly woman, of whose fare i was partaking in a greasy coffee-house
down near the pool and not very far from limehouse.

"oh yus," she answered shortly, my appearance possibly not approximating
the standard of affluence required by her house.

i said no more, consuming my rasher of bacon and pint of sickly tea in
silence.  nor did she take further interest in me till i came to pay my
reckoning (fourpence), when i pulled all of ten shillings out of my
pocket.  the expected result was produced.

"yus, sir," she at once volunteered; "i 'ave nice lodgin's you'd likely
tyke a fancy to.  back from a voyage, sir?"

"how much for a room?" i inquired, ignoring her curiosity.

she looked me up and down with frank surprise.  "i don't let rooms, not
to my reg'lar lodgers, much less casuals."

"then i'll have to look along a bit," i said, with marked disappointment.

but the sight of my ten shillings had made her keen.  "i can let you have
a nice bed in with two hother men," she urged.  "good, respectable men,
an' steady."

"but i don't want to sleep with two other men," i objected.

"you don't 'ave to.  there's three beds in the room, an' hit's not a very
small room."

"how much?" i demanded.

"'arf a crown a week, two an' six, to a regular lodger.  you'll fancy the
men, i'm sure.  one works in the ware'ouse, an' 'e's been with me two
years now.  an' the hother's bin with me six--six years, sir, an' two
months comin' nex' saturday.  'e's a scene-shifter," she went on.  "a
steady, respectable man, never missin' a night's work in the time 'e's
bin with me.  an' 'e likes the 'ouse; 'e says as it's the best 'e can do
in the w'y of lodgin's.  i board 'im, an' the hother lodgers too."

"i suppose he's saving money right along," i insinuated innocently.

"bless you, no!  nor can 'e do as well helsewhere with 'is money."

and i thought of my own spacious west, with room under its sky and
unlimited air for a thousand londons; and here was this man, a steady and
reliable man, never missing a night's work, frugal and honest, lodging in
one room with two other men, paying two dollars and a half per month for
it, and out of his experience adjudging it to be the best he could do!
and here was i, on the strength of the ten shillings in my pocket, able
to enter in with my rags and take up my bed with him.  the human soul is
a lonely thing, but it must be very lonely sometimes when there are three
beds to a room, and casuals with ten shillings are admitted.

"how long have you been here?" i asked.

"thirteen years, sir; an' don't you think you'll fancy the lodgin'?"

the while she talked she was shuffling ponderously about the small
kitchen in which she cooked the food for her lodgers who were also
boarders.  when i first entered, she had been hard at work, nor had she
let up once throughout the conversation.  undoubtedly she was a busy
woman.  "up at half-past five," "to bed the last thing at night,"
"workin' fit ter drop," thirteen years of it, and for reward, grey hairs,
frowzy clothes, stooped shoulders, slatternly figure, unending toil in a
foul and noisome coffee-house that faced on an alley ten feet between the
walls, and a waterside environment that was ugly and sickening, to say
the least.

"you'll be hin hagain to 'ave a look?" she questioned wistfully, as i
went out of the door.

and as i turned and looked at her, i realized to the full the deeper
truth underlying that very wise old maxim: "virtue is its own reward."

i went back to her.  "have you ever taken a vacation?" i asked.

"vycytion!"

"a trip to the country for a couple of days, fresh air, a day off, you
know, a rest."

"lor' lumme!" she laughed, for the first time stopping from her work.  "a
vycytion, eh? for the likes o' me?  just fancy, now!--mind yer
feet!"--this last sharply, and to me, as i stumbled over the rotten
threshold.

down near the west india dock i came upon a young fellow staring
disconsolately at the muddy water.  a fireman's cap was pulled down
across his eyes, and the fit and sag of his clothes whispered
unmistakably of the sea.

"hello, mate," i greeted him, sparring for a beginning.  "can you tell me
the way to wapping?"

"worked yer way over on a cattle boat?" he countered, fixing my
nationality on the instant.

and thereupon we entered upon a talk that extended itself to a public-
house and a couple of pints of "arf an' arf."  this led to closer
intimacy, so that when i brought to light all of a shilling's worth of
coppers (ostensibly my all), and put aside sixpence for a bed, and
sixpence for more arf an' arf, he generously proposed that we drink up
the whole shilling.

"my mate, 'e cut up rough las' night," he explained.  "an' the bobbies
got 'm, so you can bunk in wi' me.  wotcher say?"

i said yes, and by the time we had soaked ourselves in a whole shilling's
worth of beer, and slept the night on a miserable bed in a miserable den,
i knew him pretty fairly for what he was.  and that in one respect he was
representative of a large body of the lower-class london workman, my
later experience substantiates.

he was london-born, his father a fireman and a drinker before him.  as a
child, his home was the streets and the docks.  he had never learned to
read, and had never felt the need for it--a vain and useless
accomplishment, he held, at least for a man of his station in life.

he had had a mother and numerous squalling brothers and sisters, all
crammed into a couple of rooms and living on poorer and less regular food
than he could ordinarily rustle for himself.  in fact, he never went home
except at periods when he was unfortunate in procuring his own food.
petty pilfering and begging along the streets and docks, a trip or two to
sea as mess-boy, a few trips more as coal-trimmer, and then a
full-fledged fireman, he had reached the top of his life.

and in the course of this he had also hammered out a philosophy of life,
an ugly and repulsive philosophy, but withal a very logical and sensible
one from his point of view.  when i asked him what he lived for, he
immediately answered, "booze."  a voyage to sea (for a man must live and
get the wherewithal), and then the paying off and the big drunk at the
end.  after that, haphazard little drunks, sponged in the "pubs" from
mates with a few coppers left, like myself, and when sponging was played
out another trip to sea and a repetition of the beastly cycle.

"but women," i suggested, when he had finished proclaiming booze the sole
end of existence.

"wimmen!"  he thumped his pot upon the bar and orated eloquently.  "wimmen
is a thing my edication 'as learnt me t' let alone.  it don't pay, matey;
it don't pay.  wot's a man like me want o' wimmen, eh? jest you tell me.
there was my mar, she was enough, a-bangin' the kids about an' makin' the
ole man mis'rable when 'e come 'ome, w'ich was seldom, i grant.  an' fer
w'y?  becos o' mar!  she didn't make 'is 'ome 'appy, that was w'y.  then,
there's the other wimmen, 'ow do they treat a pore stoker with a few
shillin's in 'is trouseys?  a good drunk is wot 'e's got in 'is pockits,
a good long drunk, an' the wimmen skin 'im out of his money so quick 'e
ain't 'ad 'ardly a glass.  i know.  i've 'ad my fling, an' i know wot's
wot.  an' i tell you, where's wimmen is trouble--screechin' an' carryin'
on, fightin', cuttin', bobbies, magistrates, an' a month's 'ard labour
back of it all, an' no pay-day when you come out."

"but a wife and children," i insisted.  "a home of your own, and all
that.  think of it, back from a voyage, little children climbing on your
knee, and the wife happy and smiling, and a kiss for you when she lays
the table, and a kiss all round from the babies when they go to bed, and
the kettle singing and the long talk afterwards of where you've been and
what you've seen, and of her and all the little happenings at home while
you've been away, and--"

"garn!" he cried, with a playful shove of his fist on my shoulder.  "wot's
yer game, eh?  a missus kissin' an' kids clim'in', an' kettle singin',
all on four poun' ten a month w'en you 'ave a ship, an' four nothin' w'en
you 'aven't.  i'll tell you wot i'd get on four poun' ten--a missus
rowin', kids squallin', no coal t' make the kettle sing, an' the kettle
up the spout, that's wot i'd get.  enough t' make a bloke bloomin' well
glad to be back t' sea.  a missus!  wot for?  t' make you mis'rable?
kids?  jest take my counsel, matey, an' don't 'ave 'em.  look at me!  i
can 'ave my beer w'en i like, an' no blessed missus an' kids a-crying for
bread.  i'm 'appy, i am, with my beer an' mates like you, an' a good ship
comin', an' another trip to sea.  so i say, let's 'ave another pint.  arf
an' arf's good enough for me."

without going further with the speech of this young fellow of two-and-
twenty, i think i have sufficiently indicated his philosophy of life and
the underlying economic reason for it.  home life he had never known.  the
word "home" aroused nothing but unpleasant associations.  in the low
wages of his father, and of other men in the same walk in life, he found
sufficient reason for branding wife and children as encumbrances and
causes of masculine misery.  an unconscious hedonist, utterly unmoral and
materialistic, he sought the greatest possible happiness for himself, and
found it in drink.

a young sot; a premature wreck; physical inability to do a stoker's work;
the gutter or the workhouse; and the end--he saw it all as clearly as i,
but it held no terrors for him.  from the moment of his birth, all the
forces of his environment had tended to harden him, and he viewed his
wretched, inevitable future with a callousness and unconcern i could not
shake.

and yet he was not a bad man.  he was not inherently vicious and brutal.
he had normal mentality, and a more than average physique.  his eyes were
blue and round, shaded by long lashes, and wide apart.  and there was a
laugh in them, and a fund of humour behind.  the brow and general
features were good, the mouth and lips sweet, though already developing a
harsh twist.  the chin was weak, but not too weak; i have seen men
sitting in the high places with weaker.

his head was shapely, and so gracefully was it poised upon a perfect neck
that i was not surprised by his body that night when he stripped for bed.
i have seen many men strip, in gymnasium and training quarters, men of
good blood and upbringing, but i have never seen one who stripped to
better advantage than this young sot of two-and-twenty, this young god
doomed to rack and ruin in four or five short years, and to pass hence
without posterity to receive the splendid heritage it was his to
bequeath.

it seemed sacrilege to waste such life, and yet i was forced to confess
that he was right in not marrying on four pounds ten in london town.  just
as the scene-shifter was happier in making both ends meet in a room
shared with two other men, than he would have been had he packed a feeble
family along with a couple of men into a cheaper room, and failed in
making both ends meet.

and day by day i became convinced that not only is it unwise, but it is
criminal for the people of the abyss to marry.  they are the stones by
the builder rejected.  there is no place for them, in the social fabric,
while all the forces of society drive them downward till they perish.  at
the bottom of the abyss they are feeble, besotted, and imbecile.  if they
reproduce, the life is so cheap that perforce it perishes of itself.  the
work of the world goes on above them, and they do not care to take part
in it, nor are they able.  moreover, the work of the world does not need
them.  there are plenty, far fitter than they, clinging to the steep
slope above, and struggling frantically to slide no more.

in short, the london abyss is a vast shambles.  year by year, and decade
after decade, rural england pours in a flood of vigorous strong life,
that not only does not renew itself, but perishes by the third
generation.  competent authorities aver that the london workman whose
parents and grand-parents were born in london is so remarkable a specimen
that he is rarely found.

mr. a. c. pigou has said that the aged poor, and the residuum which
compose the "submerged tenth," constitute 71 per cent, of the population
of london.  which is to say that last year, and yesterday, and to-day, at
this very moment, 450,000 of these creatures are dying miserably at the
bottom of the social pit called "london."  as to how they die, i shall
take an instance from this morning's paper.

   self-neglect

   yesterday dr. wynn westcott held an inquest at shoreditch, respecting
   the death of elizabeth crews, aged 77 years, of 32 east street,
   holborn, who died on wednesday last.  alice mathieson stated that she
   was landlady of the house where deceased lived.  witness last saw her
   alive on the previous monday.  she lived quite alone.  mr. francis
   birch, relieving officer for the holborn district, stated that
   deceased had occupied the room in question for thirty-five years.  when
   witness was called, on the 1st, he found the old woman in a terrible
   state, and the ambulance and coachman had to be disinfected after the
   removal.  dr. chase fennell said death was due to blood-poisoning from
   bed-sores, due to self-neglect and filthy surroundings, and the jury
   returned a verdict to that effect.

the most startling thing about this little incident of a woman's death is
the smug complacency with which the officials looked upon it and rendered
judgment.  that an old woman of seventy-seven years of age should die of
self-neglect is the most optimistic way possible of looking at it.  it
was the old dead woman's fault that she died, and having located the
responsibility, society goes contentedly on about its own affairs.

of the "submerged tenth" mr. pigou has said: "either through lack of
bodily strength, or of intelligence, or of fibre, or of all three, they
are inefficient or unwilling workers, and consequently unable to support
themselves . . . they are often so degraded in intellect as to be
incapable of distinguishing their right from their left hand, or of
recognising the numbers of their own houses; their bodies are feeble and
without stamina, their affections are warped, and they scarcely know what
family life means."

four hundred and fifty thousand is a whole lot of people.  the young
fireman was only one, and it took him some time to say his little say.  i
should not like to hear them all talk at once.  i wonder if god hears
them?




chapter v--those on the edge


my first impression of east london was naturally a general one.  later
the details began to appear, and here and there in the chaos of misery i
found little spots where a fair measure of happiness reigned--sometimes
whole rows of houses in little out-of-the-way streets, where artisans
dwell and where a rude sort of family life obtains.  in the evenings the
men can be seen at the doors, pipes in their mouths and children on their
knees, wives gossiping, and laughter and fun going on.  the content of
these people is manifestly great, for, relative to the wretchedness that
encompasses them, they are well off.

but at the best, it is a dull, animal happiness, the content of the full
belly.  the dominant note of their lives is materialistic.  they are
stupid and heavy, without imagination.  the abyss seems to exude a
stupefying atmosphere of torpor, which wraps about them and deadens them.
religion passes them by.  the unseen holds for them neither terror nor
delight.  they are unaware of the unseen; and the full belly and the
evening pipe, with their regular "arf an' arf," is all they demand, or
dream of demanding, from existence.

this would not be so bad if it were all; but it is not all.  the
satisfied torpor in which they are sunk is the deadly inertia that
precedes dissolution.  there is no progress, and with them not to
progress is to fall back and into the abyss.  in their own lives they may
only start to fall, leaving the fall to be completed by their children
and their children's children.  man always gets less than he demands from
life; and so little do they demand, that the less than little they get
cannot save them.

at the best, city life is an unnatural life for the human; but the city
life of london is so utterly unnatural that the average workman or
workwoman cannot stand it.  mind and body are sapped by the undermining
influences ceaselessly at work.  moral and physical stamina are broken,
and the good workman, fresh from the soil, becomes in the first city
generation a poor workman; and by the second city generation, devoid of
push and go and initiative, and actually unable physically to perform the
labour his father did, he is well on the way to the shambles at the
bottom of the abyss.

if nothing else, the air he breathes, and from which he never escapes, is
sufficient to weaken him mentally and physically, so that he becomes
unable to compete with the fresh virile life from the country hastening
on to london town to destroy and be destroyed.

leaving out the disease germs that fill the air of the east end, consider
but the one item of smoke.  sir william thiselton-dyer, curator of kew
gardens, has been studying smoke deposits on vegetation, and, according
to his calculations, no less than six tons of solid matter, consisting of
soot and tarry hydrocarbons, are deposited every week on every quarter of
a square mile in and about london.  this is equivalent to twenty-four
tons per week to the square mile, or 1248 tons per year to the square
mile.  from the cornice below the dome of st. paul's cathedral was
recently taken a solid deposit of crystallised sulphate of lime.  this
deposit had been formed by the action of the sulphuric acid in the
atmosphere upon the carbonate of lime in the stone.  and this sulphuric
acid in the atmosphere is constantly being breathed by the london workmen
through all the days and nights of their lives.

it is incontrovertible that the children grow up into rotten adults,
without virility or stamina, a weak-kneed, narrow-chested, listless
breed, that crumples up and goes down in the brute struggle for life with
the invading hordes from the country.  the railway men, carriers, omnibus
drivers, corn and timber porters, and all those who require physical
stamina, are largely drawn from the country; while in the metropolitan
police there are, roughly, 12,000 country-born as against 3000 london-
born.

so one is forced to conclude that the abyss is literally a huge
man-killing machine, and when i pass along the little out-of-the-way
streets with the full-bellied artisans at the doors, i am aware of a
greater sorrow for them than for the 450,000 lost and hopeless wretches
dying at the bottom of the pit.  they, at least, are dying, that is the
point; while these have yet to go through the slow and preliminary pangs
extending through two and even three generations.

and yet the quality of the life is good.  all human potentialities are in
it.  given proper conditions, it could live through the centuries, and
great men, heroes and masters, spring from it and make the world better
by having lived.

i talked with a woman who was representative of that type which has been
jerked out of its little out-of-the-way streets and has started on the
fatal fall to the bottom.  her husband was a fitter and a member of the
engineers' union.  that he was a poor engineer was evidenced by his
inability to get regular employment.  he did not have the energy and
enterprise necessary to obtain or hold a steady position.

the pair had two daughters, and the four of them lived in a couple of
holes, called "rooms" by courtesy, for which they paid seven shillings
per week.  they possessed no stove, managing their cooking on a single
gas-ring in the fireplace.  not being persons of property, they were
unable to obtain an unlimited supply of gas; but a clever machine had
been installed for their benefit.  by dropping a penny in the slot, the
gas was forthcoming, and when a penny's worth had forthcome the supply
was automatically shut off.  "a penny gawn in no time," she explained,
"an' the cookin' not arf done!"

incipient starvation had been their portion for years.  month in and
month out, they had arisen from the table able and willing to eat more.
and when once on the downward slope, chronic innutrition is an important
factor in sapping vitality and hastening the descent.

yet this woman was a hard worker.  from 4.30 in the morning till the last
light at night, she said, she had toiled at making cloth dress-skirts,
lined up and with two flounces, for seven shillings a dozen.  cloth dress-
skirts, mark you, lined up with two flounces, for seven shillings a
dozen!  this is equal to $1.75 per dozen, or 14.75 cents per skirt.

the husband, in order to obtain employment, had to belong to the union,
which collected one shilling and sixpence from him each week.  also, when
strikes were afoot and he chanced to be working, he had at times been
compelled to pay as high as seventeen shillings into the union's coffers
for the relief fund.

one daughter, the elder, had worked as green hand for a dressmaker, for
one shilling and sixpence per week--37.5 cents per week, or a fraction
over 5 cents per day.  however, when the slack season came she was
discharged, though she had been taken on at such low pay with the
understanding that she was to learn the trade and work up.  after that
she had been employed in a bicycle store for three years, for which she
received five shillings per week, walking two miles to her work, and two
back, and being fined for tardiness.

as far as the man and woman were concerned, the game was played.  they
had lost handhold and foothold, and were falling into the pit.  but what
of the daughters?  living like swine, enfeebled by chronic innutrition,
being sapped mentally, morally, and physically, what chance have they to
crawl up and out of the abyss into which they were born falling?

as i write this, and for an hour past, the air has been made hideous by a
free-for-all, rough-and-tumble fight going on in the yard that is back to
back with my yard.  when the first sounds reached me i took it for the
barking and snarling of dogs, and some minutes were required to convince
me that human beings, and women at that, could produce such a fearful
clamour.

drunken women fighting!  it is not nice to think of; it is far worse to
listen to.  something like this it runs--

incoherent babble, shrieked at the top of the lungs of several women; a
lull, in which is heard a child crying and a young girl's voice pleading
tearfully; a woman's voice rises, harsh and grating, "you 'it me!  jest
you 'it me!" then, swat! challenge accepted and fight rages afresh.

the back windows of the houses commanding the scene are lined with
enthusiastic spectators, and the sound of blows, and of oaths that make
one's blood run cold, are borne to my ears.  happily, i cannot see the
combatants.

a lull; "you let that child alone!" child, evidently of few years,
screaming in downright terror.  "awright," repeated insistently and at
top pitch twenty times straight running; "you'll git this rock on the
'ead!" and then rock evidently on the head from the shriek that goes up.

a lull; apparently one combatant temporarily disabled and being
resuscitated; child's voice audible again, but now sunk to a lower note
of terror and growing exhaustion.

voices begin to go up the scale, something like this:-

"yes?"

"yes!"

"yes?"

"yes!"

"yes?"

"yes!"

"yes?"

"yes!"

sufficient affirmation on both sides, conflict again precipitated.  one
combatant gets overwhelming advantage, and follows it up from the way the
other combatant screams bloody murder.  bloody murder gurgles and dies
out, undoubtedly throttled by a strangle hold.

entrance of new voices; a flank attack; strangle hold suddenly broken
from the way bloody murder goes up half an octave higher than before;
general hullaballoo, everybody fighting.

lull; new voice, young girl's, "i'm goin' ter tyke my mother's part;"
dialogue, repeated about five times, "i'll do as i like, blankety, blank,
blank!"  "i'd like ter see yer, blankety, blank, blank!" renewed
conflict, mothers, daughters, everybody, during which my landlady calls
her young daughter in from the back steps, while i wonder what will be
the effect of all that she has heard upon her moral fibre.




chapter vi--frying-pan alley and a glimpse of inferno


three of us walked down mile end road, and one was a hero.  he was a
slender lad of nineteen, so slight and frail, in fact, that, like fra
lippo lippi, a puff of wind might double him up and turn him over.  he
was a burning young socialist, in the first throes of enthusiasm and ripe
for martyrdom.  as platform speaker or chairman he had taken an active
and dangerous part in the many indoor and outdoor pro-boer meetings which
have vexed the serenity of merry england these several years back.  little
items he had been imparting to me as he walked along; of being mobbed in
parks and on tram-cars; of climbing on the platform to lead the forlorn
hope, when brother speaker after brother speaker had been dragged down by
the angry crowd and cruelly beaten; of a siege in a church, where he and
three others had taken sanctuary, and where, amid flying missiles and the
crashing of stained glass, they had fought off the mob till rescued by
platoons of constables; of pitched and giddy battles on stairways,
galleries, and balconies; of smashed windows, collapsed stairways,
wrecked lecture halls, and broken heads and bones--and then, with a
regretful sigh, he looked at me and said: "how i envy you big, strong
men!  i'm such a little mite i can't do much when it comes to fighting."

and i, walking head and shoulders above my two companions, remembered my
own husky west, and the stalwart men it had been my custom, in turn, to
envy there.  also, as i looked at the mite of a youth with the heart of a
lion, i thought, this is the type that on occasion rears barricades and
shows the world that men have not forgotten how to die.

but up spoke my other companion, a man of twenty-eight, who eked out a
precarious existence in a sweating den.

"i'm a 'earty man, i am," he announced.  "not like the other chaps at my
shop, i ain't.  they consider me a fine specimen of manhood.  w'y, d' ye
know, i weigh ten stone!"

i was ashamed to tell him that i weighed one hundred and seventy pounds,
or over twelve stone, so i contented myself with taking his measure.
poor, misshapen little man!  his skin an unhealthy colour, body gnarled
and twisted out of all decency, contracted chest, shoulders bent
prodigiously from long hours of toil, and head hanging heavily forward
and out of place!  a "'earty man,' 'e was!"

"how tall are you?"

"five foot two," he answered proudly; "an' the chaps at the shop . . . "

"let me see that shop," i said.

the shop was idle just then, but i still desired to see it.  passing
leman street, we cut off to the left into spitalfields, and dived into
frying-pan alley.  a spawn of children cluttered the slimy pavement, for
all the world like tadpoles just turned frogs on the bottom of a dry
pond.  in a narrow doorway, so narrow that perforce we stepped over her,
sat a woman with a young babe, nursing at breasts grossly naked and
libelling all the sacredness of motherhood.  in the black and narrow hall
behind her we waded through a mess of young life, and essayed an even
narrower and fouler stairway.  up we went, three flights, each landing
two feet by three in area, and heaped with filth and refuse.

there were seven rooms in this abomination called a house.  in six of the
rooms, twenty-odd people, of both sexes and all ages, cooked, ate, slept,
and worked.  in size the rooms averaged eight feet by eight, or possibly
nine.  the seventh room we entered.  it was the den in which five men
"sweated."  it was seven feet wide by eight long, and the table at which
the work was performed took up the major portion of the space.  on this
table were five lasts, and there was barely room for the men to stand to
their work, for the rest of the space was heaped with cardboard, leather,
bundles of shoe uppers, and a miscellaneous assortment of materials used
in attaching the uppers of shoes to their soles.

in the adjoining room lived a woman and six children.  in another vile
hole lived a widow, with an only son of sixteen who was dying of
consumption.  the woman hawked sweetmeats on the street, i was told, and
more often failed than not to supply her son with the three quarts of
milk he daily required.  further, this son, weak and dying, did not taste
meat oftener than once a week; and the kind and quality of this meat
cannot possibly be imagined by people who have never watched human swine
eat.

"the w'y 'e coughs is somethin' terrible," volunteered my sweated friend,
referring to the dying boy.  "we 'ear 'im 'ere, w'ile we're workin', an'
it's terrible, i say, terrible!"

and, what of the coughing and the sweetmeats, i found another menace
added to the hostile environment of the children of the slum.

my sweated friend, when work was to be had, toiled with four other men in
his eight-by-seven room.  in the winter a lamp burned nearly all the day
and added its fumes to the over-loaded air, which was breathed, and
breathed, and breathed again.

in good times, when there was a rush of work, this man told me that he
could earn as high as "thirty bob a week."--thirty shillings!  seven
dollars and a half!

"but it's only the best of us can do it," he qualified.  "an' then we
work twelve, thirteen, and fourteen hours a day, just as fast as we can.
an' you should see us sweat!  just running from us!  if you could see us,
it'd dazzle your eyes--tacks flyin' out of mouth like from a machine.
look at my mouth."

i looked.  the teeth were worn down by the constant friction of the
metallic brads, while they were coal-black and rotten.

"i clean my teeth," he added, "else they'd be worse."

after he had told me that the workers had to furnish their own tools,
brads, "grindery," cardboard, rent, light, and what not, it was plain
that his thirty bob was a diminishing quantity.

"but how long does the rush season last, in which you receive this high
wage of thirty bob?" i asked.

"four months," was the answer; and for the rest of the year, he informed
me, they average from "half a quid" to a "quid" a week, which is
equivalent to from two dollars and a half to five dollars.  the present
week was half gone, and he had earned four bob, or one dollar.  and yet i
was given to understand that this was one of the better grades of
sweating.

i looked out of the window, which should have commanded the back yards of
the neighbouring buildings.  but there were no back yards, or, rather,
they were covered with one-storey hovels, cowsheds, in which people
lived.  the roofs of these hovels were covered with deposits of filth, in
some places a couple of feet deep--the contributions from the back
windows of the second and third storeys.  i could make out fish and meat
bones, garbage, pestilential rags, old boots, broken earthenware, and all
the general refuse of a human sty.

"this is the last year of this trade; they're getting machines to do away
with us," said the sweated one mournfully, as we stepped over the woman
with the breasts grossly naked and waded anew through the cheap young
life.

we next visited the municipal dwellings erected by the london county
council on the site of the slums where lived arthur morrison's "child of
the jago."  while the buildings housed more people than before, it was
much healthier.  but the dwellings were inhabited by the better-class
workmen and artisans.  the slum people had simply drifted on to crowd
other slums or to form new slums.

"an' now," said the sweated one, the 'earty man who worked so fast as to
dazzle one's eyes, "i'll show you one of london's lungs.  this is
spitalfields garden."  and he mouthed the word "garden" with scorn.

the shadow of christ's church falls across spitalfields garden, and in
the shadow of christ's church, at three o'clock in the afternoon, i saw a
sight i never wish to see again.  there are no flowers in this garden,
which is smaller than my own rose garden at home.  grass only grows here,
and it is surrounded by a sharp-spiked iron fencing, as are all the parks
of london town, so that homeless men and women may not come in at night
and sleep upon it.

as we entered the garden, an old woman, between fifty and sixty, passed
us, striding with sturdy intention if somewhat rickety action, with two
bulky bundles, covered with sacking, slung fore and aft upon her.  she
was a woman tramp, a houseless soul, too independent to drag her failing
carcass through the workhouse door.  like the snail, she carried her home
with her.  in the two sacking-covered bundles were her household goods,
her wardrobe, linen, and dear feminine possessions.

we went up the narrow gravelled walk.  on the benches on either side
arrayed a mass of miserable and distorted humanity, the sight of which
would have impelled dore to more diabolical flights of fancy than he ever
succeeded in achieving.  it was a welter of rags and filth, of all manner
of loathsome skin diseases, open sores, bruises, grossness, indecency,
leering monstrosities, and bestial faces.  a chill, raw wind was blowing,
and these creatures huddled there in their rags, sleeping for the most
part, or trying to sleep.  here were a dozen women, ranging in age from
twenty years to seventy.  next a babe, possibly of nine months, lying
asleep, flat on the hard bench, with neither pillow nor covering, nor
with any one looking after it.  next half-a-dozen men, sleeping bolt
upright or leaning against one another in their sleep.  in one place a
family group, a child asleep in its sleeping mother's arms, and the
husband (or male mate) clumsily mending a dilapidated shoe.  on another
bench a woman trimming the frayed strips of her rags with a knife, and
another woman, with thread and needle, sewing up rents.  adjoining, a man
holding a sleeping woman in his arms.  farther on, a man, his clothing
caked with gutter mud, asleep, with head in the lap of a woman, not more
than twenty-five years old, and also asleep.

it was this sleeping that puzzled me.  why were nine out of ten of them
asleep or trying to sleep?  but it was not till afterwards that i
learned.  _it is a law of the powers that be that the homeless shall not
sleep by night_.  on the pavement, by the portico of christ's church,
where the stone pillars rise toward the sky in a stately row, were whole
rows of men lying asleep or drowsing, and all too deep sunk in torpor to
rouse or be made curious by our intrusion.

"a lung of london," i said; "nay, an abscess, a great putrescent sore."

"oh, why did you bring me here?" demanded the burning young socialist,
his delicate face white with sickness of soul and stomach sickness.

"those women there," said our guide, "will sell themselves for
thru'pence, or tu'pence, or a loaf of stale bread."

he said it with a cheerful sneer.

but what more he might have said i do not know, for the sick man cried,
"for heaven's sake let us get out of this."




chapter vii--a winner of the victoria cross


i have found that it is not easy to get into the casual ward of the
workhouse.  i have made two attempts now, and i shall shortly make a
third.  the first time i started out at seven o'clock in the evening with
four shillings in my pocket.  herein i committed two errors.  in the
first place, the applicant for admission to the casual ward must be
destitute, and as he is subjected to a rigorous search, he must really be
destitute; and fourpence, much less four shillings, is sufficient
affluence to disqualify him.  in the second place, i made the mistake of
tardiness.  seven o'clock in the evening is too late in the day for a
pauper to get a pauper's bed.

for the benefit of gently nurtured and innocent folk, let me explain what
a ward is.  it is a building where the homeless, bedless, penniless man,
if he be lucky, may _casually_ rest his weary bones, and then work like a
navvy next day to pay for it.

my second attempt to break into the casual ward began more auspiciously.
i started in the middle of the afternoon, accompanied by the burning
young socialist and another friend, and all i had in my pocket was
thru'pence.  they piloted me to the whitechapel workhouse, at which i
peered from around a friendly corner.  it was a few minutes past five in
the afternoon but already a long and melancholy line was formed, which
strung out around the corner of the building and out of sight.

it was a most woeful picture, men and women waiting in the cold grey end
of the day for a pauper's shelter from the night, and i confess it almost
unnerved me.  like the boy before the dentist's door, i suddenly
discovered a multitude of reasons for being elsewhere.  some hints of the
struggle going on within must have shown in my face, for one of my
companions said, "don't funk; you can do it."

of course i could do it, but i became aware that even thru'pence in my
pocket was too lordly a treasure for such a throng; and, in order that
all invidious distinctions might be removed, i emptied out the coppers.
then i bade good-bye to my friends, and with my heart going pit-a-pat,
slouched down the street and took my place at the end of the line.  woeful
it looked, this line of poor folk tottering on the steep pitch to death;
how woeful it was i did not dream.

next to me stood a short, stout man.  hale and hearty, though aged,
strong-featured, with the tough and leathery skin produced by long years
of sunbeat and weatherbeat, his was the unmistakable sea face and eyes;
and at once there came to me a bit of kipling's "galley slave":-

   "by the brand upon my shoulder, by the gall of clinging steel;
   by the welt the whips have left me, by the scars that never heal;
   by eyes grown old with staring through the sun-wash on the brine,
   i am paid in full for service . . . "

how correct i was in my surmise, and how peculiarly appropriate the verse
was, you shall learn.

"i won't stand it much longer, i won't," he was complaining to the man on
the other side of him.  "i'll smash a windy, a big 'un, an' get run in
for fourteen days.  then i'll have a good place to sleep, never fear, an'
better grub than you get here.  though i'd miss my bit of bacey"--this as
an after-thought, and said regretfully and resignedly.

"i've been out two nights now," he went on; "wet to the skin night before
last, an' i can't stand it much longer.  i'm gettin' old, an' some
mornin' they'll pick me up dead."

he whirled with fierce passion on me: "don't you ever let yourself grow
old, lad.  die when you're young, or you'll come to this.  i'm tellin'
you sure.  seven an' eighty years am i, an' served my country like a man.
three good-conduct stripes and the victoria cross, an' this is what i get
for it.  i wish i was dead, i wish i was dead.  can't come any too quick
for me, i tell you."

the moisture rushed into his eyes, but, before the other man could
comfort him, he began to hum a lilting sea song as though there was no
such thing as heartbreak in the world.

given encouragement, this is the story he told while waiting in line at
the workhouse after two nights of exposure in the streets.

as a boy he had enlisted in the british navy, and for two score years and
more served faithfully and well.  names, dates, commanders, ports, ships,
engagements, and battles, rolled from his lips in a steady stream, but it
is beyond me to remember them all, for it is not quite in keeping to take
notes at the poorhouse door.  he had been through the "first war in
china," as he termed it; had enlisted with the east india company and
served ten years in india; was back in india again, in the english navy,
at the time of the mutiny; had served in the burmese war and in the
crimea; and all this in addition to having fought and toiled for the
english flag pretty well over the rest of the globe.

then the thing happened.  a little thing, it could only be traced back to
first causes: perhaps the lieutenant's breakfast had not agreed with him;
or he had been up late the night before; or his debts were pressing; or
the commander had spoken brusquely to him.  the point is, that on this
particular day the lieutenant was irritable.  the sailor, with others,
was "setting up" the fore rigging.

now, mark you, the sailor had been over forty years in the navy, had
three good-conduct stripes, and possessed the victoria cross for
distinguished service in battle; so he could not have been such an
altogether bad sort of a sailorman.  the lieutenant was irritable; the
lieutenant called him a name--well, not a nice sort of name.  it referred
to his mother.  when i was a boy it was our boys' code to fight like
little demons should such an insult be given our mothers; and many men
have died in my part of the world for calling other men this name.

however, the lieutenant called the sailor this name.  at that moment it
chanced the sailor had an iron lever or bar in his hands.  he promptly
struck the lieutenant over the head with it, knocking him out of the
rigging and overboard.

and then, in the man's own words: "i saw what i had done.  i knew the
regulations, and i said to myself, 'it's all up with you, jack, my boy;
so here goes.'  an' i jumped over after him, my mind made up to drown us
both.  an' i'd ha' done it, too, only the pinnace from the flagship was
just comin' alongside.  up we came to the top, me a hold of him an'
punchin' him.  this was what settled for me.  if i hadn't ben strikin'
him, i could have claimed that, seein' what i had done, i jumped over to
save him."

then came the court-martial, or whatever name a sea trial goes by.  he
recited his sentence, word for word, as though memorised and gone over in
bitterness many times.  and here it is, for the sake of discipline and
respect to officers not always gentlemen, the punishment of a man who was
guilty of manhood.  to be reduced to the rank of ordinary seaman; to be
debarred all prize-money due him; to forfeit all rights to pension; to
resign the victoria cross; to be discharged from the navy with a good
character (this being his first offence); to receive fifty lashes; and to
serve two years in prison.

"i wish i had drowned that day, i wish to god i had," he concluded, as
the line moved up and we passed around the corner.

at last the door came in sight, through which the paupers were being
admitted in bunches.  and here i learned a surprising thing: _this being
wednesday, none of us would be released till friday morning_.
furthermore, and oh, you tobacco users, take heed: _we would not be
permitted to take in any tobacco_.  this we would have to surrender as we
entered.  sometimes, i was told, it was returned on leaving and sometimes
it was destroyed.

the old man-of-war's man gave me a lesson.  opening his pouch, he emptied
the tobacco (a pitiful quantity) into a piece of paper.  this, snugly and
flatly wrapped, went down his sock inside his shoe.  down went my piece
of tobacco inside my sock, for forty hours without tobacco is a hardship
all tobacco users will understand.

again and again the line moved up, and we were slowly but surely
approaching the wicket.  at the moment we happened to be standing on an
iron grating, and a man appearing underneath, the old sailor called down
to him,--

"how many more do they want?"

"twenty-four," came the answer.

we looked ahead anxiously and counted.  thirty-four were ahead of us.
disappointment and consternation dawned upon the faces about me.  it is
not a nice thing, hungry and penniless, to face a sleepless night in the
streets.  but we hoped against hope, till, when ten stood outside the
wicket, the porter turned us away.

"full up," was what he said, as he banged the door.

like a flash, for all his eighty-seven years, the old sailor was speeding
away on the desperate chance of finding shelter elsewhere.  i stood and
debated with two other men, wise in the knowledge of casual wards, as to
where we should go.  they decided on the poplar workhouse, three miles
away, and we started off.

as we rounded the corner, one of them said, "i could a' got in 'ere to-
day.  i come by at one o'clock, an' the line was beginnin' to form
then--pets, that's what they are.  they let 'm in, the same ones, night
upon night."




chapter viii--the carter and the carpenter


the carter, with his clean-cut face, chin beard, and shaved upper lip, i
should have taken in the united states for anything from a master workman
to a well-to-do farmer.  the carpenter--well, i should have taken him for
a carpenter.  he looked it, lean and wiry, with shrewd, observant eyes,
and hands that had grown twisted to the handles of tools through forty-
seven years' work at the trade.  the chief difficulty with these men was
that they were old, and that their children, instead of growing up to
take care of them, had died.  their years had told on them, and they had
been forced out of the whirl of industry by the younger and stronger
competitors who had taken their places.

these two men, turned away from the casual ward of whitechapel workhouse,
were bound with me for poplar workhouse.  not much of a show, they
thought, but to chance it was all that remained to us.  it was poplar, or
the streets and night.  both men were anxious for a bed, for they were
"about gone," as they phrased it.  the carter, fifty-eight years of age,
had spent the last three nights without shelter or sleep, while the
carpenter, sixty-five years of age, had been out five nights.

but, o dear, soft people, full of meat and blood, with white beds and
airy rooms waiting you each night, how can i make you know what it is to
suffer as you would suffer if you spent a weary night on london's
streets!  believe me, you would think a thousand centuries had come and
gone before the east paled into dawn; you would shiver till you were
ready to cry aloud with the pain of each aching muscle; and you would
marvel that you could endure so much and live.  should you rest upon a
bench, and your tired eyes close, depend upon it the policeman would
rouse you and gruffly order you to "move on."  you may rest upon the
bench, and benches are few and far between; but if rest means sleep, on
you must go, dragging your tired body through the endless streets.  should
you, in desperate slyness, seek some forlorn alley or dark passageway and
lie down, the omnipresent policeman will rout you out just the same.  it
is his business to rout you out.  it is a law of the powers that be that
you shall be routed out.

but when the dawn came, the nightmare over, you would hale you home to
refresh yourself, and until you died you would tell the story of your
adventure to groups of admiring friends.  it would grow into a mighty
story.  your little eight-hour night would become an odyssey and you a
homer.

not so with these homeless ones who walked to poplar workhouse with me.
and there are thirty-five thousand of them, men and women, in london town
this night.  please don't remember it as you go to bed; if you are as
soft as you ought to be you may not rest so well as usual.  but for old
men of sixty, seventy, and eighty, ill-fed, with neither meat nor blood,
to greet the dawn unrefreshed, and to stagger through the day in mad
search for crusts, with relentless night rushing down upon them again,
and to do this five nights and days--o dear, soft people, full of meat
and blood, how can you ever understand?

i walked up mile end road between the carter and the carpenter.  mile end
road is a wide thoroughfare, cutting the heart of east london, and there
were tens of thousands of people abroad on it.  i tell you this so that
you may fully appreciate what i shall describe in the next paragraph.  as
i say, we walked along, and when they grew bitter and cursed the land, i
cursed with them, cursed as an american waif would curse, stranded in a
strange and terrible land.  and, as i tried to lead them to believe, and
succeeded in making them believe, they took me for a "seafaring man," who
had spent his money in riotous living, lost his clothes (no unusual
occurrence with seafaring men ashore), and was temporarily broke while
looking for a ship.  this accounted for my ignorance of english ways in
general and casual wards in particular, and my curiosity concerning the
same.

the carter was hard put to keep the pace at which we walked (he told me
that he had eaten nothing that day), but the carpenter, lean and hungry,
his grey and ragged overcoat flapping mournfully in the breeze, swung on
in a long and tireless stride which reminded me strongly of the plains
wolf or coyote.  both kept their eyes upon the pavement as they walked
and talked, and every now and then one or the other would stoop and pick
something up, never missing the stride the while.  i thought it was cigar
and cigarette stumps they were collecting, and for some time took no
notice.  then i did notice.

_from the slimy, spittle-drenched, sidewalk, they were picking up bits of
orange peel, apple skin, and grape stems, and, they were eating them.  the
pits of greengage plums they cracked between their teeth for the kernels
inside.  they picked up stray bits of bread the size of peas, apple cores
so black and dirty one would not take them to be apple cores, and these
things these two men took into their mouths, and chewed them, and
swallowed them; and this, between six and seven o'clock in the evening of
august 20, year of our lord 1902, in the heart of the greatest,
wealthiest, and most powerful empire the world has ever seen_.

these two men talked.  they were not fools, they were merely old.  and,
naturally, their guts a-reek with pavement offal, they talked of bloody
revolution.  they talked as anarchists, fanatics, and madmen would talk.
and who shall blame them?  in spite of my three good meals that day, and
the snug bed i could occupy if i wished, and my social philosophy, and my
evolutionary belief in the slow development and metamorphosis of
things--in spite of all this, i say, i felt impelled to talk rot with
them or hold my tongue.  poor fools!  not of their sort are revolutions
bred.  and when they are dead and dust, which will be shortly, other
fools will talk bloody revolution as they gather offal from the spittle-
drenched sidewalk along mile end road to poplar workhouse.

being a foreigner, and a young man, the carter and the carpenter
explained things to me and advised me.  their advice, by the way, was
brief, and to the point; it was to get out of the country.  "as fast as
god'll let me," i assured them; "i'll hit only the high places, till you
won't be able to see my trail for smoke."  they felt the force of my
figures, rather than understood them, and they nodded their heads
approvingly.

"actually make a man a criminal against 'is will," said the carpenter.
"'ere i am, old, younger men takin' my place, my clothes gettin' shabbier
an' shabbier, an' makin' it 'arder every day to get a job.  i go to the
casual ward for a bed.  must be there by two or three in the afternoon or
i won't get in.  you saw what happened to-day.  what chance does that
give me to look for work?  s'pose i do get into the casual ward?  keep me
in all day to-morrow, let me out mornin' o' next day.  what then?  the
law sez i can't get in another casual ward that night less'n ten miles
distant.  have to hurry an' walk to be there in time that day.  what
chance does that give me to look for a job?  s'pose i don't walk.  s'pose
i look for a job?  in no time there's night come, an' no bed.  no sleep
all night, nothin' to eat, what shape am i in the mornin' to look for
work?  got to make up my sleep in the park somehow" (the vision of
christ's church, spitalfield, was strong on me) "an' get something to
eat.  an' there i am!  old, down, an' no chance to get up."

"used to be a toll-gate 'ere," said the carter.  "many's the time i've
paid my toll 'ere in my cartin' days."

"i've 'ad three 'a'penny rolls in two days," the carpenter announced,
after a long pause in the conversation.  "two of them i ate yesterday,
an' the third to-day," he concluded, after another long pause.

"i ain't 'ad anything to-day," said the carter.  "an' i'm fagged out.  my
legs is hurtin' me something fearful."

"the roll you get in the 'spike' is that 'ard you can't eat it nicely
with less'n a pint of water," said the carpenter, for my benefit.  and,
on asking him what the "spike" was, he answered, "the casual ward.  it's
a cant word, you know."

but what surprised me was that he should have the word "cant" in his
vocabulary, a vocabulary that i found was no mean one before we parted.

i asked them what i might expect in the way of treatment, if we succeeded
in getting into the poplar workhouse, and between them i was supplied
with much information.  having taken a cold bath on entering, i would be
given for supper six ounces of bread and "three parts of skilly."  "three
parts" means three-quarters of a pint, and "skilly" is a fluid concoction
of three quarts of oatmeal stirred into three buckets and a half of hot
water.

"milk and sugar, i suppose, and a silver spoon?" i queried.

"no fear.  salt's what you'll get, an' i've seen some places where you'd
not get any spoon.  'old 'er up an' let 'er run down, that's 'ow they do
it."

"you do get good skilly at 'ackney," said the carter.

"oh, wonderful skilly, that," praised the carpenter, and each looked
eloquently at the other.

"flour an' water at st. george's in the east," said the carter.

the carpenter nodded.  he had tried them all.

"then what?" i demanded

and i was informed that i was sent directly to bed.  "call you at half
after five in the mornin', an' you get up an' take a 'sluice'--if there's
any soap.  then breakfast, same as supper, three parts o' skilly an' a
six-ounce loaf."

"'tisn't always six ounces," corrected the carter.

"'tisn't, no; an' often that sour you can 'ardly eat it.  when first i
started i couldn't eat the skilly nor the bread, but now i can eat my own
an' another man's portion."

"i could eat three other men's portions," said the carter.  "i 'aven't
'ad a bit this blessed day."

"then what?"

"then you've got to do your task, pick four pounds of oakum, or clean an'
scrub, or break ten to eleven hundredweight o' stones.  i don't 'ave to
break stones; i'm past sixty, you see.  they'll make you do it, though.
you're young an' strong."

"what i don't like," grumbled the carter, "is to be locked up in a cell
to pick oakum.  it's too much like prison."

"but suppose, after you've had your night's sleep, you refuse to pick
oakum, or break stones, or do any work at all?" i asked.

"no fear you'll refuse the second time; they'll run you in," answered the
carpenter.  "wouldn't advise you to try it on, my lad."

"then comes dinner," he went on.  "eight ounces of bread, one and a arf
ounces of cheese, an' cold water.  then you finish your task an' 'ave
supper, same as before, three parts o' skilly any six ounces o' bread.
then to bed, six o'clock, an' next mornin' you're turned loose, provided
you've finished your task."

we had long since left mile end road, and after traversing a gloomy maze
of narrow, winding streets, we came to poplar workhouse.  on a low stone
wall we spread our handkerchiefs, and each in his handkerchief put all
his worldly possessions, with the exception of the "bit o' baccy" down
his sock.  and then, as the last light was fading from the drab-coloured
sky, the wind blowing cheerless and cold, we stood, with our pitiful
little bundles in our hands, a forlorn group at the workhouse door.

three working girls came along, and one looked pityingly at me; as she
passed i followed her with my eyes, and she still looked pityingly back
at me.  the old men she did not notice.  dear christ, she pitied me,
young and vigorous and strong, but she had no pity for the two old men
who stood by my side!  she was a young woman, and i was a young man, and
what vague sex promptings impelled her to pity me put her sentiment on
the lowest plane.  pity for old men is an altruistic feeling, and
besides, the workhouse door is the accustomed place for old men.  so she
showed no pity for them, only for me, who deserved it least or not at
all.  not in honour do grey hairs go down to the grave in london town.

on one side the door was a bell handle, on the other side a press button.

"ring the bell," said the carter to me.

and just as i ordinarily would at anybody's door, i pulled out the handle
and rang a peal.

"oh!  oh!" they cried in one terrified voice.  "not so 'ard!"

i let go, and they looked reproachfully at me, as though i had imperilled
their chance for a bed and three parts of skilly.  nobody came.  luckily
it was the wrong bell, and i felt better.

"press the button," i said to the carpenter.

"no, no, wait a bit," the carter hurriedly interposed.

from all of which i drew the conclusion that a poorhouse porter, who
commonly draws a yearly salary of from seven to nine pounds, is a very
finicky and important personage, and cannot be treated too fastidiously
by--paupers.

so we waited, ten times a decent interval, when the carter stealthily
advanced a timid forefinger to the button, and gave it the faintest,
shortest possible push.  i have looked at waiting men where life or death
was in the issue; but anxious suspense showed less plainly on their faces
than it showed on the faces of these two men as they waited on the coming
of the porter.

he came.  he barely looked at us.  "full up," he said and shut the door.

"another night of it," groaned the carpenter.  in the dim light the
carter looked wan and grey.

indiscriminate charity is vicious, say the professional philanthropists.
well, i resolved to be vicious.

"come on; get your knife out and come here," i said to the carter,
drawing him into a dark alley.

he glared at me in a frightened manner, and tried to draw back.  possibly
he took me for a latter-day jack-the-ripper, with a penchant for elderly
male paupers.  or he may have thought i was inveigling him into the
commission of some desperate crime.  anyway, he was frightened.

it will be remembered, at the outset, that i sewed a pound inside my
stoker's singlet under the armpit.  this was my emergency fund, and i was
now called upon to use it for the first time.

not until i had gone through the acts of a contortionist, and shown the
round coin sewed in, did i succeed in getting the carter's help.  even
then his hand was trembling so that i was afraid he would cut me instead
of the stitches, and i was forced to take the knife away and do it
myself.  out rolled the gold piece, a fortune in their hungry eyes; and
away we stampeded for the nearest coffee-house.

of course i had to explain to them that i was merely an investigator, a
social student, seeking to find out how the other half lived.  and at
once they shut up like clams.  i was not of their kind; my speech had
changed, the tones of my voice were different, in short, i was a
superior, and they were superbly class conscious.

"what will you have?" i asked, as the waiter came for the order.

"two slices an' a cup of tea," meekly said the carter.

"two slices an' a cup of tea," meekly said the carpenter.

stop a moment, and consider the situation.  here were two men, invited by
me into the coffee-house.  they had seen my gold piece, and they could
understand that i was no pauper.  one had eaten a ha'penny roll that day,
the other had eaten nothing.  and they called for "two slices an' a cup
of tea!"  each man had given a tu'penny order.  "two slices," by the way,
means two slices of bread and butter.

this was the same degraded humility that had characterised their attitude
toward the poorhouse porter.  but i wouldn't have it.  step by step i
increased their order--eggs, rashers of bacon, more eggs, more bacon,
more tea, more slices and so forth--they denying wistfully all the while
that they cared for anything more, and devouring it ravenously as fast as
it arrived.

"first cup o' tea i've 'ad in a fortnight," said the carter.

"wonderful tea, that," said the carpenter.

they each drank two pints of it, and i assure you that it was slops.  it
resembled tea less than lager beer resembles champagne.  nay, it was
"water-bewitched," and did not resemble tea at all.

it was curious, after the first shock, to notice the effect the food had
on them.  at first they were melancholy, and talked of the divers times
they had contemplated suicide.  the carter, not a week before, had stood
on the bridge and looked at the water, and pondered the question.  water,
the carpenter insisted with heat, was a bad route.  he, for one, he knew,
would struggle.  a bullet was "'andier," but how under the sun was he to
get hold of a revolver?  that was the rub.

they grew more cheerful as the hot "tea" soaked in, and talked more about
themselves.  the carter had buried his wife and children, with the
exception of one son, who grew to manhood and helped him in his little
business.  then the thing happened.  the son, a man of thirty-one, died
of the smallpox.  no sooner was this over than the father came down with
fever and went to the hospital for three months.  then he was done for.
he came out weak, debilitated, no strong young son to stand by him, his
little business gone glimmering, and not a farthing.  the thing had
happened, and the game was up.  no chance for an old man to start again.
friends all poor and unable to help.  he had tried for work when they
were putting up the stands for the first coronation parade.  "an' i got
fair sick of the answer: 'no! no! no!'  it rang in my ears at night when
i tried to sleep, always the same, 'no! no! no!'"  only the past week he
had answered an advertisement in hackney, and on giving his age was told,
"oh, too old, too old by far."

the carpenter had been born in the army, where his father had served
twenty-two years.  likewise, his two brothers had gone into the army;
one, troop sergeant-major of the seventh hussars, dying in india after
the mutiny; the other, after nine years under roberts in the east, had
been lost in egypt.  the carpenter had not gone into the army, so here he
was, still on the planet.

"but 'ere, give me your 'and," he said, ripping open his ragged shirt.
"i'm fit for the anatomist, that's all.  i'm wastin' away, sir, actually
wastin' away for want of food.  feel my ribs an' you'll see."

i put my hand under his shirt and felt.  the skin was stretched like
parchment over the bones, and the sensation produced was for all the
world like running one's hand over a washboard.

"seven years o' bliss i 'ad," he said.  "a good missus and three bonnie
lassies.  but they all died.  scarlet fever took the girls inside a
fortnight."

"after this, sir," said the carter, indicating the spread, and desiring
to turn the conversation into more cheerful channels; "after this, i
wouldn't be able to eat a workhouse breakfast in the morning."

"nor i," agreed the carpenter, and they fell to discussing belly delights
and the fine dishes their respective wives had cooked in the old days.

"i've gone three days and never broke my fast," said the carter.

"and i, five," his companion added, turning gloomy with the memory of it.
"five days once, with nothing on my stomach but a bit of orange peel, an'
outraged nature wouldn't stand it, sir, an' i near died.  sometimes,
walkin' the streets at night, i've ben that desperate i've made up my
mind to win the horse or lose the saddle.  you know what i mean, sir--to
commit some big robbery.  but when mornin' come, there was i, too weak
from 'unger an' cold to 'arm a mouse."

as their poor vitals warmed to the food, they began to expand and wax
boastful, and to talk politics.  i can only say that they talked politics
as well as the average middle-class man, and a great deal better than
some of the middle-class men i have heard.  what surprised me was the
hold they had on the world, its geography and peoples, and on recent and
contemporaneous history.  as i say, they were not fools, these two men.
they were merely old, and their children had undutifully failed to grow
up and give them a place by the fire.

one last incident, as i bade them good-bye on the corner, happy with a
couple of shillings in their pockets and the certain prospect of a bed
for the night.  lighting a cigarette, i was about to throw away the
burning match when the carter reached for it.  i proffered him the box,
but he said, "never mind, won't waste it, sir."  and while he lighted the
cigarette i had given him, the carpenter hurried with the filling of his
pipe in order to have a go at the same match.

"it's wrong to waste," said he.

"yes," i said, but i was thinking of the wash-board ribs over which i had
run my hand.




chapter ix--the spike


first of all, i must beg forgiveness of my body for the vileness through
which i have dragged it, and forgiveness of my stomach for the vileness
which i have thrust into it.  i have been to the spike, and slept in the
spike, and eaten in the spike; also, i have run away from the spike.

after my two unsuccessful attempts to penetrate the whitechapel casual
ward, i started early, and joined the desolate line before three o'clock
in the afternoon.  they did not "let in" till six, but at that early hour
i was number twenty, while the news had gone forth that only twenty-two
were to be admitted.  by four o'clock there were thirty-four in line, the
last ten hanging on in the slender hope of getting in by some kind of a
miracle.  many more came, looked at the line, and went away, wise to the
bitter fact that the spike would be "full up."

conversation was slack at first, standing there, till the man on one side
of me and the man on the other side of me discovered that they had been
in the smallpox hospital at the same time, though a full house of sixteen
hundred patients had prevented their becoming acquainted.  but they made
up for it, discussing and comparing the more loathsome features of their
disease in the most cold-blooded, matter-of-fact way.  i learned that the
average mortality was one in six, that one of them had been in three
months and the other three months and a half, and that they had been
"rotten wi' it."  whereat my flesh began to creep and crawl, and i asked
them how long they had been out.  one had been out two weeks, and the
other three weeks.  their faces were badly pitted (though each assured
the other that this was not so), and further, they showed me in their
hands and under the nails the smallpox "seeds" still working out.  nay,
one of them worked a seed out for my edification, and pop it went, right
out of his flesh into the air.  i tried to shrink up smaller inside my
clothes, and i registered a fervent though silent hope that it had not
popped on me.

in both instances, i found that the smallpox was the cause of their being
"on the doss," which means on the tramp.  both had been working when
smitten by the disease, and both had emerged from the hospital "broke,"
with the gloomy task before them of hunting for work.  so far, they had
not found any, and they had come to the spike for a "rest up" after three
days and nights on the street.

it seems that not only the man who becomes old is punished for his
involuntary misfortune, but likewise the man who is struck by disease or
accident.  later on, i talked with another man--"ginger" we called
him--who stood at the head of the line--a sure indication that he had
been waiting since one o'clock.  a year before, one day, while in the
employ of a fish dealer, he was carrying a heavy box of fish which was
too much for him.  result: "something broke," and there was the box on
the ground, and he on the ground beside it.

at the first hospital, whither he was immediately carried, they said it
was a rupture, reduced the swelling, gave him some vaseline to rub on it,
kept him four hours, and told him to get along.  but he was not on the
streets more than two or three hours when he was down on his back again.
this time he went to another hospital and was patched up.  but the point
is, the employer did nothing, positively nothing, for the man injured in
his employment, and even refused him "a light job now and again," when he
came out.  as far as ginger is concerned, he is a broken man.  his only
chance to earn a living was by heavy work.  he is now incapable of
performing heavy work, and from now until he dies, the spike, the peg,
and the streets are all he can look forward to in the way of food and
shelter.  the thing happened--that is all.  he put his back under too
great a load of fish, and his chance for happiness in life was crossed
off the books.

several men in the line had been to the united states, and they were
wishing that they had remained there, and were cursing themselves for
their folly in ever having left.  england had become a prison to them, a
prison from which there was no hope of escape.  it was impossible for
them to get away.  they could neither scrape together the passage money,
nor get a chance to work their passage.  the country was too overrun by
poor devils on that "lay."

i was on the seafaring-man-who-had-lost-his-clothes-and-money tack, and
they all condoled with me and gave me much sound advice.  to sum it up,
the advice was something like this: to keep out of all places like the
spike.  there was nothing good in it for me.  to head for the coast and
bend every effort to get away on a ship.  to go to work, if possible, and
scrape together a pound or so, with which i might bribe some steward or
underling to give me chance to work my passage.  they envied me my youth
and strength, which would sooner or later get me out of the country.
these they no longer possessed.  age and english hardship had broken
them, and for them the game was played and up.

there was one, however, who was still young, and who, i am sure, will in
the end make it out.  he had gone to the united states as a young fellow,
and in fourteen years' residence the longest period he had been out of
work was twelve hours.  he had saved his money, grown too prosperous, and
returned to the mother-country.  now he was standing in line at the
spike.

for the past two years, he told me, he had been working as a cook.  his
hours had been from 7 a.m. to 10.30 p.m., and on saturday to 12.30
p.m.--ninety-five hours per week, for which he had received twenty
shillings, or five dollars.

"but the work and the long hours was killing me," he said, "and i had to
chuck the job.  i had a little money saved, but i spent it living and
looking for another place."

this was his first night in the spike, and he had come in only to get
rested.  as soon as he emerged, he intended to start for bristol, a one-
hundred-and-ten-mile walk, where he thought he would eventually get a
ship for the states.

but the men in the line were not all of this calibre.  some were poor,
wretched beasts, inarticulate and callous, but for all of that, in many
ways very human.  i remember a carter, evidently returning home after the
day's work, stopping his cart before us so that his young hopeful, who
had run to meet him, could climb in.  but the cart was big, the young
hopeful little, and he failed in his several attempts to swarm up.
whereupon one of the most degraded-looking men stepped out of the line
and hoisted him in.  now the virtue and the joy of this act lies in that
it was service of love, not hire.  the carter was poor, and the man knew
it; and the man was standing in the spike line, and the carter knew it;
and the man had done the little act, and the carter had thanked him, even
as you and i would have done and thanked.

another beautiful touch was that displayed by the "hopper" and his "ole
woman."  he had been in line about half-an-hour when the "ole woman" (his
mate) came up to him.  she was fairly clad, for her class, with a weather-
worn bonnet on her grey head and a sacking-covered bundle in her arms.  as
she talked to him, he reached forward, caught the one stray wisp of the
white hair that was flying wild, deftly twirled it between his fingers,
and tucked it back properly behind her ear.  from all of which one may
conclude many things.  he certainly liked her well enough to wish her to
be neat and tidy.  he was proud of her, standing there in the spike line,
and it was his desire that she should look well in the eyes of the other
unfortunates who stood in the spike line.  but last and best, and
underlying all these motives, it was a sturdy affection he bore her; for
man is not prone to bother his head over neatness and tidiness in a woman
for whom he does not care, nor is he likely to be proud of such a woman.

and i found myself questioning why this man and his mate, hard workers i
knew from their talk, should have to seek a pauper lodging.  he had
pride, pride in his old woman and pride in himself.  when i asked him
what he thought i, a greenhorn, might expect to earn at "hopping," he
sized me up, and said that it all depended.  plenty of people were too
slow to pick hops and made a failure of it.  a man, to succeed, must use
his head and be quick with his fingers, must be exceeding quick with his
fingers.  now he and his old woman could do very well at it, working the
one bin between them and not going to sleep over it; but then, they had
been at it for years.

"i 'ad a mate as went down last year," spoke up a man.  "it was 'is fust
time, but 'e come back wi' two poun' ten in 'is pockit, an' 'e was only
gone a month."

"there you are," said the hopper, a wealth of admiration in his voice.
"'e was quick.  'e was jest nat'rally born to it, 'e was."

two pound ten--twelve dollars and a half--for a month's work when one is
"jest nat'rally born to it!"  and in addition, sleeping out without
blankets and living the lord knows how.  there are moments when i am
thankful that i was not "jest nat'rally born" a genius for anything, not
even hop-picking,

in the matter of getting an outfit for "the hops," the hopper gave me
some sterling advice, to which same give heed, you soft and tender
people, in case you should ever be stranded in london town.

"if you ain't got tins an' cookin' things, all as you can get'll be bread
and cheese.  no bloomin' good that!  you must 'ave 'ot tea, an'
wegetables, an' a bit o' meat, now an' again, if you're goin' to do work
as is work.  cawn't do it on cold wittles.  tell you wot you do, lad.  run
around in the mornin' an' look in the dust pans.  you'll find plenty o'
tins to cook in.  fine tins, wonderful good some o' them.  me an' the ole
woman got ours that way."  (he pointed at the bundle she held, while she
nodded proudly, beaming on me with good-nature and consciousness of
success and prosperity.)  "this overcoat is as good as a blanket," he
went on, advancing the skirt of it that i might feel its thickness.  "an'
'oo knows, i may find a blanket before long."

again the old woman nodded and beamed, this time with the dead certainty
that he _would_ find a blanket before long.

"i call it a 'oliday, 'oppin'," he concluded rapturously.  "a tidy way o'
gettin' two or three pounds together an' fixin' up for winter.  the only
thing i don't like"--and here was the rift within the lute--"is paddin'
the 'oof down there."

it was plain the years were telling on this energetic pair, and while
they enjoyed the quick work with the fingers, "paddin' the 'oof," which
is walking, was beginning to bear heavily upon them.  and i looked at
their grey hairs, and ahead into the future ten years, and wondered how
it would be with them.

i noticed another man and his old woman join the line, both of them past
fifty.  the woman, because she was a woman, was admitted into the spike;
but he was too late, and, separated from his mate, was turned away to
tramp the streets all night.

the street on which we stood, from wall to wall, was barely twenty feet
wide.  the sidewalks were three feet wide.  it was a residence street.  at
least workmen and their families existed in some sort of fashion in the
houses across from us.  and each day and every day, from one in the
afternoon till six, our ragged spike line is the principal feature of the
view commanded by their front doors and windows.  one workman sat in his
door directly opposite us, taking his rest and a breath of air after the
toil of the day.  his wife came to chat with him.  the doorway was too
small for two, so she stood up.  their babes sprawled before them.  and
here was the spike line, less than a score of feet away--neither privacy
for the workman, nor privacy for the pauper.  about our feet played the
children of the neighbourhood.  to them our presence was nothing unusual.
we were not an intrusion.  we were as natural and ordinary as the brick
walls and stone curbs of their environment.  they had been born to the
sight of the spike line, and all their brief days they had seen it.

at six o'clock the line moved up, and we were admitted in groups of
three.  name, age, occupation, place of birth, condition of destitution,
and the previous night's "doss," were taken with lightning-like rapidity
by the superintendent; and as i turned i was startled by a man's
thrusting into my hand something that felt like a brick, and shouting
into my ear, "any knives, matches, or tobacco?"  "no, sir," i lied, as
lied every man who entered.  as i passed downstairs to the cellar, i
looked at the brick in my hand, and saw that by doing violence to the
language it might be called "bread."  by its weight and hardness it
certainly must have been unleavened.

the light was very dim down in the cellar, and before i knew it some
other man had thrust a pannikin into my other hand.  then i stumbled on
to a still darker room, where were benches and tables and men.  the place
smelled vilely, and the sombre gloom, and the mumble of voices from out
of the obscurity, made it seem more like some anteroom to the infernal
regions.

most of the men were suffering from tired feet, and they prefaced the
meal by removing their shoes and unbinding the filthy rags with which
their feet were wrapped.  this added to the general noisomeness, while it
took away from my appetite.

in fact, i found that i had made a mistake.  i had eaten a hearty dinner
five hours before, and to have done justice to the fare before me i
should have fasted for a couple of days.  the pannikin contained skilly,
three-quarters of a pint, a mixture of indian corn and hot water.  the
men were dipping their bread into heaps of salt scattered over the dirty
tables.  i attempted the same, but the bread seemed to stick in my mouth,
and i remembered the words of the carpenter, "you need a pint of water to
eat the bread nicely."

i went over into a dark corner where i had observed other men going and
found the water.  then i returned and attacked the skilly.  it was coarse
of texture, unseasoned, gross, and bitter.  this bitterness which
lingered persistently in the mouth after the skilly had passed on, i
found especially repulsive.  i struggled manfully, but was mastered by my
qualms, and half-a-dozen mouthfuls of skilly and bread was the measure of
my success.  the man beside me ate his own share, and mine to boot,
scraped the pannikins, and looked hungrily for more.

"i met a 'towny,' and he stood me too good a dinner," i explained.

"an' i 'aven't 'ad a bite since yesterday mornin'," he replied.

"how about tobacco?" i asked.  "will the bloke bother with a fellow now?"

"oh no," he answered me.  "no bloomin' fear.  this is the easiest spike
goin'.  y'oughto see some of them.  search you to the skin."

the pannikins scraped clean, conversation began to spring up.  "this
super'tendent 'ere is always writin' to the papers 'bout us mugs," said
the man on the other side of me.

"what does he say?" i asked.

"oh, 'e sez we're no good, a lot o' blackguards an' scoundrels as won't
work.  tells all the ole tricks i've bin 'earin' for twenty years an'
w'ich i never seen a mug ever do.  las' thing of 'is i see, 'e was
tellin' 'ow a mug gets out o' the spike, wi' a crust in 'is pockit.  an'
w'en 'e sees a nice ole gentleman comin' along the street 'e chucks the
crust into the drain, an' borrows the old gent's stick to poke it out.
an' then the ole gent gi'es 'im a tanner."

a roar of applause greeted the time-honoured yarn, and from somewhere
over in the deeper darkness came another voice, orating angrily:

"talk o' the country bein' good for tommy [food]; i'd like to see it.  i
jest came up from dover, an' blessed little tommy i got.  they won't gi'
ye a drink o' water, they won't, much less tommy."

"there's mugs never go out of kent," spoke a second voice, "they live
bloomin' fat all along."

"i come through kent," went on the first voice, still more angrily, "an'
gawd blimey if i see any tommy.  an' i always notices as the blokes as
talks about 'ow much they can get, w'en they're in the spike can eat my
share o' skilly as well as their bleedin' own."

"there's chaps in london," said a man across the table from me, "that get
all the tommy they want, an' they never think o' goin' to the country.
stay in london the year 'round.  nor do they think of lookin' for a kip
[place to sleep], till nine or ten o'clock at night."

a general chorus verified this statement

"but they're bloomin' clever, them chaps," said an admiring voice.

"course they are," said another voice.  "but it's not the likes of me an'
you can do it.  you got to be born to it, i say.  them chaps 'ave ben
openin' cabs an' sellin' papers since the day they was born, an' their
fathers an' mothers before 'em.  it's all in the trainin', i say, an' the
likes of me an' you 'ud starve at it."

this also was verified by the general chorus, and likewise the statement
that there were "mugs as lives the twelvemonth 'round in the spike an'
never get a blessed bit o' tommy other than spike skilly an' bread."

"i once got arf a crown in the stratford spike," said a new voice.
silence fell on the instant, and all listened to the wonderful tale.
"there was three of us breakin' stones.  winter-time, an' the cold was
cruel.  t'other two said they'd be blessed if they do it, an' they
didn't; but i kept wearin' into mine to warm up, you know.  an' then the
guardians come, an' t'other chaps got run in for fourteen days, an' the
guardians, w'en they see wot i'd been doin', gives me a tanner each, five
o' them, an' turns me up."

the majority of these men, nay, all of them, i found, do not like the
spike, and only come to it when driven in.  after the "rest up" they are
good for two or three days and nights on the streets, when they are
driven in again for another rest.  of course, this continuous hardship
quickly breaks their constitutions, and they realise it, though only in a
vague way; while it is so much the common run of things that they do not
worry about it.

"on the doss," they call vagabondage here, which corresponds to "on the
road" in the united states.  the agreement is that kipping, or dossing,
or sleeping, is the hardest problem they have to face, harder even than
that of food.  the inclement weather and the harsh laws are mainly
responsible for this, while the men themselves ascribe their homelessness
to foreign immigration, especially of polish and russian jews, who take
their places at lower wages and establish the sweating system.

by seven o'clock we were called away to bathe and go to bed.  we stripped
our clothes, wrapping them up in our coats and buckling our belts about
them, and deposited them in a heaped rack and on the floor--a beautiful
scheme for the spread of vermin.  then, two by two, we entered the
bathroom.  there were two ordinary tubs, and this i know: the two men
preceding had washed in that water, we washed in the same water, and it
was not changed for the two men that followed us.  this i know; but i am
also certain that the twenty-two of us washed in the same water.

i did no more than make a show of splashing some of this dubious liquid
at myself, while i hastily brushed it off with a towel wet from the
bodies of other men.  my equanimity was not restored by seeing the back
of one poor wretch a mass of blood from attacks of vermin and retaliatory
scratching.

a shirt was handed me--which i could not help but wonder how many other
men had worn; and with a couple of blankets under my arm i trudged off to
the sleeping apartment.  this was a long, narrow room, traversed by two
low iron rails.  between these rails were stretched, not hammocks, but
pieces of canvas, six feet long and less than two feet wide.  these were
the beds, and they were six inches apart and about eight inches above the
floor.  the chief difficulty was that the head was somewhat higher than
the feet, which caused the body constantly to slip down.  being slung to
the same rails, when one man moved, no matter how slightly, the rest were
set rocking; and whenever i dozed somebody was sure to struggle back to
the position from which he had slipped, and arouse me again.

many hours passed before i won to sleep.  it was only seven in the
evening, and the voices of children, in shrill outcry, playing in the
street, continued till nearly midnight.  the smell was frightful and
sickening, while my imagination broke loose, and my skin crept and
crawled till i was nearly frantic.  grunting, groaning, and snoring arose
like the sounds emitted by some sea monster, and several times, afflicted
by nightmare, one or another, by his shrieks and yells, aroused the lot
of us.  toward morning i was awakened by a rat or some similar animal on
my breast.  in the quick transition from sleep to waking, before i was
completely myself, i raised a shout to wake the dead.  at any rate, i
woke the living, and they cursed me roundly for my lack of manners.

but morning came, with a six o'clock breakfast of bread and skilly, which
i gave away, and we were told off to our various tasks.  some were set to
scrubbing and cleaning, others to picking oakum, and eight of us were
convoyed across the street to the whitechapel infirmary where we were set
at scavenger work.  this was the method by which we paid for our skilly
and canvas, and i, for one, know that i paid in full many times over.

though we had most revolting tasks to perform, our allotment was
considered the best and the other men deemed themselves lucky in being
chosen to perform it.

"don't touch it, mate, the nurse sez it's deadly," warned my working
partner, as i held open a sack into which he was emptying a garbage can.

it came from the sick wards, and i told him that i purposed neither to
touch it, nor to allow it to touch me.  nevertheless, i had to carry the
sack, and other sacks, down five flights of stairs and empty them in a
receptacle where the corruption was speedily sprinkled with strong
disinfectant.

perhaps there is a wise mercy in all this.  these men of the spike, the
peg, and the street, are encumbrances.  they are of no good or use to any
one, nor to themselves.  they clutter the earth with their presence, and
are better out of the way.  broken by hardship, ill fed, and worse
nourished, they are always the first to be struck down by disease, as
they are likewise the quickest to die.

they feel, themselves, that the forces of society tend to hurl them out
of existence.  we were sprinkling disinfectant by the mortuary, when the
dead waggon drove up and five bodies were packed into it.  the
conversation turned to the "white potion" and "black jack," and i found
they were all agreed that the poor person, man or woman, who in the
infirmary gave too much trouble or was in a bad way, was "polished off."
that is to say, the incurables and the obstreperous were given a dose of
"black jack" or the "white potion," and sent over the divide.  it does
not matter in the least whether this be actually so or not.  the point
is, they have the feeling that it is so, and they have created the
language with which to express that feeling--"black jack" "white potion,"
"polishing off."

at eight o'clock we went down into a cellar under the infirmary, where
tea was brought to us, and the hospital scraps.  these were heaped high
on a huge platter in an indescribable mess--pieces of bread, chunks of
grease and fat pork, the burnt skin from the outside of roasted joints,
bones, in short, all the leavings from the fingers and mouths of the sick
ones suffering from all manner of diseases.  into this mess the men
plunged their hands, digging, pawing, turning over, examining, rejecting,
and scrambling for.  it wasn't pretty.  pigs couldn't have done worse.
but the poor devils were hungry, and they ate ravenously of the swill,
and when they could eat no more they bundled what was left into their
handkerchiefs and thrust it inside their shirts.

"once, w'en i was 'ere before, wot did i find out there but a 'ole lot of
pork-ribs," said ginger to me.  by "out there" he meant the place where
the corruption was dumped and sprinkled with strong disinfectant.  "they
was a prime lot, no end o' meat on 'em, an' i 'ad 'em into my arms an'
was out the gate an' down the street, a-lookin' for some 'un to gi' 'em
to.  couldn't see a soul, an' i was runnin' 'round clean crazy, the bloke
runnin' after me an' thinkin' i was 'slingin' my 'ook' [running away].
but jest before 'e got me, i got a ole woman an' poked 'em into 'er
apron."

o charity, o philanthropy, descend to the spike and take a lesson from
ginger.  at the bottom of the abyss he performed as purely an altruistic
act as was ever performed outside the abyss.  it was fine of ginger, and
if the old woman caught some contagion from the "no end o' meat" on the
pork-ribs, it was still fine, though not so fine.  but the most salient
thing in this incident, it seems to me, is poor ginger, "clean crazy" at
sight of so much food going to waste.

it is the rule of the casual ward that a man who enters must stay two
nights and a day; but i had seen sufficient for my purpose, had paid for
my skilly and canvas, and was preparing to run for it.

"come on, let's sling it," i said to one of my mates, pointing toward the
open gate through which the dead waggon had come.

"an' get fourteen days?"

"no; get away."

"aw, i come 'ere for a rest," he said complacently.  "an' another night's
kip won't 'urt me none."

they were all of this opinion, so i was forced to "sling it" alone.

"you cawn't ever come back 'ere again for a doss," they warned me.

"no fear," said i, with an enthusiasm they could not comprehend; and,
dodging out the gate, i sped down the street.

straight to my room i hurried, changed my clothes, and less than an hour
from my escape, in a turkish bath, i was sweating out whatever germs and
other things had penetrated my epidermis, and wishing that i could stand
a temperature of three hundred and twenty rather than two hundred and
twenty.




chapter x--carrying the banner


"to carry the banner" means to walk the streets all night; and i, with
the figurative emblem hoisted, went out to see what i could see.  men and
women walk the streets at night all over this great city, but i selected
the west end, making leicester square my base, and scouting about from
the thames embankment to hyde park.

the rain was falling heavily when the theatres let out, and the brilliant
throng which poured from the places of amusement was hard put to find
cabs.  the streets were so many wild rivers of cabs, most of which were
engaged, however; and here i saw the desperate attempts of ragged men and
boys to get a shelter from the night by procuring cabs for the cabless
ladies and gentlemen.  i use the word "desperate" advisedly, for these
wretched, homeless ones were gambling a soaking against a bed; and most
of them, i took notice, got the soaking and missed the bed.  now, to go
through a stormy night with wet clothes, and, in addition, to be ill
nourished and not to have tasted meat for a week or a month, is about as
severe a hardship as a man can undergo.  well fed and well clad, i have
travelled all day with the spirit thermometer down to seventy-four
degrees below zero--one hundred and six degrees of frost {1}; and though
i suffered, it was a mere nothing compared with carrying the banner for a
night, ill fed, ill clad, and soaking wet.

the streets grew very quiet and lonely after the theatre crowd had gone
home.  only were to be seen the ubiquitous policemen, flashing their dark
lanterns into doorways and alleys, and men and women and boys taking
shelter in the lee of buildings from the wind and rain.  piccadilly,
however, was not quite so deserted.  its pavements were brightened by
well-dressed women without escort, and there was more life and action
there than elsewhere, due to the process of finding escort.  but by three
o'clock the last of them had vanished, and it was then indeed lonely.

at half-past one the steady downpour ceased, and only showers fell
thereafter.  the homeless folk came away from the protection of the
buildings, and slouched up and down and everywhere, in order to rush up
the circulation and keep warm.

one old woman, between fifty and sixty, a sheer wreck, i had noticed
earlier in the night standing in piccadilly, not far from leicester
square.  she seemed to have neither the sense nor the strength to get out
of the rain or keep walking, but stood stupidly, whenever she got the
chance, meditating on past days, i imagine, when life was young and blood
was warm.  but she did not get the chance often.  she was moved on by
every policeman, and it required an average of six moves to send her
doddering off one man's beat and on to another's.  by three o'clock, she
had progressed as far as st. james street, and as the clocks were
striking four i saw her sleeping soundly against the iron railings of
green park.  a brisk shower was falling at the time, and she must have
been drenched to the skin.

now, said i, at one o'clock, to myself; consider that you are a poor
young man, penniless, in london town, and that to-morrow you must look
for work.  it is necessary, therefore, that you get some sleep in order
that you may have strength to look for work and to do work in case you
find it.

so i sat down on the stone steps of a building.  five minutes later a
policeman was looking at me.  my eyes were wide open, so he only grunted
and passed on.  ten minutes later my head was on my knees, i was dozing,
and the same policeman was saying gruffly, "'ere, you, get outa that!"

i got.  and, like the old woman, i continued to get; for every time i
dozed, a policeman was there to rout me along again.  not long after,
when i had given this up, i was walking with a young londoner (who had
been out to the colonies and wished he were out to them again), when i
noticed an open passage leading under a building and disappearing in
darkness.  a low iron gate barred the entrance.

"come on," i said.  "let's climb over and get a good sleep."

"wot?" he answered, recoiling from me.  "an' get run in fer three months!
blimey if i do!"

later on i was passing hyde park with a young boy of fourteen or fifteen,
a most wretched-looking youth, gaunt and hollow-eyed and sick.

"let's go over the fence," i proposed, "and crawl into the shrubbery for
a sleep.  the bobbies couldn't find us there."

"no fear," he answered.  "there's the park guardians, and they'd run you
in for six months."

times have changed, alas!  when i was a youngster i used to read of
homeless boys sleeping in doorways.  already the thing has become a
tradition.  as a stock situation it will doubtless linger in literature
for a century to come, but as a cold fact it has ceased to be.  here are
the doorways, and here are the boys, but happy conjunctions are no longer
effected.  the doorways remain empty, and the boys keep awake and carry
the banner.

"i was down under the arches," grumbled another young fellow.  by
"arches" he meant the shore arches where begin the bridges that span the
thames.  "i was down under the arches wen it was ryning its 'ardest, an'
a bobby comes in an' chyses me out.  but i come back, an' 'e come too.
''ere,' sez 'e, 'wot you doin' 'ere?'  an' out i goes, but i sez, 'think
i want ter pinch [steal] the bleedin' bridge?'"

among those who carry the banner, green park has the reputation of
opening its gates earlier than the other parks, and at quarter-past four
in the morning, i, and many more, entered green park.  it was raining
again, but they were worn out with the night's walking, and they were
down on the benches and asleep at once.  many of the men stretched out
full length on the dripping wet grass, and, with the rain falling
steadily upon them, were sleeping the sleep of exhaustion.

and now i wish to criticise the powers that be.  they _are_ the powers,
therefore they may decree whatever they please; so i make bold only to
criticise the ridiculousness of their decrees.  all night long they make
the homeless ones walk up and down.  they drive them out of doors and
passages, and lock them out of the parks.  the evident intention of all
this is to deprive them of sleep.  well and good, the powers have the
power to deprive them of sleep, or of anything else for that matter; but
why under the sun do they open the gates of the parks at five o'clock in
the morning and let the homeless ones go inside and sleep?  if it is
their intention to deprive them of sleep, why do they let them sleep
after five in the morning?  and if it is not their intention to deprive
them of sleep, why don't they let them sleep earlier in the night?

in this connection, i will say that i came by green park that same day,
at one in the afternoon, and that i counted scores of the ragged wretches
asleep in the grass.  it was sunday afternoon, the sun was fitfully
appearing, and the well-dressed west enders, with their wives and
progeny, were out by thousands, taking the air.  it was not a pleasant
sight for them, those horrible, unkempt, sleeping vagabonds; while the
vagabonds themselves, i know, would rather have done their sleeping the
night before.

and so, dear soft people, should you ever visit london town, and see
these men asleep on the benches and in the grass, please do not think
they are lazy creatures, preferring sleep to work.  know that the powers
that be have kept them walking all the night long, and that in the day
they have nowhere else to sleep.




chapter xi--the peg


but, after carrying the banner all night, i did not sleep in green park
when morning dawned.  i was wet to the skin, it is true, and i had had no
sleep for twenty-four hours; but, still adventuring as a penniless man
looking for work, i had to look about me, first for a breakfast, and next
for the work.

during the night i had heard of a place over on the surrey side of the
thames, where the salvation army every sunday morning gave away a
breakfast to the unwashed.  (and, by the way, the men who carry the
banner are unwashed in the morning, and unless it is raining they do not
have much show for a wash, either.)  this, thought i, is the very
thing--breakfast in the morning, and then the whole day in which to look
for work.

it was a weary walk.  down st. james street i dragged my tired legs,
along pall mall, past trafalgar square, to the strand.  i crossed the
waterloo bridge to the surrey side, cut across to blackfriars road,
coming out near the surrey theatre, and arrived at the salvation army
barracks before seven o'clock.  this was "the peg."  and by "the peg," in
the argot, is meant the place where a free meal may be obtained.

here was a motley crowd of woebegone wretches who had spent the night in
the rain.  such prodigious misery! and so much of it!  old men, young
men, all manner of men, and boys to boot, and all manner of boys.  some
were drowsing standing up; half a score of them were stretched out on the
stone steps in most painful postures, all of them sound asleep, the skin
of their bodies showing red through the holes, and rents in their rags.
and up and down the street and across the street for a block either way,
each doorstep had from two to three occupants, all asleep, their heads
bent forward on their knees.  and, it must be remembered, these are not
hard times in england.  things are going on very much as they ordinarily
do, and times are neither hard nor easy.

and then came the policeman.  "get outa that, you bloomin' swine!  eigh!
eigh!  get out now!"  and like swine he drove them from the doorways and
scattered them to the four winds of surrey.  but when he encountered the
crowd asleep on the steps he was astounded.  "shocking!" he exclaimed.
"shocking!  and of a sunday morning!  a pretty sight!  eigh! eigh!  get
outa that, you bleeding nuisances!"

of course it was a shocking sight, i was shocked myself.  and i should
not care to have my own daughter pollute her eyes with such a sight, or
come within half a mile of it; but--and there we were, and there you are,
and "but" is all that can be said.

the policeman passed on, and back we clustered, like flies around a honey
jar.  for was there not that wonderful thing, a breakfast, awaiting us?
we could not have clustered more persistently and desperately had they
been giving away million-dollar bank-notes.  some were already off to
sleep, when back came the policeman and away we scattered only to return
again as soon as the coast was clear.

at half-past seven a little door opened, and a salvation army soldier
stuck out his head.  "ayn't no sense blockin' the wy up that wy," he
said.  "those as 'as tickets cawn come hin now, an' those as 'asn't
cawn't come hin till nine."

oh, that breakfast!  nine o'clock!  an hour and a half longer!  the men
who held tickets were greatly envied.  they were permitted to go inside,
have a wash, and sit down and rest until breakfast, while we waited for
the same breakfast on the street.  the tickets had been distributed the
previous night on the streets and along the embankment, and the
possession of them was not a matter of merit, but of chance.

at eight-thirty, more men with tickets were admitted, and by nine the
little gate was opened to us.  we crushed through somehow, and found
ourselves packed in a courtyard like sardines.  on more occasions than
one, as a yankee tramp in yankeeland, i have had to work for my
breakfast; but for no breakfast did i ever work so hard as for this one.
for over two hours i had waited outside, and for over another hour i
waited in this packed courtyard.  i had had nothing to eat all night, and
i was weak and faint, while the smell of the soiled clothes and unwashed
bodies, steaming from pent animal heat, and blocked solidly about me,
nearly turned my stomach.  so tightly were we packed, that a number of
the men took advantage of the opportunity and went soundly asleep
standing up.

now, about the salvation army in general i know nothing, and whatever
criticism i shall make here is of that particular portion of the
salvation army which does business on blackfriars road near the surrey
theatre.  in the first place, this forcing of men who have been up all
night to stand on their feet for hours longer, is as cruel as it is
needless.  we were weak, famished, and exhausted from our night's
hardship and lack of sleep, and yet there we stood, and stood, and stood,
without rhyme or reason.

sailors were very plentiful in this crowd.  it seemed to me that one man
in four was looking for a ship, and i found at least a dozen of them to
be american sailors.  in accounting for their being "on the beach," i
received the same story from each and all, and from my knowledge of sea
affairs this story rang true.  english ships sign their sailors for the
voyage, which means the round trip, sometimes lasting as long as three
years; and they cannot sign off and receive their discharges until they
reach the home port, which is england.  their wages are low, their food
is bad, and their treatment worse.  very often they are really forced by
their captains to desert in the new world or the colonies, leaving a
handsome sum of wages behind them--a distinct gain, either to the captain
or the owners, or to both.  but whether for this reason alone or not, it
is a fact that large numbers of them desert.  then, for the home voyage,
the ship engages whatever sailors it can find on the beach.  these men
are engaged at the somewhat higher wages that obtain in other portions of
the world, under the agreement that they shall sign off on reaching
england.  the reason for this is obvious; for it would be poor business
policy to sign them for any longer time, since seamen's wages are low in
england, and england is always crowded with sailormen on the beach.  so
this fully accounted for the american seamen at the salvation army
barracks.  to get off the beach in other outlandish places they had come
to england, and gone on the beach in the most outlandish place of all.

there were fully a score of americans in the crowd, the non-sailors being
"tramps royal," the men whose "mate is the wind that tramps the world."
they were all cheerful, facing things with the pluck which is their chief
characteristic and which seems never to desert them, withal they were
cursing the country with lurid metaphors quite refreshing after a month
of unimaginative, monotonous cockney swearing.  the cockney has one oath,
and one oath only, the most indecent in the language, which he uses on
any and every occasion.  far different is the luminous and varied western
swearing, which runs to blasphemy rather than indecency.  and after all,
since men will swear, i think i prefer blasphemy to indecency; there is
an audacity about it, an adventurousness and defiance that is better than
sheer filthiness.

there was one american tramp royal whom i found particularly enjoyable.  i
first noticed him on the street, asleep in a doorway, his head on his
knees, but a hat on his head that one does not meet this side of the
western ocean.  when the policeman routed him out, he got up slowly and
deliberately, looked at the policeman, yawned and stretched himself,
looked at the policeman again as much as to say he didn't know whether he
would or wouldn't, and then sauntered leisurely down the sidewalk.  at
the outset i was sure of the hat, but this made me sure of the wearer of
the hat.

in the jam inside i found myself alongside of him, and we had quite a
chat.  he had been through spain, italy, switzerland, and france, and had
accomplished the practically impossible feat of beating his way three
hundred miles on a french railway without being caught at the finish.
where was i hanging out? he asked.  and how did i manage for
"kipping"?--which means sleeping.  did i know the rounds yet?  he was
getting on, though the country was "horstyl" and the cities were "bum."
fierce, wasn't it?  couldn't "batter" (beg) anywhere without being
"pinched."  but he wasn't going to quit it.  buffalo bill's show was
coming over soon, and a man who could drive eight horses was sure of a
job any time.  these mugs over here didn't know beans about driving
anything more than a span.  what was the matter with me hanging on and
waiting for buffalo bill?  he was sure i could ring in somehow.

and so, after all, blood is thicker than water.  we were
fellow-countrymen and strangers in a strange land.  i had warmed to his
battered old hat at sight of it, and he was as solicitous for my welfare
as if we were blood brothers.  we swapped all manner of useful
information concerning the country and the ways of its people, methods by
which to obtain food and shelter and what not, and we parted genuinely
sorry at having to say good-bye.

one thing particularly conspicuous in this crowd was the shortness of
stature.  i, who am but of medium height, looked over the heads of nine
out of ten.  the natives were all short, as were the foreign sailors.
there were only five or six in the crowd who could be called fairly tall,
and they were scandinavians and americans.  the tallest man there,
however, was an exception.  he was an englishman, though not a londoner.
"candidate for the life guards," i remarked to him.  "you've hit it,
mate," was his reply; "i've served my bit in that same, and the way
things are i'll be back at it before long."

for an hour we stood quietly in this packed courtyard.  then the men
began to grow restless.  there was pushing and shoving forward, and a
mild hubbub of voices.  nothing rough, however, nor violent; merely the
restlessness of weary and hungry men.  at this juncture forth came the
adjutant.  i did not like him.  his eyes were not good.  there was
nothing of the lowly galilean about him, but a great deal of the
centurion who said: "for i am a man in authority, having soldiers under
me; and i say to this man, go, and he goeth; and to another, come, and he
cometh; and to my servant, do this, and he doeth it."

well, he looked at us in just that way, and those nearest to him quailed.
then he lifted his voice.

"stop this 'ere, now, or i'll turn you the other wy an' march you out,
an' you'll get no breakfast."

i cannot convey by printed speech the insufferable way in which he said
this.  he seemed to me to revel in that he was a man in authority, able
to say to half a thousand ragged wretches, "you may eat or go hungry, as
i elect."

to deny us our breakfast after standing for hours!  it was an awful
threat, and the pitiful, abject silence which instantly fell attested its
awfulness.  and it was a cowardly threat.  we could not strike back, for
we were starving; and it is the way of the world that when one man feeds
another he is that man's master.  but the centurion--i mean the
adjutant--was not satisfied.  in the dead silence he raised his voice
again, and repeated the threat, and amplified it.

at last we were permitted to enter the feasting hall, where we found the
"ticket men" washed but unfed.  all told, there must have been nearly
seven hundred of us who sat down--not to meat or bread, but to speech,
song, and prayer.  from all of which i am convinced that tantalus suffers
in many guises this side of the infernal regions.  the adjutant made the
prayer, but i did not take note of it, being too engrossed with the
massed picture of misery before me.  but the speech ran something like
this: "you will feast in paradise.  no matter how you starve and suffer
here, you will feast in paradise, that is, if you will follow the
directions."  and so forth and so forth.  a clever bit of propaganda, i
took it, but rendered of no avail for two reasons.  first, the men who
received it were unimaginative and materialistic, unaware of the
existence of any unseen, and too inured to hell on earth to be frightened
by hell to come.  and second, weary and exhausted from the night's
sleeplessness and hardship, suffering from the long wait upon their feet,
and faint from hunger, they were yearning, not for salvation, but for
grub.  the "soul-snatchers" (as these men call all religious
propagandists), should study the physiological basis of psychology a
little, if they wish to make their efforts more effective.

all in good time, about eleven o'clock, breakfast arrived.  it arrived,
not on plates, but in paper parcels.  i did not have all i wanted, and i
am sure that no man there had all he wanted, or half of what he wanted or
needed.  i gave part of my bread to the tramp royal who was waiting for
buffalo bill, and he was as ravenous at the end as he was in the
beginning.  this is the breakfast: two slices of bread, one small piece
of bread with raisins in it and called "cake," a wafer of cheese, and a
mug of "water bewitched."  numbers of the men had been waiting since five
o'clock for it, while all of us had waited at least four hours; and in
addition, we had been herded like swine, packed like sardines, and
treated like curs, and been preached at, and sung to, and prayed for.  nor
was that all.

no sooner was breakfast over (and it was over almost as quickly as it
takes to tell), than the tired heads began to nod and droop, and in five
minutes half of us were sound asleep.  there were no signs of our being
dismissed, while there were unmistakable signs of preparation for a
meeting.  i looked at a small clock hanging on the wall.  it indicated
twenty-five minutes to twelve.  heigh-ho, thought i, time is flying, and
i have yet to look for work.

"i want to go," i said to a couple of waking men near me.

"got ter sty fer the service," was the answer.

"do you want to stay?" i asked.

they shook their heads.

"then let us go and tell them we want to get out," i continued.  "come
on."

but the poor creatures were aghast.  so i left them to their fate, and
went up to the nearest salvation army man.

"i want to go," i said.  "i came here for breakfast in order that i might
be in shape to look for work.  i didn't think it would take so long to
get breakfast.  i think i have a chance for work in stepney, and the
sooner i start, the better chance i'll have of getting it."

he was really a good fellow, though he was startled by my request.  "wy,"
he said, "we're goin' to 'old services, and you'd better sty."

"but that will spoil my chances for work," i urged.  "and work is the
most important thing for me just now."

as he was only a private, he referred me to the adjutant, and to the
adjutant i repeated my reasons for wishing to go, and politely requested
that he let me go.

"but it cawn't be done," he said, waxing virtuously indignant at such
ingratitude.  "the idea!" he snorted.  "the idea!"

"do you mean to say that i can't get out of here?" i demanded.  "that you
will keep me here against my will?"

"yes," he snorted.

i do not know what might have happened, for i was waxing indignant
myself; but the "congregation" had "piped" the situation, and he drew me
over to a corner of the room, and then into another room.  here he again
demanded my reasons for wishing to go.

"i want to go," i said, "because i wish to look for work over in stepney,
and every hour lessens my chance of finding work.  it is now twenty-five
minutes to twelve.  i did not think when i came in that it would take so
long to get a breakfast."

"you 'ave business, eh?" he sneered.  "a man of business you are, eh?
then wot did you come 'ere for?"

"i was out all night, and i needed a breakfast in order to strengthen me
to find work.  that is why i came here."

"a nice thing to do," he went on in the same sneering manner.  "a man
with business shouldn't come 'ere.  you've tyken some poor man's
breakfast 'ere this morning, that's wot you've done."

which was a lie, for every mother's son of us had come in.

now i submit, was this christian-like, or even honest?--after i had
plainly stated that i was homeless and hungry, and that i wished to look
for work, for him to call my looking for work "business," to call me
therefore a business man, and to draw the corollary that a man of
business, and well off, did not require a charity breakfast, and that by
taking a charity breakfast i had robbed some hungry waif who was not a
man of business.

i kept my temper, but i went over the facts again, and clearly and
concisely demonstrated to him how unjust he was and how he had perverted
the facts.  as i manifested no signs of backing down (and i am sure my
eyes were beginning to snap), he led me to the rear of the building
where, in an open court, stood a tent.  in the same sneering tone he
informed a couple of privates standing there that "'ere is a fellow that
'as business an' 'e wants to go before services."

they were duly shocked, of course, and they looked unutterable horror
while he went into the tent and brought out the major.  still in the same
sneering manner, laying particular stress on the "business," he brought
my case before the commanding officer.  the major was of a different
stamp of man.  i liked him as soon as i saw him, and to him i stated my
case in the same fashion as before.

"didn't you know you had to stay for services?" he asked.

"certainly not," i answered, "or i should have gone without my breakfast.
you have no placards posted to that effect, nor was i so informed when i
entered the place."

he meditated a moment.  "you can go," he said.

it was twelve o'clock when i gained the street, and i couldn't quite make
up my mind whether i had been in the army or in prison.  the day was half
gone, and it was a far fetch to stepney.  and besides, it was sunday, and
why should even a starving man look for work on sunday?  furthermore, it
was my judgment that i had done a hard night's work walking the streets,
and a hard day's work getting my breakfast; so i disconnected myself from
my working hypothesis of a starving young man in search of employment,
hailed a bus, and climbed aboard.

after a shave and a bath, with my clothes all off, i got in between clean
white sheets and went to sleep.  it was six in the evening when i closed
my eyes.  when they opened again, the clocks were striking nine next
morning.  i had slept fifteen straight hours.  and as i lay there
drowsily, my mind went back to the seven hundred unfortunates i had left
waiting for services.  no bath, no shave for them, no clean white sheets
and all clothes off, and fifteen hours' straight sleep.  services over,
it was the weary streets again, the problem of a crust of bread ere
night, and the long sleepless night in the streets, and the pondering of
the problem of how to obtain a crust at dawn.




chapter xii--coronation day


   o thou that sea-walls sever
   from lands unwalled by seas!
   wilt thou endure forever,
   o milton's england, these?
   thou that wast his republic,
   wilt thou clasp their knees?
   these royalties rust-eaten,
   these worm-corroded lies
   that keep thy head storm-beaten,
   and sun-like strength of eyes
   from the open air and heaven
   of intercepted skies!

   swinburne.

vivat rex eduardus!  they crowned a king this day, and there has been
great rejoicing and elaborate tomfoolery, and i am perplexed and
saddened.  i never saw anything to compare with the pageant, except
yankee circuses and alhambra ballets; nor did i ever see anything so
hopeless and so tragic.

to have enjoyed the coronation procession, i should have come straight
from america to the hotel cecil, and straight from the hotel cecil to a
five-guinea seat among the washed.  my mistake was in coming from the
unwashed of the east end.  there were not many who came from that
quarter.  the east end, as a whole, remained in the east end and got
drunk.  the socialists, democrats, and republicans went off to the
country for a breath of fresh air, quite unaffected by the fact that four
hundred millions of people were taking to themselves a crowned and
anointed ruler.  six thousand five hundred prelates, priests, statesmen,
princes, and warriors beheld the crowning and anointing, and the rest of
us the pageant as it passed.

i saw it at trafalgar square, "the most splendid site in europe," and the
very innermost heart of the empire.  there were many thousands of us, all
checked and held in order by a superb display of armed power.  the line
of march was double-walled with soldiers.  the base of the nelson column
was triple-fringed with bluejackets.  eastward, at the entrance to the
square, stood the royal marine artillery.  in the triangle of pall mall
and cockspur street, the statue of george iii. was buttressed on either
side by the lancers and hussars.  to the west were the red-coats of the
royal marines, and from the union club to the embouchure of whitehall
swept the glittering, massive curve of the 1st life guards--gigantic men
mounted on gigantic chargers, steel-breastplated, steel-helmeted, steel-
caparisoned, a great war-sword of steel ready to the hand of the powers
that be.  and further, throughout the crowd, were flung long lines of the
metropolitan constabulary, while in the rear were the reserves--tall,
well-fed men, with weapons to wield and muscles to wield them in ease of
need.

and as it was thus at trafalgar square, so was it along the whole line of
march--force, overpowering force; myriads of men, splendid men, the pick
of the people, whose sole function in life is blindly to obey, and
blindly to kill and destroy and stamp out life.  and that they should be
well fed, well clothed, and well armed, and have ships to hurl them to
the ends of the earth, the east end of london, and the "east end" of all
england, toils and rots and dies.

there is a chinese proverb that if one man lives in laziness another will
die of hunger; and montesquieu has said, "the fact that many men are
occupied in making clothes for one individual is the cause of there being
many people without clothes."  so one explains the other.  we cannot
understand the starved and runty {2} toiler of the east end (living with
his family in a one-room den, and letting out the floor space for
lodgings to other starved and runty toilers) till we look at the
strapping life guardsmen of the west end, and come to know that the one
must feed and clothe and groom the other.

and while in westminster abbey the people were taking unto themselves a
king, i, jammed between the life guards and constabulary of trafalgar
square, was dwelling upon the time when the people of israel first took
unto themselves a king.  you all know how it runs.  the elders came to
the prophet samuel, and said: "make us a king to judge us like all the
nations."

   and the lord said unto samuel: now therefore hearken unto their voice;
   howbeit thou shalt show them the manner of the king that shall reign
   over them.

   and samuel told all the words of the lord unto the people that asked
   of him a king, and he said:

   this will be the manner of the king that shall reign over you; he will
   take your sons, and appoint them unto him, for his chariots, and to be
   his horsemen, and they shall run before his chariots.

   and he will appoint them unto him for captains of thousands, and
   captains of fifties; and he will set some to plough his ground, and to
   reap his harvest, and to make his instruments of war, and the
   instruments of his chariots.

   and he will take your daughters to be confectionaries, and to be
   cooks, and to be bakers.

   and he will take your fields and your vineyards, and your oliveyards,
   even the best of them, and give them to his servants.

   and he will take a tenth of your seed, and of your vineyards, and give
   to his officers, and to his servants.

   and he will take your menservants, and your maidservants, and your
   goodliest young men, and your asses, and put them to his work.

   he will take a tenth of your flocks; and ye shall be his servants.

   and ye shall call out in that day because of your king which ye shall
   have chosen you; and the lord will not answer you in that day.

all of which came to pass in that ancient day, and they did cry out to
samuel, saying: "pray for thy servants unto the lord thy god, that we die
not; for we have added unto all our sins this evil, to ask us a king."
and after saul, david, and solomon, came rehoboam, who "answered the
people roughly, saying: my father made your yoke heavy, but i will add to
your yoke; my father chastised you with whips, but i will chastise you
with scorpions."

and in these latter days, five hundred hereditary peers own one-fifth of
england; and they, and the officers and servants under the king, and
those who go to compose the powers that be, yearly spend in wasteful
luxury $1,850,000,000, or 370,000,000 pounds, which is thirty-two per
cent. of the total wealth produced by all the toilers of the country.

at the abbey, clad in wonderful golden raiment, amid fanfare of trumpets
and throbbing of music, surrounded by a brilliant throng of masters,
lords, and rulers, the king was being invested with the insignia of his
sovereignty.  the spurs were placed to his heels by the lord great
chamberlain, and a sword of state, in purple scabbard, was presented him
by the archbishop of canterbury, with these words:-

   receive this kingly sword brought now from the altar of god, and
   delivered to you by the hands of the bishops and servants of god,
   though unworthy.

whereupon, being girded, he gave heed to the archbishop's exhortation:-

   with this sword do justice, stop the growth of iniquity, protect the
   holy church of god, help and defend widows and orphans, restore the
   things that are gone to decay, maintain the things that are restored,
   punish and reform what is amiss, and confirm what is in good order.

but hark!  there is cheering down whitehall; the crowd sways, the double
walls of soldiers come to attention, and into view swing the king's
watermen, in fantastic mediaeval garbs of red, for all the world like the
van of a circus parade.  then a royal carriage, filled with ladies and
gentlemen of the household, with powdered footmen and coachmen most
gorgeously arrayed.  more carriages, lords, and chamberlains, viscounts,
mistresses of the robes--lackeys all.  then the warriors, a kingly
escort, generals, bronzed and worn, from the ends of the earth come up to
london town, volunteer officers, officers of the militia and regular
forces; spens and plumer, broadwood and cooper who relieved ookiep,
mathias of dargai, dixon of vlakfontein; general gaselee and admiral
seymour of china; kitchener of khartoum; lord roberts of india and all
the world--the fighting men of england, masters of destruction, engineers
of death!  another race of men from those of the shops and slums, a
totally different race of men.

but here they come, in all the pomp and certitude of power, and still
they come, these men of steel, these war lords and world harnessers.  pell-
mell, peers and commoners, princes and maharajahs, equerries to the king
and yeomen of the guard.  and here the colonials, lithe and hardy men;
and here all the breeds of all the world-soldiers from canada, australia,
new zealand; from bermuda, borneo, fiji, and the gold coast; from
rhodesia, cape colony, natal, sierra leone and gambia, nigeria, and
uganda; from ceylon, cyprus, hong-kong, jamaica, and wei-hai-wei; from
lagos, malta, st. lucia, singapore, trinidad.  and here the conquered men
of ind, swarthy horsemen and sword wielders, fiercely barbaric, blazing
in crimson and scarlet, sikhs, rajputs, burmese, province by province,
and caste by caste.

and now the horse guards, a glimpse of beautiful cream ponies, and a
golden panoply, a hurricane of cheers, the crashing of bands--"the king!
the king!  god save the king!"  everybody has gone mad.  the contagion is
sweeping me off my feet--i, too, want to shout, "the king!  god save the
king!"  ragged men about me, tears in their eyes, are tossing up their
hats and crying ecstatically, "bless 'em!  bless 'em!  bless 'em!"  see,
there he is, in that wondrous golden coach, the great crown flashing on
his head, the woman in white beside him likewise crowned.

and i check myself with a rush, striving to convince myself that it is
all real and rational, and not some glimpse of fairyland.  this i cannot
succeed in doing, and it is better so.  i much prefer to believe that all
this pomp, and vanity, and show, and mumbo-jumbo foolery has come from
fairyland, than to believe it the performance of sane and sensible people
who have mastered matter and solved the secrets of the stars.

princes and princelings, dukes, duchesses, and all manner of coroneted
folk of the royal train are flashing past; more warriors, and lackeys,
and conquered peoples, and the pagent is over.  i drift with the crowd
out of the square into a tangle of narrow streets, where the
public-houses are a-roar with drunkenness, men, women, and children mixed
together in colossal debauch.  and on every side is rising the favourite
song of the coronation:-

   "oh! on coronation day, on coronation day,
   we'll have a spree, a jubilee, and shout, hip, hip, hooray,
   for we'll all be marry, drinking whisky, wine, and sherry,
   we'll all be merry on coronation day."

the rain is pouring down.  up the street come troops of the auxiliaries,
black africans and yellow asiatics, beturbaned and befezed, and coolies
swinging along with machine guns and mountain batteries on their heads,
and the bare feet of all, in quick rhythm, going _slish, slish, slish_
through the pavement mud.  the public-houses empty by magic, and the
swarthy allegiants are cheered by their british brothers, who return at
once to the carouse.

"and how did you like the procession, mate?" i asked an old man on a
bench in green park.

"'ow did i like it?  a bloomin' good chawnce, sez i to myself, for a
sleep, wi' all the coppers aw'y, so i turned into the corner there, along
wi' fifty others.  but i couldn't sleep, a-lyin' there an' thinkin' 'ow
i'd worked all the years o' my life an' now 'ad no plyce to rest my 'ead;
an' the music comin' to me, an' the cheers an' cannon, till i got almost
a hanarchist an' wanted to blow out the brains o' the lord chamberlain."

why the lord chamberlain i could not precisely see, nor could he, but
that was the way he felt, he said conclusively, and them was no more
discussion.

as night drew on, the city became a blaze of light.  splashes of colour,
green, amber, and ruby, caught the eye at every point, and "e. r.," in
great crystal letters and backed by flaming gas, was everywhere.  the
crowds in the streets increased by hundreds of thousands, and though the
police sternly put down mafficking, drunkenness and rough play abounded.
the tired workers seemed to have gone mad with the relaxation and
excitement, and they surged and danced down the streets, men and women,
old and young, with linked arms and in long rows, singing, "i may be
crazy, but i love you," "dolly gray," and "the honeysuckle and the
bee"--the last rendered something like this:-

   "yew aw the enny, ennyseckle, oi em ther bee,
   oi'd like ter sip ther enny from those red lips, yew see."

i sat on a bench on the thames embankment, looking across the illuminated
water.  it was approaching midnight, and before me poured the better
class of merrymakers, shunning the more riotous streets and returning
home.  on the bench beside me sat two ragged creatures, a man and a
woman, nodding and dozing.  the woman sat with her arms clasped across
the breast, holding tightly, her body in constant play--now dropping
forward till it seemed its balance would be overcome and she would fall
to the pavement; now inclining to the left, sideways, till her head
rested on the man's shoulder; and now to the right, stretched and
strained, till the pain of it awoke her and she sat bolt upright.
whereupon the dropping forward would begin again and go through its cycle
till she was aroused by the strain and stretch.

every little while boys and young men stopped long enough to go behind
the bench and give vent to sudden and fiendish shouts.  this always
jerked the man and woman abruptly from their sleep; and at sight of the
startled woe upon their faces the crowd would roar with laughter as it
flooded past.

this was the most striking thing, the general heartlessness exhibited on
every hand.  it is a commonplace, the homeless on the benches, the poor
miserable folk who may be teased and are harmless.  fifty thousand people
must have passed the bench while i sat upon it, and not one, on such a
jubilee occasion as the crowning of the king, felt his heart-strings
touched sufficiently to come up and say to the woman: "here's sixpence;
go and get a bed."  but the women, especially the young women, made witty
remarks upon the woman nodding, and invariably set their companions
laughing.

to use a briticism, it was "cruel"; the corresponding americanism was
more appropriate--it was "fierce."  i confess i began to grow incensed at
this happy crowd streaming by, and to extract a sort of satisfaction from
the london statistics which demonstrate that one in every four adults is
destined to die on public charity, either in the workhouse, the
infirmary, or the asylum.

i talked with the man.  he was fifty-four and a broken-down docker.  he
could only find odd work when there was a large demand for labour, for
the younger and stronger men were preferred when times were slack.  he
had spent a week, now, on the benches of the embankment; but things
looked brighter for next week, and he might possibly get in a few days'
work and have a bed in some doss-house.  he had lived all his life in
london, save for five years, when, in 1878, he saw foreign service in
india.

of course he would eat; so would the girl.  days like this were uncommon
hard on such as they, though the coppers were so busy poor folk could get
in more sleep.  i awoke the girl, or woman, rather, for she was "eyght
an' twenty, sir," and we started for a coffee-house.

"wot a lot o' work puttin' up the lights," said the man at sight of some
building superbly illuminated.  this was the keynote of his being.  all
his life he had worked, and the whole objective universe, as well as his
own soul, he could express in terms only of work.  "coronations is some
good," he went on.  "they give work to men."

"but your belly is empty," i said.

"yes," he answered.  "i tried, but there wasn't any chawnce.  my age is
against me.  wot do you work at?  seafarin' chap, eh?  i knew it from yer
clothes."

"i know wot you are," said the girl, "an eyetalian."

"no 'e ayn't," the man cried heatedly.  "'e's a yank, that's wot 'e is.  i
know."

"lord lumne, look a' that," she exclaimed, as we debauched upon the
strand, choked with the roaring, reeling coronation crowd, the men
bellowing and the girls singing in high throaty notes:-

   "oh! on coronation d'y, on coronation d'y,
   we'll 'ave a spree, a jubilee, an' shout 'ip, 'ip, 'ooray;
   for we'll all be merry, drinkin' whisky, wine, and sherry,
   we'll all be merry on coronation d'y."

"'ow dirty i am, bein' around the w'y i 'ave," the woman said, as she sat
down in a coffee-house, wiping the sleep and grime from the corners of
her eyes.  "an' the sights i 'ave seen this d'y, an' i enjoyed it, though
it was lonesome by myself.  an' the duchesses an' the lydies 'ad sich
gran' w'ite dresses.  they was jest bu'ful, bu'ful."

"i'm irish," she said, in answer to a question.  "my nyme's eyethorne."

"what?" i asked.

"eyethorne, sir; eyethorne."

"spell it."

"h-a-y-t-h-o-r-n-e, eyethorne.'

"oh," i said, "irish cockney."

"yes, sir, london-born."

she had lived happily at home till her father died, killed in an
accident, when she had found herself on the world.  one brother was in
the army, and the other brother, engaged in keeping a wife and eight
children on twenty shillings a week and unsteady employment, could do
nothing for her.  she had been out of london once in her life, to a place
in essex, twelve miles away, where she had picked fruit for three weeks:
"an' i was as brown as a berry w'en i come back.  you won't b'lieve it,
but i was."

the last place in which she had worked was a coffee-house, hours from
seven in the morning till eleven at night, and for which she had received
five shillings a week and her food.  then she had fallen sick, and since
emerging from the hospital had been unable to find anything to do.  she
wasn't feeling up to much, and the last two nights had been spent in the
street.

between them they stowed away a prodigious amount of food, this man and
woman, and it was not till i had duplicated and triplicated their
original orders that they showed signs of easing down.

once she reached across and felt the texture of my coat and shirt, and
remarked upon the good clothes the yanks wore.  my rags good clothes!  it
put me to the blush; but, on inspecting them more closely and on
examining the clothes worn by the man and woman, i began to feel quite
well dressed and respectable.

"what do you expect to do in the end?" i asked them.  "you know you're
growing older every day."

"work'ouse," said he.

"gawd blimey if i do," said she.  "there's no 'ope for me, i know, but
i'll die on the streets.  no work'ouse for me, thank you.  no, indeed,"
she sniffed in the silence that fell.

"after you have been out all night in the streets," i asked, "what do you
do in the morning for something to eat?"

"try to get a penny, if you 'aven't one saved over," the man explained.
"then go to a coffee-'ouse an' get a mug o' tea."

"but i don't see how that is to feed you," i objected.

the pair smiled knowingly.

"you drink your tea in little sips," he went on, "making it last its
longest.  an' you look sharp, an' there's some as leaves a bit be'ind
'em."

"it's s'prisin', the food wot some people leaves," the woman broke in.

"the thing," said the man judicially, as the trick dawned upon me, "is to
get 'old o' the penny."

as we started to leave, miss haythorne gathered up a couple of crusts
from the neighbouring tables and thrust them somewhere into her rags.

"cawn't wyste 'em, you know," said she; to which the docker nodded,
tucking away a couple of crusts himself.

at three in the morning i strolled up the embankment.  it was a gala
night for the homeless, for the police were elsewhere; and each bench was
jammed with sleeping occupants.  there were as many women as men, and the
great majority of them, male and female, were old.  occasionally a boy
was to be seen.  on one bench i noticed a family, a man sitting upright
with a sleeping babe in his arms, his wife asleep, her head on his
shoulder, and in her lap the head of a sleeping youngster.  the man's
eyes were wide open.  he was staring out over the water and thinking,
which is not a good thing for a shelterless man with a family to do.  it
would not be a pleasant thing to speculate upon his thoughts; but this i
know, and all london knows, that the cases of out-of-works killing their
wives and babies is not an uncommon happening.

one cannot walk along the thames embankment, in the small hours of
morning, from the houses of parliament, past cleopatra's needle, to
waterloo bridge, without being reminded of the sufferings, seven and
twenty centuries old, recited by the author of "job":-

   there are that remove the landmarks; they violently take away flocks
   and feed them.

   they drive away the ass of the fatherless, they take the widow's ox
   for a pledge.

   they turn the needy out of the way; the poor of the earth hide
   themselves together.

   behold, as wild asses in the desert they go forth to their work,
   seeking diligently for meat; the wilderness yieldeth them food for
   their children.

   they cut their provender in the field, and they glean the vintage of
   the wicked.

   they lie all night naked without clothing, and have no covering in the
   cold.

   they are wet with the showers of the mountains, and embrace the rock
   for want of a shelter.

   there are that pluck the fatherless from the breast, and take a pledge
   of the poor.

   so that they go about naked without clothing, and being an hungered
   they carry the sheaves.--job xxiv. 2-10.

seven and twenty centuries agone!  and it is all as true and apposite to-
day in the innermost centre of this christian civilisation whereof edward
vii. is king.




chapter xiii--dan cullen, docker


i stood, yesterday, in a room in one of the "municipal dwellings," not
far from leman street.  if i looked into a dreary future and saw that i
would have to live in such a room until i died, i should immediately go
down, plump into the thames, and cut the tenancy short.

it was not a room.  courtesy to the language will no more permit it to be
called a room than it will permit a hovel to be called a mansion.  it was
a den, a lair.  seven feet by eight were its dimensions, and the ceiling
was so low as not to give the cubic air space required by a british
soldier in barracks.  a crazy couch, with ragged coverlets, occupied
nearly half the room.  a rickety table, a chair, and a couple of boxes
left little space in which to turn around.  five dollars would have
purchased everything in sight.  the floor was bare, while the walls and
ceiling were literally covered with blood marks and splotches.  each mark
represented a violent death--of an insect, for the place swarmed with
vermin, a plague with which no person could cope single-handed.

the man who had occupied this hole, one dan cullen, docker, was dying in
hospital.  yet he had impressed his personality on his miserable
surroundings sufficiently to give an inkling as to what sort of man he
was.  on the walls were cheap pictures of garibaldi, engels, dan burns,
and other labour leaders, while on the table lay one of walter besant's
novels.  he knew his shakespeare, i was told, and had read history,
sociology, and economics.  and he was self-educated.

on the table, amidst a wonderful disarray, lay a sheet of paper on which
was scrawled: _mr. cullen, please return the large white jug and
corkscrew i lent you_--articles loaned, during the first stages of his
sickness, by a woman neighbour, and demanded back in anticipation of his
death.  a large white jug and a corkscrew are far too valuable to a
creature of the abyss to permit another creature to die in peace.  to the
last, dan cullen's soul must be harrowed by the sordidness out of which
it strove vainly to rise.

it is a brief little story, the story of dan cullen, but there is much to
read between the lines.  he was born lowly, in a city and land where the
lines of caste are tightly drawn.  all his days he toiled hard with his
body; and because he had opened the books, and been caught up by the
fires of the spirit, and could "write a letter like a lawyer," he had
been selected by his fellows to toil hard for them with his brain.  he
became a leader of the fruit-porters, represented the dockers on the
london trades council, and wrote trenchant articles for the labour
journals.

he did not cringe to other men, even though they were his economic
masters, and controlled the means whereby he lived, and he spoke his mind
freely, and fought the good fight.  in the "great dock strike" he was
guilty of taking a leading part.  and that was the end of dan cullen.
from that day he was a marked man, and every day, for ten years and more,
he was "paid off" for what he had done.

a docker is a casual labourer.  work ebbs and flows, and he works or does
not work according to the amount of goods on hand to be moved.  dan
cullen was discriminated against.  while he was not absolutely turned
away (which would have caused trouble, and which would certainly have
been more merciful), he was called in by the foreman to do not more than
two or three days' work per week.  this is what is called being
"disciplined," or "drilled."  it means being starved.  there is no
politer word.  ten years of it broke his heart, and broken-hearted men
cannot live.

he took to his bed in his terrible den, which grew more terrible with his
helplessness.  he was without kith or kin, a lonely old man, embittered
and pessimistic, fighting vermin the while and looking at garibaldi,
engels, and dan burns gazing down at him from the blood-bespattered
walls.  no one came to see him in that crowded municipal barracks (he had
made friends with none of them), and he was left to rot.

but from the far reaches of the east end came a cobbler and his son, his
sole friends.  they cleansed his room, brought fresh linen from home, and
took from off his limbs the sheets, greyish-black with dirt.  and they
brought to him one of the queen's bounty nurses from aldgate.

she washed his face, shook up his conch, and talked with him.  it was
interesting to talk with him--until he learned her name.  oh, yes, blank
was her name, she replied innocently, and sir george blank was her
brother.  sir george blank, eh? thundered old dan cullen on his death-
bed; sir george blank, solicitor to the docks at cardiff, who, more than
any other man, had broken up the dockers' union of cardiff, and was
knighted?  and she was his sister?  thereupon dan cullen sat up on his
crazy couch and pronounced anathema upon her and all her breed; and she
fled, to return no more, strongly impressed with the ungratefulness of
the poor.

dan cullen's feet became swollen with dropsy.  he sat up all day on the
side of the bed (to keep the water out of his body), no mat on the floor,
a thin blanket on his legs, and an old coat around his shoulders.  a
missionary brought him a pair of paper slippers, worth fourpence (i saw
them), and proceeded to offer up fifty prayers or so for the good of dan
cullen's soul.  but dan cullen was the sort of man that wanted his soul
left alone.  he did not care to have tom, dick, or harry, on the strength
of fourpenny slippers, tampering with it.  he asked the missionary kindly
to open the window, so that he might toss the slippers out.  and the
missionary went away, to return no more, likewise impressed with the
ungratefulness of the poor.

the cobbler, a brave old hero himself, though unaneled and unsung, went
privily to the head office of the big fruit brokers for whom dan cullen
had worked as a casual labourer for thirty years.  their system was such
that the work was almost entirely done by casual hands.  the cobbler told
them the man's desperate plight, old, broken, dying, without help or
money, reminded them that he had worked for them thirty years, and asked
them to do something for him.

"oh," said the manager, remembering dan cullen without having to refer to
the books, "you see, we make it a rule never to help casuals, and we can
do nothing."

nor did they do anything, not even sign a letter asking for dan cullen's
admission to a hospital.  and it is not so easy to get into a hospital in
london town.  at hampstead, if he passed the doctors, at least four
months would elapse before he could get in, there were so many on the
books ahead of him.  the cobbler finally got him into the whitechapel
infirmary, where he visited him frequently.  here he found that dan
cullen had succumbed to the prevalent feeling, that, being hopeless, they
were hurrying him out of the way.  a fair and logical conclusion, one
must agree, for an old and broken man to arrive at, who has been
resolutely "disciplined" and "drilled" for ten years.  when they sweated
him for bright's disease to remove the fat from the kidneys, dan cullen
contended that the sweating was hastening his death; while bright's
disease, being a wasting away of the kidneys, there was therefore no fat
to remove, and the doctor's excuse was a palpable lie.  whereupon the
doctor became wroth, and did not come near him for nine days.

then his bed was tilted up so that his feet and legs were elevated.  at
once dropsy appeared in the body, and dan cullen contended that the thing
was done in order to run the water down into his body from his legs and
kill him more quickly.  he demanded his discharge, though they told him
he would die on the stairs, and dragged himself, more dead than alive, to
the cobbler's shop.  at the moment of writing this, he is dying at the
temperance hospital, into which place his staunch friend, the cobbler,
moved heaven and earth to have him admitted.

poor dan cullen!  a jude the obscure, who reached out after knowledge;
who toiled with his body in the day and studied in the watches of the
night; who dreamed his dream and struck valiantly for the cause; a
patriot, a lover of human freedom, and a fighter unafraid; and in the
end, not gigantic enough to beat down the conditions which baffled and
stifled him, a cynic and a pessimist, gasping his final agony on a
pauper's couch in a charity ward,--"for a man to die who might have been
wise and was not, this i call a tragedy."




chapter xiv--hops and hoppers


so far has the divorcement of the worker from the soil proceeded, that
the farming districts, the civilised world over, are dependent upon the
cities for the gathering of the harvests.  then it is, when the land is
spilling its ripe wealth to waste, that the street folk, who have been
driven away from the soil, are called back to it again.  but in england
they return, not as prodigals, but as outcasts still, as vagrants and
pariahs, to be doubted and flouted by their country brethren, to sleep in
jails and casual wards, or under the hedges, and to live the lord knows
how.

it is estimated that kent alone requires eighty thousand of the street
people to pick her hops.  and out they come, obedient to the call, which
is the call of their bellies and of the lingering dregs of adventure-lust
still in them.  slum, stews, and ghetto pour them forth, and the
festering contents of slum, stews, and ghetto are undiminished.  yet they
overrun the country like an army of ghouls, and the country does not want
them.  they are out of place.  as they drag their squat, misshapen bodies
along the highways and byways, they resemble some vile spawn from
underground.  their very presence, the fact of their existence, is an
outrage to the fresh, bright sun and the green and growing things.  the
clean, upstanding trees cry shame upon them and their withered
crookedness, and their rottenness is a slimy desecration of the sweetness
and purity of nature.

is the picture overdrawn?  it all depends.  for one who sees and thinks
life in terms of shares and coupons, it is certainly overdrawn.  but for
one who sees and thinks life in terms of manhood and womanhood, it cannot
be overdrawn.  such hordes of beastly wretchedness and inarticulate
misery are no compensation for a millionaire brewer who lives in a west
end palace, sates himself with the sensuous delights of london's golden
theatres, hobnobs with lordlings and princelings, and is knighted by the
king.  wins his spurs--god forbid!  in old time the great blonde beasts
rode in the battle's van and won their spurs by cleaving men from pate to
chine.  and, after all, it is finer to kill a strong man with a clean-
slicing blow of singing steel than to make a beast of him, and of his
seed through the generations, by the artful and spidery manipulation of
industry and politics.

but to return to the hops.  here the divorcement from the soil is as
apparent as in every other agricultural line in england.  while the
manufacture of beer steadily increases, the growth of hops steadily
decreases.  in 1835 the acreage under hops was 71,327.  to-day it stands
at 48,024, a decrease of 3103 from the acreage of last year.

small as the acreage is this year, a poor summer and terrible storms
reduced the yield.  this misfortune is divided between the people who own
hops and the people who pick hops.  the owners perforce must put up with
less of the nicer things of life, the pickers with less grub, of which,
in the best of times, they never get enough.  for weary weeks headlines
like the following have appeared in the london papers.-

   tramps plentiful, but the hops are few and not yet ready.

then there have been numberless paragraphs like this:-

   from the neighbourhood of the hop fields comes news of a distressing
   nature.  the bright outburst of the last two days has sent many
   hundreds of hoppers into kent, who will have to wait till the fields
   are ready for them.  at dover the number of vagrants in the workhouse
   is treble the number there last year at this time, and in other towns
   the lateness of the season is responsible for a large increase in the
   number of casuals.

to cap their wretchedness, when at last the picking had begun, hops and
hoppers were well-nigh swept away by a frightful storm of wind, rain, and
hail.  the hops were stripped clean from the poles and pounded into the
earth, while the hoppers, seeking shelter from the stinging hail, were
close to drowning in their huts and camps on the low-lying ground.  their
condition after the storm was pitiable, their state of vagrancy more
pronounced than ever; for, poor crop that it was, its destruction had
taken away the chance of earning a few pennies, and nothing remained for
thousands of them but to "pad the hoof" back to london.

"we ayn't crossin'-sweepers," they said, turning away from the ground,
carpeted ankle-deep with hops.

those that remained grumbled savagely among the half-stripped poles at
the seven bushels for a shilling--a rate paid in good seasons when the
hops are in prime condition, and a rate likewise paid in bad seasons by
the growers because they cannot afford more.

i passed through teston and east and west farleigh shortly after the
storm, and listened to the grumbling of the hoppers and saw the hops
rotting on the ground.  at the hothouses of barham court, thirty thousand
panes of glass had been broken by the hail, while peaches, plums, pears,
apples, rhubarb, cabbages, mangolds, everything, had been pounded to
pieces and torn to shreds.

all of which was too bad for the owners, certainly; but at the worst, not
one of them, for one meal, would have to go short of food or drink.  yet
it was to them that the newspapers devoted columns of sympathy, their
pecuniary losses being detailed at harrowing length.  "mr. herbert l---
calculates his loss at 8000 pounds;" "mr. f---, of brewery fame, who
rents all the land in this parish, loses 10,000 pounds;" and "mr. l---,
the wateringbury brewer, brother to mr. herbert l---, is another heavy
loser."  as for the hoppers, they did not count.  yet i venture to assert
that the several almost-square meals lost by underfed william buggles,
and underfed mrs. buggles, and the underfed buggles kiddies, was a
greater tragedy than the 10,000 pounds lost by mr. f---.  and in
addition, underfed william buggles' tragedy might be multiplied by
thousands where mr. f---'s could not be multiplied by five.

to see how william buggles and his kind fared, i donned my seafaring togs
and started out to get a job.  with me was a young east london cobbler,
bert, who had yielded to the lure of adventure and joined me for the
trip.  acting on my advice, he had brought his "worst rags," and as we
hiked up the london road out of maidstone he was worrying greatly for
fear we had come too ill-dressed for the business.

nor was he to be blamed.  when we stopped in a tavern the publican eyed
us gingerly, nor did his demeanour brighten till we showed him the colour
of our cash.  the natives along the coast were all dubious; and "bean-
feasters" from london, dashing past in coaches, cheered and jeered and
shouted insulting things after us.  but before we were done with the
maidstone district my friend found that we were as well clad, if not
better, than the average hopper.  some of the bunches of rags we chanced
upon were marvellous.

"the tide is out," called a gypsy-looking woman to her mates, as we came
up a long row of bins into which the pickers were stripping the hops.

"do you twig?" bert whispered.  "she's on to you."

i twigged.  and it must be confessed the figure was an apt one.  when the
tide is out boats are left on the beach and do not sail, and a sailor,
when the tide is out, does not sail either.  my seafaring togs and my
presence in the hop field proclaimed that i was a seaman without a ship,
a man on the beach, and very like a craft at low water.

"can yer give us a job, governor?" bert asked the bailiff, a kindly faced
and elderly man who was very busy.

his "no" was decisively uttered; but bert clung on and followed him
about, and i followed after, pretty well all over the field.  whether our
persistency struck the bailiff as anxiety to work, or whether he was
affected by our hard-luck appearance and tale, neither bert nor i
succeeded in making out; but in the end he softened his heart and found
us the one unoccupied bin in the place--a bin deserted by two other men,
from what i could learn, because of inability to make living wages.

"no bad conduct, mind ye," warned the bailiff, as he left us at work in
the midst of the women.

it was saturday afternoon, and we knew quitting time would come early; so
we applied ourselves earnestly to the task, desiring to learn if we could
at least make our salt.  it was simple work, woman's work, in fact, and
not man's.  we sat on the edge of the bin, between the standing hops,
while a pole-puller supplied us with great fragrant branches.  in an
hour's time we became as expert as it is possible to become.  as soon as
the fingers became accustomed automatically to differentiate between hops
and leaves and to strip half-a-dozen blossoms at a time there was no more
to learn.

we worked nimbly, and as fast as the women themselves, though their bins
filled more rapidly because of their swarming children, each of which
picked with two hands almost as fast as we picked.

"don'tcher pick too clean, it's against the rules," one of the women
informed us; and we took the tip and were grateful.

as the afternoon wore along, we realised that living wages could not be
made--by men.  women could pick as much as men, and children could do
almost as well as women; so it was impossible for a man to compete with a
woman and half-a-dozen children.  for it is the woman and the half-dozen
children who count as a unit, and by their combined capacity determine
the unit's pay.

"i say, matey, i'm beastly hungry," said i to bert.  we had not had any
dinner.

"blimey, but i could eat the 'ops," he replied.

whereupon we both lamented our negligence in not rearing up a numerous
progeny to help us in this day of need.  and in such fashion we whiled
away the time and talked for the edification of our neighbours.  we quite
won the sympathy of the pole-puller, a young country yokel, who now and
again emptied a few picked blossoms into our bin, it being part of his
business to gather up the stray clusters torn off in the process of
pulling.

with him we discussed how much we could "sub," and were informed that
while we were being paid a shilling for seven bushels, we could only
"sub," or have advanced to us, a shilling for every twelve bushels.  which
is to say that the pay for five out of every twelve bushels was
withheld--a method of the grower to hold the hopper to his work whether
the crop runs good or bad, and especially if it runs bad.

after all, it was pleasant sitting there in the bright sunshine, the
golden pollen showering from our hands, the pungent aromatic odour of the
hops biting our nostrils, and the while remembering dimly the sounding
cities whence these people came.  poor street people!  poor gutter folk!
even they grow earth-hungry, and yearn vaguely for the soil from which
they have been driven, and for the free life in the open, and the wind
and rain and sun all undefiled by city smirches.  as the sea calls to the
sailor, so calls the land to them; and, deep down in their aborted and
decaying carcasses, they are stirred strangely by the peasant memories of
their forbears who lived before cities were.  and in incomprehensible
ways they are made glad by the earth smells and sights and sounds which
their blood has not forgotten though unremembered by them.

"no more 'ops, matey," bert complained.

it was five o'clock, and the pole-pullers had knocked off, so that
everything could be cleaned up, there being no work on sunday.  for an
hour we were forced idly to wait the coming of the measurers, our feet
tingling with the frost which came on the heels of the setting sun.  in
the adjoining bin, two women and half-a-dozen children had picked nine
bushels: so that the five bushels the measurers found in our bin
demonstrated that we had done equally well, for the half-dozen children
had ranged from nine to fourteen years of age.

five bushels!  we worked it out to eight-pence ha'penny, or seventeen
cents, for two men working three hours and a half.  fourpence farthing
apiece! a little over a penny an hour!  but we were allowed only to "sub"
fivepence of the total sum, though the tally-keeper, short of change,
gave us sixpence.  entreaty was in vain.  a hard-luck story could not
move him.  he proclaimed loudly that we had received a penny more than
our due, and went his way.

granting, for the sake of the argument, that we were what we represented
ourselves to be--namely, poor men and broke--then here was out position:
night was coming on; we had had no supper, much less dinner; and we
possessed sixpence between us.  i was hungry enough to eat three
sixpenn'orths of food, and so was bert.  one thing was patent.  by doing
16.3 per cent. justice to our stomachs, we would expend the sixpence, and
our stomachs would still be gnawing under 83.3 per cent. injustice.  being
broke again, we could sleep under a hedge, which was not so bad, though
the cold would sap an undue portion of what we had eaten.  but the morrow
was sunday, on which we could do no work, though our silly stomachs would
not knock off on that account.  here, then, was the problem: how to get
three meals on sunday, and two on monday (for we could not make another
"sub" till monday evening).

we knew that the casual wards were overcrowded; also, that if we begged
from farmer or villager, there was a large likelihood of our going to
jail for fourteen days.  what was to be done?  we looked at each other in
despair--

--not a bit of it.  we joyfully thanked god that we were not as other
men, especially hoppers, and went down the road to maidstone, jingling in
our pockets the half-crowns and florins we had brought from london.




chapter xv--the sea wife


you might not expect to find the sea wife in the heart of kent, but that
is where i found her, in a mean street, in the poor quarter of maidstone.
in her window she had no sign of lodgings to let, and persuasion was
necessary before she could bring herself to let me sleep in her front
room.  in the evening i descended to the semi-subterranean kitchen, and
talked with her and her old man, thomas mugridge by name.

and as i talked to them, all the subtleties and complexities of this
tremendous machine civilisation vanished away.  it seemed that i went
down through the skin and the flesh to the naked soul of it, and in
thomas mugridge and his old woman gripped hold of the essence of this
remarkable english breed.  i found there the spirit of the wanderlust
which has lured albion's sons across the zones; and i found there the
colossal unreckoning which has tricked the english into foolish
squabblings and preposterous fights, and the doggedness and stubbornness
which have brought them blindly through to empire and greatness; and
likewise i found that vast, incomprehensible patience which has enabled
the home population to endure under the burden of it all, to toil without
complaint through the weary years, and docilely to yield the best of its
sons to fight and colonise to the ends of the earth.

thomas mugridge was seventy-one years old and a little man.  it was
because he was little that he had not gone for a soldier.  he had
remained at home and worked.  his first recollections were connected with
work.  he knew nothing else but work.  he had worked all his days, and at
seventy-one he still worked.  each morning saw him up with the lark and
afield, a day labourer, for as such he had been born.  mrs. mugridge was
seventy-three.  from seven years of age she had worked in the fields,
doing a boy's work at first, and later a man's.  she still worked,
keeping the house shining, washing, boiling, and baking, and, with my
advent, cooking for me and shaming me by making my bed.  at the end of
threescore years and more of work they possessed nothing, had nothing to
look forward to save more work.  and they were contented.  they expected
nothing else, desired nothing else.

they lived simply.  their wants were few--a pint of beer at the end of
the day, sipped in the semi-subterranean kitchen, a weekly paper to pore
over for seven nights hand-running, and conversation as meditative and
vacant as the chewing of a heifer's cud.  from a wood engraving on the
wall a slender, angelic girl looked down upon them, and underneath was
the legend: "our future queen."  and from a highly coloured lithograph
alongside looked down a stout and elderly lady, with underneath: "our
queen--diamond jubilee."

"what you earn is sweetest," quoth mrs. mugridge, when i suggested that
it was about time they took a rest.

"no, an' we don't want help," said thomas mugridge, in reply to my
question as to whether the children lent them a hand.

"we'll work till we dry up and blow away, mother an' me," he added; and
mrs. mugridge nodded her head in vigorous indorsement.

fifteen children she had borne, and all were away and gone, or dead.  the
"baby," however, lived in maidstone, and she was twenty-seven.  when the
children married they had their hands full with their own families and
troubles, like their fathers and mothers before them.

where were the children?  ah, where were they not?  lizzie was in
australia; mary was in buenos ayres; poll was in new york; joe had died
in india--and so they called them up, the living and the dead, soldier
and sailor, and colonist's wife, for the traveller's sake who sat in
their kitchen.

they passed me a photograph.  a trim young fellow, in soldier's garb
looked out at me.

"and which son is this?" i asked.

they laughed a hearty chorus.  son!  nay, grandson, just back from indian
service and a soldier-trumpeter to the king.  his brother was in the same
regiment with him.  and so it ran, sons and daughters, and grand sons and
daughters, world-wanderers and empire-builders, all of them, while the
old folks stayed at home and worked at building empire too.

   "there dwells a wife by the northern gate,
      and a wealthy wife is she;
   she breeds a breed o' rovin' men
      and casts them over sea.

   "and some are drowned in deep water,
      and some in sight of shore;
   and word goes back to the weary wife,
      and ever she sends more."

but the sea wife's child-bearing is about done.  the stock is running
out, and the planet is filling up.  the wives of her sons may carry on
the breed, but her work is past.  the erstwhile men of england are now
the men of australia, of africa, of america.  england has sent forth "the
best she breeds" for so long, and has destroyed those that remained so
fiercely, that little remains for her to do but to sit down through the
long nights and gaze at royalty on the wall.

the true british merchant seaman has passed away.  the merchant service
is no longer a recruiting ground for such sea dogs as fought with nelson
at trafalgar and the nile.  foreigners largely man the merchant ships,
though englishmen still continue to officer them and to prefer foreigners
for'ard.  in south africa the colonial teaches the islander how to shoot,
and the officers muddle and blunder; while at home the street people play
hysterically at mafficking, and the war office lowers the stature for
enlistment.

it could not be otherwise.  the most complacent britisher cannot hope to
draw off the life-blood, and underfeed, and keep it up forever.  the
average mrs. thomas mugridge has been driven into the city, and she is
not breeding very much of anything save an anaemic and sickly progeny
which cannot find enough to eat.  the strength of the english-speaking
race to-day is not in the tight little island, but in the new world
overseas, where are the sons and daughters of mrs. thomas mugridge.  the
sea wife by the northern gate has just about done her work in the world,
though she does not realize it.  she must sit down and rest her tired
loins for a space; and if the casual ward and the workhouse do not await
her, it is because of the sons and daughters she has reared up against
the day of her feebleness and decay.




chapter xvi--property versus person


in a civilisation frankly materialistic and based upon property, not
soul, it is inevitable that property shall be exalted over soul, that
crimes against property shall be considered far more serious than crimes
against the person.  to pound one's wife to a jelly and break a few of
her ribs is a trivial offence compared with sleeping out under the naked
stars because one has not the price of a doss.  the lad who steals a few
pears from a wealthy railway corporation is a greater menace to society
than the young brute who commits an unprovoked assault upon an old man
over seventy years of age.  while the young girl who takes a lodging
under the pretence that she has work commits so dangerous an offence,
that, were she not severely punished, she and her kind might bring the
whole fabric of property clattering to the ground.  had she unholily
tramped piccadilly and the strand after midnight, the police would not
have interfered with her, and she would have been able to pay for her
lodging.

the following illustrative cases are culled from the police-court reports
for a single week:-

   widnes police court.  before aldermen gossage and neil.  thomas lynch,
   charged with being drunk and disorderly and with assaulting a
   constable.  defendant rescued a woman from custody, kicked the

   defendant struck the complainant a violent blow in the face, knocking
   him down, and then kicked him on the side of the head.  he was
   rendered unconscious, and he remained under medical treatment for a
   fortnight.  fined 21s.

   perth sheriff court.  before sheriff sym.  david mitchell, charged
   with poaching.  there were two previous convictions, the last being

   mitchell, who was sixty-two years of age, and who offered no
   resistance to the gamekeeper.  four months.

   dundee sheriff court.  before hon. sheriff-substitute r. c. walker.

   worksop petty sessions.  before messrs. f. j. s. foljambe, r. eddison,
   and s. smith.  john priestley, charged with assaulting the rev. leslie
   graham.  defendant, who was drunk, was wheeling a perambulator and
   pushed it in front of a lorry, with the result that the perambulator
   was overturned and the baby in it thrown out.  the lorry passed over
   the perambulator, but the baby was uninjured.  defendant then attacked
   the driver of the lorry, and afterwards assaulted the complainant, who
   remonstrated with him upon his conduct.  in consequence of the
   injuries defendant inflicted, complainant had to consult a doctor.
   fined 40s. and costs.

   charged with doing grievous bodily harm to a constable.  prisoner had
   been kicking his wife, and also assaulting another woman who protested
   against his brutality.  the constable tried to persuade him to go
   inside his house, but prisoner suddenly turned upon him, knocking him
   down by a blow on the face, kicking him as he lay on the ground, and
   attempting to strangle him.  finally the prisoner deliberately kicked
   the officer in a dangerous part, inflicting an injury which will keep
   him off duty for a long time to come.  six weeks.

   lambeth police court, london.  before mr. hopkins.  "baby" stuart,

   of atwell road.  prisoner took apartments at her house on the
   representation that she was employed at the crown theatre.  after
   prisoner had been in her house two or three days, mrs. brasier made
   inquiries, and, finding the girl's story untrue, gave her into
   custody.  prisoner told the magistrate that she would have worked had
   she not had such bad health.  six weeks' hard labour.




chapter xvii--inefficiency


i stopped a moment to listen to an argument on the mile end waste.  it
was night-time, and they were all workmen of the better class.  they had
surrounded one of their number, a pleasant-faced man of thirty, and were
giving it to him rather heatedly.

"but 'ow about this 'ere cheap immigration?" one of them demanded.  "the
jews of whitechapel, say, a-cutting our throats right along?"

"you can't blame them," was the answer.  "they're just like us, and
they've got to live.  don't blame the man who offers to work cheaper than
you and gets your job."

"but 'ow about the wife an' kiddies?" his interlocutor demanded.

"there you are," came the answer.  "how about the wife and kiddies of the
man who works cheaper than you and gets your job?  eh?  how about his
wife and kiddies?  he's more interested in them than in yours, and he
can't see them starve.  so he cuts the price of labour and out you go.
but you mustn't blame him, poor devil.  he can't help it.  wages always
come down when two men are after the same job.  that's the fault of
competition, not of the man who cuts the price."

"but wyges don't come down where there's a union," the objection was
made.

"and there you are again, right on the head.  the union cheeks
competition among the labourers, but makes it harder where there are no
unions.  there's where your cheap labour of whitechapel comes in.  they're
unskilled, and have no unions, and cut each other's throats, and ours in
the bargain, if we don't belong to a strong union."

without going further into the argument, this man on the mile end waste
pointed the moral that when two men were after the one job wages were
bound to fall.  had he gone deeper into the matter, he would have found
that even the union, say twenty thousand strong, could not hold up wages
if twenty thousand idle men were trying to displace the union men.  this
is admirably instanced, just now, by the return and disbandment of the
soldiers from south africa.  they find themselves, by tens of thousands,
in desperate straits in the army of the unemployed.  there is a general
decline in wages throughout the land, which, giving rise to labour
disputes and strikes, is taken advantage of by the unemployed, who gladly
pick up the tools thrown down by the strikers.

sweating, starvation wages, armies of unemployed, and great numbers of
the homeless and shelterless are inevitable when there are more men to do
work than there is work for men to do.  the men and women i have met upon
the streets, and in the spikes and pegs, are not there because as a mode
of life it may be considered a "soft snap."  i have sufficiently outlined
the hardships they undergo to demonstrate that their existence is
anything but "soft."

it is a matter of sober calculation, here in england, that it is softer
to work for twenty shillings a week, and have regular food, and a bed at
night, than it is to walk the streets.  the man who walks the streets
suffers more, and works harder, for far less return.  i have depicted the
nights they spend, and how, driven in by physical exhaustion, they go to
the casual ward for a "rest up."  nor is the casual ward a soft snap.  to
pick four pounds of oakum, break twelve hundredweight of stones, or
perform the most revolting tasks, in return for the miserable food and
shelter they receive, is an unqualified extravagance on the part of the
men who are guilty of it.  on the part of the authorities it is sheer
robbery.  they give the men far less for their labour than do the
capitalistic employers.  the wage for the same amount of labour,
performed for a private employer, would buy them better beds, better
food, more good cheer, and, above all, greater freedom.

as i say, it is an extravagance for a man to patronise a casual ward.  and
that they know it themselves is shown by the way these men shun it till
driven in by physical exhaustion.  then why do they do it?  not because
they are discouraged workers.  the very opposite is true; they are
discouraged vagabonds.  in the united states the tramp is almost
invariably a discouraged worker.  he finds tramping a softer mode of life
than working.  but this is not true in england.  here the powers that be
do their utmost to discourage the tramp and vagabond, and he is, in all
truth, a mightily discouraged creature.  he knows that two shillings a
day, which is only fifty cents, will buy him three fair meals, a bed at
night, and leave him a couple of pennies for pocket money.  he would
rather work for those two shillings than for the charity of the casual
ward; for he knows that he would not have to work so hard, and that he
would not be so abominably treated.  he does not do so, however, because
there are more men to do work than there is work for men to do.

when there are more men than there is work to be done, a sifting-out
process must obtain.  in every branch of industry the less efficient are
crowded out.  being crowded out because of inefficiency, they cannot go
up, but must descend, and continue to descend, until they reach their
proper level, a place in the industrial fabric where they are efficient.
it follows, therefore, and it is inexorable, that the least efficient
must descend to the very bottom, which is the shambles wherein they
perish miserably.

a glance at the confirmed inefficients at the bottom demonstrates that
they are, as a rule, mental, physical, and moral wrecks.  the exceptions
to the rule are the late arrivals, who are merely very inefficient, and
upon whom the wrecking process is just beginning to operate.  all the
forces here, it must be remembered, are destructive.  the good body
(which is there because its brain is not quick and capable) is speedily
wrenched and twisted out of shape; the clean mind (which is there because
of its weak body) is speedily fouled and contaminated.

the mortality is excessive, but, even then, they die far too lingering
deaths.

here, then, we have the construction of the abyss and the shambles.
throughout the whole industrial fabric a constant elimination is going
on.  the inefficient are weeded out and flung downward.  various things
constitute inefficiency.  the engineer who is irregular or irresponsible
will sink down until he finds his place, say as a casual labourer, an
occupation irregular in its very nature and in which there is little or
no responsibility.  those who are slow and clumsy, who suffer from
weakness of body or mind, or who lack nervous, mental, and physical
stamina, must sink down, sometimes rapidly, sometimes step by step, to
the bottom.  accident, by disabling an efficient worker, will make him
inefficient, and down he must go.  and the worker who becomes aged, with
failing energy and numbing brain, must begin the frightful descent which
knows no stopping-place short of the bottom and death.

in this last instance, the statistics of london tell a terrible tale.  the
population of london is one-seventh of the total population of the united
kingdom, and in london, year in and year out, one adult in every four
dies on public charity, either in the workhouse, the hospital, or the
asylum.  when the fact that the well-to-do do not end thus is taken into
consideration, it becomes manifest that it is the fate of at least one in
every three adult workers to die on public charity.

as an illustration of how a good worker may suddenly become inefficient,
and what then happens to him, i am tempted to give the case of m'garry, a
man thirty-two years of age, and an inmate of the workhouse.  the
extracts are quoted from the annual report of the trade union.

   i worked at sullivan's place in widnes, better known as the british
   alkali chemical works.  i was working in a shed, and i had to cross
   the yard.  it was ten o'clock at night, and there was no light about.
   while crossing the yard i felt something take hold of my leg and screw
   it off.  i became unconscious; i didn't know what became of me for a
   day or two.  on the following sunday night i came to my senses, and
   found myself in the hospital.  i asked the nurse what was to do with
   my legs, and she told me both legs were off.

   there was a stationary crank in the yard, let into the ground; the
   hole was 18 inches long, 15 inches deep, and 15 inches wide.  the
   crank revolved in the hole three revolutions a minute.  there was no
   fence or covering over the hole.  since my accident they have stopped
   it altogether, and have covered the hole up with a piece of sheet
   iron. . . . they gave me 25 pounds.  they didn't reckon that as
   compensation; they said it was only for charity's sake.  out of that i
   paid 9 pounds for a machine by which to wheel myself about.

   i was labouring at the time i got my legs off.  i got twenty-four
   shillings a week, rather better pay than the other men, because i used
   to take shifts.  when there was heavy work to be done i used to be
   picked out to do it.  mr. manton, the manager, visited me at the
   hospital several times.  when i was getting better, i asked him if he
   would be able to find me a job.  he told me not to trouble myself, as
   the firm was not cold-hearted.  i would be right enough in any case .
   . . mr. manton stopped coming to see me; and the last time, he said he
   thought of asking the directors to give me a fifty-pound note, so i
   could go home to my friends in ireland.

poor m'garry!  he received rather better pay than the other men because
he was ambitious and took shifts, and when heavy work was to be done he
was the man picked out to do it.  and then the thing happened, and he
went into the workhouse.  the alternative to the workhouse is to go home
to ireland and burden his friends for the rest of his life.  comment is
superfluous.

it must be understood that efficiency is not determined by the workers
themselves, but is determined by the demand for labour.  if three men
seek one position, the most efficient man will get it.  the other two, no
matter how capable they may be, will none the less be inefficients.  if
germany, japan, and the united states should capture the entire world
market for iron, coal, and textiles, at once the english workers would be
thrown idle by hundreds of thousands.  some would emigrate, but the rest
would rush their labour into the remaining industries.  a general shaking
up of the workers from top to bottom would result; and when equilibrium
had been restored, the number of the inefficients at the bottom of the
abyss would have been increased by hundreds of thousands.  on the other
hand, conditions remaining constant and all the workers doubling their
efficiency, there would still be as many inefficients, though each
inefficient were twice as capable as he had been and more capable than
many of the efficients had previously been.

when there are more men to work than there is work for men to do, just as
many men as are in excess of work will be inefficients, and as
inefficients they are doomed to lingering and painful destruction.  it
shall be the aim of future chapters to show, by their work and manner of
living, not only how the inefficients are weeded out and destroyed, but
to show how inefficients are being constantly and wantonly created by the
forces of industrial society as it exists to-day.




chapter xviii--wages


when i learned that in lesser london there were 1,292,737 people who
received twenty-one shillings or less a week per family, i became
interested as to how the wages could best be spent in order to maintain
the physical efficiency of such families.  families of six, seven, eight
or ten being beyond consideration, i have based the following table upon
a family of five--a father, mother, and three children; while i have made
twenty-one shillings equivalent to $5.25, though actually, twenty-one
shillings are equivalent to about $5.11.

rent       $1.50    or 6/0
bread       1.00    " 4/0
meat        o.87.5  " 3/6
vegetables  o.62.5  " 2/6
coals       0.25    " 1/0
tea         0.18    " 0/9
oil         0.16    " 0/8
sugar       0.18    " 0/9
milk        0.12    " 0/6
soap        0.08    " 0/4
butter      0.20    " 0/10
firewood    0.08    " 0/4
total      $5.25     21/2

an analysis of one item alone will show how little room there is for
waste.  _bread_, $1: for a family of five, for seven days, one dollar's
worth of bread will give each a daily ration of 2.8 cents; and if they
eat three meals a day, each may consume per meal 9.5 mills' worth of
bread, a little less than one halfpennyworth.  now bread is the heaviest
item.  they will get less of meat per mouth each meal, and still less of
vegetates; while the smaller items become too microscopic for
consideration.  on the other hand, these food articles are all bought at
small retail, the most expensive and wasteful method of purchasing.

while the table given above will permit no extravagance, no overloading
of stomachs, it will be noticed that there is no surplus.  the whole
guinea is spent for food and rent.  there is no pocket-money left over.
does the man buy a glass of beer, the family must eat that much less; and
in so far as it eats less, just that far will it impair its physical
efficiency.  the members of this family cannot ride in busses or trams,
cannot write letters, take outings, go to a "tu'penny gaff" for cheap
vaudeville, join social or benefit clubs, nor can they buy sweetmeats,
tobacco, books, or newspapers.

and further, should one child (and there are three) require a pair of
shoes, the family must strike meat for a week from its bill of fare.  and
since there are five pairs of feet requiring shoes, and five heads
requiring hats, and five bodies requiring clothes, and since there are
laws regulating indecency, the family must constantly impair its physical
efficiency in order to keep warm and out of jail.  for notice, when rent,
coals, oil, soap, and firewood are extracted from the weekly income,
there remains a daily allowance for food of 4.5d. to each person; and
that 4.5d. cannot be lessened by buying clothes without impairing the
physical efficiency.

all of which is hard enough.  but the thing happens; the husband and
father breaks his leg or his neck.  no 4.5d. a day per mouth for food is
coming in; no halfpennyworth of bread per meal; and, at the end of the
week, no six shillings for rent.  so out they must go, to the streets or
the workhouse, or to a miserable den, somewhere, in which the mother will
desperately endeavour to hold the family together on the ten shillings
she may possibly be able to earn.

while in london there are 1,292,737 people who receive twenty-one
shillings or less a week per family, it must be remembered that we have
investigated a family of five living on a twenty-one shilling basis.
there are larger families, there are many families that live on less than
twenty-one shillings, and there is much irregular employment.  the
question naturally arises, how do _they_ live?  the answer is that they
do not live.  they do not know what life is.  they drag out a
subterbestial existence until mercifully released by death.

before descending to the fouler depths, let the case of the telephone
girls be cited.  here are clean, fresh english maids, for whom a higher
standard of living than that of the beasts is absolutely necessary.
otherwise they cannot remain clean, fresh english maids.  on entering the
service, a telephone girl receives a weekly wage of eleven shillings.  if
she be quick and clever, she may, at the end of five years, attain a
minimum wage of one pound.  recently a table of such a girl's weekly
expenditure was furnished to lord londonderry.  here it is:-

                      s.   d.
rent, fire, and light 7    6
board at home         3    6
board at the office   4    6
street car fare       1    6
laundry               1    0
total                18    0

this leaves nothing for clothes, recreation, or sickness.  and yet many
of the girls are receiving, not eighteen shillings, but eleven shillings,
twelve shillings, and fourteen shillings per week.  they must have
clothes and recreation, and--

   man to man so oft unjust,
   is always so to woman.

at the trades union congress now being held in london, the gasworkers'
union moved that instructions be given the parliamentary committee to
introduce a bill to prohibit the employment of children under fifteen
years of age.  mr. shackleton, member of parliament and a representative
of the northern counties weavers, opposed the resolution on behalf of the
textile workers, who, he said, could not dispense with the earnings of
their children and live on the scale of wages which obtained.  the
representatives of 514,000 workers voted against the resolution, while
the representatives of 535,000 workers voted in favour of it.  when
514,000 workers oppose a resolution prohibiting child-labour under
fifteen, it is evident that a less-than-living wage is being paid to an
immense number of the adult workers of the country.

i have spoken with women in whitechapel who receive right along less than
one shilling for a twelve-hour day in the coat-making sweat shops; and
with women trousers finishers who receive an average princely and weekly
wage of three to four shillings.

a case recently cropped up of men, in the employ of a wealthy business
house, receiving their board and six shillings per week for six working
days of sixteen hours each.  the sandwich men get fourteenpence per day
and find themselves.  the average weekly earnings of the hawkers and
costermongers are not more than ten to twelve shillings.  the average of
all common labourers, outside the dockers, is less than sixteen shillings
per week, while the dockers average from eight to nine shillings.  these
figures are taken from a royal commission report and are authentic.

conceive of an old woman, broken and dying, supporting herself and four
children, and paying three shillings per week rent, by making match boxes
at 2.25d. per gross.  twelve dozen boxes for 2.25d., and, in addition,
finding her own paste and thread!  she never knew a day off, either for
sickness, rest, or recreation.  each day and every day, sundays as well,
she toiled fourteen hours.  her day's stint was seven gross, for which
she received 1s. 3.75d.  in the week of ninety-eight hours' work, she
made 7066 match boxes, and earned 4s. 10.25d., less per paste and thread.

last year, mr. thomas holmes, a police-court missionary of note, after
writing about the condition of the women workers, received the following
letter, dated april 18, 1901:-

   sir,--pardon the liberty i am taking, but, having read what you said
   about poor women working fourteen hours a day for ten shillings per
   week, i beg to state my case.  i am a tie-maker, who, after working
   all the week, cannot earn more than five shillings, and i have a poor
   afflicted husband to keep who hasn't earned a penny for more than ten
   years.

imagine a woman, capable of writing such a clear, sensible, grammatical
letter, supporting her husband and self on five shillings per week!  mr.
holmes visited her.  he had to squeeze to get into the room.  there lay
her sick husband; there she worked all day long; there she cooked, ate,
washed, and slept; and there her husband and she performed all the
functions of living and dying.  there was no space for the missionary to
sit down, save on the bed, which was partially covered with ties and
silk.  the sick man's lungs were in the last stages of decay.  he coughed
and expectorated constantly, the woman ceasing from her work to assist
him in his paroxysms.  the silken fluff from the ties was not good for
his sickness; nor was his sickness good for the ties, and the handlers
and wearers of the ties yet to come.

another case mr. holmes visited was that of a young girl, twelve years of
age, charged in the police court with stealing food.  he found her the
deputy mother of a boy of nine, a crippled boy of seven, and a younger
child.  her mother was a widow and a blouse-maker.  she paid five
shillings a week rent.  here are the last items in her housekeeping
account: tea. 0.5d.; sugar, 0.5d.; bread, 0.25d.; margarine, 1d.; oil,
1.5d.; and firewood, 1d.  good housewives of the soft and tender folk,
imagine yourselves marketing and keeping house on such a scale, setting a
table for five, and keeping an eye on your deputy mother of twelve to see
that she did not steal food for her little brothers and sisters, the
while you stitched, stitched, stitched at a nightmare line of blouses,
which stretched away into the gloom and down to the pauper's coffin a-
yawn for you.




chapter xix--the ghetto


   is it well that while we range with science, glorying in the time,
   city children soak and blacken soul and sense in city slime?
   there among the gloomy alleys progress halts on palsied feet;
   crime and hunger cast out maidens by the thousand on the street;

   there the master scrimps his haggard seamstress of her daily bread;
   there the single sordid attic holds the living and the dead;
   there the smouldering fire of fever creeps across the rotted floor,
   and the crowded couch of incest, in the warrens of the poor.

at one time the nations of europe confined the undesirable jews in city
ghettos.  but to-day the dominant economic class, by less arbitrary but
none the less rigorous methods, has confined the undesirable yet
necessary workers into ghettos of remarkable meanness and vastness.  east
london is such a ghetto, where the rich and the powerful do not dwell,
and the traveller cometh not, and where two million workers swarm,
procreate, and die.

it must not be supposed that all the workers of london are crowded into
the east end, but the tide is setting strongly in that direction.  the
poor quarters of the city proper are constantly being destroyed, and the
main stream of the unhoused is toward the east.  in the last twelve
years, one district, "london over the border," as it is called, which
lies well beyond aldgate, whitechapel, and mile end, has increased
260,000, or over sixty per cent.  the churches in this district, by the
way, can seat but one in every thirty-seven of the added population.

the city of dreadful monotony, the east end is often called, especially
by well-fed, optimistic sightseers, who look over the surface of things
and are merely shocked by the intolerable sameness and meanness of it
all.  if the east end is worthy of no worse title than the city of
dreadful monotony, and if working people are unworthy of variety and
beauty and surprise, it would not be such a bad place in which to live.
but the east end does merit a worse title.  it should be called the city
of degradation.

while it is not a city of slums, as some people imagine, it may well be
said to be one gigantic slum.  from the standpoint of simple decency and
clean manhood and womanhood, any mean street, of all its mean streets, is
a slum.  where sights and sounds abound which neither you nor i would
care to have our children see and hear is a place where no man's children
should live, and see, and hear.  where you and i would not care to have
our wives pass their lives is a place where no other man's wife should
have to pass her life.  for here, in the east end, the obscenities and
brute vulgarities of life are rampant.  there is no privacy.  the bad
corrupts the good, and all fester together.  innocent childhood is sweet
and beautiful: but in east london innocence is a fleeting thing, and you
must catch them before they crawl out of the cradle, or you will find the
very babes as unholily wise as you.

the application of the golden rule determines that east london is an
unfit place in which to live.  where you would not have your own babe
live, and develop, and gather to itself knowledge of life and the things
of life, is not a fit place for the babes of other men to live, and
develop, and gather to themselves knowledge of life and the things of
life.  it is a simple thing, this golden rule, and all that is required.
political economy and the survival of the fittest can go hang if they say
otherwise.  what is not good enough for you is not good enough for other
men, and there's no more to be said.

there are 300,000 people in london, divided into families, that live in
one-room tenements.  far, far more live in two and three rooms and are as
badly crowded, regardless of sex, as those that live in one room.  the
law demands 400 cubic feet of space for each person.  in army barracks
each soldier is allowed 600 cubic feet.  professor huxley, at one time
himself a medical officer in east london, always held that each person
should have 800 cubic feet of space, and that it should be well
ventilated with pure air.  yet in london there are 900,000 people living
in less than the 400 cubic feet prescribed by the law.

mr. charles booth, who engaged in a systematic work of years in charting
and classifying the toiling city population, estimates that there are
1,800,000 people in london who are _poor_ and _very poor_.  it is of
interest to mark what he terms poor.  by _poor_ he means families which
have a total weekly income of from eighteen to twenty-one shillings.  the
_very poor_ fall greatly below this standard.

the workers, as a class, are being more and more segregated by their
economic masters; and this process, with its jamming and overcrowding,
tends not so much toward immorality as unmorality.  here is an extract
from a recent meeting of the london county council, terse and bald, but
with a wealth of horror to be read between the lines:-

   mr. bruce asked the chairman of the public health committee whether
   his attention had been called to a number of cases of serious
   overcrowding in the east end.  in st. georges-in-the-east a man and
   his wife and their family of eight occupied one small room.  this
   family consisted of five daughters, aged twenty, seventeen, eight,
   four, and an infant; and three sons, aged fifteen, thirteen, and
   twelve.  in whitechapel a man and his wife and their three daughters,
   aged sixteen, eight, and four, and two sons, aged ten and twelve
   years, occupied a smaller room.  in bethnal green a man and his wife,
   with four sons, aged twenty-three, twenty-one, nineteen, and sixteen,
   and two daughters, aged fourteen and seven, were also found in one
   room.  he asked whether it was not the duty of the various local
   authorities to prevent such serious overcrowding.

but with 900,000 people actually living under illegal conditions, the
authorities have their hands full.  when the overcrowded folk are ejected
they stray off into some other hole; and, as they move their belongings
by night, on hand-barrows (one hand-barrow accommodating the entire
household goods and the sleeping children), it is next to impossible to
keep track of them.  if the public health act of 1891 were suddenly and
completely enforced, 900,000 people would receive notice to clear out of
their houses and go on to the streets, and 500,000 rooms would have to be
built before they were all legally housed again.

the mean streets merely look mean from the outside, but inside the walls
are to be found squalor, misery, and tragedy.  while the following
tragedy may be revolting to read, it must not be forgotten that the
existence of it is far more revolting.

in devonshire place, lisson grove, a short while back died an old woman
of seventy-five years of age.  at the inquest the coroner's officer
stated that "all he found in the room was a lot of old rags covered with
vermin.  he had got himself smothered with the vermin.  the room was in a
shocking condition, and he had never seen anything like it.  everything
was absolutely covered with vermin."

the doctor said: "he found deceased lying across the fender on her back.
she had one garment and her stockings on.  the body was quite alive with
vermin, and all the clothes in the room were absolutely grey with
insects.  deceased was very badly nourished and was very emaciated.  she
had extensive sores on her legs, and her stockings were adherent to those
sores.  the sores were the result of vermin."

a man present at the inquest wrote: "i had the evil fortune to see the
body of the unfortunate woman as it lay in the mortuary; and even now the
memory of that gruesome sight makes me shudder.  there she lay in the
mortuary shell, so starved and emaciated that she was a mere bundle of
skin and bones.  her hair, which was matted with filth, was simply a nest
of vermin.  over her bony chest leaped and rolled hundreds, thousands,
myriads of vermin!"

if it is not good for your mother and my mother so to die, then it is not
good for this woman, whosoever's mother she might be, so to die.

bishop wilkinson, who has lived in zululand, recently said, "no human of
an african village would allow such a promiscuous mixing of young men and
women, boys and girls."  he had reference to the children of the
overcrowded folk, who at five have nothing to learn and much to unlearn
which they will never unlearn.

it is notorious that here in the ghetto the houses of the poor are
greater profit earners than the mansions of the rich.  not only does the
poor worker have to live like a beast, but he pays proportionately more
for it than does the rich man for his spacious comfort.  a class of house-
sweaters has been made possible by the competition of the poor for
houses.  there are more people than there is room, and numbers are in the
workhouse because they cannot find shelter elsewhere.  not only are
houses let, but they are sublet, and sub-sublet down to the very rooms.

"a part of a room to let."  this notice was posted a short while ago in a
window not five minutes' walk from st. james's hall.  the rev. hugh price
hughes is authority for the statement that beds are let on the
three-relay system--that is, three tenants to a bed, each occupying it
eight hours, so that it never grows cold; while the floor space
underneath the bed is likewise let on the three-relay system.  health
officers are not at all unused to finding such cases as the following: in
one room having a cubic capacity of 1000 feet, three adult females in the
bed, and two adult females under the bed; and in one room of 1650 cubic
feet, one adult male and two children in the bed, and two adult females
under the bed.

here is a typical example of a room on the more respectable two-relay
system.  it is occupied in the daytime by a young woman employed all
night in a hotel.  at seven o'clock in the evening she vacates the room,
and a bricklayer's labourer comes in.  at seven in the morning he
vacates, and goes to his work, at which time she returns from hers.

the rev. w. n. davies, rector of spitalfields, took a census of some of
the alleys in his parish.  he says:-

   in one alley there are ten houses--fifty-one rooms, nearly all about 8
   feet by 9 feet--and 254 people.  in six instances only do 2 people
   occupy one room; and in others the number varied from 3 to 9.  in
   another court with six houses and twenty-two rooms were 84
   people--again 6, 7, 8, and 9 being the number living in one room, in
   several instances.  in one house with eight rooms are 45 people--one
   room containing 9 persons, one 8, two 7, and another 6.

this ghetto crowding is not through inclination, but compulsion.  nearly
fifty per cent. of the workers pay from one-fourth to one-half of their
earnings for rent.  the average rent in the larger part of the east end
is from four to six shillings per week for one room, while skilled
mechanics, earning thirty-five shillings per week, are forced to part
with fifteen shillings of it for two or three pokey little dens, in which
they strive desperately to obtain some semblance of home life.  and rents
are going up all the time.  in one street in stepney the increase in only
two years has been from thirteen to eighteen shillings; in another street
from eleven to sixteen shillings; and in another street, from eleven to
fifteen shillings; while in whitechapel, two-room houses that recently
rented for ten shillings are now costing twenty-one shillings.  east,
west, north, and south the rents are going up.  when land is worth from
20,000 to 30,000 pounds an acre, some one must pay the landlord.

mr. w. c. steadman, in the house of commons, in a speech concerning his
constituency in stepney, related the following:-

   this morning, not a hundred yards from where i am myself living, a
   widow stopped me.  she has six children to support, and the rent of
   her house was fourteen shillings per week.  she gets her living by
   letting the house to lodgers and doing a day's washing or charring.
   that woman, with tears in her eyes, told me that the landlord had
   increased the rent from fourteen shillings to eighteen shillings.  what
   could the woman do?  there is no accommodation in stepney.  every
   place is taken up and overcrowded.

class supremacy can rest only on class degradation; and when the workers
are segregated in the ghetto, they cannot escape the consequent
degradation.  a short and stunted people is created--a breed strikingly
differentiated from their masters' breed, a pavement folk, as it were
lacking stamina and strength.  the men become caricatures of what
physical men ought to be, and their women and children are pale and
anaemic, with eyes ringed darkly, who stoop and slouch, and are early
twisted out of all shapeliness and beauty.

to make matters worse, the men of the ghetto are the men who are left--a
deteriorated stock, left to undergo still further deterioration.  for a
hundred and fifty years, at least, they have been drained of their best.
the strong men, the men of pluck, initiative, and ambition, have been
faring forth to the fresher and freer portions of the globe, to make new
lands and nations.  those who are lacking, the weak of heart and head and
hand, as well as the rotten and hopeless, have remained to carry on the
breed.  and year by year, in turn, the best they breed are taken from
them.  wherever a man of vigour and stature manages to grow up, he is
haled forthwith into the army.  a soldier, as bernard shaw has said,
"ostensibly a heroic and patriotic defender of his country, is really an
unfortunate man driven by destitution to offer himself as food for powder
for the sake of regular rations, shelter, and clothing."

this constant selection of the best from the workers has impoverished
those who are left, a sadly degraded remainder, for the great part,
which, in the ghetto, sinks to the deepest depths.  the wine of life has
been drawn off to spill itself in blood and progeny over the rest of the
earth.  those that remain are the lees, and they are segregated and
steeped in themselves.  they become indecent and bestial.  when they
kill, they kill with their hands, and then stupidly surrender themselves
to the executioners.  there is no splendid audacity about their
transgressions.  they gouge a mate with a dull knife, or beat his head in
with an iron pot, and then sit down and wait for the police.  wife-beating
is the masculine prerogative of matrimony.  they wear remarkable boots of
brass and iron, and when they have polished off the mother of their
children with a black eye or so, they knock her down and proceed to
trample her very much as a western stallion tramples a rattlesnake.

a woman of the lower ghetto classes is as much the slave of her husband
as is the indian squaw.  and i, for one, were i a woman and had but the
two choices, should prefer being a squaw.  the men are economically
dependent on their masters, and the women are economically dependent on
the men.  the result is, the woman gets the beating the man should give
his master, and she can do nothing.  there are the kiddies, and he is the
bread-winner, and she dare not send him to jail and leave herself and
children to starve.  evidence to convict can rarely be obtained when such
cases come into the courts; as a rule, the trampled wife and mother is
weeping and hysterically beseeching the magistrate to let her husband off
for the kiddies' sakes.

the wives become screaming harridans or, broken-spirited and doglike,
lose what little decency and self-respect they have remaining over from
their maiden days, and all sink together, unheeding, in their degradation
and dirt.

sometimes i become afraid of my own generalizations upon the massed
misery of this ghetto life, and feel that my impressions are exaggerated,
that i am too close to the picture and lack perspective.  at such moments
i find it well to turn to the testimony of other men to prove to myself
that i am not becoming over-wrought and addle-pated.  frederick harrison
has always struck me as being a level-headed, well-controlled man, and he
says:-

   to me, at least, it would be enough to condemn modern society as
   hardly an advance on slavery or serfdom, if the permanent condition of
   industry were to be that which we behold, that ninety per cent. of the
   actual producers of wealth have no home that they can call their own
   beyond the end of the week; have no bit of soil, or so much as a room
   that belongs to them; have nothing of value of any kind, except as
   much old furniture as will go into a cart; have the precarious chance
   of weekly wages, which barely suffice to keep them in health; are
   housed, for the most part, in places that no man thinks fit for his
   horse; are separated by so narrow a margin from destitution that a
   month of bad trade, sickness, or unexpected loss brings them face to
   face with hunger and pauperism . . . but below this normal state of
   the average workman in town and country, there is found the great band
   of destitute outcasts--the camp followers of the army of industry--at
   least one-tenth the whole proletarian population, whose normal
   condition is one of sickening wretchedness.  if this is to be the
   permanent arrangement of modern society, civilization must be held to
   bring a curse on the great majority of mankind.

ninety per cent.!  the figures are appalling, yet mr. stopford brooke,
after drawing a frightful london picture, finds himself compelled to
multiply it by half a million.  here it is:-

   i often used to meet, when i was curate at kensington, families
   drifting into london along the hammersmith road.  one day there came
   along a labourer and his wife, his son and two daughters.  their
   family had lived for a long time on an estate in the country, and
   managed, with the help of the common-land and their labour, to get on.
   but the time came when the common was encroached upon, and their
   labour was not needed on the estate, and they were quietly turned out
   of their cottage.  where should they go?  of course to london, where
   work was thought to be plentiful.  they had a little savings, and they
   thought they could get two decent rooms to live in.  but the
   inexorable land question met them in london.  they tried the decent
   courts for lodgings, and found that two rooms would cost ten shillings
   a week.  food was dear and bad, water was bad, and in a short time
   their health suffered.  work was hard to get, and its wage was so low
   that they were soon in debt.  they became more ill and more despairing
   with the poisonous surroundings, the darkness, and the long hours of
   work; and they were driven forth to seek a cheaper lodging.  they
   found it in a court i knew well--a hotbed of crime and nameless
   horrors.  in this they got a single room at a cruel rent, and work was
   more difficult for them to get now, as they came from a place of such
   bad repute, and they fell into the hands of those who sweat the last
   drop out of man and woman and child, for wages which are the food only
   of despair.  and the darkness and the dirt, the bad food and the
   sickness, and the want of water was worse than before; and the crowd
   and the companionship of the court robbed them of the last shreds of
   self-respect.  the drink demon seized upon them.  of course there was
   a public-house at both ends of the court.  there they fled, one and
   all, for shelter, and warmth, and society, and forgetfulness.  and
   they came out in deeper debt, with inflamed senses and burning brains,
   and an unsatisfied craving for drink they would do anything to
   satiate.  and in a few months the father was in prison, the wife
   dying, the son a criminal, and the daughters on the street.  _multiply
   this by half a million, and you will be beneath the truth_.

no more dreary spectacle can be found on this earth than the whole of the
"awful east," with its whitechapel, hoxton, spitalfields, bethnal green,
and wapping to the east india docks.  the colour of life is grey and
drab.  everything is helpless, hopeless, unrelieved, and dirty.  bath
tubs are a thing totally unknown, as mythical as the ambrosia of the
gods.  the people themselves are dirty, while any attempt at cleanliness
becomes howling farce, when it is not pitiful and tragic.  strange,
vagrant odours come drifting along the greasy wind, and the rain, when it
falls, is more like grease than water from heaven.  the very cobblestones
are scummed with grease.

here lives a population as dull and unimaginative as its long grey miles
of dingy brick.  religion has virtually passed it by, and a gross and
stupid materialism reigns, fatal alike to the things of the spirit and
the finer instincts of life.

it used to be the proud boast that every englishman's home was his
castle.  but to-day it is an anachronism.  the ghetto folk have no homes.
they do not know the significance and the sacredness of home life.  even
the municipal dwellings, where live the better-class workers, are
overcrowded barracks.  they have no home life.  the very language proves
it.  the father returning from work asks his child in the street where
her mother is; and back the answer comes, "in the buildings."

a new race has sprung up, a street people.  they pass their lives at work
and in the streets.  they have dens and lairs into which to crawl for
sleeping purposes, and that is all.  one cannot travesty the word by
calling such dens and lairs "homes."  the traditional silent and reserved
englishman has passed away.  the pavement folk are noisy, voluble, high-
strung, excitable--when they are yet young.  as they grow older they
become steeped and stupefied in beer.  when they have nothing else to do,
they ruminate as a cow ruminates.  they are to be met with everywhere,
standing on curbs and corners, and staring into vacancy.  watch one of
them.  he will stand there, motionless, for hours, and when you go away
you will leave him still staring into vacancy.  it is most absorbing.  he
has no money for beer, and his lair is only for sleeping purposes, so
what else remains for him to do?  he has already solved the mysteries of
girl's love, and wife's love, and child's love, and found them delusions
and shams, vain and fleeting as dew-drops, quick-vanishing before the
ferocious facts of life.

as i say, the young are high-strung, nervous, excitable; the middle-aged
are empty-headed, stolid, and stupid.  it is absurd to think for an
instant that they can compete with the workers of the new world.
brutalised, degraded, and dull, the ghetto folk will be unable to render
efficient service to england in the world struggle for industrial
supremacy which economists declare has already begun.  neither as workers
nor as soldiers can they come up to the mark when england, in her need,
calls upon them, her forgotten ones; and if england be flung out of the
world's industrial orbit, they will perish like flies at the end of
summer.  or, with england critically situated, and with them made
desperate as wild beasts are made desperate, they may become a menace and
go "swelling" down to the west end to return the "slumming" the west end
has done in the east.  in which case, before rapid-fire guns and the
modern machinery of warfare, they will perish the more swiftly and
easily.




chapter xx--coffee-houses and doss-houses


another phrase gone glimmering, shorn of romance and tradition and all
that goes to make phrases worth keeping!  for me, henceforth, "coffee-
house" will possess anything but an agreeable connotation.  over on the
other side of the world, the mere mention of the word was sufficient to
conjure up whole crowds of its historic frequenters, and to send trooping
through my imagination endless groups of wits and dandies, pamphleteers
and bravos, and bohemians of grub street.

but here, on this side of the world, alas and alack, the very name is a
misnomer.  coffee-house: a place where people drink coffee.  not at all.
you cannot obtain coffee in such a place for love or money.  true, you
may call for coffee, and you will have brought you something in a cup
purporting to be coffee, and you will taste it and be disillusioned, for
coffee it certainly is not.

and what is true of the coffee is true of the coffee-house.  working-men,
in the main, frequent these places, and greasy, dirty places they are,
without one thing about them to cherish decency in a man or put
self-respect into him.  table-cloths and napkins are unknown.  a man eats
in the midst of the debris left by his predecessor, and dribbles his own
scraps about him and on the floor.  in rush times, in such places, i have
positively waded through the muck and mess that covered the floor, and i
have managed to eat because i was abominably hungry and capable of eating
anything.

this seems to be the normal condition of the working-man, from the zest
with which he addresses himself to the board.  eating is a necessity, and
there are no frills about it.  he brings in with him a primitive
voraciousness, and, i am confident, carries away with him a fairly
healthy appetite.  when you see such a man, on his way to work in the
morning, order a pint of tea, which is no more tea than it is ambrosia,
pull a hunk of dry bread from his pocket, and wash the one down with the
other, depend upon it, that man has not the right sort of stuff in his
belly, nor enough of the wrong sort of stuff, to fit him for big day's
work.  and further, depend upon it, he and a thousand of his kind will
not turn out the quantity or quality of work that a thousand men will who
have eaten heartily of meat and potatoes, and drunk coffee that is
coffee.

as a vagrant in the "hobo" of a california jail, i have been served
better food and drink than the london workman receives in his
coffee-houses; while as an american labourer i have eaten a breakfast for
twelvepence such as the british labourer would not dream of eating.  of
course, he will pay only three or four pence for his; which is, however,
as much as i paid, for i would be earning six shillings to his two or two
and a half.  on the other hand, though, and in return, i would turn out
an amount of work in the course of the day that would put to shame the
amount he turned out.  so there are two sides to it.  the man with the
high standard of living will always do more work and better than the man
with the low standard of living.

there is a comparison which sailormen make between the english and
american merchant services.  in an english ship, they say, it is poor
grub, poor pay, and easy work; in an american ship, good grub, good pay,
and hard work.  and this is applicable to the working populations of both
countries.  the ocean greyhounds have to pay for speed and steam, and so
does the workman.  but if the workman is not able to pay for it, he will
not have the speed and steam, that is all.  the proof of it is when the
english workman comes to america.  he will lay more bricks in new york
than he will in london, still more bricks in st. louis, and still more
bricks when he gets to san francisco. {3}  his standard of living has
been rising all the time.

early in the morning, along the streets frequented by workmen on the way
to work, many women sit on the sidewalk with sacks of bread beside them.
no end of workmen purchase these, and eat them as they walk along.  they
do not even wash the dry bread down with the tea to be obtained for a
penny in the coffee-houses.  it is incontestable that a man is not fit to
begin his day's work on a meal like that; and it is equally incontestable
that the loss will fall upon his employer and upon the nation.  for some
time, now, statesmen have been crying, "wake up, england!"  it would show
more hard-headed common sense if they changed the tune to "feed up,
england!"

not only is the worker poorly fed, but he is filthily fed.  i have stood
outside a butcher-shop and watched a horde of speculative housewives
turning over the trimmings and scraps and shreds of beef and mutton--dog-
meat in the states.  i would not vouch for the clean fingers of these
housewives, no more than i would vouch for the cleanliness of the single
rooms in which many of them and their families lived; yet they raked, and
pawed, and scraped the mess about in their anxiety to get the worth of
their coppers.  i kept my eye on one particularly offensive-looking bit
of meat, and followed it through the clutches of over twenty women, till
it fell to the lot of a timid-appearing little woman whom the butcher
bluffed into taking it.  all day long this heap of scraps was added to
and taken away from, the dust and dirt of the street falling upon it,
flies settling on it, and the dirty fingers turning it over and over.

the costers wheel loads of specked and decaying fruit around in the
barrows all day, and very often store it in their one living and sleeping
room for the night.  there it is exposed to the sickness and disease, the
effluvia and vile exhalations of overcrowded and rotten life, and next
day it is carted about again to be sold.

the poor worker of the east end never knows what it is to eat good,
wholesome meat or fruit--in fact, he rarely eats meat or fruit at all;
while the skilled workman has nothing to boast of in the way of what he
eats.  judging from the coffee-houses, which is a fair criterion, they
never know in all their lives what tea, coffee, or cocoa tastes like.  the
slops and water-witcheries of the coffee-houses, varying only in
sloppiness and witchery, never even approximate or suggest what you and i
are accustomed to drink as tea and coffee.

a little incident comes to me, connected with a coffee-house not far from
jubilee street on the mile end road.

"cawn yer let me 'ave somethin' for this, daughter?  anythin', hi don't
mind.  hi 'aven't 'ad a bite the blessed dy, an' hi'm that fynt . . . "

she was an old woman, clad in decent black rags, and in her hand she held
a penny.  the one she had addressed as "daughter" was a careworn woman of
forty, proprietress and waitress of the house.

i waited, possibly as anxiously as the old woman, to see how the appeal
would be received.  it was four in the afternoon, and she looked faint
and sick.  the woman hesitated an instant, then brought a large plate of
"stewed lamb and young peas."  i was eating a plate of it myself, and it
is my judgment that the lamb was mutton and that the peas might have been
younger without being youthful.  however, the point is, the dish was sold
at sixpence, and the proprietress gave it for a penny, demonstrating anew
the old truth that the poor are the most charitable.

the old woman, profuse in her gratitude, took a seat on the other side of
the narrow table and ravenously attacked the smoking stew.  we ate
steadily and silently, the pair of us, when suddenly, explosively and
most gleefully, she cried out to me,--

"hi sold a box o' matches!  yus," she confirmed, if anything with greater
and more explosive glee.  "hi sold a box o' matches!  that's 'ow hi got
the penny."

"you must be getting along in years," i suggested.

"seventy-four yesterday," she replied, and returned with gusto to her
plate.

"blimey, i'd like to do something for the old girl, that i would, but
this is the first i've 'ad to-dy," the young fellow alongside volunteered
to me.  "an' i only 'ave this because i 'appened to make an odd shilling
washin' out, lord lumme! i don't know 'ow many pots."

"no work at my own tryde for six weeks," he said further, in reply to my
questions; "nothin' but odd jobs a blessed long wy between."

* * * * *

one meets with all sorts of adventures in coffee-house, and i shall not
soon forget a cockney amazon in a place near trafalgar square, to whom i
tendered a sovereign when paying my score.  (by the way, one is supposed
to pay before he begins to eat, and if he be poorly dressed he is
compelled to pay before he eats).

the girl bit the gold piece between her teeth, rang it on the counter,
and then looked me and my rags witheringly up and down.

"where'd you find it?" she at length demanded.

"some mug left it on the table when he went out, eh, don't you think?" i
retorted.

"wot's yer gyme?" she queried, looking me calmly in the eyes.

"i makes 'em," quoth i.

she sniffed superciliously and gave me the change in small silver, and i
had my revenge by biting and ringing every piece of it.

"i'll give you a ha'penny for another lump of sugar in the tea," i said.

"i'll see you in 'ell first," came the retort courteous.  also, she
amplified the retort courteous in divers vivid and unprintable ways.

i never had much talent for repartee, but she knocked silly what little i
had, and i gulped down my tea a beaten man, while she gloated after me
even as i passed out to the street.

while 300,000 people of london live in one-room tenements, and 900,000
are illegally and viciously housed, 38,000 more are registered as living
in common lodging-houses--known in the vernacular as "doss-houses."  there
are many kinds of doss-houses, but in one thing they are all alike, from
the filthy little ones to the monster big ones paying five per cent. and
blatantly lauded by smug middle-class men who know but one thing about
them, and that one thing is their uninhabitableness.  by this i do not
mean that the roofs leak or the walls are draughty; but what i do mean is
that life in them is degrading and unwholesome.

"the poor man's hotel," they are often called, but the phrase is
caricature.  not to possess a room to one's self, in which sometimes to
sit alone; to be forced out of bed willy-nilly, the first thing in the
morning; to engage and pay anew for a bed each night; and never to have
any privacy, surely is a mode of existence quite different from that of
hotel life.

this must not be considered a sweeping condemnation of the big private
and municipal lodging-houses and working-men's homes.  far from it.  they
have remedied many of the atrocities attendant upon the irresponsible
small doss-houses, and they give the workman more for his money than he
ever received before; but that does not make them as habitable or
wholesome as the dwelling-place of a man should be who does his work in
the world.

the little private doss-houses, as a rule, are unmitigated horrors.  i
have slept in them, and i know; but let me pass them by and confine
myself to the bigger and better ones.  not far from middlesex street,
whitechapel, i entered such a house, a place inhabited almost entirely by
working men.  the entrance was by way of a flight of steps descending
from the sidewalk to what was properly the cellar of the building.  here
were two large and gloomily lighted rooms, in which men cooked and ate.  i
had intended to do some cooking myself, but the smell of the place stole
away my appetite, or, rather, wrested it from me; so i contented myself
with watching other men cook and eat.

one workman, home from work, sat down opposite me at the rough wooden
table, and began his meal.  a handful of salt on the not over-clean table
constituted his butter.  into it he dipped his bread, mouthful by
mouthful, and washed it down with tea from a big mug.  a piece of fish
completed his bill of fare.  he ate silently, looking neither to right
nor left nor across at me.  here and there, at the various tables, other
men were eating, just as silently.  in the whole room there was hardly a
note of conversation.  a feeling of gloom pervaded the ill-lighted place.
many of them sat and brooded over the crumbs of their repast, and made me
wonder, as childe roland wondered, what evil they had done that they
should be punished so.

from the kitchen came the sounds of more genial life, and i ventured into
the range where the men were cooking.  but the smell i had noticed on
entering was stronger here, and a rising nausea drove me into the street
for fresh air.

on my return i paid fivepence for a "cabin," took my receipt for the same
in the form of a huge brass check, and went upstairs to the smoking-room.
here, a couple of small billiard tables and several checkerboards were
being used by young working-men, who waited in relays for their turn at
the games, while many men were sitting around, smoking, reading, and
mending their clothes.  the young men were hilarious, the old men were
gloomy.  in fact, there were two types of men, the cheerful and the
sodden or blue, and age seemed to determine the classification.

but no more than the two cellar rooms did this room convey the remotest
suggestion of home.  certainly there could be nothing home-like about it
to you and me, who know what home really is.  on the walls were the most
preposterous and insulting notices regulating the conduct of the guests,
and at ten o'clock the lights were put out, and nothing remained but bed.
this was gained by descending again to the cellar, by surrendering the
brass check to a burly doorkeeper, and by climbing a long flight of
stairs into the upper regions.  i went to the top of the building and
down again, passing several floors filled with sleeping men.  the
"cabins" were the best accommodation, each cabin allowing space for a
tiny bed and room alongside of it in which to undress.  the bedding was
clean, and with neither it nor the bed do i find any fault.  but there
was no privacy about it, no being alone.

to get an adequate idea of a floor filled with cabins, you have merely to
magnify a layer of the pasteboard pigeon-holes of an egg-crate till each
pigeon-hole is seven feet in height and otherwise properly dimensioned,
then place the magnified layer on the floor of a large, barnlike room,
and there you have it.  there are no ceilings to the pigeon-holes, the
walls are thin, and the snores from all the sleepers and every move and
turn of your nearer neighbours come plainly to your ears.  and this cabin
is yours only for a little while.  in the morning out you go.  you cannot
put your trunk in it, or come and go when you like, or lock the door
behind you, or anything of the sort.  in fact, there is no door at all,
only a doorway.  if you care to remain a guest in this poor man's hotel,
you must put up with all this, and with prison regulations which impress
upon you constantly that you are nobody, with little soul of your own and
less to say about it.

now i contend that the least a man who does his day's work should have is
a room to himself, where he can lock the door and be safe in his
possessions; where he can sit down and read by a window or look out;
where he can come and go whenever he wishes; where he can accumulate a
few personal belongings other than those he carries about with him on his
back and in his pockets; where he can hang up pictures of his mother,
sister, sweet-heart, ballet dancers, or bulldogs, as his heart listeth--in
short, one place of his own on the earth of which he can say: "this is
mine, my castle; the world stops at the threshold; here am i lord and
master."  he will be a better citizen, this man; and he will do a better
day's work.

i stood on one floor of the poor man's hotel and listened.  i went from
bed to bed and looked at the sleepers.  they were young men, from twenty
to forty, most of them.  old men cannot afford the working-man's home.
they go to the workhouse.  but i looked at the young men, scores of them,
and they were not bad-looking fellows.  their faces were made for women's
kisses, their necks for women's arms.  they were lovable, as men are
lovable.  they were capable of love.  a woman's touch redeems and
softens, and they needed such redemption and softening instead of each
day growing harsh and harsher.  and i wondered where these women were,
and heard a "harlot's ginny laugh."  leman street, waterloo road,
piccadilly, the strand, answered me, and i knew where they were.




chapter xxi--the precariousness of life


i was talking with a very vindictive man.  in his opinion, his wife had
wronged him and the law had wronged him.  the merits and morals of the
case are immaterial.  the meat of the matter is that she had obtained a
separation, and he was compelled to pay ten shillings each week for the
support of her and the five children.  "but look you," said he to me,
"wot'll 'appen to 'er if i don't py up the ten shillings?  s'posin', now,
just s'posin' a accident 'appens to me, so i cawn't work.  s'posin' i get
a rupture, or the rheumatics, or the cholera.  wot's she goin' to do, eh?
wot's she goin' to do?"

he shook his head sadly.  "no 'ope for 'er.  the best she cawn do is the
work'ouse, an' that's 'ell.  an' if she don't go to the work'ouse, it'll
be a worse 'ell.  come along 'ith me an' i'll show you women sleepin' in
a passage, a dozen of 'em.  an' i'll show you worse, wot she'll come to
if anythin' 'appens to me and the ten shillings."

the certitude of this man's forecast is worthy of consideration.  he knew
conditions sufficiently to know the precariousness of his wife's grasp on
food and shelter.  for her game was up when his working capacity was
impaired or destroyed.  and when this state of affairs is looked at in
its larger aspect, the same will be found true of hundreds of thousands
and even millions of men and women living amicably together and
co-operating in the pursuit of food and shelter.

the figures are appalling: 1,800,000 people in london live on the poverty
line and below it, and 1,000,000 live with one week's wages between them
and pauperism.  in all england and wales, eighteen per cent. of the whole
population are driven to the parish for relief, and in london, according
to the statistics of the london county council, twenty-one per cent. of
the whole population are driven to the parish for relief.  between being
driven to the parish for relief and being an out-and-out pauper there is
a great difference, yet london supports 123,000 paupers, quite a city of
folk in themselves.  one in every four in london dies on public charity,
while 939 out of every 1000 in the united kingdom die in poverty;
8,000,000 simply struggle on the ragged edge of starvation, and
20,000,000 more are not comfortable in the simple and clean sense of the
word.

it is interesting to go more into detail concerning the london people who
die on charity.

in 1886, and up to 1893, the percentage of pauperism to population was
less in london than in all england; but since 1893, and for every
succeeding year, the percentage of pauperism to population has been
greater in london than in all england.  yet, from the registrar-general's
report for 1886, the following figures are taken:-

out of 81,951 deaths in london (1884):-

in workhouses            9,909
in hospitals             6,559
in lunatic asylums         278
total in public refuges 16,746

commenting on these figures, a fabian writer says: "considering that
comparatively few of these are children, it is probable that one in every
three london adults will be driven into one of these refuges to die, and
the proportion in the case of the manual labour class must of course be
still larger."

these figures serve somewhat to indicate the proximity of the average
worker to pauperism.  various things make pauperism.  an advertisement,
for instance, such as this, appearing in yesterday morning's paper:-

"clerk wanted, with knowledge of shorthand, typewriting, and invoicing:
wages ten shillings ($2.50) a week.  apply by letter," &c.

and in to-day's paper i read of a clerk, thirty-five years of age and an
inmate of a london workhouse, brought before a magistrate for
non-performance of task.  he claimed that he had done his various tasks
since he had been an inmate; but when the master set him to breaking
stones, his hands blistered, and he could not finish the task.  he had
never been used to an implement heavier than a pen, he said.  the
magistrate sentenced him and his blistered hands to seven days' hard
labour.

old age, of course, makes pauperism.  and then there is the accident, the
thing happening, the death or disablement of the husband, father, and
bread-winner.  here is a man, with a wife and three children, living on
the ticklish security of twenty shillings per week--and there are
hundreds of thousands of such families in london.  perforce, to even half
exist, they must live up to the last penny of it, so that a week's wages
(one pound) is all that stands between this family and pauperism or
starvation.  the thing happens, the father is struck down, and what then?
a mother with three children can do little or nothing.  either she must
hand her children over to society as juvenile paupers, in order to be
free to do something adequate for herself, or she must go to the sweat-
shops for work which she can perform in the vile den possible to her
reduced income.  but with the sweat-shops, married women who eke out
their husband's earnings, and single women who have but themselves
miserably to support, determine the scale of wages.  and this scale of
wages, so determined, is so low that the mother and her three children
can live only in positive beastliness and semi-starvation, till decay and
death end their suffering.

to show that this mother, with her three children to support, cannot
compete in the sweating industries, i instance from the current
newspapers the two following cases:-

a father indignantly writes that his daughter and a girl companion
receive 8.5d. per gross for making boxes.  they made each day four gross.
their expenses were 8d. for car fare, 2d. for stamps, 2.5d. for glue, and
1d. for string, so that all they earned between them was 1s. 9d., or a
daily wage each of 10.5d.

in the second ewe, before the luton guardians a few days ago, an old
woman of seventy-two appeared, asking for relief.  "she was a straw-hat
maker, but had been compelled to give up the work owing to the price she
obtained for them--namely, 2.25d. each.  for that price she had to
provide plait trimmings and make and finish the hats."

yet this mother and her three children we are considering have done no
wrong that they should be so punished.  they have not sinned.  the thing
happened, that is all; the husband, father and bread-winner, was struck
down.  there is no guarding against it.  it is fortuitous.  a family
stands so many chances of escaping the bottom of the abyss, and so many
chances of falling plump down to it.  the chance is reducible to cold,
pitiless figures, and a few of these figures will not be out of place.

sir a. forwood calculates that--

1 of every 1400 workmen is killed annually.
1 of every 2500 workmen is totally disabled.
1 of every 300 workmen is permanently partially disabled.
1 of every 8 workmen is temporarily disabled 3 or 4 weeks.

but these are only the accidents of industry.  the high mortality of the
people who live in the ghetto plays a terrible part.  the average age at
death among the people of the west end is fifty-five years; the average
age at death among the people of the east end is thirty years.  that is
to say, the person in the west end has twice the chance for life that the
person has in the east end.  talk of war!  the mortality in south africa
and the philippines fades away to insignificance.  here, in the heart of
peace, is where the blood is being shed; and here not even the civilised
rules of warfare obtain, for the women and children and babes in the arms
are killed just as ferociously as the men are killed.  war!  in england,
every year, 500,000 men, women, and children, engaged in the various
industries, are killed and disabled, or are injured to disablement by
disease.

in the west end eighteen per cent. of the children die before five years
of age; in the east end fifty-five per cent. of the children die before
five years of age.  and there are streets in london where out of every
one hundred children born in a year, fifty die during the next year; and
of the fifty that remain, twenty-five die before they are five years old.
slaughter!  herod did not do quite so badly.

that industry causes greater havoc with human life than battle does no
better substantiation can be given than the following extract from a
recent report of the liverpool medical officer, which is not applicable
to liverpool alone:-

   in many instances little if any sunlight could get to the courts, and
   the atmosphere within the dwellings was always foul, owing largely to
   the saturated condition of the walls and ceilings, which for so many
   years had absorbed the exhalations of the occupants into their porous
   material.  singular testimony to the absence of sunlight in these
   courts was furnished by the action of the parks and gardens committee,
   who desired to brighten the homes of the poorest class by gifts of
   growing flowers and window-boxes; but these gifts could not be made in
   courts such as these, _as flowers and plants were susceptible to the
   unwholesome surroundings, and would not live_.

mr. george haw has compiled the following table on the three st. george's
parishes (london parishes):-

                   percentage of
                   population      death-rate
                   overcrowded      per 1000
st. george's west  10                 13.2
st. george's south 35                 23.7
st. george's east  40                 26.4

then there are the "dangerous trades," in which countless workers are
employed.  their hold on life is indeed precarious--far, far more
precarious than the hold of the twentieth-century soldier on life.  in
the linen trade, in the preparation of the flax, wet feet and wet clothes
cause an unusual amount of bronchitis, pneumonia, and severe rheumatism;
while in the carding and spinning departments the fine dust produces lung
disease in the majority of cases, and the woman who starts carding at
seventeen or eighteen begins to break up and go to pieces at thirty.  the
chemical labourers, picked from the strongest and most splendidly-built
men to be found, live, on an average, less than forty-eight years.

says dr. arlidge, of the potter's trade: "potter's dust does not kill
suddenly, but settles, year after year, a little more firmly into the
lungs, until at length a case of plaster is formed.  breathing becomes
more and more difficult and depressed, and finally ceases."

steel dust, stone dust, clay dust, alkali dust, fluff dust, fibre
dust--all these things kill, and they are more deadly than machine-guns
and pom-poms.  worst of all is the lead dust in the white-lead trades.
here is a description of the typical dissolution of a young, healthy,
well-developed girl who goes to work in a white-lead factory:-

   here, after a varying degree of exposure, she becomes anaemic.  it may
   be that her gums show a very faint blue line, or perchance her teeth
   and gums are perfectly sound, and no blue line is discernible.
   coincidently with the anaemia she has been getting thinner, but so
   gradually as scarcely to impress itself upon her or her friends.
   sickness, however, ensues, and headaches, growing in intensity, are
   developed.  these are frequently attended by obscuration of vision or
   temporary blindness.  such a girl passes into what appears to her
   friends and medical adviser as ordinary hysteria.  this gradually
   deepens without warning, until she is suddenly seized with a
   convulsion, beginning in one half of the face, then involving the arm,
   next the leg of the same side of the body, until the convulsion,
   violent and purely epileptic form in character, becomes universal.
   this is attended by loss of consciousness, out of which she passes
   into a series of convulsions, gradually increasing in severity, in one
   of which she dies--or consciousness, partial or perfect, is regained,
   either, it may be, for a few minutes, a few hours, or days, during
   which violent headache is complained of, or she is delirious and
   excited, as in acute mania, or dull and sullen as in melancholia, and
   requires to be roused, when she is found wandering, and her speech is
   somewhat imperfect.  without further warning, save that the pulse,
   which has become soft, with nearly the normal number of beats, all at
   once becomes low and hard; she is suddenly seized with another
   convulsion, in which she dies, or passes into a state of coma from
   which she never rallies.  in another case the convulsions will
   gradually subside, the headache disappears and the patient recovers,
   only to find that she has completely lost her eyesight, a loss that
   may be temporary or permanent.

and here are a few specific cases of white-lead poisoning:-

   charlotte rafferty, a fine, well-grown young woman with a splendid
   constitution--who had never had a day's illness in her life--became a
   white-lead worker.  convulsions seized her at the foot of the ladder
   in the works.  dr. oliver examined her, found the blue line along her
   gums, which shows that the system is under the influence of the lead.
   he knew that the convulsions would shortly return.  they did so, and
   she died.

   mary ann toler--a girl of seventeen, who had never had a fit in her
   life--three times became ill, and had to leave off work in the
   factory.  before she was nineteen she showed symptoms of lead
   poisoning--had fits, frothed at the mouth, and died.

   mary a., an unusually vigorous woman, was able to work in the lead
   factory for _twenty years_, having colic once only during that time.
   her eight children all died in early infancy from convulsions.  one
   morning, whilst brushing her hair, this woman suddenly lost all power
   in both her wrists.

   eliza h., aged twenty-five, _after five months_ at lead works, was
   seized with colic.  she entered another factory (after being refused
   by the first one) and worked on uninterruptedly for two years.  then
   the former symptoms returned, she was seized with convulsions, and
   died in two days of acute lead poisoning.

mr. vaughan nash, speaking of the unborn generation, says: "the children
of the white-lead worker enter the world, as a rule, only to die from the
convulsions of lead poisoning--they are either born prematurely, or die
within the first year."

and, finally, let me instance the case of harriet a. walker, a young girl
of seventeen, killed while leading a forlorn hope on the industrial
battlefield.  she was employed as an enamelled ware brusher, wherein lead
poisoning is encountered.  her father and brother were both out of
employment.  she concealed her illness, walked six miles a day to and
from work, earned her seven or eight shillings per week, and died, at
seventeen.

depression in trade also plays an important part in hurling the workers
into the abyss.  with a week's wages between a family and pauperism, a
month's enforced idleness means hardship and misery almost indescribable,
and from the ravages of which the victims do not always recover when work
is to be had again.  just now the daily papers contain the report of a
meeting of the carlisle branch of the dockers' union, wherein it is
stated that many of the men, for months past, have not averaged a weekly
income of more than from four to five shillings.  the stagnated state of
the shipping industry in the port of london is held accountable for this
condition of affairs.

to the young working-man or working-woman, or married couple, there is no
assurance of happy or healthy middle life, nor of solvent old age.  work
as they will, they cannot make their future secure.  it is all a matter
of chance.  everything depends upon the thing happening, the thing with
which they have nothing to do.  precaution cannot fend it off, nor can
wiles evade it.  if they remain on the industrial battlefield they must
face it and take their chance against heavy odds.  of course, if they are
favourably made and are not tied by kinship duties, they may run away
from the industrial battlefield.  in which event the safest thing the man
can do is to join the army; and for the woman, possibly, to become a red
cross nurse or go into a nunnery.  in either case they must forego home
and children and all that makes life worth living and old age other than
a nightmare.




chapter xxii--suicide


with life so precarious, and opportunity for the happiness of life so
remote, it is inevitable that life shall be cheap and suicide common.  so
common is it, that one cannot pick up a daily paper without running
across it; while an attempt-at-suicide case in a police court excites no
more interest than an ordinary "drunk," and is handled with the same
rapidity and unconcern.

i remember such a case in the thames police court.  i pride myself that i
have good eyes and ears, and a fair working knowledge of men and things;
but i confess, as i stood in that court-room, that i was half bewildered
by the amazing despatch with which drunks, disorderlies, vagrants,
brawlers, wife-beaters, thieves, fences, gamblers, and women of the
street went through the machine of justice.  the dock stood in the centre
of the court (where the light is best), and into it and out again stepped
men, women, and children, in a stream as steady as the stream of
sentences which fell from the magistrate's lips.

i was still pondering over a consumptive "fence" who had pleaded
inability to work and necessity for supporting wife and children, and who
had received a year at hard labour, when a young boy of about twenty
appeared in the dock.  "alfred freeman," i caught his name, but failed to
catch the charge.  a stout and motherly-looking woman bobbed up in the
witness-box and began her testimony.  wife of the britannia lock-keeper,
i learned she was.  time, night; a splash; she ran to the lock and found
the prisoner in the water.

i flashed my gaze from her to him.  so that was the charge, self-murder.
he stood there dazed and unheeding, his bonny brown hair rumpled down his
forehead, his face haggard and careworn and boyish still.

"yes, sir," the lock-keeper's wife was saying.  "as fast as i pulled to
get 'im out, 'e crawled back.  then i called for 'elp, and some workmen
'appened along, and we got 'im out and turned 'im over to the constable."

the magistrate complimented the woman on her muscular powers, and the
court-room laughed; but all i could see was a boy on the threshold of
life, passionately crawling to muddy death, and there was no laughter in
it.

a man was now in the witness-box, testifying to the boy's good character
and giving extenuating evidence.  he was the boy's foreman, or had been.
alfred was a good boy, but he had had lots of trouble at home, money
matters.  and then his mother was sick.  he was given to worrying, and he
worried over it till he laid himself out and wasn't fit for work.  he
(the foreman), for the sake of his own reputation, the boy's work being
bad, had been forced to ask him to resign.

"anything to say?" the magistrate demanded abruptly.

the boy in the dock mumbled something indistinctly.  he was still dazed.

"what does he say, constable?" the magistrate asked impatiently.

the stalwart man in blue bent his ear to the prisoner's lips, and then
replied loudly, "he says he's very sorry, your worship."

"remanded," said his worship; and the next case was under way, the first
witness already engaged in taking the oath.  the boy, dazed and
unheeding, passed out with the jailer.  that was all, five minutes from
start to finish; and two hulking brutes in the dock were trying
strenuously to shift the responsibility of the possession of a stolen
fishing-pole, worth probably ten cents.

the chief trouble with these poor folk is that they do not know how to
commit suicide, and usually have to make two or three attempts before
they succeed.  this, very naturally, is a horrid nuisance to the
constables and magistrates, and gives them no end of trouble.  sometimes,
however, the magistrates are frankly outspoken about the matter, and
censure the prisoners for the slackness of their attempts.  for instance
mr. r. s---, chairman of the s--- b--- magistrates, in the case the other
day of ann wood, who tried to make away with herself in the canal: "if
you wanted to do it, why didn't you do it and get it done with?" demanded
the indignant mr. r. s---.  "why did you not get under the water and make
an end of it, instead of giving us all this trouble and bother?"

poverty, misery, and fear of the workhouse, are the principal causes of
suicide among the working classes.  "i'll drown myself before i go into
the workhouse," said ellen hughes hunt, aged fifty-two.  last wednesday
they held an inquest on her body at shoreditch.  her husband came from
the islington workhouse to testify.  he had been a cheesemonger, but
failure in business and poverty had driven him into the workhouse,
whither his wife had refused to accompany him.

she was last seen at one in the morning.  three hours later her hat and
jacket were found on the towing path by the regent's canal, and later her
body was fished from the water.  _verdict: suicide during temporary
insanity_.

such verdicts are crimes against truth.  the law is a lie, and through it
men lie most shamelessly.  for instance, a disgraced woman, forsaken and
spat upon by kith and kin, doses herself and her baby with laudanum.  the
baby dies; but she pulls through after a few weeks in hospital, is
charged with murder, convicted, and sentenced to ten years' penal
servitude.  recovering, the law holds her responsible for her actions;
yet, had she died, the same law would have rendered a verdict of
temporary insanity.

now, considering the case of ellen hughes hunt, it is as fair and logical
to say that her husband was suffering from temporary insanity when he
went into the islington workhouse, as it is to say that she was suffering
from temporary insanity when she went into the regent's canal.  as to
which is the preferable sojourning place is a matter of opinion, of
intellectual judgment.  i, for one, from what i know of canals and
workhouses, should choose the canal, were i in a similar position.  and i
make bold to contend that i am no more insane than ellen hughes hunt, her
husband, and the rest of the human herd.

man no longer follows instinct with the old natural fidelity.  he has
developed into a reasoning creature, and can intellectually cling to life
or discard life just as life happens to promise great pleasure or pain.  i
dare to assert that ellen hughes hunt, defrauded and bilked of all the
joys of life which fifty-two years' service in the world has earned, with
nothing but the horrors of the workhouse before her, was very rational
and level-headed when she elected to jump into the canal.  and i dare to
assert, further, that the jury had done a wiser thing to bring in a
verdict charging society with temporary insanity for allowing ellen
hughes hunt to be defrauded and bilked of all the joys of life which
fifty-two years' service in the world had earned.

temporary insanity!  oh, these cursed phrases, these lies of language,
under which people with meat in their bellies and whole shirts on their
backs shelter themselves, and evade the responsibility of their brothers
and sisters, empty of belly and without whole shirts on their backs.

from one issue of the _observer_, an east end paper, i quote the
following commonplace events:-

   a ship's fireman, named johnny king, was charged with attempting to
   commit suicide.  on wednesday defendant went to bow police station and
   stated that he had swallowed a quantity of phosphor paste, as he was
   hard up and unable to obtain work.  king was taken inside and an
   emetic administered, when he vomited up a quantity of the poison.
   defendant now said he was very sorry.  although he had sixteen years'
   good character, he was unable to obtain work of any kind.  mr.
   dickinson had defendant put back for the court missionary to see him.

   timothy warner, thirty-two, was remanded for a similar offence.  he
   jumped off limehouse pier, and when rescued, said, "i intended to do
   it."

   a decent-looking young woman, named ellen gray, was remanded on a
   charge of attempting to commit suicide.  about half-past eight on
   sunday morning constable 834 k found defendant lying in a doorway in
   benworth street, and she was in a very drowsy condition.  she was
   holding an empty bottle in one hand, and stated that some two or three
   hours previously she had swallowed a quantity of laudanum.  as she was
   evidently very ill, the divisional surgeon was sent for, and having
   administered some coffee, ordered that she was to be kept awake.  when
   defendant was charged, she stated that the reason why she attempted to
   take her life was she had neither home nor friends.

i do not say that all people who commit suicide are sane, no more than i
say that all people who do not commit suicide are sane.  insecurity of
food and shelter, by the way, is a great cause of insanity among the
living.  costermongers, hawkers, and pedlars, a class of workers who live
from hand to mouth more than those of any other class, form the highest
percentage of those in the lunatic asylums.  among the males each year,
26.9 per 10,000 go insane, and among the women, 36.9.  on the other hand,
of soldiers, who are at least sure of food and shelter, 13 per 10,000 go
insane; and of farmers and graziers, only 5.1.  so a coster is twice as
likely to lose his reason as a soldier, and five times as likely as a
farmer.

misfortune and misery are very potent in turning people's heads, and
drive one person to the lunatic asylum, and another to the morgue or the
gallows.  when the thing happens, and the father and husband, for all of
his love for wife and children and his willingness to work, can get no
work to do, it is a simple matter for his reason to totter and the light
within his brain go out.  and it is especially simple when it is taken
into consideration that his body is ravaged by innutrition and disease,
in addition to his soul being torn by the sight of his suffering wife and
little ones.

"he is a good-looking man, with a mass of black hair, dark, expressive
eyes, delicately chiselled nose and chin, and wavy, fair moustache."  this
is the reporter's description of frank cavilla as he stood in court, this
dreary month of september, "dressed in a much worn grey suit, and wearing
no collar."

frank cavilla lived and worked as a house decorator in london.  he is
described as a good workman, a steady fellow, and not given to drink,
while all his neighbours unite in testifying that he was a gentle and
affectionate husband and father.

his wife, hannah cavilla, was a big, handsome, light-hearted woman.  she
saw to it that his children were sent neat and clean (the neighbours all
remarked the fact) to the childeric road board school.  and so, with such
a man, so blessed, working steadily and living temperately, all went
well, and the goose hung high.

then the thing happened.  he worked for a mr. beck, builder, and lived in
one of his master's houses in trundley road.  mr. beck was thrown from
his trap and killed.  the thing was an unruly horse, and, as i say, it
happened.  cavilla had to seek fresh employment and find another house.

this occurred eighteen months ago.  for eighteen months he fought the big
fight.  he got rooms in a little house in batavia road, but could not
make both ends meet.  steady work could not be obtained.  he struggled
manfully at casual employment of all sorts, his wife and four children
starving before his eyes.  he starved himself, and grew weak, and fell
ill.  this was three months ago, and then there was absolutely no food at
all.  they made no complaint, spoke no word; but poor folk know.  the
housewives of batavia road sent them food, but so respectable were the
cavillas that the food was sent anonymously, mysteriously, so as not to
hurt their pride.

the thing had happened.  he had fought, and starved, and suffered for
eighteen months.  he got up one september morning, early.  he opened his
pocket-knife.  he cut the throat of his wife, hannah cavilla, aged thirty-
three.  he cut the throat of his first-born, frank, aged twelve.  he cut
the throat of his son, walter, aged eight.  he cut the throat of his
daughter, nellie, aged four.  he cut the throat of his youngest-born,
ernest, aged sixteen months.  then he watched beside the dead all day
until the evening, when the police came, and he told them to put a penny
in the slot of the gas-meter in order that they might have light to see.

frank cavilla stood in court, dressed in a much worn grey suit, and
wearing no collar.  he was a good-looking man, with a mass of black hair,
dark, expressive eyes, delicately chiselled nose and chin, and wavy, fair
moustache.




chapter xxiii--the children


   "where home is a hovel, and dull we grovel,
   forgetting the world is fair."

there is one beautiful sight in the east end, and only one, and it is the
children dancing in the street when the organ-grinder goes his round.  it
is fascinating to watch them, the new-born, the next generation, swaying
and stepping, with pretty little mimicries and graceful inventions all
their own, with muscles that move swiftly and easily, and bodies that
leap airily, weaving rhythms never taught in dancing school.

i have talked with these children, here, there, and everywhere, and they
struck me as being bright as other children, and in many ways even
brighter.  they have most active little imaginations.  their capacity for
projecting themselves into the realm of romance and fantasy is
remarkable.  a joyous life is romping in their blood.  they delight in
music, and motion, and colour, and very often they betray a startling
beauty of face and form under their filth and rags.

but there is a pied piper of london town who steals them all away.  they
disappear.  one never sees them again, or anything that suggests them.
you may look for them in vain amongst the generation of grown-ups.  here
you will find stunted forms, ugly faces, and blunt and stolid minds.
grace, beauty, imagination, all the resiliency of mind and muscle, are
gone.  sometimes, however, you may see a woman, not necessarily old, but
twisted and deformed out of all womanhood, bloated and drunken, lift her
draggled skirts and execute a few grotesque and lumbering steps upon the
pavement.  it is a hint that she was once one of those children who
danced to the organ-grinder.  those grotesque and lumbering steps are all
that is left of the promise of childhood.  in the befogged recesses of
her brain has arisen a fleeting memory that she was once a girl.  the
crowd closes in.  little girls are dancing beside her, about her, with
all the pretty graces she dimly recollects, but can no more than parody
with her body.  then she pants for breath, exhausted, and stumbles out
through the circle.  but the little girls dance on.

the children of the ghetto possess all the qualities which make for noble
manhood and womanhood; but the ghetto itself, like an infuriated tigress
turning on its young, turns upon and destroys all these qualities, blots
out the light and laughter, and moulds those it does not kill into sodden
and forlorn creatures, uncouth, degraded, and wretched below the beasts
of the field.

as to the manner in which this is done, i have in previous chapters
described it at length; here let professor huxley describe it in brief:-

"any one who is acquainted with the state of the population of all great
industrial centres, whether in this or other countries, is aware that
amidst a large and increasing body of that population there reigns
supreme . . . that condition which the french call _la misere_, a word
for which i do not think there is any exact english equivalent.  it is a
condition in which the food, warmth, and clothing which are necessary for
the mere maintenance of the functions of the body in their normal state
cannot be obtained; in which men, women, and children are forced to crowd
into dens wherein decency is abolished, and the most ordinary conditions
of healthful existence are impossible of attainment; in which the
pleasures within reach are reduced to brutality and drunkenness; in which
the pains accumulate at compound interest in the shape of starvation,
disease, stunted development, and moral degradation; in which the
prospect of even steady and honest industry is a life of unsuccessful
battling with hunger, rounded by a pauper's grave."

in such conditions, the outlook for children is hopeless.  they die like
flies, and those that survive, survive because they possess excessive
vitality and a capacity of adaptation to the degradation with which they
are surrounded.  they have no home life.  in the dens and lairs in which
they live they are exposed to all that is obscene and indecent.  and as
their minds are made rotten, so are their bodies made rotten by bad
sanitation, overcrowding, and underfeeding.  when a father and mother
live with three or four children in a room where the children take turn
about in sitting up to drive the rats away from the sleepers, when those
children never have enough to eat and are preyed upon and made miserable
and weak by swarming vermin, the sort of men and women the survivors will
make can readily be imagined.

   "dull despair and misery
   lie about them from their birth;
   ugly curses, uglier mirth,
   are their earliest lullaby."

a man and a woman marry and set up housekeeping in one room.  their
income does not increase with the years, though their family does, and
the man is exceedingly lucky if he can keep his health and his job.  a
baby comes, and then another.  this means that more room should be
obtained; but these little mouths and bodies mean additional expense and
make it absolutely impossible to get more spacious quarters.  more babies
come.  there is not room in which to turn around.  the youngsters run the
streets, and by the time they are twelve or fourteen the room-issue comes
to a head, and out they go on the streets for good.  the boy, if he be
lucky, can manage to make the common lodging-houses, and he may have any
one of several ends.  but the girl of fourteen or fifteen, forced in this
manner to leave the one room called home, and able to earn at the best a
paltry five or six shillings per week, can have but one end.  and the
bitter end of that one end is such as that of the woman whose body the
police found this morning in a doorway in dorset street, whitechapel.
homeless, shelterless, sick, with no one with her in her last hour, she
had died in the night of exposure.  she was sixty-two years old and a
match vendor.  she died as a wild animal dies.

fresh in my mind is the picture of a boy in the dock of an east end
police court.  his head was barely visible above the railing.  he was
being proved guilty of stealing two shillings from a woman, which he had
spent, not for candy and cakes and a good time, but for food.

"why didn't you ask the woman for food?" the magistrate demanded, in a
hurt sort of tone.  "she would surely have given you something to eat."

"if i 'ad arsked 'er, i'd got locked up for beggin'," was the boy's
reply.

the magistrate knitted his brows and accepted the rebuke.  nobody knew
the boy, nor his father or mother.  he was without beginning or
antecedent, a waif, a stray, a young cub seeking his food in the jungle
of empire, preying upon the weak and being preyed upon by the strong.

the people who try to help, who gather up the ghetto children and send
them away on a day's outing to the country, believe that not very many
children reach the age of ten without having had at least one day there.
of this, a writer says: "the mental change caused by one day so spent
must not be undervalued.  whatever the circumstances, the children learn
the meaning of fields and woods, so that descriptions of country scenery
in the books they read, which before conveyed no impression, become now
intelligible."

one day in the fields and woods, if they are lucky enough to be picked up
by the people who try to help!  and they are being born faster every day
than they can be carted off to the fields and woods for the one day in
their lives.  one day!  in all their lives, one day!  and for the rest of
the days, as the boy told a certain bishop, "at ten we 'ops the wag; at
thirteen we nicks things; an' at sixteen we bashes the copper."  which is
to say, at ten they play truant, at thirteen steal, and at sixteen are
sufficiently developed hooligans to smash the policemen.

the rev. j. cartmel robinson tells of a boy and girl of his parish who
set out to walk to the forest.  they walked and walked through the never-
ending streets, expecting always to see it by-and-by; until they sat down
at last, faint and despairing, and were rescued by a kind woman who
brought them back.  evidently they had been overlooked by the people who
try to help.

the same gentleman is authority for the statement that in a street in
hoxton (a district of the vast east end), over seven hundred children,
between five and thirteen years, live in eighty small houses.  and he
adds: "it is because london has largely shut her children in a maze of
streets and houses and robbed them of their rightful inheritance in sky
and field and brook, that they grow up to be men and women physically
unfit."

he tells of a member of his congregation who let a basement room to a
married couple.  "they said they had two children; when they got
possession it turned out that they had four.  after a while a fifth
appeared, and the landlord gave them notice to quit.  they paid no
attention to it.  then the sanitary inspector who has to wink at the law
so often, came in and threatened my friend with legal proceedings.  he
pleaded that he could not get them out.  they pleaded that nobody would
have them with so many children at a rental within their means, which is
one of the commonest complaints of the poor, by-the-bye.  what was to be
done?  the landlord was between two millstones.  finally he applied to
the magistrate, who sent up an officer to inquire into the case.  since
that time about twenty days have elapsed, and nothing has yet been done.
is this a singular case?  by no means; it is quite common."

last week the police raided a disorderly house.  in one room were found
two young children.  they were arrested and charged with being inmates
the same as the women had been.  their father appeared at the trial.  he
stated that himself and wife and two older children, besides the two in
the dock, occupied that room; he stated also that he occupied it because
he could get no other room for the half-crown a week he paid for it.  the
magistrate discharged the two juvenile offenders and warned the father
that he was bringing his children up unhealthily.

but there is no need further to multiply instances.  in london the
slaughter of the innocents goes on on a scale more stupendous than any
before in the history of the world.  and equally stupendous is the
callousness of the people who believe in christ, acknowledge god, and go
to church regularly on sunday.  for the rest of the week they riot about
on the rents and profits which come to them from the east end stained
with the blood of the children.  also, at times, so peculiarly are they
made, they will take half a million of these rents and profits and send
it away to educate the black boys of the soudan.




chapter xxiv--a vision of the night


   all these were years ago little red-coloured, pulpy infants, capable
   of being kneaded, baked, into any social form you chose.--carlyle.

late last night i walked along commercial street from spitalfields to
whitechapel, and still continuing south, down leman street to the docks.
and as i walked i smiled at the east end papers, which, filled with civic
pride, boastfully proclaim that there is nothing the matter with the east
end as a living place for men and women.

it is rather hard to tell a tithe of what i saw.  much of it is
untenable.  but in a general way i may say that i saw a nightmare, a
fearful slime that quickened the pavement with life, a mess of
unmentionable obscenity that put into eclipse the "nightly horror" of
piccadilly and the strand.  it _was_ a menagerie of garmented bipeds that
looked something like humans and more like beasts, and to complete the
picture, brass-buttoned keepers kept order among them when they snarled
too fiercely.

i was glad the keepers were there, for i did not have on my "seafaring"
clothes, and i was what is called a "mark" for the creatures of prey that
prowled up and down.  at times, between keepers, these males looked at me
sharply, hungrily, gutter-wolves that they were, and i was afraid of
their hands, of their naked hands, as one may be afraid of the paws of a
gorilla.  they reminded me of gorillas.  their bodies were small, ill-
shaped, and squat.  there were no swelling muscles, no abundant thews and
wide-spreading shoulders.  they exhibited, rather, an elemental economy
of nature, such as the cave-men must have exhibited.  but there was
strength in those meagre bodies, the ferocious, primordial strength to
clutch and gripe and tear and rend.  when they spring upon their human
prey they are known even to bend the victim backward and double its body
till the back is broken.  they possess neither conscience nor sentiment,
and they will kill for a half-sovereign, without fear or favour, if they
are given but half a chance.  they are a new species, a breed of city
savages.  the streets and houses, alleys and courts, are their hunting
grounds.  as valley and mountain are to the natural savage, street and
building are valley and mountain to them.  the slum is their jungle, and
they live and prey in the jungle.

the dear soft people of the golden theatres and wonder-mansions of the
west end do not see these creatures, do not dream that they exist.  but
they are here, alive, very much alive in their jungle.  and woe the day,
when england is fighting in her last trench, and her able-bodied men are
on the firing line!  for on that day they will crawl out of their dens
and lairs, and the people of the west end will see them, as the dear soft
aristocrats of feudal france saw them and asked one another, "whence came
they?"  "are they men?"

but they were not the only beasts that ranged the menagerie.  they were
only here and there, lurking in dark courts and passing like grey shadows
along the walls; but the women from whose rotten loins they spring were
everywhere.  they whined insolently, and in maudlin tones begged me for
pennies, and worse.  they held carouse in every boozing ken, slatternly,
unkempt, bleary-eyed, and towsled, leering and gibbering, overspilling
with foulness and corruption, and, gone in debauch, sprawling across
benches and bars, unspeakably repulsive, fearful to look upon.

and there were others, strange, weird faces and forms and twisted
monstrosities that shouldered me on every side, inconceivable types of
sodden ugliness, the wrecks of society, the perambulating carcasses, the
living deaths--women, blasted by disease and drink till their shame
brought not tuppence in the open mart; and men, in fantastic rags,
wrenched by hardship and exposure out of all semblance of men, their
faces in a perpetual writhe of pain, grinning idiotically, shambling like
apes, dying with every step they took and each breath they drew.  and
there were young girls, of eighteen and twenty, with trim bodies and
faces yet untouched with twist and bloat, who had fetched the bottom of
the abyss plump, in one swift fall.  and i remember a lad of fourteen,
and one of six or seven, white-faced and sickly, homeless, the pair of
them, who sat upon the pavement with their backs against a railing and
watched it all.

the unfit and the unneeded!  industry does not clamour for them.  there
are no jobs going begging through lack of men and women.  the dockers
crowd at the entrance gate, and curse and turn away when the foreman does
not give them a call.  the engineers who have work pay six shillings a
week to their brother engineers who can find nothing to do; 514,000
textile workers oppose a resolution condemning the employment of children
under fifteen.  women, and plenty to spare, are found to toil under the
sweat-shop masters for tenpence a day of fourteen hours.  alfred freeman
crawls to muddy death because he loses his job.  ellen hughes hunt
prefers regent's canal to islington workhouse.  frank cavilla cuts the
throats of his wife and children because he cannot find work enough to
give them food and shelter.

the unfit and the unneeded!  the miserable and despised and forgotten,
dying in the social shambles.  the progeny of prostitution--of the
prostitution of men and women and children, of flesh and blood, and
sparkle and spirit; in brief, the prostitution of labour.  if this is the
best that civilisation can do for the human, then give us howling and
naked savagery.  far better to be a people of the wilderness and desert,
of the cave and the squatting-place, than to be a people of the machine
and the abyss.




chapter xxv--the hunger wail


"my father has more stamina than i, for he is country-born."

the speaker, a bright young east ender, was lamenting his poor physical
development.

"look at my scrawny arm, will you."  he pulled up his sleeve.  "not
enough to eat, that's what's the matter with it.  oh, not now.  i have
what i want to eat these days.  but it's too late.  it can't make up for
what i didn't have to eat when i was a kiddy.  dad came up to london from
the fen country.  mother died, and there were six of us kiddies and dad
living in two small rooms.

"he had hard times, dad did.  he might have chucked us, but he didn't.  he
slaved all day, and at night he came home and cooked and cared for us.  he
was father and mother, both.  he did his best, but we didn't have enough
to eat.  we rarely saw meat, and then of the worst.  and it is not good
for growing kiddies to sit down to a dinner of bread and a bit of cheese,
and not enough of it.

"and what's the result?  i am undersized, and i haven't the stamina of my
dad.  it was starved out of me.  in a couple of generations there'll be
no more of me here in london.  yet there's my younger brother; he's
bigger and better developed.  you see, dad and we children held together,
and that accounts for it."

"but i don't see," i objected.  "i should think, under such conditions,
that the vitality should decrease and the younger children be born weaker
and weaker."

"not when they hold together," he replied.  "whenever you come along in
the east end and see a child of from eight to twelve, good-sized, well-
developed, and healthy-looking, just you ask and you will find that it is
the youngest in the family, or at least is one of the younger.  the way
of it is this: the older children starve more than the younger ones.  by
the time the younger ones come along, the older ones are starting to
work, and there is more money coming in, and more food to go around."

he pulled down his sleeve, a concrete instance of where chronic
semi-starvation kills not, but stunts.  his voice was but one among the
myriads that raise the cry of the hunger wail in the greatest empire in
the world.  on any one day, over 1,000,000 people are in receipt of poor-
law relief in the united kingdom.  one in eleven of the whole working-
class receive poor-law relief in the course of the year; 37,500,000
people receive less than 12 pounds per month, per family; and a constant
army of 8,000,000 lives on the border of starvation.

a committee of the london county school board makes this declaration: "at
times, _when there is no special distress_, 55,000 children in a state of
hunger, which makes it useless to attempt to teach them, are in the
schools of london alone."  the italics are mine.  "when there is no
special distress" means good times in england; for the people of england
have come to look upon starvation and suffering, which they call
"distress," as part of the social order.  chronic starvation is looked
upon as a matter of course.  it is only when acute starvation makes its
appearance on a large scale that they think something is unusual

i shall never forget the bitter wail of a blind man in a little east end
shop at the close of a murky day.  he had been the eldest of five
children, with a mother and no father.  being the eldest, he had starved
and worked as a child to put bread into the mouths of his little brothers
and sisters.  not once in three months did he ever taste meat.  he never
knew what it was to have his hunger thoroughly appeased.  and he claimed
that this chronic starvation of his childhood had robbed him of his
sight.  to support the claim, he quoted from the report of the royal
commission on the blind, "blindness is more prevalent in poor districts,
and poverty accelerates this dreadful affliction."

but he went further, this blind man, and in his voice was the bitterness
of an afflicted man to whom society did not give enough to eat.  he was
one of an enormous army of blind in london, and he said that in the blind
homes they did not receive half enough to eat.  he gave the diet for a
day:-

breakfast--0.75 pint of skilly and dry bread.
dinner   --3 oz. meat.
            1 slice of bread.
            0.5 lb. potatoes.
supper   --0.75 pint of skilly and dry bread.

oscar wilde, god rest his soul, voices the cry of the prison child,
which, in varying degree, is the cry of the prison man and woman:-

"the second thing from which a child suffers in prison is hunger.  the
food that is given to it consists of a piece of usually bad-baked prison
bread and a tin of water for breakfast at half-past seven.  at twelve
o'clock it gets dinner, composed of a tin of coarse indian meal stirabout
(skilly), and at half-past five it gets a piece of dry bread and a tin of
water for its supper.  this diet in the case of a strong grown man is
always productive of illness of some kind, chiefly of course diarrhoea,
with its attendant weakness.  in fact, in a big prison astringent
medicines are served out regularly by the warders as a matter of course.
in the case of a child, the child is, as a rule, incapable of eating the
food at all.  any one who knows anything about children knows how easily
a child's digestion is upset by a fit of crying, or trouble and mental
distress of any kind.  a child who has been crying all day long, and
perhaps half the night, in a lonely dim-lit cell, and is preyed upon by
terror, simply cannot eat food of this coarse, horrible kind.  in the
case of the little child to whom warder martin gave the biscuits, the
child was crying with hunger on tuesday morning, and utterly unable to
eat the bread and water served to it for its breakfast.  martin went out
after the breakfasts had been served and bought the few sweet biscuits
for the child rather than see it starving.  it was a beautiful action on
his part, and was so recognised by the child, who, utterly unconscious of
the regulations of the prison board, told one of the senior wardens how
kind this junior warden had been to him.  the result was, of course, a
report and a dismissal."

robert blatchford compares the workhouse pauper's daily diet with the
soldier's, which, when he was a soldier, was not considered liberal
enough, and yet is twice as liberal as the pauper's.

pauper    diet          soldier
3.25 oz.  meat          12 oz.
15.5 oz.  bread         24 oz.
6 oz.     vegetables     8 oz.

the adult male pauper gets meat (outside of soup) but once a week, and
the paupers "have nearly all that pallid, pasty complexion which is the
sure mark of starvation."

here is a table, comparing the workhouse officer's weekly allowance:-

officer    diet          pauper
7 lb.      bread         6.75 lb.
5 lb.      meat          1 lb. 2 oz.
12 oz.     bacon         2.5 oz.
8 oz.      cheese        2 oz.
7 lb.      potatoes      1.5 lb.
6 lb.      vegetables    none.
1 lb.      flour         none.
2 oz.      lard          none.
12 oz.     butter        7 oz.
none.      rice pudding  1 lb.

and as the same writer remarks: "the officer's diet is still more liberal
than the pauper's; but evidently it is not considered liberal enough, for
a footnote is added to the officer's table saying that 'a cash payment of
two shillings and sixpence a week is also made to each resident officer
and servant.'  if the pauper has ample food, why does the officer have
more?  and if the officer has not too much, can the pauper be properly
fed on less than half the amount?"

but it is not alone the ghetto-dweller, the prisoner, and the pauper that
starve.  hodge, of the country, does not know what it is always to have a
full belly.  in truth, it is his empty belly which has driven him to the
city in such great numbers.  let us investigate the way of living of a
labourer from a parish in the bradfield poor law union, berks.  supposing
him to have two children, steady work, a rent-free cottage, and an
average weekly wage of thirteen shillings, which is equivalent to $3.25,
then here is his weekly budget:-

                                      s.  d.
bread (5 quarterns)                   1   10
flour (0.5 gallon)                    0   4
tea (0.25 lb.)                        0   6
butter (1 lb.)                        1   3
lard (1 lb.)                          0   6
sugar (6 lb.)                         1   0
bacon or other meat (about 0.25 lb.)  2   8
cheese (1 lb.)                        0   8
milk (half-tin condensed)             0   3.25
coal                                  1   6
beer                                  none
tobacco                               none
insurance ("prudential")              0   3
labourers' union                      0   1
wood, tools, dispensary, &c.          0   6
insurance ("foresters") and margin    1   1.75
        for clothes
total                                13   0

the guardians of the workhouse in the above union pride themselves on
their rigid economy.  it costs per pauper per week:-

               s.   d.
men            6    1.5
women          5    6.5
children       5    1.25

if the labourer whose budget has been described should quit his toil and
go into the workhouse, he would cost the guardians for

               s.   d.
himself        6    1.5
wife           5    6.5
two children  10    2.5
total         21    10.5
or roughly, $5.46

it would require more than a guinea for the workhouse to care for him and
his family, which he, somehow, manages to do on thirteen shillings.  and
in addition, it is an understood fact that it is cheaper to cater for a
large number of people--buying, cooking, and serving wholesale--than it
is to cater for a small number of people, say a family.

nevertheless, at the time this budget was compiled, there was in that
parish another family, not of four, but eleven persons, who had to live
on an income, not of thirteen shillings, but of twelve shillings per week
(eleven shillings in winter), and which had, not a rent-free cottage, but
a cottage for which it paid three shillings per week.

this must be understood, and understood clearly: _whatever is true of
london in the way of poverty and degradation, is true of all england_.
while paris is not by any means france, the city of london is england.
the frightful conditions which mark london an inferno likewise mark the
united kingdom an inferno.  the argument that the decentralisation of
london would ameliorate conditions is a vain thing and false.  if the
6,000,000 people of london were separated into one hundred cities each
with a population of 60,000, misery would be decentralised but not
diminished.  the sum of it would remain as large.

in this instance, mr. b. s. rowntree, by an exhaustive analysis, has
proved for the country town what mr. charles booth has proved for the
metropolis, that fully one-fourth of the dwellers are condemned to a
poverty which destroys them physically and spiritually; that fully one-
fourth of the dwellers do not have enough to eat, are inadequately
clothed, sheltered, and warmed in a rigorous climate, and are doomed to a
moral degeneracy which puts them lower than the savage in cleanliness and
decency.

after listening to the wail of an old irish peasant in kerry, robert
blatchford asked him what he wanted.  "the old man leaned upon his spade
and looked out across the black peat fields at the lowering skies.  'what
is it that i'm wantun?' he said; then in a deep plaintive tone he
continued, more to himself than to me, 'all our brave bhoys and dear
gurrls is away an' over the says, an' the agent has taken the pig off me,
an' the wet has spiled the praties, an' i'm an owld man, _an' i want the
day av judgment_.'"

the day of judgment!  more than he want it.  from all the land rises the
hunger wail, from ghetto and countryside, from prison and casual ward,
from asylum and workhouse--the cry of the people who have not enough to
eat.  millions of people, men, women, children, little babes, the blind,
the deaf, the halt, the sick, vagabonds and toilers, prisoners and
paupers, the people of ireland, england, scotland, wales, who have not
enough to eat.  and this, in face of the fact that five men can produce
bread for a thousand; that one workman can produce cotton cloth for 250
people, woollens for 300, and boots and shoes for 1000.  it would seem
that 40,000,000 people are keeping a big house, and that they are keeping
it badly.  the income is all right, but there is something criminally
wrong with the management.  and who dares to say that it is not
criminally mismanaged, this big house, when five men can produce bread
for a thousand, and yet millions have not enough to eat?




chapter xxvi--drink, temperance, and thrift


the english working classes may be said to be soaked in beer.  they are
made dull and sodden by it.  their efficiency is sadly impaired, and they
lose whatever imagination, invention, and quickness may be theirs by
right of race.  it may hardly be called an acquired habit, for they are
accustomed to it from their earliest infancy.  children are begotten in
drunkenness, saturated in drink before they draw their first breath, born
to the smell and taste of it, and brought up in the midst of it.

the public-house is ubiquitous.  it flourishes on every corner and
between corners, and it is frequented almost as much by women as by men.
children are to be found in it as well, waiting till their fathers and
mothers are ready to go home, sipping from the glasses of their elders,
listening to the coarse language and degrading conversation, catching the
contagion of it, familiarising themselves with licentiousness and
debauchery.

mrs. grundy rules as supremely over the workers as she does over the
bourgeoisie; but in the case of the workers, the one thing she does not
frown upon is the public-house.  no disgrace or shame attaches to it, nor
to the young woman or girl who makes a practice of entering it.

i remember a girl in a coffee-house saying, "i never drink spirits when
in a public-'ouse."  she was a young and pretty waitress, and she was
laying down to another waitress her pre-eminent respectability and
discretion.  mrs. grundy drew the line at spirits, but allowed that it
was quite proper for a clean young girl to drink beer, and to go into a
public-house to drink it.

not only is this beer unfit for the people to drink, but too often the
men and women are unfit to drink it.  on the other hand, it is their very
unfitness that drives them to drink it.  ill-fed, suffering from
innutrition and the evil effects of overcrowding and squalor, their
constitutions develop a morbid craving for the drink, just as the sickly
stomach of the overstrung manchester factory operative hankers after
excessive quantities of pickles and similar weird foods.  unhealthy
working and living engenders unhealthy appetites and desires.  man cannot
be worked worse than a horse is worked, and be housed and fed as a pig is
housed and fed, and at the same time have clean and wholesome ideals and
aspirations.

as home-life vanishes, the public-house appears.  not only do men and
women abnormally crave drink, who are overworked, exhausted, suffering
from deranged stomachs and bad sanitation, and deadened by the ugliness
and monotony of existence, but the gregarious men and women who have no
home-life flee to the bright and clattering public-house in a vain
attempt to express their gregariousness.  and when a family is housed in
one small room, home-life is impossible.

a brief examination of such a dwelling will serve to bring to light one
important cause of drunkenness.  here the family arises in the morning,
dresses, and makes its toilet, father, mother, sons, and daughters, and
in the same room, shoulder to shoulder (for the room is small), the wife
and mother cooks the breakfast.  and in the same room, heavy and
sickening with the exhalations of their packed bodies throughout the
night, that breakfast is eaten.  the father goes to work, the elder
children go to school or into the street, and the mother remains with her
crawling, toddling youngsters to do her housework--still in the same
room.  here she washes the clothes, filling the pent space with soapsuds
and the smell of dirty clothes, and overhead she hangs the wet linen to
dry.

here, in the evening, amid the manifold smells of the day, the family
goes to its virtuous couch.  that is to say, as many as possible pile
into the one bed (if bed they have), and the surplus turns in on the
floor.  and this is the round of their existence, month after month, year
after year, for they never get a vacation save when they are evicted.
when a child dies, and some are always bound to die, since fifty-five per
cent. of the east end children die before they are five years old, the
body is laid out in the same room.  and if they are very poor, it is kept
for some time until they can bury it.  during the day it lies on the bed;
during the night, when the living take the bed, the dead occupies the
table, from which, in the morning, when the dead is put back into the
bed, they eat their breakfast.  sometimes the body is placed on the shelf
which serves as a pantry for their food.  only a couple of weeks ago, an
east end woman was in trouble, because, in this fashion, being unable to
bury it, she had kept her dead child three weeks.

now such a room as i have described is not home but horror; and the men
and women who flee away from it to the public-house are to be pitied, not
blamed.  there are 300,000 people, in london, divided into families that
live in single rooms, while there are 900,000 who are illegally housed
according to the public health act of 1891--a respectable
recruiting-ground for the drink traffic.

then there are the insecurity of happiness, the precariousness of
existence, the well-founded fear of the future--potent factors in driving
people to drink.  wretchedness squirms for alleviation, and in the public-
house its pain is eased and forgetfulness is obtained.  it is unhealthy.
certainly it is, but everything else about their lives is unhealthy,
while this brings the oblivion that nothing else in their lives can
bring.  it even exalts them, and makes them feel that they are finer and
better, though at the same time it drags them down and makes them more
beastly than ever.  for the unfortunate man or woman, it is a race
between miseries that ends with death.

it is of no avail to preach temperance and teetotalism to these people.
the drink habit may be the cause of many miseries; but it is, in turn,
the effect of other and prior miseries.  the temperance advocates may
preach their hearts out over the evils of drink, but until the evils that
cause people to drink are abolished, drink and its evils will remain.

until the people who try to help realise this, their well-intentioned
efforts will be futile, and they will present a spectacle fit only to set
olympus laughing.  i have gone through an exhibition of japanese art, got
up for the poor of whitechapel with the idea of elevating them, of
begetting in them yearnings for the beautiful and true and good.  granting
(what is not so) that the poor folk are thus taught to know and yearn
after the beautiful and true and good, the foul facts of their existence
and the social law that dooms one in three to a public-charity death,
demonstrate that this knowledge and yearning will be only so much of an
added curse to them.  they will have so much more to forget than if they
had never known and yearned.  did destiny to-day bind me down to the life
of an east end slave for the rest of my years, and did destiny grant me
but one wish, i should ask that i might forget all about the beautiful
and true and good; that i might forget all i had learned from the open
books, and forget the people i had known, the things i had heard, and the
lands i had seen.  and if destiny didn't grant it, i am pretty confident
that i should get drunk and forget it as often as possible.

these people who try to help!  their college settlements, missions,
charities, and what not, are failures.  in the nature of things they
cannot but be failures.  they are wrongly, though sincerely, conceived.
they approach life through a misunderstanding of life, these good folk.
they do not understand the west end, yet they come down to the east end
as teachers and savants.  they do not understand the simple sociology of
christ, yet they come to the miserable and the despised with the pomp of
social redeemers.  they have worked faithfully, but beyond relieving an
infinitesimal fraction of misery and collecting a certain amount of data
which might otherwise have been more scientifically and less expensively
collected, they have achieved nothing.

as some one has said, they do everything for the poor except get off
their backs.  the very money they dribble out in their child's schemes
has been wrung from the poor.  they come from a race of successful and
predatory bipeds who stand between the worker and his wages, and they try
to tell the worker what he shall do with the pitiful balance left to him.
of what use, in the name of god, is it to establish nurseries for women
workers, in which, for instance, a child is taken while the mother makes
violets in islington at three farthings a gross, when more children and
violet-makers than they can cope with are being born right along?  this
violet-maker handles each flower four times, 576 handlings for three
farthings, and in the day she handles the flowers 6912 times for a wage
of ninepence.  she is being robbed.  somebody is on her back, and a
yearning for the beautiful and true and good will not lighten her burden.
they do nothing for her, these dabblers; and what they do not do for the
mother, undoes at night, when the child comes home, all that they have
done for the child in the day.

and one and all, they join in teaching a fundamental lie.  they do not
know it is a lie, but their ignorance does not make it more of a truth.
and the lie they preach is "thrift."  an instant will demonstrate it.  in
overcrowded london, the struggle for a chance to work is keen, and
because of this struggle wages sink to the lowest means of subsistence.
to be thrifty means for a worker to spend less than his income--in other
words, to live on less.  this is equivalent to a lowering of the standard
of living.  in the competition for a chance to work, the man with a lower
standard of living will underbid the man with a higher standard.  and a
small group of such thrifty workers in any overcrowded industry will
permanently lower the wages of that industry.  and the thrifty ones will
no longer be thrifty, for their income will have been reduced till it
balances their expenditure.

in short, thrift negates thrift.  if every worker in england should heed
the preachers of thrift and cut expenditure in half, the condition of
there being more men to work than there is work to do would swiftly cut
wages in half.  and then none of the workers of england would be thrifty,
for they would be living up to their diminished incomes.  the
short-sighted thrift-preachers would naturally be astounded at the
outcome.  the measure of their failure would be precisely the measure of
the success of their propaganda.  and, anyway, it is sheer bosh and
nonsense to preach thrift to the 1,800,000 london workers who are divided
into families which have a total income of less than 21s. per week, one
quarter to one half of which must be paid for rent.

concerning the futility of the people who try to help, i wish to make one
notable, noble exception, namely, the dr. barnardo homes.  dr. barnardo
is a child-catcher.  first, he catches them when they are young, before
they are set, hardened, in the vicious social mould; and then he sends
them away to grow up and be formed in another and better social mould.  up
to date he has sent out of the country 13,340 boys, most of them to
canada, and not one in fifty has failed.  a splendid record, when it is
considered that these lads are waifs and strays, homeless and parentless,
jerked out from the very bottom of the abyss, and forty-nine out of fifty
of them made into men.

every twenty-four hours in the year dr. barnardo snatches nine waifs from
the streets; so the enormous field he has to work in may be comprehended.
the people who try to help have something to learn from him.  he does not
play with palliatives.  he traces social viciousness and misery to their
sources.  he removes the progeny of the gutter-folk from their
pestilential environment, and gives them a healthy, wholesome environment
in which to be pressed and prodded and moulded into men.

when the people who try to help cease their playing and dabbling with day
nurseries and japanese art exhibits and go back and learn their west end
and the sociology of christ, they will be in better shape to buckle down
to the work they ought to be doing in the world.  and if they do buckle
down to the work, they will follow dr. barnardo's lead, only on a scale
as large as the nation is large.  they won't cram yearnings for the
beautiful, and true, and good down the throat of the woman making violets
for three farthings a gross, but they will make somebody get off her back
and quit cramming himself till, like the romans, he must go to a bath and
sweat it out.  and to their consternation, they will find that they will
have to get off that woman's back themselves, as well as the backs of a
few other women and children they did not dream they were riding upon.




chapter xxvii--the management


in this final chapter it were well to look at the social abyss in its
widest aspect, and to put certain questions to civilisation, by the
answers to which civilisation must stand or fall.  for instance, has
civilisation bettered the lot of man?  "man," i use in its democratic
sense, meaning the average man.  so the question re-shapes itself: _has
civilisation bettered the lot of the average man_?

let us see.  in alaska, along the banks of the yukon river, near its
mouth, live the innuit folk.  they are a very primitive people,
manifesting but mere glimmering adumbrations of that tremendous artifice,
civilisation.  their capital amounts possibly to 2 pounds per head.  they
hunt and fish for their food with bone-headed spews and arrows.  they
never suffer from lack of shelter.  their clothes, largely made from the
skins of animals, are warm.  they always have fuel for their fires,
likewise timber for their houses, which they build partly underground,
and in which they lie snugly during the periods of intense cold.  in the
summer they live in tents, open to every breeze and cool.  they are
healthy, and strong, and happy.  their one problem is food.  they have
their times of plenty and times of famine.  in good times they feast; in
bad times they die of starvation.  but starvation, as a chronic
condition, present with a large number of them all the time, is a thing
unknown.  further, they have no debts.

in the united kingdom, on the rim of the western ocean, live the english
folk.  they are a consummately civilised people.  their capital amounts
to at least 300 pounds per head.  they gain their food, not by hunting
and fishing, but by toil at colossal artifices.  for the most part, they
suffer from lack of shelter.  the greater number of them are vilely
housed, do not have enough fuel to keep them warm, and are insufficiently
clothed.  a constant number never have any houses at all, and sleep
shelterless under the stars.  many are to be found, winter and summer,
shivering on the streets in their rags.  they have good times and bad.  in
good times most of them manage to get enough to eat, in bad times they
die of starvation.  they are dying now, they were dying yesterday and
last year, they will die to-morrow and next year, of starvation; for
they, unlike the innuit, suffer from a chronic condition of starvation.
there are 40,000,000 of the english folk, and 939 out of every 1000 of
them die in poverty, while a constant army of 8,000,000 struggles on the
ragged edge of starvation.  further, each babe that is born, is born in
debt to the sum of 22 pounds.  this is because of an artifice called the
national debt.

in a fair comparison of the average innuit and the average englishman, it
will be seen that life is less rigorous for the innuit; that while the
innuit suffers only during bad times from starvation, the englishman
suffers during good times as well; that no innuit lacks fuel, clothing,
or housing, while the englishman is in perpetual lack of these three
essentials.  in this connection it is well to instance the judgment of a
man such as huxley.  from the knowledge gained as a medical officer in
the east end of london, and as a scientist pursuing investigations among
the most elemental savages, he concludes, "were the alternative presented
to me, i would deliberately prefer the life of the savage to that of
those people of christian london."

the creature comforts man enjoys are the products of man's labour.  since
civilisation has failed to give the average englishman food and shelter
equal to that enjoyed by the innuit, the question arises: _has
civilisation increased the producing power of the average man_?  if it
has not increased man's producing power, then civilisation cannot stand.

but, it will be instantly admitted, civilisation has increased man's
producing power.  five men can produce bread for a thousand.  one man can
produce cotton cloth for 250 people, woollens for 300, and boots and
shoes for 1000.  yet it has been shown throughout the pages of this book
that english folk by the millions do not receive enough food, clothes,
and boots.  then arises the third and inexorable question: _if
civilisation has increased the producing power of the average man, why
has it not bettered the lot of the average man_?

there can be one answer only--mismanagement.  civilisation has made
possible all manner of creature comforts and heart's delights.  in these
the average englishman does not participate.  if he shall be forever
unable to participate, then civilisation falls.  there is no reason for
the continued existence of an artifice so avowed a failure.  but it is
impossible that men should have reared this tremendous artifice in vain.
it stuns the intellect.  to acknowledge so crushing a defeat is to give
the death-blow to striving and progress.

one other alternative, and one other only, presents itself.  _civilisation
must be compelled to better the lot of the average men_.  this accepted,
it becomes at once a question of business management.  things profitable
must be continued; things unprofitable must be eliminated.  either the
empire is a profit to england, or it is a loss.  if it is a loss, it must
be done away with.  if it is a profit, it must be managed so that the
average man comes in for a share of the profit.

if the struggle for commercial supremacy is profitable, continue it.  if
it is not, if it hurts the worker and makes his lot worse than the lot of
a savage, then fling foreign markets and industrial empire overboard.  for
it is a patent fact that if 40,000,000 people, aided by civilisation,
possess a greater individual producing power than the innuit, then those
40,000,000 people should enjoy more creature comforts and heart's
delights than the innuits enjoy.

if the 400,000 english gentlemen, "of no occupation," according to their
own statement in the census of 1881, are unprofitable, do away with them.
set them to work ploughing game preserves and planting potatoes.  if they
are profitable, continue them by all means, but let it be seen to that
the average englishman shares somewhat in the profits they produce by
working at no occupation.

in short, society must be reorganised, and a capable management put at
the head.  that the present management is incapable, there can be no
discussion.  it has drained the united kingdom of its life-blood.  it has
enfeebled the stay-at-home folk till they are unable longer to struggle
in the van of the competing nations.  it has built up a west end and an
east end as large as the kingdom is large, in which one end is riotous
and rotten, the other end sickly and underfed.

a vast empire is foundering on the hands of this incapable management.
and by empire is meant the political machinery which holds together the
english-speaking people of the world outside of the united states.  nor
is this charged in a pessimistic spirit.  blood empire is greater than
political empire, and the english of the new world and the antipodes are
strong and vigorous as ever.  but the political empire under which they
are nominally assembled is perishing.  the political machine known as the
british empire is running down.  in the hands of its management it is
losing momentum every day.

it is inevitable that this management, which has grossly and criminally
mismanaged, shall be swept away.  not only has it been wasteful and
inefficient, but it has misappropriated the funds.  every worn-out, pasty-
faced pauper, every blind man, every prison babe, every man, woman, and
child whose belly is gnawing with hunger pangs, is hungry because the
funds have been misappropriated by the management.

nor can one member of this managing class plead not guilty before the
judgment bar of man.  "the living in their houses, and in their graves
the dead," are challenged by every babe that dies of innutrition, by
every girl that flees the sweater's den to the nightly promenade of
piccadilly, by every worked-out toiler that plunges into the canal.  the
food this managing class eats, the wine it drinks, the shows it makes,
and the fine clothes it wears, are challenged by eight million mouths
which have never had enough to fill them, and by twice eight million
bodies which have never been sufficiently clothed and housed.

there can be no mistake.  civilisation has increased man's producing
power an hundred-fold, and through mismanagement the men of civilisation
live worse than the beasts, and have less to eat and wear and protect
them from the elements than the savage innuit in a frigid climate who
lives to-day as he lived in the stone age ten thousand years ago.




challenge


i have a vague remembrance
   of a story that is told
in some ancient spanish legend
   or chronicle of old.

it was when brave king sanche
   was before zamora slain,
and his great besieging army
   lay encamped upon the plain.

don diego de ordenez
   sallied forth in front of all,
and shouted loud his challenge
   to the warders on the wall.

all the people of zamora,
   both the born and the unborn,
as traitors did he challenge
   with taunting words of scorn.

the living in their houses,
   and in their graves the dead,
and the waters in their rivers,
   and their wine, and oil, and bread.

there is a greater army
   that besets us round with strife,
a starving, numberless army
   at all the gates of life.

the poverty-stricken millions
   who challenge our wine and bread,
and impeach us all as traitors,
   both the living and the dead.

and whenever i sit at the banquet,
   where the feast and song are high,
amid the mirth and music
   i can hear that fearful cry.

and hollow and haggard faces
   look into the lighted hall,
and wasted hands are extended
   to catch the crumbs that fall

and within there is light and plenty,
   and odours fill the air;
but without there is cold and darkness,
   and hunger and despair.

and there in the camp of famine,
   in wind, and cold, and rain,
christ, the great lord of the army,
   lies dead upon the plain.

the way led along upon what had once been the embankment of a railroad.
but no train had run upon it for many years. the forest on either side
swelled up the slopes of the embankment and crested across it in a green
wave of trees and bushes. the trail was as narrow as a man's body, and
was no more than a wild-animal runway. occasionally, a piece of rusty
iron, showing through the forest-mould, advertised that the rail and the
ties still remained. in one place, a ten-inch tree, bursting through at
a connection, had lifted the end of a rail clearly into view. the tie
had evidently followed the rail, held to it by the spike long enough
for its bed to be filled with gravel and rotten leaves, so that now the
crumbling, rotten timber thrust itself up at a curious slant. old as the
road was, it was manifest that it had been of the mono-rail type.

an old man and a boy travelled along this runway. they moved slowly, for
the old man was very old, a touch of palsy made his movements tremulous,
and he leaned heavily upon his staff. a rude skull-cap of goat-skin
protected his head from the sun. from beneath this fell a scant fringe
of stained and dirty-white hair. a visor, ingeniously made from a large
leaf, shielded his eyes, and from under this he peered at the way of
his feet on the trail. his beard, which should have been snow-white
but which showed the same weather-wear and camp-stain as his hair,
fell nearly to his waist in a great tangled mass. about his chest and
shoulders hung a single, mangy garment of goat-skin. his arms and legs,
withered and skinny, betokened extreme age, as well as did their sunburn
and scars and scratches betoken long years of exposure to the elements.

the boy, who led the way, checking the eagerness of his muscles to
the slow progress of the elder, likewise wore a single garment--a
ragged-edged piece of bear-skin, with a hole in the middle through which
he had thrust his head. he could not have been more than twelve years
old. tucked coquettishly over one ear was the freshly severed tail of a
pig. in one hand he carried a medium-sized bow and an arrow.

on his back was a quiverful of arrows. from a sheath hanging about his
neck on a thong, projected the battered handle of a hunting knife. he
was as brown as a berry, and walked softly, with almost a catlike tread.
in marked contrast with his sunburned skin were his eyes--blue, deep
blue, but keen and sharp as a pair of gimlets. they seemed to bore into
aft about him in a way that was habitual. as he went along he smelled
things, as well, his distended, quivering nostrils carrying to his brain
an endless series of messages from the outside world. also, his hearing
was acute, and had been so trained that it operated automatically.
without conscious effort, he heard all the slight sounds in the apparent
quiet--heard, and differentiated, and classified these sounds--whether
they were of the wind rustling the leaves, of the humming of bees and
gnats, of the distant rumble of the sea that drifted to him only in
lulls, or of the gopher, just under his foot, shoving a pouchful of
earth into the entrance of his hole.

suddenly he became alertly tense. sound, sight, and odor had given him
a simultaneous warning. his hand went back to the old man, touching
him, and the pair stood still. ahead, at one side of the top of the
embankment, arose a crackling sound, and the boy's gaze was fixed on the
tops of the agitated bushes. then a large bear, a grizzly, crashed into
view, and likewise stopped abruptly, at sight of the humans. he did not
like them, and growled querulously. slowly the boy fitted the arrow to
the bow, and slowly he pulled the bowstring taut. but he never removed
his eyes from the bear.

[illustration: slowly he pulled the bowstring taut 020]

the old man peered from under his green leaf at the danger, and stood as
quietly as the boy. for a few seconds this mutual scrutinizing went
on; then, the bear betraying a growing irritability, the boy, with a
movement of his head, indicated that the old man must step aside from
the trail and go down the embankment. the boy followed, going backward,
still holding the bow taut and ready. they waited till a crashing among
the bushes from the opposite side of the embankment told them the bear
had gone on. the boy grinned as he led back to the trail.

“a big un, granser,” he chuckled.

the old man shook his head.

“they get thicker every day,” he complained in a thin, undependable
falsetto. “who'd have thought i'd live to see the time when a man would
be afraid of his life on the way to the cliff house. when i was a boy,
edwin, men and women and little babies used to come out here from san
francisco by tens of thousands on a nice day. and there weren't any
bears then. no, sir. they used to pay money to look at them in cages,
they were that rare.”

“what is money, granser?”

before the old man could answer, the boy recollected and triumphantly
shoved his hand into a pouch under his bear-skin and pulled forth a
battered and tarnished silver dollar. the old man's eyes glistened, as
he held the coin close to them.

“i can't see,” he muttered. “you look and see if you can make out the
date, edwin.”

the boy laughed.

“you're a great granser,” he cried delightedly, “always making believe
them little marks mean something.”

the old man manifested an accustomed chagrin as he brought the coin back
again close to his own eyes.

“2012,” he shrilled, and then fell to cackling grotesquely. “that was
the year morgan the fifth was appointed president of the united states
by the board of magnates. it must have been one of the last coins
minted, for the scarlet death came in 2013. lord! lord!--think of it!
sixty years ago, and i am the only person alive to-day that lived in
those times. where did you find it, edwin?”

the boy, who had been regarding him with the tolerant curiousness one
accords to the prattlings of the feeble-minded, answered promptly.

“i got it off of hoo-hoo. he found it when we was herdin' goats down
near san josé last spring. hoo-hoo said it was _money_. ain't you
hungry, granser?”

the ancient caught his staff in a tighter grip and urged along the
trail, his old eyes shining greedily.

“i hope har-lip 's found a crab... or two,” he mumbled. “they're good
eating, crabs, mighty good eating when you've no more teeth and you've
got grandsons that love their old grandsire and make a point of catching
crabs for him. when i was a boy--”

but edwin, suddenly stopped by what he saw, was drawing the bowstring
on a fitted arrow. he had paused on the brink of a crevasse in the
embankment. an ancient culvert had here washed out, and the stream, no
longer confined, had cut a passage through the fill. on the opposite
side, the end of a rail projected and overhung. it showed rustily
through the creeping vines which overran it. beyond, crouching by a
bush, a rabbit looked across at him in trembling hesitancy. fully fifty
feet was the distance, but the arrow flashed true; and the transfixed
rabbit, crying out in sudden fright and hurt, struggled painfully away
into the brush. the boy himself was a flash of brown skin and flying fur
as he bounded down the steep wall of the gap and up the other side.
his lean muscles were springs of steel that released into graceful
and efficient action. a hundred feet beyond, in a tangle of bushes,
he overtook the wounded creature, knocked its head on a convenient
tree-trunk, and turned it over to granser to carry.

[illustration: rabbit is good, very good 026]

“rabbit is good, very good,” the ancient quavered, “but when it comes to
a toothsome delicacy i prefer crab. when i was a boy--”

“why do you say so much that ain't got no sense?” edwin impatiently
interrupted the other's threatened garrulousness.

the boy did not exactly utter these words, but something that remotely
resembled them and that was more guttural and explosive and economical
of qualifying phrases. his speech showed distant kinship with that of
the old man, and the latter's speech was approximately an english that
had gone through a bath of corrupt usage.

“what i want to know,” edwin continued, “is why you call crab 'toothsome
delicacy'? crab is crab, ain't it? no one i never heard calls it such
funny things.”

the old man sighed but did not answer, and they moved on in silence.
the surf grew suddenly louder, as they emerged from the forest upon a
stretch of sand dunes bordering the sea. a few goats were browsing among
the sandy hillocks, and a skin-clad boy, aided by a wolfish-looking
dog that was only faintly reminiscent of a collie, was watching them.
mingled with the roar of the surf was a continuous, deep-throated
barking or bellowing, which came from a cluster of jagged rocks a
hundred yards out from shore. here huge sea-lions hauled themselves
up to lie in the sun or battle with one another. in the immediate
foreground arose the smoke of a fire, tended by a third savage-looking
boy. crouched near him were several wolfish dogs similar to the one that
guarded the goats.

the old man accelerated his pace, sniffing eagerly as he neared the
fire.

“mussels!” he muttered ecstatically. “mussels! and ain't that a crab,
hoo-hoo? ain't that a crab? my, my, you boys are good to your old
grandsire.”

hoo-hoo, who was apparently of the same age as edwin, grinned.

“all you want, granser. i got four.”

the old man's palsied eagerness was pitiful. sitting down in the sand as
quickly as his stiff limbs would let him, he poked a large rock-mussel
from out of the coals. the heat had forced its shells apart, and
the meat, salmon-colored, was thoroughly cooked. between thumb and
forefinger, in trembling haste, he caught the morsel and carried it
to his mouth. but it was too hot, and the next moment was violently
ejected. the old man spluttered with the pain, and tears ran out of his
eyes and down his cheeks.

the boys were true savages, possessing only the cruel humor of the
savage. to them the incident was excruciatingly funny, and they burst
into loud laughter. hoo-hoo danced up and down, while edwin rolled
gleefully on the ground. the boy with the goats came running to join in
the fun.

“set 'em to cool, edwin, set 'em to cool,” the old man besought, in the
midst of his grief, making no attempt to wipe away the tears that
still flowed from his eyes. “and cool a crab, edwin, too. you know your
grandsire likes crabs.”

from the coals arose a great sizzling, which proceeded from the many
mussels bursting open their shells and exuding their moisture. they were
large shellfish, running from three to six inches in length. the boys
raked them out with sticks and placed them on a large piece of driftwood
to cool.

“when i was a boy, we did not laugh at our elders; we respected them.”

the boys took no notice, and granser continued to babble an incoherent
flow of complaint and censure. but this time he was more careful, and
did not burn his mouth. all began to eat, using nothing but their hands
and making loud mouth-noises and lip-smackings. the third boy, who was
called hare-lip, slyly deposited a pinch of sand on a mussel the ancient
was carrying to his mouth; and when the grit of it bit into the old
fellow's mucous membrane and gums, the laughter was again uproarious. he
was unaware that a joke had been played on him, and spluttered and spat
until edwin, relenting, gave him a gourd of fresh water with which to
wash out his mouth.

“where's them crabs, hoo-hoo?” edwin demanded. “granser's set upon
having a snack.”

again granser's eyes burned with greediness as a large crab was handed
to him. it was a shell with legs and all complete, but the meat had long
since departed. with shaky fingers and babblings of anticipation, the
old man broke off a leg and found it filled with emptiness.

“the crabs, hoo-hoo?” he wailed. “the crabs?”

“i was fooling granser. they ain't no crabs! i never found one.”

the boys were overwhelmed with delight at sight of the tears of senile
disappointment that dribbled down the old man's cheeks. then, unnoticed,
hoo-hoo replaced the empty shell with a fresh-cooked crab. already
dismembered, from the cracked legs the white meat sent forth a small
cloud of savory steam. this attracted the old man's nostrils, and he
looked down in amazement.

[illustration: this attracted the old man's nostrils 033]

the change of his mood to one of joy was immediate. he snuffled and
muttered and mumbled, making almost a croon of delight, as he began
to eat. of this the boys took little notice, for it was an accustomed
spectacle. nor did they notice his occasional exclamations and
utterances of phrases which meant nothing to them, as, for instance,
when he smacked his lips and champed his gums while muttering:
“mayonnaise! just think--mayonnaise! and it's sixty years since the last
was ever made! two generations and never a smell of it! why, in those
days it was served in every restaurant with crab.”

when he could eat no more, the old man sighed, wiped his hands on his
naked legs, and gazed out over the sea. with the content of a full
stomach, he waxed reminiscent.

“to think of it! i've seen this beach alive with men, women, and
children on a pleasant sunday. and there weren't any bears to eat them
up, either. and right up there on the cliff was a big restaurant where
you could get anything you wanted to eat. four million people lived in
san francisco then. and now, in the whole city and county there aren't
forty all told. and out there on the sea were ships and ships always to
be seen, going in for the golden gate or coming out. and airships in the
air--dirigibles and flying machines. they could travel two hundred miles
an hour. the mail contracts with the new york and san francisco limited
demanded that for the minimum. there was a chap, a frenchman, i forget
his name, who succeeded in making three hundred; but the thing was
risky, too risky for conservative persons. but he was on the right clew,
and he would have managed it if it hadn't been for the great plague.
when i was a boy, there were men alive who remembered the coming of the
first aeroplanes, and now i have lived to see the last of them, and that
sixty years ago.”

the old man babbled on, unheeded by the boys, who were long accustomed
to his garrulousness, and whose vocabularies, besides, lacked the
greater portion of the words he used. it was noticeable that in these
rambling soliloquies his english seemed to recrudesce into better
construction and phraseology. but when he talked directly with the boys
it lapsed, largely, into their own uncouth and simpler forms.

“but there weren't many crabs in those days,” the old man wandered on.
“they were fished out, and they were great delicacies. the open season
was only a month long, too. and now crabs are accessible the whole year
around. think of it--catching all the crabs you want, any time you want,
in the surf of the cliff house beach!”

a sudden commotion among the goats brought the boys to their feet. the
dogs about the fire rushed to join their snarling fellow who guarded the
goats, while the goats themselves stampeded in the direction of their
human protectors. a half dozen forms, lean and gray, glided about on the
sand hillocks and faced the bristling dogs. edwin arched an arrow that
fell short. but hare-lip, with a sling such as david carried into battle
against goliath, hurled a stone through the air that whistled from the
speed of its flight. it fell squarely among the wolves and caused them
to slink away toward the dark depths of the eucalyptus forest.

[illustration: with a sling such as david carried 036]

the boys laughed and lay down again in the sand, while granser sighed
ponderously. he had eaten too much, and, with hands clasped on his
paunch, the fingers interlaced, he resumed his maunderings.

“'the fleeting systems lapse like foam,'” he mumbled what was evidently
a quotation. “that's it--foam, and fleeting. all man's toil upon the
planet was just so much foam. he domesticated the serviceable animals,
destroyed the hostile ones, and cleared the land of its wild vegetation.
and then he passed, and the flood of primordial life rolled back again,
sweeping his handiwork away--the weeds and the forest inundated his
fields, the beasts of prey swept over his flocks, and now there are
wolves on the cliff house beach.” he was appalled by the thought. “where
four million people disported themselves, the wild wolves roam to-day,
and the savage progeny of our loins, with prehistoric weapons, defend
themselves against the fanged despoilers. think of it! and all because
of the scarlet death--”

the adjective had caught hare-lip's ear.

“he's always saying that,” he said to edwin. “what is _scarlet?_”

“'the scarlet of the maples can shake me like the cry of bugles going
by,'” the old man quoted.

“it's red,” edwin answered the question. “and you don't know it because
you come from the chauffeur tribe. they never did know nothing, none of
them. scarlet is red--i know that.”

“red is red, ain't it?” hare-lip grumbled. “then what's the good of
gettin' cocky and calling it scarlet?”

“granser, what for do you always say so much what nobody knows?” he
asked. “scarlet ain't anything, but red is red. why don't you say red,
then?”

“red is not the right word,” was the reply. “the plague was scarlet.
the whole face and body turned scarlet in an hour's time. don't i
know? didn't i see enough of it? and i am telling you it was scarlet
because--well, because it _was_ scarlet. there is no other word for it.”

“red is good enough for me,” hare-lip muttered obstinately. “my dad
calls red red, and he ought to know. he says everybody died of the red
death.”

“your dad is a common fellow, descended from a common fellow,” granser
retorted heatedly. “don't i know the beginnings of the chauffeurs? your
grandsire was a chauffeur, a servant, and without education. he worked
for other persons. but your grandmother was of good stock, only the
children did not take after her. don't i remember when i first met them,
catching fish at lake temescal?”

“what is _education?_” edwin asked.

“calling red scarlet,” hare-lip sneered, then returned to the attack on
granser. “my dad told me, an' he got it from his dad afore he croaked,
that your wife was a santa rosan, an' that she was sure no account. he
said she was a _hash-slinger_ before the red death, though i don't know
what a _hash-slinger_ is. you can tell me, edwin.”

but edwin shook his head in token of ignorance.

“it is true, she was a waitress,” granser acknowledged. “but she was a
good woman, and your mother was her daughter. women were very scarce in
the days after the plague. she was the only wife i could find, even if
she was a _hash-slinger_, as your father calls it. but it is not nice to
talk about our progenitors that way.”

“dad says that the wife of the first chauffeur was a _lady_--”

“what's a _lady?_” hoo-hoo demanded.

“a _lady_ 's a chauffeur squaw,” was the quick reply of hare-lip.

“the first chauffeur was bill, a common fellow, as i said before,” the
old man expounded; “but his wife was a lady, a great lady. before the
scarlet death she was the wife of van worden. he was president of the
board of industrial magnates, and was one of the dozen men who
ruled america. he was worth one billion, eight hundred millions of
dollars--coins like you have there in your pouch, edwin. and then came
the scarlet death, and his wife became the wife of bill, the first
chauffeur. he used to beat her, too. i have seen it myself.”

hoo-hoo, lying on his stomach and idly digging his toes in the sand,
cried out and investigated, first, his toe-nail, and next, the small
hole he had dug. the other two boys joined him, excavating the sand
rapidly with their hands till there lay three skeletons exposed. two
were of adults, the third being that of a part-grown child. the old man
hudged along on the ground and peered at the find.

“plague victims,” he announced. “that's the way they died everywhere
in the last days. this must have been a family, running away from the
contagion and perishing here on the cliff house beach. they--what are
you doing, edwin?”

this question was asked in sudden dismay, as edwin, using the back of
his hunting knife, began to knock out the teeth from the jaws of one of
the skulls.

“going to string 'em,” was the response.

the three boys were now hard at it; and quite a knocking and hammering
arose, in which granser babbled on unnoticed.

“you are true savages. already has begun the custom of wearing human
teeth. in another generation you will be perforating your noses and
ears and wearing ornaments of bone and shell. i know. the human race
is doomed to sink back farther and farther into the primitive night
ere again it begins its bloody climb upward to civilization. when we
increase and feel the lack of room, we will proceed to kill one another.
and then i suppose you will wear human scalp-locks at your waist, as
well--as you, edwin, who are the gentlest of my grandsons, have already
begun with that vile pigtail. throw it away, edwin, boy; throw it away.”

“what a gabble the old geezer makes,” hare-lip remarked, when, the teeth
all extracted, they began an attempt at equal division.

they were very quick and abrupt in their actions, and their speech, in
moments of hot discussion over the allotment of the choicer teeth, was
truly a gabble. they spoke in monosyllables and short jerky sentences
that was more a gibberish than a language. and yet, through it ran hints
of grammatical construction, and appeared vestiges of the conjugation
of some superior culture. even the speech of granser was so corrupt that
were it put down literally it would be almost so much nonsense to the
reader. this, however, was when he talked with the boys.

when he got into the full swing of babbling to himself, it slowly purged
itself into pure english. the sentences grew longer and were enunciated
with a rhythm and ease that was reminiscent of the lecture platform.

“tell us about the red death, granser,” hare-lip demanded, when the
teeth affair had been satisfactorily concluded.

“the scarlet death,” edwin corrected.

“an' don't work all that funny lingo on us,” hare-lip went on. “talk
sensible, granser, like a santa rosan ought to talk. other santa rosans
don't talk like you.”




ii

the old man showed pleasure in being thus called upon. he cleared his
throat and began.

“twenty or thirty years ago my story was in great demand. but in these
days nobody seems interested--”

“there you go!” hare-lip cried hotly. “cut out the funny stuff and talk
sensible. what's _interested?_ you talk like a baby that don't know
how.”

“let him alone,” edwin urged, “or he'll get mad and won't talk at all.
skip the funny places. we'll catch on to some of what he tells us.”

“let her go, granser,” hoo-hoo encouraged; for the old man was already
maundering about the disrespect for elders and the reversion to cruelty
of all humans that fell from high culture to primitive conditions.

the tale began.

“there were very many people in the world in those days. san francisco
alone held four millions--”

“what is millions?” edwin interrupted.

granser looked at him kindly.

“i know you cannot count beyond ten, so i will tell you. hold up your
two hands. on both of them you have altogether ten fingers and thumbs.
very well. i now take this grain of sand--you hold it, hoo-hoo.” he
dropped the grain of sand into the lad's palm and went on. “now that
grain of sand stands for the ten fingers of edwin. i add another grain.
that's ten more fingers. and i add another, and another, and another,
until i have added as many grains as edwin has fingers and thumbs. that
makes what i call one hundred. remember that word--one hundred. now i
put this pebble in hare-lip's hand. it stands for ten grains of sand, or
ten tens of fingers, or one hundred fingers. i put in ten pebbles. they
stand for a thousand fingers. i take a mussel-shell, and it stands for
ten pebbles, or one hundred grains of sand, or one thousand fingers....”
 and so on, laboriously, and with much reiteration, he strove to build
up in their minds a crude conception of numbers. as the quantities
increased, he had the boys holding different magnitudes in each of
their hands. for still higher sums, he laid the symbols on the log of
driftwood; and for symbols he was hard put, being compelled to use the
teeth from the skulls for millions, and the crab-shells for billions.
it was here that he stopped, for the boys were showing signs of becoming
tired.

“there were four million people in san francisco--four teeth.”

the boys' eyes ranged along from the teeth and from hand to hand, down
through the pebbles and sand-grains to edwin's fingers. and back again
they ranged along the ascending series in the effort to grasp such
inconceivable numbers.

“that was a lot of folks, granser,” edwin at last hazarded.

“like sand on the beach here, like sand on the beach, each grain of sand
a man, or woman, or child. yes, my boy, all those people lived right
here in san francisco. and at one time or another all those people
came out on this very beach--more people than there are grains of sand.
more--more--more. and san francisco was a noble city. and across the
bay--where we camped last year, even more people lived, clear from point
richmond, on the level ground and on the hills, all the way around to
san leandro--one great city of seven million people.--seven teeth...
there, that's it, seven millions.”

again the boys' eyes ranged up and down from edwin's fingers to the
teeth on the log.

“the world was full of people. the census of 2010 gave eight billions
for the whole world--eight crab-shells, yes, eight billions. it was not
like to-day. mankind knew a great deal more about getting food. and the
more food there was, the more people there were. in the year 1800, there
were one hundred and seventy millions in europe alone. one hundred years
later--a grain of sand, hoo-hoo--one hundred years later, at 1900, there
were five hundred millions in europe--five grains of sand, hoo-hoo, and
this one tooth. this shows how easy was the getting of food, and how men
increased. and in the year 2000 there were fifteen hundred millions
in europe. and it was the same all over the rest of the world. eight
crab-shells there, yes, eight billion people were alive on the earth
when the scarlet death began.

“i was a young man when the plague came--twenty-seven years old; and i
lived on the other side of san francisco bay, in berkeley. you remember
those great stone houses, edwin, when we came down the hills from contra
costa? that was where i lived, in those stone houses. i was a professor
of english literature.”

[illustration: i was a professor of english literature 054]

much of this was over the heads of the boys, but they strove to
comprehend dimly this tale of the past.

“what was them stone houses for?” hare-lip queried.

“you remember when your dad taught you to swim?” the boy nodded.
“well, in the university of california--that is the name we had for
the houses--we taught young men and women how to think, just as i have
taught you now, by sand and pebbles and shells, to know how many people
lived in those days. there was very much to teach. the young men and
women we taught were called students. we had large rooms in which we
taught. i talked to them, forty or fifty at a time, just as i am talking
to you now. i told them about the books other men had written before
their time, and even, sometimes, in their time--”

“was that all you did?--just talk, talk, talk?” hoo-hoo demanded. “who
hunted your meat for you? and milked the goats? and caught the fish?”

“a sensible question, hoo-hoo, a sensible question. as i have told you,
in those days food-getting was easy. we were very wise. a few men got
the food for many men. the other men did other things. as you say, i
talked. i talked all the time, and for this food was given me--much
food, fine food, beautiful food, food that i have not tasted in sixty
years and shall never taste again. i sometimes think the most wonderful
achievement of our tremendous civilization was food--its inconceivable
abundance, its infinite variety, its marvellous delicacy. o my
grandsons, life was life in those days, when we had such wonderful
things to eat.”

this was beyond the boys, and they let it slip by, words and thoughts,
as a mere senile wandering in the narrative.

“our food-getters were called _freemen_. this was a joke. we of the
ruling classes owned all the land, all the machines, everything. these
food-getters were our slaves. we took almost all the food they got, and
left them a little so that they might eat, and work, and get us more
food--”

“i'd have gone into the forest and got food for myself,” hare-lip
announced; “and if any man tried to take it away from me, i'd have
killed him.”

the old man laughed.

“did i not tell you that we of the ruling class owned all the land, all
the forest, everything? any food-getter who would not get food for us,
him we punished or compelled to starve to death. and very few did that.
they preferred to get food for us, and make clothes for us, and prepare
and administer to us a thousand--a mussel-shell, hoo-hoo--a thousand
satisfactions and delights. and i was professor smith in those
days--professor james howard smith. and my lecture courses were very
popular--that is, very many of the young men and women liked to hear me
talk about the books other men had written.

“and i was very happy, and i had beautiful things to eat. and my hands
were soft, because i did no work with them, and my body was clean
all over and dressed in the softest garments--

“he surveyed his mangy goat-skin with disgust.

“we did not wear such things in those days. even the slaves had better
garments. and we were most clean. we washed our faces and hands often
every day. you boys never wash unless you fall into the water or go
swimming.”

“neither do you granzer,” hoo-hoo retorted.

“i know, i know, i am a filthy old man, but times have changed. nobody
washes these days, there are no conveniences. it is sixty years since i
have seen a piece of soap.

[illustration: sixty years since i have seen a piece of soap. 059]

“you do not know what soap is, and i shall not tell you, for i am telling
the story of the scarlet death. you know what sickness is. we called
it a disease. very many of the diseases came from what we called germs.
remember that word--germs. a germ is a very small thing. it is like a
woodtick, such as you find on the dogs in the spring of the year when
they run in the forest. only the germ is very small. it is so small that
you cannot see it--”

hoo-hoo began to laugh.

“you're a queer un, granser, talking about things you can't see. if you
can't see 'em, how do you know they are? that's what i want to know. how
do you know anything you can't see?”

“a good question, a very good question, hoo-hoo. but we did see--some of
them. we had what we called microscopes and ultramicroscopes, and we put
them to our eyes and looked through them, so that we saw things larger
than they really were, and many things we could not see without the
microscopes at all. our best ultramicroscopes could make a germ look
forty thousand times larger. a mussel-shell is a thousand fingers like
edwin's. take forty mussel-shells, and by as many times larger was the
germ when we looked at it through a microscope. and after that, we
had other ways, by using what we called moving pictures, of making the
forty-thousand-times germ many, many thousand times larger still. and
thus we saw all these things which our eyes of themselves could not see.
take a grain of sand. break it into ten pieces. take one piece and break
it into ten. break one of those pieces into ten, and one of those into
ten, and one of those into ten, and one of those into ten, and do it all
day, and maybe, by sunset, you will have a piece as small as one of the
germs.” the boys were openly incredulous. hare-lip sniffed and sneered
and hoo-hoo snickered, until edwin nudged them to be silent.

“the woodtick sucks the blood of the dog, but the germ, being so very
small, goes right into the blood of the body, and there it has
many children. in those days there would be as many as a billion--a
crab-shell, please--as many as that crab-shell in one man's body. we
called germs micro-organisms. when a few million, or a billion, of them
were in a man, in all the blood of a man, he was sick. these germs were
a disease. there were many different kinds of them--more different kinds
than there are grains of sand on this beach. we knew only a few of the
kinds. the micro-organic world was an invisible world, a world we could
not see, and we knew very little about it. yet we did know something.
there was the _bacillus anthracis_; there was the _micrococcus_; there
was the _bacterium termo_, and the _bacterium lactis_--that's what
turns the goat milk sour even to this day, hare-lip; and there were
_schizomycetes_ without end. and there were many others....”

here the old man launched into a disquisition on germs and their
natures, using words and phrases of such extraordinary length and
meaninglessness, that the boys grinned at one another and looked out
over the deserted ocean till they forgot the old man was babbling on.

“but the scarlet death, granser,” edwin at last suggested.

granser recollected himself, and with a start tore himself away from the
rostrum of the lecture-hall, where, to another world audience, he
had been expounding the latest theory, sixty years gone, of germs and
germ-diseases.

“yes, yes, edwin; i had forgotten. sometimes the memory of the past is
very strong upon me, and i forget that i am a dirty old man, clad in
goat-skin, wandering with my savage grandsons who are goatherds in
the primeval wilderness. 'the fleeting systems lapse like foam,' and so
lapsed our glorious, colossal civilization. i am granser, a tired old
man. i belong to the tribe of santa rosans. i married into that tribe.
my sons and daughters married into the chauffeurs, the sacramen-tos, and
the palo-altos. you, hare-lip, are of the chauffeurs. you, edwin, are
of the sacramentos. and you, hoo-hoo, are of the palo-altos. your tribe
takes its name from a town that was near the seat of another great
institution of learning. it was called stanford university. yes, i
remember now. it is perfectly clear. i was telling you of the scarlet
death. where was i in my story?”

“you was telling about germs, the things you can't see but which make
men sick,” edwin prompted.

“yes, that's where i was. a man did not notice at first when only a few
of these germs got into his body. but each germ broke in half and became
two germs, and they kept doing this very rapidly so that in a short time
there were many millions of them in the body. then the man was sick. he
had a disease, and the disease was named after the kind of a germ that
was in him. it might be measles, it might be influenza, it might be
yellow fever; it might be any of thousands and thousands of kinds of
diseases.

“now this is the strange thing about these germs. there were always new
ones coming to live in men's bodies. long and long and long ago, when
there were only a few men in the world, there were few diseases. but
as men increased and lived closely together in great cities and
civilizations, new diseases arose, new kinds of germs entered their
bodies. thus were countless millions and billions of human beings
killed. and the more thickly men packed together, the more terrible were
the new diseases that came to be. long before my time, in the middle
ages, there was the black plague that swept across europe. it swept
across europe many times. there was tuberculosis, that entered into men
wherever they were thickly packed. a hundred years before my time there
was the bubonic plague. and in africa was the sleeping sickness. the
bacteriologists fought all these sicknesses and destroyed them, just as
you boys fight the wolves away from your goats, or squash the mosquitoes
that light on you. the bacteriologists--”

“but, granser, what is a what-you-call-it?” edwin interrupted.

“you, edwin, are a goatherd. your task is to watch the goats. you know a
great deal about goats. a bacteriologist watches germs. that's his
task, and he knows a great deal about them. so, as i was saying, the
bacteriologists fought with the germs and destroyed them--sometimes.
there was leprosy, a horrible disease. a hundred years before i was
born, the bacteriologists discovered the germ of leprosy. they knew all
about it. they made pictures of it. i have seen those pictures. but
they never found a way to kill it. but in 1984, there was the pantoblast
plague, a disease that broke out in a country called brazil and that
killed millions of people. but the bacteriologists found it out, and
found the way to kill it, so that the pantoblast plague went no farther.
they made what they called a serum, which they put into a man's body and
which killed the pantoblast germs without killing the man. and in 1910,
there was pellagra, and also the hookworm. these were easily killed
by the bacteriologists. but in 1947 there arose a new disease that had
never been seen before. it got into the bodies of babies of only ten
months old or less, and it made them unable to move their hands and
feet, or to eat, or anything; and the bacteriologists were eleven years
in discovering how to kill that particular germ and save the babies.

“in spite of all these diseases, and of all the new ones that continued
to arise, there were more and more men in the world. this was because it
was easy to get food. the easier it was to get food, the more men
there were; the more men there were, the more thickly were they packed
together on the earth; and the more thickly they were packed, the more
new kinds of germs became diseases. there were warnings. soldervetzsky,
as early as 1929, told the bacteriologists that they had no guaranty
against some new disease, a thousand times more deadly than any they
knew, arising and killing by the hundreds of millions and even by the
billion. you see, the micro-organic world remained a mystery to the end.
they knew there was such a world, and that from time to time armies of
new germs emerged from it to kill men.

“and that was all they knew about it. for all they knew, in that
invisible micro-organic world there might be as many different kinds of
germs as there are grains of sand on this beach. and also, in that same
invisible world it might well be that new kinds of germs came to be.
it might be there that life originated--the 'abysmal fecundity,'
soldervetzsky called it, applying the words of other men who had written
before him....”

it was at this point that hare-lip rose to his feet, an expression of
huge contempt on his face.

[illustration: granser, you make me sick with your gabble 071]

“granser,” he announced, “you make me sick with your gabble. why don't
you tell about the red death? if you ain't going to, say so, an' we'll
start back for camp.”

the old man looked at him and silently began to cry. the weak tears of
age rolled down his cheeks and all the feebleness of his eighty-seven
years showed in his grief-stricken countenance.

“sit down,” edwin counselled soothingly. “granser's all right. he's just
gettin' to the scarlet death, ain't you, granser? he's just goin' to
tell us about it right now. sit down, hare-lip. go ahead, granser.”




iii

the old man wiped the tears away on his grimy knuckles and took up the
tale in a tremulous, piping voice that soon strengthened as he got the
swing of the narrative.

“it was in the summer of 2013 that the plague came. i was twenty-seven
years old, and well do i remember it. wireless despatches--”

hare-lip spat loudly his disgust, and granser hastened to make amends.

“we talked through the air in those days, thousands and thousands of
miles. and the word came of a strange disease that had broken out in
new york. there were seventeen millions of people living then in that
noblest city of america. nobody thought anything about the news. it was
only a small thing. there had been only a few deaths. it seemed, though,
that they had died very quickly, and that one of the first signs of
the disease was the turning red of the face and all the body. within
twenty-four hours came the report of the first case in chicago. and on
the same day, it was made public that london, the greatest city in the
world, next to chicago, had been secretly fighting the plague for two
weeks and censoring the news despatches--that is, not permitting the
word to go forth to the rest of the world that london had the plague.

“it looked serious, but we in california, like everywhere else, were
not alarmed. we were sure that the bacteriologists would find a way to
overcome this new germ, just as they had overcome other germs in the
past. but the trouble was the astonishing quickness with which this germ
destroyed human beings, and the fact that it inevitably killed any
human body it entered. no one ever recovered. there was the old asiatic
cholera, when you might eat dinner with a well man in the evening, and
the next morning, if you got up early enough, you would see him being
hauled by your window in the death-cart. but this new plague was quicker
than that--much quicker.

[illustration: but this new plague was quicker 078]

“from the moment of the first signs of it, a man would be dead in an
hour. some lasted for several hours. many died within ten or fifteen
minutes of the appearance of the first signs.

“the heart began to beat faster and the heat of the body to increase.
then came the scarlet rash, spreading like wildfire over the face and
body. most persons never noticed the increase in heat and heart-beat,
and the first they knew was when the scarlet rash came out. usually,
they had convulsions at the time of the appearance of the rash. but
these convulsions did not last long and were not very severe. if one
lived through them, he became perfectly quiet, and only did he feel a
numbness swiftly creeping up his body from the feet. the heels became
numb first, then the legs, and hips, and when the numbness reached
as high as his heart he died. they did not rave or sleep. their minds
always remained cool and calm up to the moment their heart numbed and
stopped. and another strange thing was the rapidity of decomposition. no
sooner was a person dead than the body seemed to fall to pieces, to
fly apart, to melt away even as you looked at it. that was one of the
reasons the plague spread so rapidly. all the billions of germs in a
corpse were so immediately released.

“and it was because of all this that the bacteriologists had so little
chance in fighting the germs. they were killed in their laboratories
even as they studied the germ of the scarlet death. they were heroes.
as fast as they perished, others stepped forth and took their places.
it was in london that they first isolated it. the news was telegraphed
everywhere. trask was the name of the man who succeeded in this, but
within thirty hours he was dead. then came the struggle in all the
laboratories to find something that would kill the plague germs. all
drugs failed. you see, the problem was to get a drug, or serum, that
would kill the germs in the body and not kill the body. they tried to
fight it with other germs, to put into the body of a sick man germs that
were the enemies of the plague germs--”

“and you can't see these germ-things, granser,” hare-lip objected, “and
here you gabble, gabble, gabble about them as if they was anything,
when they're nothing at all. anything you can't see, ain't, that's what.
fighting things that ain't with things that ain't! they must have
been all fools in them days. that's why they croaked. i ain't goin' to
believe in such rot, i tell you that.”

granser promptly began to weep, while edwin hotly took up his defence.

“look here, hare-lip, you believe in lots of things you can't see.”

hare-lip shook his head.

“you believe in dead men walking about. you never seen one dead man walk
about.”

“i tell you i seen 'em, last winter, when i was wolf-hunting with dad.”

“well, you always spit when you cross running water,” edwin challenged.

“that's to keep off bad luck,” was hare-lip's defence.

“you believe in bad luck?”

“sure.”

“an' you ain't never seen bad luck,” edwin concluded triumphantly.
“you're just as bad as granser and his germs. you believe in what you
don't see. go on, granser.”

hare-lip, crushed by this metaphysical defeat, remained silent, and
the old man went on. often and often, though this narrative must not be
clogged by the details, was granser's tale interrupted while the boys
squabbled among themselves. also, among themselves they kept up a
constant, low-voiced exchange of explanation and conjecture, as they
strove to follow the old man into his unknown and vanished world.

“the scarlet death broke out in san francisco. the first death came on
a monday morning. by thursday they were dying like flies in oakland
and san francisco. they died everywhere--in their beds, at their
work, walking along the street. it was on tuesday that i saw my first
death--miss collbran, one of my students, sitting right there before my
eyes, in my lecture-room. i noticed her face while i was talking. it had
suddenly turned scarlet. i ceased speaking and could only look at her,
for the first fear of the plague was already on all of us and we knew
that it had come. the young women screamed and ran out of the room. so
did the young men run out, all but two. miss collbran's convulsions were
very mild and lasted less than a minute. one of the young men fetched
her a glass of water. she drank only a little of it, and cried out:

“'my feet! all sensation has left them.'

“after a minute she said, 'i have no feet. i am unaware that i have any
feet. and my knees are cold. i can scarcely feel that i have knees.'

“she lay on the floor, a bundle of notebooks under her head. and we
could do nothing. the coldness and the numbness crept up past her hips
to her heart, and when it reached her heart she was dead. in fifteen
minutes, by the clock--i timed it--she was dead, there, in my own
classroom, dead. and she was a very beautiful, strong, healthy young
woman. and from the first sign of the plague to her death only fifteen
minutes elapsed. that will show you how swift was the scarlet death.

“yet in those few minutes i remained with the dying woman in my
classroom, the alarm had spread over the university; and the students,
by thousands, all of them, had deserted the lecture-room and
laboratories. when i emerged, on my way to make report to the president
of the faculty, i found the university deserted. across the campus were
several stragglers hurrying for their homes. two of them were running.

“president hoag, i found in his office, all alone, looking very old and
very gray, with a multitude of wrinkles in his face that i had never
seen before. at the sight of me, he pulled himself to his feet and
tottered away to the inner office, banging the door after him and
locking it. you see, he knew i had been exposed, and he was afraid.
he shouted to me through the door to go away. i shall never forget
my feelings as i walked down the silent corridors and out across that
deserted campus. i was not afraid. i had been exposed, and i looked
upon myself as already dead. it was not that, but a feeling of awful
depression that impressed me. everything had stopped. it was like the
end of the world to me--my world. i had been born within sight and sound
of the university. it had been my predestined career. my father had been
a professor there before me, and his father before him. for a century
and a half had this university, like a splendid machine, been running
steadily on. and now, in an instant, it had stopped. it was like seeing
the sacred flame die down on some thrice-sacred altar. i was shocked,
unutterably shocked.

“when i arrived home, my housekeeper screamed as i entered, and fled
away. and when i rang, i found the housemaid had likewise fled. i
investigated. in the kitchen i found the cook on the point of departure.
but she screamed, too, and in her haste dropped a suitcase of her
personal belongings and ran out of the house and across the grounds,
still screaming. i can hear her scream to this day. you see, we did not
act in this way when ordinary diseases smote us. we were always calm
over such things, and sent for the doctors and nurses who knew just
what to do. but this was different. it struck so suddenly, and killed so
swiftly, and never missed a stroke. when the scarlet rash appeared on a
person's face, that person was marked by death. there was never a known
case of a recovery.

“i was alone in my big house. as i have told you often before, in those
days we could talk with one another over wires or through the air. the
telephone bell rang, and i found my brother talking to me. he told me
that he was not coming home for fear of catching the plague from me, and
that he had taken our two sisters to stop at professor bacon's home. he
advised me to remain where i was, and wait to find out whether or not i
had caught the plague.

[illustration: the telephone bell rang 088]

“to all of this i agreed, staying in my house and for the first time in
my life attempting to cook. and the plague did not come out on me. by
means of the telephone i could talk with whomsoever i pleased and get
the news. also, there were the newspapers, and i ordered all of them to
be thrown up to my door so that i could know what was happening with the
rest of the world.

“new york city and chicago were in chaos. and what happened with them
was happening in all the large cities. a third of the new york police
were dead. their chief was also dead, likewise the mayor. all law and
order had ceased. the bodies were lying in the streets un-buried. all
railroads and vessels carrying food and such things into the great
city had ceased runnings and mobs of the hungry poor were pillaging
the stores and warehouses. murder and robbery and drunkenness were
everywhere. already the people had fled from the city by millions--at
first the rich, in their private motor-cars and dirigibles, and then the
great mass of the population, on foot, carrying the plague with them,
themselves starving and pillaging the farmers and all the towns and
villages on the way.

[illustration: fled from the city by millions 092]

“the man who sent this news, the wireless operator, was alone with his
instrument on the top of a lofty building. the people remaining in the
city--he estimated them at several hundred thousand--had gone mad from
fear and drink, and on all sides of him great fires were raging. he was
a hero, that man who staid by his post--an obscure newspaperman, most
likely.

“for twenty-four hours, he said, no transatlantic airships had arrived,
and no more messages were coming from england. he did state, though,
that a message from berlin--that's in germany--announced that hoffmeyer,
a bacteriologist of the metchnikoff school, had discovered the serum for
the plague. that was the last word, to this day, that we of america
ever received from europe. if hoffmeyer discovered the serum, it was too
late, or otherwise, long ere this, explorers from europe would have
come looking for us. we can only conclude that what happened in america
happened in europe, and that, at the best, some several score may have
survived the scarlet death on that whole continent.

“for one day longer the despatches continued to come from new york.
then they, too, ceased. the man who had sent them, perched in his lofty
building, had either died of the plague or been consumed in the great
conflagrations he had described as raging around him. and what had
occurred in new york had been duplicated in all the other cities. it was
the same in san francisco, and oakland, and berkeley. by thursday the
people were dying so rapidly that their corpses could not be handled,
and dead bodies lay everywhere. thursday night the panic outrush for
the country began. imagine, my grandsons, people, thicker than the
salmon-run you have seen on the sacramento river, pouring out of the
cities by millions, madly over the country, in vain attempt to escape
the ubiquitous death. you see, they carried the germs with them. even
the airships of the rich, fleeing for mountain and desert fastnesses,
carried the germs.

“hundreds of these airships escaped to hawaii, and not only did they
bring the plague with them, but they found the plague already there
before them. this we learned, by the despatches, until all order in san
francisco vanished, and there were no operators left at their posts to
receive or send. it was amazing, astounding, this loss of communication
with the world. it was exactly as if the world had ceased, been blotted
out. for sixty years that world has no longer existed for me. i know
there must be such places as new york, europe, asia, and africa; but not
one word has been heard of them--not in sixty years. with the coming of
the scarlet death the world fell apart, absolutely, irretrievably. ten
thousand years of culture and civilization passed in the twinkling of an
eye, 'lapsed like foam.'

“i was telling about the airships of the rich. they carried the plague
with them and no matter where they fled, they died. i never encountered
but one survivor of any of them--mungerson. he was afterwards a santa
rosan, and he married my eldest daughter. he came into the tribe eight
years after the plague. he was then nineteen years old, and he was
compelled to wait twelve years more before he could marry. you see,
there were no unmarried women, and some of the older daughters of the
santa rosans were already bespoken. so he was forced to wait until
my mary had grown to sixteen years. it was his son, gimp-leg, who was
killed last year by the mountain lion.

“mungerson was eleven years old at the time of the plague. his father
was one of the industrial magnates, a very wealthy, powerful man. it was
on his airship, the condor, that they were fleeing, with all the family,
for the wilds of british columbia, which is far to the north of here.
but there was some accident, and they were wrecked near mount shasta.
you have heard of that mountain. it is far to the north. the plague
broke out amongst them, and this boy of eleven was the only survivor.
for eight years he was alone, wandering over a deserted land and looking
vainly for his own kind. and at last, travelling south, he picked up
with us, the santa rosans.

“but i am ahead of my story. when the great exodus from the cities
around san francisco bay began, and while the telephones were still
working, i talked with my brother. i told him this flight from the
cities was insanity, that there were no symptoms of the plague in
me, and that the thing for us to do was to isolate ourselves and our
relatives in some safe place. we decided on the chemistry building, at
the university, and we planned to lay in a supply of provisions, and by
force of arms to prevent any other persons from forcing their presence
upon us after we had retired to our refuge.

“all this being arranged, my brother begged me to stay in my own
house for at least twenty-four hours more, on the chance of the plague
developing in me. to this i agreed, and he promised to come for me next
day. we talked on over the details of the provisioning and the defending
of the chemistry building until the telephone died. it died in the midst
of our conversation. that evening there were no electric lights, and
i was alone in my house in the darkness. no more newspapers were being
printed, so i had no knowledge of what was taking place outside.

[illustration: i heard sounds of rioting and of pistol shots 098]

“i heard sounds of rioting and of pistol shots, and from my windows i
could see the glare of the sky of some conflagration in the direction
of oakland. it was a night of terror. i did not sleep a wink. a man--why
and how i do not know--was killed on the sidewalk in front of the house.
i heard the rapid reports of an automatic pistol, and a few minutes
later the wounded wretch crawled up to my door, moaning and crying out
for help. arming myself with two automatics, i went to him. by the light
of a match i ascertained that while he was dying of the bullet wounds,
at the same time the plague was on him. i fled indoors, whence i heard
him moan and cry out for half an hour longer.

“in the morning, my brother came to me. i had gathered into a handbag
what things of value i purposed taking, but when i saw his face i knew
that he would never accompany me to the chemistry building. the plague
was on him. he intended shaking my hand, but i went back hurriedly
before him.

“'look at yourself in the mirror,' i commanded.

[illustration: look at yourself in the mirror 100]

“he did so, and at sight of his scarlet face, the color deepening as he
looked at it, he sank down nervelessly in a chair.

“'my god!' he said. 'i've got it. don't come near me. i am a dead man.'

“then the convulsions seized him. he was two hours in dying, and he
was conscious to the last, complaining about the coldness and loss of
sensation in his feet, his calves, his thighs, until at last it was his
heart and he was dead.

“that was the way the scarlet death slew. i caught up my handbag and
fled. the sights in the streets were terrible. one stumbled on bodies
everywhere. some were not yet dead. and even as you looked, you saw men
sink down with the death fastened upon them. there were numerous fires
burning in berkeley, while oakland and san francisco were apparently
being swept by vast conflagrations. the smoke of the burning filled the
heavens, so that the midday was as a gloomy twilight, and, in the shifts
of wind, sometimes the sun shone through dimly, a dull red orb. truly,
my grandsons, it was like the last days of the end of the world.

“there were numerous stalled motor cars, showing that the gasoline and
the engine supplies of the garages had given out. i remember one such
car. a man and a woman lay back dead in the seats, and on the pavement
near it were two more women and a child. strange and terrible sights
there were on every hand. people slipped by silently, furtively, like
ghosts--white-faced women carrying infants in their arms; fathers
leading children by the hand; singly, and in couples, and in
families--all fleeing out of the city of death. some carried supplies
of food, others blankets and valuables, and there were many who carried
nothing.

“there was a grocery store--a place where food was sold. the man to whom
it belonged--i knew him well--a quiet, sober, but stupid and obstinate
fellow, was defending it. the windows and doors had been broken in, but
he, inside, hiding behind a counter, was discharging his pistol at a
number of men on the sidewalk who were breaking in. in the entrance were
several bodies--of men, i decided, whom he had killed earlier in the
day. even as i looked on from a distance, i saw one of the robbers break
the windows of the adjoining store, a place where shoes were sold,
and deliberately set fire to it. i did not go to the groceryman's
assistance. the time for such acts had already passed. civilization was
crumbling, and it was each for himself.”




iv

i went away hastily, down a cross-street, and at the first corner i saw
another tragedy. two men of the working class had caught a man and a
woman with two children, and were robbing them. i knew the man by sight,
though i had never been introduced to him. he was a poet whose verses i
had long admired. yet i did not go to his help, for at the moment i came
upon the scene there was a pistol shot, and i saw him sinking to the
ground. the woman screamed, and she was felled with a fist-blow by one
of the brutes. i cried out threateningly, whereupon they discharged
their pistols at me and i ran away around the corner. here i was blocked
by an advancing conflagration. the buildings on both sides were burning,
and the street was filled with smoke and flame. from somewhere in that
murk came a woman's voice calling shrilly for help. but i did not go to
her. a man's heart turned to iron amid such scenes, and one heard all
too many appeals for help.

“returning to the corner, i found the two robbers were gone. the poet
and his wife lay dead on the pavement. it was a shocking sight. the two
children had vanished--whither i could not tell. and i knew, now, why
it was that the fleeing persons i encountered slipped along so furtively
and with such white faces. in the midst of our civilization, down in our
slums and labor-ghettos, we had bred a race of barbarians, of savages;
and now, in the time of our calamity, they turned upon us like the wild
beasts they were and destroyed us. and they destroyed themselves as
well.

[illustration: now in the time of calamity they turned on us 108]

“they inflamed themselves with strong drink and committed a thousand
atrocities, quarreling and killing one another in the general madness.
one group of workingmen i saw, of the better sort, who had banded
together, and, with their women and children in their midst, the sick
and aged in litters and being carried, and with a number of horses
pulling a truck-load of provisions, they were fighting their way out
of the city. they made a fine spectacle as they came down the street
through the drifting smoke, though they nearly shot me when i first
appeared in their path. as they went by, one of their leaders shouted
out to me in apologetic explanation. he said they were killing the
robbers and looters on sight, and that they had thus banded together as
the only-means by which to escape the prowlers.

“it was here that i saw for the first time what i was soon to see so
often. one of the marching men had suddenly shown the unmistakable mark
of the plague. immediately those about him drew away, and he, without
a remonstrance, stepped out of his place to let them pass on. a woman,
most probably his wife, attempted to follow him. she was leading a
little boy by the hand. but the husband commanded her sternly to go on,
while others laid hands on her and restrained her from following him.
this i saw, and i saw the man also, with his scarlet blaze of face, step
into a doorway on the opposite side of the street. i heard the report of
his pistol, and saw him sink lifeless to the ground.

“after being turned aside twice again by advancing fires, i succeeded in
getting through to the university. on the edge of the campus i came
upon a party of university folk who were going in the direction of the
chemistry building. they were all family men, and their families were
with them, including the nurses and the servants. professor badminton
greeted me, i had difficulty in recognizing him. somewhere he had gone
through flames, and his beard was singed off. about his head was a
bloody bandage, and his clothes were filthy.

[illustration: he told me he had been cruelly beaten 112]

“he told me he had prowlers, and that his brother had been killed the
previous night, in the defence of their dwelling.

“midway across the campus, he pointed suddenly to mrs. swinton's face.
the unmistakable scarlet was there. immediately all the other women set
up a screaming and began to run away from her. her two children were
with a nurse, and these also ran with the women. but her husband, doctor
swinton, remained with her.

“'go on, smith,' he told me. 'keep an eye on the children. as for me,
i shall stay with my wife. i know she is as already dead, but i can't
leave her. afterwards, if i escape, i shall come to the chemistry
building, and do you watch for me and let me in.'

“i left him bending over his wife and soothing her last moments, while
i ran to overtake the party. we were the last to be admitted to the
chemistry building. after that, with our automatic rifles we maintained
our isolation. by our plans, we had arranged for a company of sixty to
be in this refuge. instead, every one of the number originally planned
had added relatives and friends and whole families until there were over
four hundred souls. but the chemistry building was large, and, standing
by itself, was in no danger of being burned by the great fires that
raged everywhere in the city.

“a large quantity of provisions had been gathered, and a food committee
took charge of it, issuing rations daily to the various families and
groups that arranged themselves into messes. a number of committees were
appointed, and we developed a very efficient organization. i was on the
committee of defence, though for the first day no prowlers came near. we
could see them in the distance, however, and by the smoke of their fires
knew that several camps of them were occupying the far edge of the
campus. drunkenness was rife, and often we heard them singing ribald
songs or insanely shouting. while the world crashed to ruin about them
and all the air was filled with the smoke of its burning, these low
creatures gave rein to their bestiality and fought and drank and died.
and after all, what did it matter? everybody died anyway, the good and
the bad, the efficients and the weaklings, those that loved to live and
those that scorned to live. they passed. everything passed.

“when twenty-four hours had gone by and no signs of the plague were
apparent, we congratulated ourselves and set about digging a well. you
have seen the great iron pipes which in those days carried water to all
the city-dwellers. we feared that the fires in the city would burst the
pipes and empty the reservoirs. so we tore up the cement floor of the
central court of the chemistry building and dug a well. there were many
young men, undergraduates, with us, and we worked night and day on the
well. and our fears were confirmed. three hours before we reached water,
the pipes went dry.

“a second twenty-four hours passed, and still the plague did not
appear among us. we thought we were saved. but we did not know what i
afterwards decided to be true, namely, that the period of the incubation
of the plague germs in a human's body was a matter of a number of days.
it slew so swiftly when once it manifested itself, that we were led to
believe that the period of incubation was equally swift. so, when two
days had left us unscathed, we were elated with the idea that we were
free of the contagion.

“but the third day disillusioned us. i can never forget the night
preceding it. i had charge of the night guards from eight to twelve,
and from the roof of the building i watched the passing of all man's
glorious works. so terrible were the local conflagrations that all the
sky was lighted up. one could read the finest print in the red glare.
all the world seemed wrapped in flames. san francisco spouted smoke and
fire from a score of vast conflagrations that were like so many active
volcanoes. oakland, san leandro, haywards--all were burning; and to the
northward, clear to point richmond, other fires were at work. it was an
awe-inspiring spectacle. civilization, my grandsons, civilization was
passing in a sheet of flame and a breath of death. at ten o'clock that
night, the great powder magazines at point pinole exploded in rapid
succession. so terrific were the concussions that the strong building
rocked as in an earthquake, while every pane of glass was broken. it was
then that i left the roof and went down the long corridors, from room to
room, quieting the alarmed women and telling them what had happened.

“an hour later, at a window on the ground floor, i heard pandemonium
break out in the camps of the prowlers. there were cries and screams,
and shots from many pistols. as we afterward conjectured, this fight had
been precipitated by an attempt on the part of those that were well
to drive out those that were sick. at any rate, a number of the
plague-stricken prowlers escaped across the campus and drifted against
our doors. we warned them back, but they cursed us and discharged a
fusillade from their pistols. professor merryweather, at one of the
windows, was instantly killed, the bullet striking him squarely between
the eyes. we opened fire in turn, and all the prowlers fled away with
the exception of three. one was a woman. the plague was on them and they
were reckless. like foul fiends, there in the red glare from the skies,
with faces blazing, they continued to curse us and fire at us. one of
the men i shot with my own hand. after that the other man and the woman,
still cursing us, lay down under our windows, where we were compelled to
watch them die of the plague.

“the situation was critical. the explosions of the powder magazines
had broken all the windows of the chemistry building, so that we were
exposed to the germs from the corpses. the sanitary committee was called
upon to act, and it responded nobly. two men were required to go out and
remove the corpses, and this meant the probable sacrifice of their own
lives, for, having performed the task, they were not to be permitted to
reenter the building. one of the professors, who was a bachelor, and
one of the undergraduates volunteered. they bade good-bye to us and
went forth. they were heroes. they gave up their lives that four hundred
others might live. after they had performed their work, they stood for
a moment, at a distance, looking at us wistfully. then they waved their
hands in farewell and went away slowly across the campus toward the
burning city.

“and yet it was all useless. the next morning the first one of us was
smitten with the plague--a little nurse-girl in the family of professor
stout. it was no time for weak-kneed, sentimental policies. on the
chance that she might be the only one, we thrust her forth from the
building and commanded her to be gone.

[illustration: we thrust her forth from the building 121]

“she went away slowly across the campus, wringing her hands and crying
pitifully. we felt like brutes, but what were we to do? there were four
hundred of us, and individuals had to be sacrificed.

“in one of the laboratories three families had domiciled themselves, and
that afternoon we found among them no less than four corpses and seven
cases of the plague in all its different stages.

“then it was that the horror began. leaving the dead lie, we forced the
living ones to segregate themselves in another room. the plague began to
break out among the rest of us, and as fast as the symptoms appeared, we
sent the stricken ones to these segregated rooms. we compelled them to
walk there by themselves, so as to avoid laying hands on them. it was
heartrending. but still the plague raged among us, and room after
room was filled with the dead and dying. and so we who were yet clean
retreated to the next floor and to the next, before this sea of the
dead, that, room by room and floor by floor, inundated the building.

“the place became a charnel house, and in the middle of the night
the survivors fled forth, taking nothing with them except arms and
ammunition and a heavy store of tinned foods. we camped on the opposite
side of the campus from the prowlers, and, while some stood guard,
others of us volunteered to scout into the city in quest of horses,
motor cars, carts, and wagons, or anything that would carry our
provisions and enable us to emulate the banded workingmen i had seen
fighting their way out to the open country.

“i was one of these scouts; and doctor hoyle, remembering that his motor
car had been left behind in his home garage, told me to look for it. we
scouted in pairs, and dombey, a young undergraduate, accompanied me. we
had to cross half a mile of the residence portion of the city to get
to doctor hoyle's home. here the buildings stood apart, in the midst of
trees and grassy lawns, and here the fires had played freaks, burning
whole blocks, skipping blocks and often skipping a single house in a
block. and here, too, the prowlers were still at their work. we carried
our automatic pistols openly in our hands, and looked desperate enough,
forsooth, to keep them from attacking us. but at doctor hoyle's house
the thing happened. untouched by fire, even as we came to it the smoke
of flames burst forth.

“the miscreant who had set fire to it staggered down the steps and out
along the driveway. sticking out of his coat pockets were bottles of
whiskey, and he was very drunk. my first impulse was to shoot him, and
i have never ceased regretting that i did not. staggering and maundering
to himself, with bloodshot eyes, and a raw and bleeding slash down one
side of his bewhiskered face, he was altogether the most nauseating
specimen of degradation and filth i had ever encountered. i did not
shoot him, and he leaned against a tree on the lawn to let us go by.
it was the most absolute, wanton act. just as we were opposite him,
he suddenly drew a pistol and shot dombey through the head. the next
instant i shot him. but it was too late. dombey expired without a groan,
immediately. i doubt if he even knew what had happened to him.

“leaving the two corpses, i hurried on past the burning house to the
garage, and there found doctor hoyle's motor car. the tanks were filled
with gasoline, and it was ready for use. and it was in this car that i
threaded the streets of the ruined city and came back to the survivors
on the campus. the other scouts returned, but none had been so
fortunate. professor fairmead had found a shetland pony, but the poor
creature, tied in a stable and abandoned for days, was so weak from want
of food and water that it could carry no burden at all. some of the men
were for turning it loose, but i insisted that we should lead it along
with us, so that, if we got out of food, we would have it to eat.

“there were forty-seven of us when we started, many being women and
children. the president of the faculty, an old man to begin with, and
now hopelessly broken by the awful happenings of the past week, rode
in the motor car with several young children and the aged mother of
professor fairmead. wathope, a young professor of english, who had a
grievous bullet-wound in his leg, drove the car. the rest of us walked,
professor fairmead leading the pony.

“it was what should have been a bright summer day, but the smoke from
the burning world filled the sky, through which the sun shone murkily,
a dull and lifeless orb, blood-red and ominous. but we had grown
accustomed to that blood-red sun. with the smoke it was different. it
bit into our nostrils and eyes, and there was not one of us whose eyes
were not bloodshot. we directed our course to the southeast through the
endless miles of suburban residences, travelling along where the first
swells of low hills rose from the flat of the central city. it was by
this way, only, that we could expect to gain the country.

“our progress was painfully slow. the women and children could not walk
fast. they did not dream of walking, my grandsons, in the way all people
walk to-day. in truth, none of us knew how to walk. it was not until
after the plague that i learned really to walk. so it was that the pace
of the slowest was the pace of all, for we dared not separate on account
of the prowlers. there were not so many now of these human beasts of
prey. the plague had already well diminished their numbers, but enough
still lived to be a constant menace to us. many of the beautiful
residences were untouched by fire, yet smoking ruins were everywhere.
the prowlers, too, seemed to have got over their insensate desire to
burn, and it was more rarely that we saw houses freshly on fire.

“several of us scouted among the private garages in search of motor cars
and gasoline. but in this we were unsuccessful. the first great flights
from the cities had swept all such utilities away. calgan, a fine young
man, was lost in this work. he was shot by prowlers while crossing a
lawn. yet this was our only casualty, though, once, a drunken brute
deliberately opened fire on all of us. luckily, he fired wildly, and we
shot him before he had done any hurt.

“at fruitvale, still in the heart of the magnificent residence section
of the city, the plague again smote us. professor fair-mead was the
victim. making signs to us that his mother was not to know, he turned
aside into the grounds of a beautiful mansion. he sat down forlornly on
the steps of the front veranda, and i, having lingered, waved him a last
farewell. that night, several miles beyond fruitvale and still in the
city, we made camp. and that night we shifted camp twice to get away
from our dead. in the morning there were thirty of us. i shall never
forget the president of the faculty. during the morning's march his
wife, who was walking, betrayed the fatal symptoms, and when she
drew aside to let us go on, he insisted on leaving the motor car and
remaining with her. there was quite a discussion about this, but in the
end we gave in. it was just as well, for we knew not which ones of us,
if any, might ultimately escape.

“that night, the second of our march, we camped beyond haywards in the
first stretches of country. and in the morning there were eleven of us
that lived. also, during the night, wathope, the professor with the
wounded leg, deserted us in the motor car. he took with him his sister
and his mother and most of our tinned provisions. it was that day, in
the afternoon, while resting by the wayside, that i saw the last airship
i shall ever see. the smoke was much thinner here in the country, and i
first sighted the ship drifting and veering helplessly at an elevation
of two thousand feet. what had happened i could not conjecture, but even
as we looked we saw her bow dip down lower and lower. then the bulkheads
of the various gas-chambers must have burst, for, quite perpendicular,
she fell like a plummet to the earth.

[illustration: she fell like a plummet to the earth 132]

“and from that day to this i have not seen another airship. often and
often, during the next few years, i scanned the sky for them, hoping
against hope that somewhere in the world civilization had survived. but
it was not to be. what happened with us in california must have happened
with everybody everywhere.

“another day, and at niles there were three of us. beyond niles, in the
middle of the highway, we found wathope. the motor car had broken down,
and there, on the rugs which they had spread on the ground, lay the
bodies of his sister, his mother, and himself.

“wearied by the unusual exercise of continual walking, that night i
slept heavily. in the morning i was alone in the world. canfield and
parsons, my last companions, were dead of the plague. of the four
hundred that sought shelter in the chemistry building, and of the
forty-seven that began the march, i alone remained--i and the shetland
pony. why this should be so there is no explaining. i did not catch the
plague, that is all. i was immune. i was merely the one lucky man in
a million--just as every survivor was one in a million, or, rather, in
several millions, for the proportion was at least that.”




v

“for two days i sheltered in a pleasant grove where there had been no
deaths. in those two days, while badly depressed and believing that my
turn would come at any moment, nevertheless i rested and recuperated. so
did the pony. and on the third day, putting what small store of tinned
provisions i possessed on the pony's back, i started on across a very
lonely land. not a live man, woman, or child, did i encounter, though
the dead were everywhere. food, however, was abundant. the land then
was not as it is now. it was all cleared of trees and brush, and it was
cultivated. the food for millions of mouths was growing, ripening, and
going to waste. from the fields and orchards i gathered vegetables,
fruits, and berries. around the deserted farmhouses i got eggs and
caught chickens. and frequently i found supplies of tinned provisions in
the store-rooms.

“a strange thing was what was taking place with all the domestic
animals. everywhere they were going wild and preying on one another. the
chickens and ducks were the first to be destroyed, while the pigs were
the first to go wild, followed by the cats. nor were the dogs long in
adapting themselves to the changed conditions. there was a veritable
plague of dogs. they devoured the corpses, barked and howled during the
nights, and in the daytime slunk about in the distance. as the time went
by, i noticed a change in their behavior. at first they were apart from
one another, very suspicious and very prone to fight. but after a not
very long while they began to come together and run in packs. the dog,
you see, always was a social animal, and this was true before ever he
came to be domesticated by man. in the last days of the world before the
plague, there were many many very different kinds of dogs--dogs without
hair and dogs with warm fur, dogs so small that they would make scarcely
a mouthful for other dogs that were as large as mountain lions. well,
all the small dogs, and the weak types, were killed by their fellows.
also, the very large ones were not adapted for the wild life and bred
out. as a result, the many different kinds of dogs disappeared, and
there remained, running in packs, the medium-sized wolfish dogs that you
know to-day.”

“but the cats don't run in packs, granser,” hoo-hoo objected.

“the cat was never a social animal. as one writer in the nineteenth
century said, the cat walks by himself. he always walked by himself,
from before the time he was tamed by man, down through the long ages of
domestication, to to-day when once more he is wild.

“the horses also went wild, and all the fine breeds we had degenerated
into the small mustang horse you know to-day. the cows likewise went
wild, as did the pigeons and the sheep. and that a few of the chickens
survived you know yourself. but the wild chicken of to-day is quite a
different thing from the chickens we had in those days.

“but i must go on with my story. i travelled through a deserted land. as
the time went by i began to yearn more and more for human beings. but i
never found one, and i grew lonelier and lonelier. i crossed livermore
valley and the mountains between it and the great valley of the san
joaquin. you have never seen that valley, but it is very large and it is
the home of the wild horse. there are great droves there, thousands and
tens of thousands. i revisited it thirty years after, so i know. you
think there are lots of wild horses down here in the coast valleys, but
they are as nothing compared with those of the san joaquin. strange to
say, the cows, when they went wild, went back into the lower mountains.
evidently they were better able to protect themselves there.

“in the country districts the ghouls and prowlers had been less in
evidence, for i found many villages and towns untouched by fire. but
they were filled by the pestilential dead, and i passed by without
exploring them. it was near lathrop that, out of my loneliness, i picked
up a pair of collie dogs that were so newly free that they were urgently
willing to return to their allegiance to man. these collies accompanied
me for many years, and the strains of them are in those very dogs there
that you boys have to-day. but in sixty years the collie strain has
worked out. these brutes are more like domesticated wolves than anything
else.”

hare-lip rose to his feet, glanced to see that the goats were safe,
and looked at the sun's position in the afternoon sky, advertising
impatience at the prolixity of the old man's tale. urged to hurry by
edwin, granser went on.

“there is little more to tell. with my two dogs and my pony, and riding
a horse i had managed to capture, i crossed the san joaquin and went on
to a wonderful valley in the sierras called yosemite. in the great hotel
there i found a prodigious supply of tinned provisions. the pasture was
abundant, as was the game, and the river that ran through the valley was
full of trout. i remained there three years in an utter loneliness that
none but a man who has once been highly civilized can understand. then
i could stand it no more. i felt that i was going crazy. like the dog,
i was a social animal and i needed my kind. i reasoned that since i had
survived the plague, there was a possibility that others had survived.
also, i reasoned that after three years the plague germs must all be
gone and the land be clean again.

[illustration: with my horse and dogs and pony, i set out 144]

“with my horse and dogs and pony, i set out. again i crossed the san
joaquin valley, the mountains beyond, and came down into livermore
valley. the change in those three years was amazing. all the land had
been splendidly tilled, and now i could scarcely recognize it, 'such was
the sea of rank vegetation that had overrun the agricultural handiwork
of man. you see, the wheat, the vegetables, and orchard trees had always
been cared for and nursed by man, so that they were soft and tender. the
weeds and wild bushes and such things, on the contrary, had always been
fought by man, so that they were tough and resistant. as a result, when
the hand of man was removed, the wild vegetation smothered and destroyed
practically all the domesticated vegetation. the coyotes were greatly
increased, and it was at this time that i first encountered wolves,
straying in twos and threes and small packs down from the regions where
they had always persisted.

“it was at lake temescal, not far from the one-time city of oakland,
that i came upon the first live human beings. oh, my grandsons, how can
i describe to you my emotion, when, astride my horse and dropping down
the hillside to the lake, i saw the smoke of a campfire rising through
the trees. almost did my heart stop beating. i felt that i was going
crazy. then i heard the cry of a babe--a human babe. and dogs barked,
and my dogs answered. i did not know but what i was the one human alive
in the whole world. it could not be true that here were others--smoke,
and the cry of a babe.

“emerging on the lake, there, before my eyes, not a hundred yards away,
i saw a man, a large man. he was standing on an outjutting rock and
fishing. i was overcome. i stopped my horse. i tried to call out but
could not. i waved my hand. it seemed to me that the man looked at me,
but he did not appear to wave. then i laid my head on my arms there
in the saddle. i was afraid to look again, for i knew it was an
hallucination, and i knew that if i looked the man would be gone. and so
precious was the hallucination, that i wanted it to persist yet a little
while. i knew, too, that as long as i did not look it would persist.

“thus i remained, until i heard my dogs snarling, and a man's voice.
what do you think the voice said? i will tell you. it said: '_where in
hell did you come from??_'

“those were the words, the exact words. that was what your other
grandfather said to me, hare-lip, when he greeted me there on the shore
of lake temescal fifty-seven years ago. and they were the most ineffable
words i have ever heard. i opened my eyes, and there he stood before me,
a large, dark, hairy man, heavy-jawed, slant-browed, fierce-eyed. how i
got off my horse i do not know. but it seemed that the next i knew i was
clasping his hand with both of mine and crying. i would have embraced
him, but he was ever a narrow-minded, suspicious man, and he drew away
from me. yet did i cling to his hand and cry.”

granser's voice faltered and broke at the recollection, and the weak
tears streamed down his cheeks while the boys looked on and giggled.

“yet did i cry,” he continued, “and desire to embrace him, though the
chauffeur was a brute, a perfect brute--the most abhorrent man i have
ever known. his name was... strange, how i have forgotten his name.
everybody called him chauffeur--it was the name of his occupation, and
it stuck. that is how, to this day, the tribe he founded is called the
chauffeur tribe.

[illustration: everybody called him chauffeur 149]

“he was a violent, unjust man. why the plague germs spared him i can
never understand. it would seem, in spite of our old metaphysical
notions about absolute justice, that there is no justice in the
universe. why did he live?--an iniquitous, moral monster, a blot on the
face of nature, a cruel, relentless, bestial cheat as well. all he
could talk about was motor cars, machinery, gasoline, and garages--and
especially, and with huge delight, of his mean pilferings and sordid
swindlings of the persons who had employed him in the days before the
coming of the plague. and yet he was spared, while hundreds of millions,
yea, billions, of better men were destroyed.

[illustration: vesta the one woman 150]

“i went on with him to his camp, and there i saw her, vesta, the one
woman. it was glorious and... pitiful. there she was, vesta van warden,
the young wife of john van warden, clad in rags, with marred and scarred
and toil-calloused hands, bending over the campfire and doing scullion
work--she, vesta, who had been born to the purple of the greatest
baronage of wealth the world had ever known. john van warden, her
husband, worth one billion, eight hundred millions and president of the
board of industrial magnates, had been the ruler of america. also,
sitting on the international board of control, he had been one of the
seven men who ruled the world. and she herself had come of equally noble
stock. her father, philip saxon, had been president of the board of
industrial magnates up to the time of his death. this office was in
process of becoming hereditary, and had philip saxon had a son that son
would have succeeded him. but his only child was vesta, the perfect
flower of generations of the highest culture this planet has ever
produced. it was not until the engagement between vesta and van warden
took place, that saxon indicated the latter as his successor. it was, i
am sure, a political marriage. i have reason to believe that vesta never
really loved her husband in the mad passionate way of which the poets
used to sing. it was more like the marriages that obtained among crowned
heads in the days before they were displaced by the magnates.

[illustration: there she was, boiling fish-chowder 153]

“and there she was, boiling fish-chowder in a soot-covered pot, her
glorious eyes inflamed by the acrid smoke of the open fire. hers was a
sad story. she was the one survivor in a million, as i had been, as
the chauffeur had been. on a crowning eminence of the alameda hills,
overlooking san francisco bay, van warden had built a vast summer
palace. it was surrounded by a park of a thousand acres. when the
plague broke out, van warden sent her there. armed guards patrolled the
boundaries of the park, and nothing entered in the way of provisions or
even mail matter that was not first fumigated. and yet did the plague
enter, killing the guards at their posts, the servants at their tasks,
sweeping away the whole army of retainers--or, at least, all of them who
did not flee to die elsewhere. so it was that vesta found herself the
sole living person in the palace that had become a charnel house.

“now the chauffeur had been one of the servants that ran away.
returning, two months afterward, he discovered vesta in a little summer
pavilion where there had been no deaths and where she had established
herself. he was a brute. she was afraid, and she ran away and hid among
the trees. that night, on foot, she fled into the mountains--she, whose
tender feet and delicate body had never known the bruise of stones nor
the scratch of briars. he followed, and that night he caught her. he
struck her. do you understand? he beat her with those terrible fists of
his and made her his slave. it was she who had to gather the firewood,
build the fires, cook, and do all the degrading camp-labor--she, who had
never performed a menial act in her life. these things he compelled her
to do, while he, a proper savage, elected to lie around camp and look
on. he did nothing, absolutely nothing, except on occasion to hunt meat
or catch fish.”

“good for chauffeur,” hare-lip commented in an undertone to the other
boys. “i remember him before he died. he was a corker. but he did
things, and he made things go. you know, dad married his daughter, an'
you ought to see the way he knocked the spots outa dad. the chauffeur
was a son-of-a-gun. he made us kids stand around. even when he was
croaking he reached out for me, once, an' laid my head open with that
long stick he kept always beside him.”

hare-lip rubbed his bullet head reminiscently, and the boys returned to
the old man, who was maundering ecstatically about vesta, the squaw of
the founder of the chauffeur tribe.

“and so i say to you that you cannot understand the awfulness of the
situation. the chauffeur was a servant, understand, a servant. and he
cringed, with bowed head, to such as she. she was a lord of life, both
by birth and by marriage. the destinies of millions, such as he, she
carried in the hollow of her pink-white hand. and, in the days before
the plague, the slightest contact with such as he would have been
pollution. oh, i have seen it. once, i remember, there was mrs. goldwin,
wife of one of the great magnates. it was on a landing stage, just
as she was embarking in her private dirigible, that she dropped her
parasol. a servant picked it up and made the mistake of handing it to
her--to her, one of the greatest royal ladies of the land! she shrank
back, as though he were a leper, and indicated her secretary to receive
it. also, she ordered her secretary to ascertain the creature's name and
to see that he was immediately discharged from service. and such a woman
was vesta van warden. and her the chauffeur beat and made his slave.

[illustration: and her the chauffeur beat and made his slave 158]

“--bill--that was it; bill, the chauffeur. that was his name. he was
a wretched, primitive man, wholly devoid of the finer instincts and
chivalrous promptings of a cultured soul. no, there is no absolute
justice, for to him fell that wonder of womanhood, vesta van warden. the
grievous-ness of this you will never understand, my grandsons; for
you are yourselves primitive little savages, unaware of aught else but
savagery. why should vesta not have been mine? i was a man of culture
and refinement, a professor in a great university. even so, in the time
before the plague, such was her exalted position, she would not have
deigned to know that i existed. mark, then, the abysmal degradation
to which she fell at the hands of the chauffeur. nothing less than the
destruction of all mankind had made it possible that i should know her,
look in her eyes, converse with her, touch her hand--ay, and love her
and know that her feelings toward me were very kindly. i have reason to
believe that she, even she, would have loved me, there being no other
man in the world except the chauffeur. why, when it destroyed eight
billions of souls, did not the plague destroy just one more man, and
that man the chauffeur?

“once, when the chauffeur was away fishing, she begged me to kill him.
with tears in her eyes she begged me to kill him. but he was a strong
and violent man, and i was afraid. afterwards, i talked with him. i
offered him my horse, my pony, my dogs, all that i possessed, if he
would give vesta to me. and he grinned in my face and shook his head. he
was very insulting. he said that in the old days he had been a servant,
had been dirt under the feet of men like me and of women like vesta, and
that now he had the greatest lady in the land to be servant to him and
cook his food and nurse his brats. 'you had your day before the plague,'
he said; 'but this is my day, and a damned good day it is. i wouldn't
trade back to the old times for anything.' such words he spoke, but they
are not his words. he was a vulgar, low-minded man, and vile oaths fell
continually from his lips.

“also, he told me that if he caught me making eyes at his woman he'd
wring my neck and give her a beating as well. what was i to do? i was
afraid. he was a brute. that first night, when i discovered the camp,
vesta and i had great talk about the things of our vanished world. we
talked of art, and books, and poetry; and the chauffeur listened and
grinned and sneered. he was bored and angered by our way of speech which
he did not comprehend, and finally he spoke up and said: 'and this is
vesta van warden, one-time wife of van warden the magnate--a high and
stuck-up beauty, who is now my squaw. eh, professor smith, times is
changed, times is changed. here, you, woman, take off my moccasins,
and lively about it. i want professor smith to see how well i have you
trained.'

“i saw her clench her teeth, and the flame of revolt rise in her face.
he drew back his gnarled fist to strike, and i was afraid, and sick at
heart. i could do nothing to prevail against him. so i got up to go,
and not be witness to such indignity. but the chauffeur laughed and
threatened me with a beating if i did not stay and behold. and i sat
there, perforce, by the campfire on the shore of lake temescal, and
saw vesta, vesta van warden, kneel and remove the moccasins of that
grinning, hairy, apelike human brute.

“--oh, you do not understand, my grandsons. you have never known
anything else, and you do not understand.

“'halter-broke and bridle-wise,' the chauffeur gloated, while she
performed that dreadful, menial task. 'a trifle balky at times,
professor, a trifle balky; but a clout alongside the jaw makes her as
meek and gentle as a lamb.'

“and another time he said: 'we've got to start all over and replenish
the earth and multiply. you're handicapped, professor. you ain't got no
wife, and we're up against a regular garden-of-eden proposition. but i
ain't proud. i'll tell you what, professor.' he pointed at their little
infant, barely a year old. 'there's your wife, though you'll have to
wait till she grows up. it's rich, ain't it? we're all equals here, and
i'm the biggest toad in the splash. but i ain't stuck up--not i. i do
you the honor, professor smith, the very great honor of betrothing to
you my and vesta van warden's daughter. ain't it cussed bad that van
warden ain't here to see?'”

“i lived three weeks of infinite torment there in the chauffeur's camp.
and then, one day, tiring of me, or of what to him was my bad effect
on vesta, he told me that the year before, wandering through the contra
costa hills to the straits of carquinez, across the straits he had seen
a smoke. this meant that there were still other human beings, and that
for three weeks he had kept this inestimably precious information from
me. i departed at once, with my dogs and horses, and journeyed across
the contra costa hills to the straits. i saw no smoke on the other side,
but at port costa discovered a small steel barge on which i was able to
embark my animals. old canvas which i found served me for a sail, and
a southerly breeze fanned me across the straits and up to the ruins
of vallejo. here, on the outskirts of the city, i found evidences of a
recently occupied camp.

[illustration: found evidences of a recently occupied camp 169]

“many clam-shells showed me why these humans had come to the shores of
the bay. this was the santa rosa tribe, and i followed its track along
the old railroad right of way across the salt marshes to sonoma valley.
here, at the old brickyard at glen ellen, i came upon the camp. there
were eighteen souls all told. two were old men, one of whom was jones, a
banker. the other was harrison, a retired pawnbroker, who had taken for
wife the matron of the state hospital for the insane at napa. of all the
persons of the city of napa, and of all the other towns and villages
in that rich and populous valley, she had been the only-survivor. next,
there were the three young men--cardiff and hale, who had been farmers,
and wainwright, a common day-laborer. all three had found wives. to
hale, a crude, illiterate farmer, had fallen isadore, the greatest
prize, next to vesta, of the women who came through the plague. she was
one of the world's most noted singers, and the plague had caught her at
san francisco. she has talked with me for hours at a time, telling me of
her adventures, until, at last, rescued by hale in the mendocino forest
reserve, there had remained nothing for her to do but become his wife.
but hale was a good fellow, in spite of his illiteracy. he had a keen
sense of justice and right-dealing, and she was far happier with him
than was vesta with the chauffeur.

“the wives of cardiff and wainwright were ordinary women, accustomed
to toil with strong constitutions--just the type for the wild new life
which they were compelled to live. in addition were two adult idiots
from the feeble-minded home at el-dredge, and five or six young children
and infants born after the formation of the santa rosa tribe. also,
there was bertha. she was a good woman, hare-lip, in spite of the sneers
of your father. her i took for wife. she was the mother of your father,
edwin, and of yours, hoo-hoo. and it was our daughter, vera, who married
your father, hare-lip--your father, sandow, who was the oldest son of
vesta van warden and the chauffeur.

“and so it was that i became the nineteenth member of the santa rosa
tribe. there were only two outsiders added after me. one was mungerson,
descended from the magnates, who wandered alone in the wilds of northern
california for eight years before he came south and joined us. he it was
who waited twelve years more before he married my daughter, mary. the
other was johnson, the man who founded the utah tribe. that was where he
came from, utah, a country that lies very far away from here, across the
great deserts, to the east. it was not until twenty-seven years after
the plague that johnson reached california. in all that utah region he
reported but three survivors, himself one, and all men. for many years
these three men lived and hunted together, until, at last, desperate,
fearing that with them the human race would perish utterly from the
planet, they headed westward on the possibility of finding women
survivors in california. johnson alone came through the great desert,
where his two companions died. he was forty-six years old when he joined
us, and he married the fourth daughter of isadore and hale, and his
eldest son married your aunt, hare-lip, who was the third daughter of
vesta and the chauffeur. johnson was a strong man, with a will of his
own. and it was because of this that he seceded from the santa rosans
and formed the utah tribe at san josé. it is a small tribe--there are
only nine in it; but, though he is dead, such was his influence and the
strength of his breed, that it will grow into a strong tribe and play a
leading part in the recivilization of the planet.

“there are only two other tribes that we know of--the los angelitos
and the carmelitos. the latter started from one man and woman. he was
called lopez, and he was descended from the ancient mexicans and was
very black. he was a cowherd in the ranges beyond carmel, and his wife
was a maidservant in the great del monte hotel. it was seven years
before we first got in touch with the los ange-litos. they have a
good country down there, but it is too warm. i estimate the present
population of the world at between three hundred and fifty and four
hundred--provided, of course, that there are no scattered little tribes
elsewhere in the world. if there be such, we have not heard from them.
since johnson crossed the desert from utah, no word nor sign has come
from the east or anywhere else. the great world which i knew in my
boyhood and early manhood is gone. it has ceased to be. i am the last
man who was alive in the days of the plague and who knows the wonders of
that far-off time. we, who mastered the planet--its earth, and sea, and
sky--and who were as very gods, now live in primitive savagery along the
water courses of this california country.

“but we are increasing rapidly--your sister, hare-lip, already has four
children. we are increasing rapidly and making ready for a new climb
toward civilization. in time, pressure of population will compel us
to spread out, and a hundred generations from now we may expect our
descendants to start across the sierras, oozing slowly along, generation
by generation, over the great continent to the colonization of the
east--a new aryan drift around the world.

“but it will be slow, very slow; we have so far to climb. we fell so
hopelessly far. if only one physicist or one chemist had survived!
but it was not to be, and we have forgotten everything. the chauffeur
started working in iron. he made the forge which we use to this day.
but he was a lazy man, and when he died he took with him all he knew
of metals and machinery. what was i to know of such things? i was a
classical scholar, not a chemist.. the other men who survived were not
educated. only two things did the chauffeur accomplish--the brewing
of strong drink and the growing of tobacco. it was while he was drunk,
once, that he killed vesta. i firmly believe that he killed vesta in a
fit of drunken cruelty though he always maintained that she fell into
the lake and was drowned.

“and, my grandsons, let me warn you against the medicine-men. they call
themselves _doctors_, travestying what was once a noble profession, but
in reality they are medicine-men, devil-devil men, and they make for
superstition and darkness. they are cheats and liars. but so debased and
degraded are we, that we believe their lies. they, too, will increase
in numbers as we increase, and they will strive to rule us. yet are
they liars and charlatans. look at young cross-eyes, posing as a
doctor, selling charms against sickness, giving good hunting,
exchanging promises of fair weather for good meat and skins, sending the
death-stick, performing a thousand abominations. yet i say to you,
that when he says he can do these things, he lies. i, professor smith,
professor james howard smith, say that he lies. i have told him so to
his teeth. why has he not sent me the death-stick? because he knows that
with me it is without avail. but you, hare-lip, so deeply are you
sunk in black superstition that did you awake this night and find the
death-stick beside you, you would surely die. and you would die, not
because of any virtues in the stick, but because you are a savage with
the dark and clouded mind of a savage.

“the doctors must be destroyed, and all that was lost must be discovered
over again. wherefore, earnestly, i repeat unto you certain things which
you must remember and tell to your children after you. you must tell
them that when water is made hot by fire, there resides in it a
wonderful thing called steam, which is stronger than ten thousand men
and which can do all man's work for him. there are other very useful
things. in the lightning flash resides a similarly strong servant of
man, which was of old his slave and which some day will be his slave
again.

[illustration: i have stored many books in a cave 179]

“quite a different thing is the alphabet. it is what enables me to
know the meaning of fine markings, whereas you boys know only rude
picture-writing. in that dry cave on telegraph hill, where you see me
often go when the tribe is down by the sea, i have stored many books.
in them is great wisdom. also, with them, i have placed a key to the
alphabet, so that one who knows picture-writing may also know print.
some day men will read again; and then, if no accident has befallen my
cave, they will know that professor james howard smith once lived and
saved for them the knowledge of the ancients.

“there is another little device that men inevitably will rediscover. it
is called gunpowder. it was what enabled us to kill surely and at long
distances. certain things which are found in the ground, when combined
in the right proportions, will make this gunpowder. what these things
are, i have forgotten, or else i never knew. but i wish i did know. then
would i make powder, and then would i certainly kill cross-eyes and rid
the land of superstition--”

“after i am man-grown i am going to give cross-eyes all the goats,
and meat, and skins i can get, so that he'll teach me to be a doctor,”
 hoo-hoo asserted. “and when i know, i'll make everybody else sit up and
take notice. they'll get down in the dirt to me, you bet.”

the old man nodded his head solemnly, and murmured:

“strange it is to hear the vestiges and remnants of the complicated
aryan speech falling from the lips of a filthy little skin-clad savage.
all the world is topsy-turvy. and it has been topsy-turvy ever since the
plague.”

“you won't make me sit up,” hare-lip boasted to the would-be
medicine-man. “if i paid you for a sending of the death-stick and it
didn't work, i'd bust in your head--understand, you hoo-hoo, you?”

“i'm going to get granser to remember this here gunpowder stuff,” edwin
said softly, “and then i'll have you all on the run. you, hare-lip, will
do my fighting for me and get my meat for me, and you, hoo-hoo, will
send the death-stick for me and make everybody afraid. and if i catch
hare-lip trying to bust your head, hoo-hoo, i'll fix him with that same
gunpowder. granser ain't such a fool as you think, and i'm going to
listen to him and some day i'll be boss over the whole bunch of you.”

the old man shook his head sadly, and said:

“the gunpowder will come. nothing can stop it--the same old story over
and over. man will increase, and men will fight. the gunpowder will
enable men to kill millions of men, and in this way only, by fire and
blood, will a new civilization, in some remote day, be evolved. and of
what profit will it be? just as the old civilization passed, so will the
new. it may take fifty thousand years to build, but it will pass. all
things pass. only remain cosmic force and matter, ever in flux, ever
acting and reacting and realizing the eternal types--the priest, the
soldier, and the king. out of the mouths of babes comes the wisdom of
all the ages. some will fight, some will rule, some will pray; and all
the rest will toil and suffer sore while on their bleeding carcasses
is reared again, and yet again, without end, the amazing beauty and
surpassing wonder of the civilized state. it were just as well that i
destroyed those cave-stored books--whether they remain or perish, all
their old truths will be discovered, their old lies lived and handed
down. what is the profit--”

hare-lip leaped to his feet, giving a quick glance at the pasturing
goats and the afternoon sun.

“gee!” he muttered to edwin, “the old geezer gets more long-winded every
day. let's pull for camp.”

while the other two, aided by the dogs, assembled the goats and started
them for the trail through the forest, edwin stayed by the old man and
guided him in the same direction. when they reached the old right of
way, edwin stopped suddenly and looked back. hare-lip and hoo-hoo and
the dogs and the goats passed on. edwin was looking at a small herd of
wild horses which had come down on the hard sand. there were at least
twenty of them, young colts and yearlings and mares, led by a beautiful
stallion which stood in the foam at the edge of the surf, with arched
neck and bright wild eyes, sniffing the salt air from off the sea.

“what is it?” granser queried.

“horses,” was the answer. “first time i ever seen 'em on the beach. it's
the mountain lions getting thicker and thicker and driving 'em down.”

the low sun shot red shafts of light, fan-shaped, up from a
cloud-tumbled horizon. and close at hand, in the white waste of
shore-lashed waters, the sea-lions, bellowing their old primeval chant,
hauled up out of the sea on the black rocks and fought and loved.

“come on, granser,” edwin prompted. and old man and boy, skin-clad and
barbaric, turned and went along the right of way into the forest in the
wake of the goats.

the end

lost face


it was the end.  subienkow had travelled a long trail of bitterness and
horror, homing like a dove for the capitals of europe, and here, farther
away than ever, in russian america, the trail ceased.  he sat in the
snow, arms tied behind him, waiting the torture.  he stared curiously
before him at a huge cossack, prone in the snow, moaning in his pain.
the men had finished handling the giant and turned him over to the women.
that they exceeded the fiendishness of the men, the man’s cries attested.

subienkow looked on, and shuddered.  he was not afraid to die.  he had
carried his life too long in his hands, on that weary trail from warsaw
to nulato, to shudder at mere dying.  but he objected to the torture.  it
offended his soul.  and this offence, in turn, was not due to the mere
pain he must endure, but to the sorry spectacle the pain would make of
him.  he knew that he would pray, and beg, and entreat, even as big ivan
and the others that had gone before.  this would not be nice.  to pass
out bravely and cleanly, with a smile and a jest—ah! that would have been
the way.  but to lose control, to have his soul upset by the pangs of the
flesh, to screech and gibber like an ape, to become the veriest beast—ah,
that was what was so terrible.

there had been no chance to escape.  from the beginning, when he dreamed
the fiery dream of poland’s independence, he had become a puppet in the
hands of fate.  from the beginning, at warsaw, at st. petersburg, in the
siberian mines, in kamtchatka, on the crazy boats of the fur-thieves,
fate had been driving him to this end.  without doubt, in the foundations
of the world was graved this end for him—for him, who was so fine and
sensitive, whose nerves scarcely sheltered under his skin, who was a
dreamer, and a poet, and an artist.  before he was dreamed of, it had
been determined that the quivering bundle of sensitiveness that
constituted him should be doomed to live in raw and howling savagery, and
to die in this far land of night, in this dark place beyond the last
boundaries of the world.

he sighed.  so that thing before him was big ivan—big ivan the giant, the
man without nerves, the man of iron, the cossack turned freebooter of the
seas, who was as phlegmatic as an ox, with a nervous system so low that
what was pain to ordinary men was scarcely a tickle to him.  well, well,
trust these nulato indians to find big ivan’s nerves and trace them to
the roots of his quivering soul.  they were certainly doing it.  it was
inconceivable that a man could suffer so much and yet live.  big ivan was
paying for his low order of nerves.  already he had lasted twice as long
as any of the others.

subienkow felt that he could not stand the cossack’s sufferings much
longer.  why didn’t ivan die?  he would go mad if that screaming did not
cease.  but when it did cease, his turn would come.  and there was yakaga
awaiting him, too, grinning at him even now in anticipation—yakaga, whom
only last week he had kicked out of the fort, and upon whose face he had
laid the lash of his dog-whip.  yakaga would attend to him.  doubtlessly
yakaga was saving for him more refined tortures, more exquisite
nerve-racking.  ah! that must have been a good one, from the way ivan
screamed.  the squaws bending over him stepped back with laughter and
clapping of hands.  subienkow saw the monstrous thing that had been
perpetrated, and began to laugh hysterically.  the indians looked at him
in wonderment that he should laugh.  but subienkow could not stop.

this would never do.  he controlled himself, the spasmodic twitchings
slowly dying away.  he strove to think of other things, and began reading
back in his own life.  he remembered his mother and his father, and the
little spotted pony, and the french tutor who had taught him dancing and
sneaked him an old worn copy of voltaire.  once more he saw paris, and
dreary london, and gay vienna, and rome.  and once more he saw that wild
group of youths who had dreamed, even as he, the dream of an independent
poland with a king of poland on the throne at warsaw.  ah, there it was
that the long trail began.  well, he had lasted longest.  one by one,
beginning with the two executed at st. petersburg, he took up the count
of the passing of those brave spirits.  here one had been beaten to death
by a jailer, and there, on that bloodstained highway of the exiles, where
they had marched for endless months, beaten and maltreated by their
cossack guards, another had dropped by the way.  always it had been
savagery—brutal, bestial savagery.  they had died—of fever, in the mines,
under the knout.  the last two had died after the escape, in the battle
with the cossacks, and he alone had won to kamtchatka with the stolen
papers and the money of a traveller he had left lying in the snow.

it had been nothing but savagery.  all the years, with his heart in
studios, and theatres, and courts, he had been hemmed in by savagery.  he
had purchased his life with blood.  everybody had killed.  he had killed
that traveller for his passports.  he had proved that he was a man of
parts by duelling with two russian officers on a single day.  he had had
to prove himself in order to win to a place among the fur-thieves.  he
had had to win to that place.  behind him lay the thousand-years-long
road across all siberia and russia.  he could not escape that way.  the
only way was ahead, across the dark and icy sea of bering to alaska.  the
way had led from savagery to deeper savagery.  on the scurvy-rotten ships
of the fur-thieves, out of food and out of water, buffeted by the
interminable storms of that stormy sea, men had become animals.  thrice
he had sailed east from kamtchatka.  and thrice, after all manner of
hardship and suffering, the survivors had come back to kamtchatka.  there
had been no outlet for escape, and he could not go back the way he had
come, for the mines and the knout awaited him.

again, the fourth and last time, he had sailed east.  he had been with
those who first found the fabled seal islands; but he had not returned
with them to share the wealth of furs in the mad orgies of kamtchatka.
he had sworn never to go back.  he knew that to win to those dear
capitals of europe he must go on.  so he had changed ships and remained
in the dark new land.  his comrades were slavonian hunters and russian
adventurers, mongols and tartars and siberian aborigines; and through the
savages of the new world they had cut a path of blood.  they had
massacred whole villages that refused to furnish the fur-tribute; and
they, in turn, had been massacred by ships’ companies.  he, with one
finn, had been the sole survivor of such a company.  they had spent a
winter of solitude and starvation on a lonely aleutian isle, and their
rescue in the spring by another fur-ship had been one chance in a
thousand.

but always the terrible savagery had hemmed him in.  passing from ship to
ship, and ever refusing to return, he had come to the ship that explored
south.  all down the alaska coast they had encountered nothing but hosts
of savages.  every anchorage among the beetling islands or under the
frowning cliffs of the mainland had meant a battle or a storm.  either
the gales blew, threatening destruction, or the war canoes came off,
manned by howling natives with the war-paint on their faces, who came to
learn the bloody virtues of the sea-rovers’ gunpowder.  south, south they
had coasted, clear to the myth-land of california.  here, it was said,
were spanish adventurers who had fought their way up from mexico.  he had
had hopes of those spanish adventurers.  escaping to them, the rest would
have been easy—a year or two, what did it matter more or less—and he
would win to mexico, then a ship, and europe would be his.  but they had
met no spaniards.  only had they encountered the same impregnable wall of
savagery.  the denizens of the confines of the world, painted for war,
had driven them back from the shores.  at last, when one boat was cut off
and every man killed, the commander had abandoned the quest and sailed
back to the north.

the years had passed.  he had served under tebenkoff when michaelovski
redoubt was built.  he had spent two years in the kuskokwim country.  two
summers, in the month of june, he had managed to be at the head of
kotzebue sound.  here, at this time, the tribes assembled for barter;
here were to be found spotted deerskins from siberia, ivory from the
diomedes, walrus skins from the shores of the arctic, strange stone
lamps, passing in trade from tribe to tribe, no one knew whence, and,
once, a hunting-knife of english make; and here, subienkow knew, was the
school in which to learn geography.  for he met eskimos from norton
sound, from king island and st. lawrence island, from cape prince of
wales, and point barrow.  such places had other names, and their
distances were measured in days.

it was a vast region these trading savages came from, and a vaster region
from which, by repeated trade, their stone lamps and that steel knife had
come.  subienkow bullied, and cajoled, and bribed.  every far-journeyer
or strange tribesman was brought before him.  perils unaccountable and
unthinkable were mentioned, as well as wild beasts, hostile tribes,
impenetrable forests, and mighty mountain ranges; but always from beyond
came the rumour and the tale of white-skinned men, blue of eye and fair
of hair, who fought like devils and who sought always for furs.  they
were to the east—far, far to the east.  no one had seen them.  it was the
word that had been passed along.

it was a hard school.  one could not learn geography very well through
the medium of strange dialects, from dark minds that mingled fact and
fable and that measured distances by “sleeps” that varied according to
the difficulty of the going.  but at last came the whisper that gave
subienkow courage.  in the east lay a great river where were these
blue-eyed men.  the river was called the yukon.  south of michaelovski
redoubt emptied another great river which the russians knew as the
kwikpak.  these two rivers were one, ran the whisper.

subienkow returned to michaelovski.  for a year he urged an expedition up
the kwikpak.  then arose malakoff, the russian half-breed, to lead the
wildest and most ferocious of the hell’s broth of mongrel adventurers who
had crossed from kamtchatka.  subienkow was his lieutenant.  they
threaded the mazes of the great delta of the kwikpak, picked up the first
low hills on the northern bank, and for half a thousand miles, in skin
canoes loaded to the gunwales with trade-goods and ammunition, fought
their way against the five-knot current of a river that ran from two to
ten miles wide in a channel many fathoms deep.  malakoff decided to build
the fort at nulato.  subienkow urged to go farther.  but he quickly
reconciled himself to nulato.  the long winter was coming on.  it would
be better to wait.  early the following summer, when the ice was gone, he
would disappear up the kwikpak and work his way to the hudson bay
company’s posts.  malakoff had never heard the whisper that the kwikpak
was the yukon, and subienkow did not tell him.

came the building of the fort.  it was enforced labour.  the tiered walls
of logs arose to the sighs and groans of the nulato indians.  the lash
was laid upon their backs, and it was the iron hand of the freebooters of
the sea that laid on the lash.  there were indians that ran away, and
when they were caught they were brought back and spread-eagled before the
fort, where they and their tribe learned the efficacy of the knout.  two
died under it; others were injured for life; and the rest took the lesson
to heart and ran away no more.  the snow was flying ere the fort was
finished, and then it was the time for furs.  a heavy tribute was laid
upon the tribe.  blows and lashings continued, and that the tribute
should be paid, the women and children were held as hostages and treated
with the barbarity that only the fur-thieves knew.

well, it had been a sowing of blood, and now was come the harvest.  the
fort was gone.  in the light of its burning, half the fur-thieves had
been cut down.  the other half had passed under the torture.  only
subienkow remained, or subienkow and big ivan, if that whimpering,
moaning thing in the snow could be called big ivan.  subienkow caught
yakaga grinning at him.  there was no gainsaying yakaga.  the mark of the
lash was still on his face.  after all, subienkow could not blame him,
but he disliked the thought of what yakaga would do to him.  he thought
of appealing to makamuk, the head-chief; but his judgment told him that
such appeal was useless.  then, too, he thought of bursting his bonds and
dying fighting.  such an end would be quick.  but he could not break his
bonds.  caribou thongs were stronger than he.  still devising, another
thought came to him.  he signed for makamuk, and that an interpreter who
knew the coast dialect should be brought.

“oh, makamuk,” he said, “i am not minded to die.  i am a great man, and
it were foolishness for me to die.  in truth, i shall not die.  i am not
like these other carrion.”

he looked at the moaning thing that had once been big ivan, and stirred
it contemptuously with his toe.

“i am too wise to die.  behold, i have a great medicine.  i alone know
this medicine.  since i am not going to die, i shall exchange this
medicine with you.”

“what is this medicine?” makamuk demanded.

“it is a strange medicine.”

subienkow debated with himself for a moment, as if loth to part with the
secret.

“i will tell you.  a little bit of this medicine rubbed on the skin makes
the skin hard like a rock, hard like iron, so that no cutting weapon can
cut it.  the strongest blow of a cutting weapon is a vain thing against
it.  a bone knife becomes like a piece of mud; and it will turn the edge
of the iron knives we have brought among you.  what will you give me for
the secret of the medicine?”

“i will give you your life,” makamuk made answer through the interpreter.

subienkow laughed scornfully.

“and you shall be a slave in my house until you die.”

the pole laughed more scornfully.

“untie my hands and feet and let us talk,” he said.

the chief made the sign; and when he was loosed subienkow rolled a
cigarette and lighted it.

“this is foolish talk,” said makamuk.  “there is no such medicine.  it
cannot be.  a cutting edge is stronger than any medicine.”

the chief was incredulous, and yet he wavered.  he had seen too many
deviltries of fur-thieves that worked.  he could not wholly doubt.

“i will give you your life; but you shall not be a slave,” he announced.

“more than that.”

subienkow played his game as coolly as if he were bartering for a
foxskin.

“it is a very great medicine.  it has saved my life many times.  i want a
sled and dogs, and six of your hunters to travel with me down the river
and give me safety to one day’s sleep from michaelovski redoubt.”

“you must live here, and teach us all of your deviltries,” was the reply.

subienkow shrugged his shoulders and remained silent.  he blew cigarette
smoke out on the icy air, and curiously regarded what remained of the big
cossack.

“that scar!” makamuk said suddenly, pointing to the pole’s neck, where a
livid mark advertised the slash of a knife in a kamtchatkan brawl.  “the
medicine is not good.  the cutting edge was stronger than the medicine.”

“it was a strong man that drove the stroke.”  (subienkow considered.)
“stronger than you, stronger than your strongest hunter, stronger than
he.”

again, with the toe of his moccasin, he touched the cossack—a grisly
spectacle, no longer conscious—yet in whose dismembered body the
pain-racked life clung and was loth to go.

“also, the medicine was weak.  for at that place there were no berries of
a certain kind, of which i see you have plenty in this country.  the
medicine here will be strong.”

“i will let you go down river,” said makamuk; “and the sled and the dogs
and the six hunters to give you safety shall be yours.”

“you are slow,” was the cool rejoinder.  “you have committed an offence
against my medicine in that you did not at once accept my terms.  behold,
i now demand more.  i want one hundred beaver skins.”  (makamuk sneered.)

“i want one hundred pounds of dried fish.”  (makamuk nodded, for fish
were plentiful and cheap.)  “i want two sleds—one for me and one for my
furs and fish.  and my rifle must be returned to me.  if you do not like
the price, in a little while the price will grow.”

yakaga whispered to the chief.

“but how can i know your medicine is true medicine?” makamuk asked.

“it is very easy.  first, i shall go into the woods—”

again yakaga whispered to makamuk, who made a suspicious dissent.

“you can send twenty hunters with me,” subienkow went on.  “you see, i
must get the berries and the roots with which to make the medicine.
then, when you have brought the two sleds and loaded on them the fish and
the beaver skins and the rifle, and when you have told off the six
hunters who will go with me—then, when all is ready, i will rub the
medicine on my neck, so, and lay my neck there on that log.  then can
your strongest hunter take the axe and strike three times on my neck.
you yourself can strike the three times.”

makamuk stood with gaping mouth, drinking in this latest and most
wonderful magic of the fur-thieves.

“but first,” the pole added hastily, “between each blow i must put on
fresh medicine.  the axe is heavy and sharp, and i want no mistakes.”

“all that you have asked shall be yours,” makamuk cried in a rush of
acceptance.  “proceed to make your medicine.”

subienkow concealed his elation.  he was playing a desperate game, and
there must be no slips.  he spoke arrogantly.

“you have been slow.  my medicine is offended.  to make the offence clean
you must give me your daughter.”

he pointed to the girl, an unwholesome creature, with a cast in one eye
and a bristling wolf-tooth.  makamuk was angry, but the pole remained
imperturbable, rolling and lighting another cigarette.

“make haste,” he threatened.  “if you are not quick, i shall demand yet
more.”

in the silence that followed, the dreary northland scene faded before
him, and he saw once more his native land, and france, and, once, as he
glanced at the wolf-toothed girl, he remembered another girl, a singer
and a dancer, whom he had known when first as a youth he came to paris.

“what do you want with the girl?” makamuk asked.

“to go down the river with me.”  subienkow glanced over her critically.
“she will make a good wife, and it is an honour worthy of my medicine to
be married to your blood.”

again he remembered the singer and dancer and hummed aloud a song she had
taught him.  he lived the old life over, but in a detached, impersonal
sort of way, looking at the memory-pictures of his own life as if they
were pictures in a book of anybody’s life.  the chief’s voice, abruptly
breaking the silence, startled him

“it shall be done,” said makamuk.  “the girl shall go down the river with
you.  but be it understood that i myself strike the three blows with the
axe on your neck.”

“but each time i shall put on the medicine,” subienkow answered, with a
show of ill-concealed anxiety.

“you shall put the medicine on between each blow.  here are the hunters
who shall see you do not escape.  go into the forest and gather your
medicine.”

makamuk had been convinced of the worth of the medicine by the pole’s
rapacity.  surely nothing less than the greatest of medicines could
enable a man in the shadow of death to stand up and drive an old-woman’s
bargain.

“besides,” whispered yakaga, when the pole, with his guard, had
disappeared among the spruce trees, “when you have learned the medicine
you can easily destroy him.”

“but how can i destroy him?” makamuk argued.  “his medicine will not let
me destroy him.”

“there will be some part where he has not rubbed the medicine,” was
yakaga’s reply.  “we will destroy him through that part.  it may be his
ears.  very well; we will thrust a spear in one ear and out the other.
or it may be his eyes.  surely the medicine will be much too strong to
rub on his eyes.”

the chief nodded.  “you are wise, yakaga.  if he possesses no other
devil-things, we will then destroy him.”

subienkow did not waste time in gathering the ingredients for his
medicine, he selected whatsoever came to hand such as spruce needles, the
inner bark of the willow, a strip of birch bark, and a quantity of
moss-berries, which he made the hunters dig up for him from beneath the
snow.  a few frozen roots completed his supply, and he led the way back
to camp.

makamuk and yakaga crouched beside him, noting the quantities and kinds
of the ingredients he dropped into the pot of boiling water.

“you must be careful that the moss-berries go in first,” he explained.

“and—oh, yes, one other thing—the finger of a man.  here, yakaga, let me
cut off your finger.”

but yakaga put his hands behind him and scowled.

“just a small finger,” subienkow pleaded.

“yakaga, give him your finger,” makamuk commanded.

“there be plenty of fingers lying around,” yakaga grunted, indicating the
human wreckage in the snow of the score of persons who had been tortured
to death.

“it must be the finger of a live man,” the pole objected.

“then shall you have the finger of a live man.”  yakaga strode over to
the cossack and sliced off a finger.

“he is not yet dead,” he announced, flinging the bloody trophy in the
snow at the pole’s feet.  “also, it is a good finger, because it is
large.”

subienkow dropped it into the fire under the pot and began to sing.  it
was a french love-song that with great solemnity he sang into the brew.

“without these words i utter into it, the medicine is worthless,” he
explained.  “the words are the chiefest strength of it.  behold, it is
ready.”

“name the words slowly, that i may know them,” makamuk commanded.

“not until after the test.  when the axe flies back three times from my
neck, then will i give you the secret of the words.”

“but if the medicine is not good medicine?” makamuk queried anxiously.

subienkow turned upon him wrathfully.

“my medicine is always good.  however, if it is not good, then do by me
as you have done to the others.  cut me up a bit at a time, even as you
have cut him up.”  he pointed to the cossack.  “the medicine is now cool.
thus, i rub it on my neck, saying this further medicine.”

with great gravity he slowly intoned a line of the “marseillaise,” at the
same time rubbing the villainous brew thoroughly into his neck.

an outcry interrupted his play-acting.  the giant cossack, with a last
resurgence of his tremendous vitality, had arisen to his knees.  laughter
and cries of surprise and applause arose from the nulatos, as big ivan
began flinging himself about in the snow with mighty spasms.

subienkow was made sick by the sight, but he mastered his qualms and made
believe to be angry.

“this will not do,” he said.  “finish him, and then we will make the
test.  here, you, yakaga, see that his noise ceases.”

while this was being done, subienkow turned to makamuk.

“and remember, you are to strike hard.  this is not baby-work.  here,
take the axe and strike the log, so that i can see you strike like a
man.”

makamuk obeyed, striking twice, precisely and with vigour, cutting out a
large chip.

“it is well.”  subienkow looked about him at the circle of savage faces
that somehow seemed to symbolize the wall of savagery that had hemmed him
about ever since the czar’s police had first arrested him in warsaw.
“take your axe, makamuk, and stand so.  i shall lie down.  when i raise
my hand, strike, and strike with all your might.  and be careful that no
one stands behind you.  the medicine is good, and the axe may bounce from
off my neck and right out of your hands.”

he looked at the two sleds, with the dogs in harness, loaded with furs
and fish.  his rifle lay on top of the beaver skins.  the six hunters who
were to act as his guard stood by the sleds.

“where is the girl?” the pole demanded.  “bring her up to the sleds
before the test goes on.”

when this had been carried out, subienkow lay down in the snow, resting
his head on the log like a tired child about to sleep.  he had lived so
many dreary years that he was indeed tired.

“i laugh at you and your strength, o makamuk,” he said.  “strike, and
strike hard.”

he lifted his hand.  makamuk swung the axe, a broadaxe for the squaring
of logs.  the bright steel flashed through the frosty air, poised for a
perceptible instant above makamuk’s head, then descended upon subienkow’s
bare neck.  clear through flesh and bone it cut its way, biting deeply
into the log beneath.  the amazed savages saw the head bounce a yard away
from the blood-spouting trunk.

there was a great bewilderment and silence, while slowly it began to dawn
in their minds that there had been no medicine.  the fur-thief had
outwitted them.  alone, of all their prisoners, he had escaped the
torture.  that had been the stake for which he played.  a great roar of
laughter went up.  makamuk bowed his head in shame.  the fur-thief had
fooled him.  he had lost face before all his people.  still they
continued to roar out their laughter.  makamuk turned, and with bowed
head stalked away.  he knew that thenceforth he would be no longer known
as makamuk.  he would be lost face; the record of his shame would be with
him until he died; and whenever the tribes gathered in the spring for the
salmon, or in the summer for the trading, the story would pass back and
forth across the camp-fires of how the fur-thief died peaceably, at a
single stroke, by the hand of lost face.

“who was lost face?” he could hear, in anticipation, some insolent young
buck demand, “oh, lost face,” would be the answer, “he who once was
makamuk in the days before he cut off the fur-thief’s head.”




trust


all lines had been cast off, and the _seattle no._ 4 was pulling slowly
out from the shore.  her decks were piled high with freight and baggage,
and swarmed with a heterogeneous company of indians, dogs, and
dog-mushers, prospectors, traders, and homeward-bound gold-seekers.  a
goodly portion of dawson was lined up on the bank, saying good-bye.  as
the gang-plank came in and the steamer nosed into the stream, the clamour
of farewell became deafening.  also, in that eleventh moment, everybody
began to remember final farewell messages and to shout them back and
forth across the widening stretch of water.  louis bondell, curling his
yellow moustache with one hand and languidly waving the other hand to his
friends on shore, suddenly remembered something and sprang to the rail.

“oh, fred!” he bawled.  “oh, fred!”

the “fred” desired thrust a strapping pair of shoulders through the
forefront of the crowd on the bank and tried to catch louis bondell’s
message.  the latter grew red in the face with vain vociferation.  still
the water widened between steamboat and shore.

“hey, you, captain scott!” he yelled at the pilot-house.  “stop the
boat!”

the gongs clanged, and the big stern wheel reversed, then stopped.  all
hands on steamboat and on bank took advantage of this respite to exchange
final, new, and imperative farewells.  more futile than ever was louis
bondell’s effort to make himself heard.  the _seattle no._ 4 lost way and
drifted down-stream, and captain scott had to go ahead and reverse a
second time.  his head disappeared inside the pilot-house, coming into
view a moment later behind a big megaphone.

now captain scott had a remarkable voice, and the “shut up!” he launched
at the crowd on deck and on shore could have been heard at the top of
moosehide mountain and as far as klondike city.  this official
remonstrance from the pilot-house spread a film of silence over the
tumult.

“now, what do you want to say?” captain scott demanded.

“tell fred churchill—he’s on the bank there—tell him to go to macdonald.
it’s in his safe—a small gripsack of mine.  tell him to get it and bring
it out when he comes.”

in the silence captain scott bellowed the message ashore through the
megaphone:—

“you, fred churchill, go to macdonald—in his safe—small gripsack—belongs
to louis bondell—important!  bring it out when you come!  got it!”

churchill waved his hand in token that he had got it.  in truth, had
macdonald, half a mile away, opened his window, he’d have got it, too.
the tumult of farewell rose again, the gongs clanged, and the _seattle
no._ 4 went ahead, swung out into the stream, turned on her heel, and
headed down the yukon, bondell and churchill waving farewell and mutual
affection to the last.

that was in midsummer.  in the fall of the year, the _w. h. willis_
started up the yukon with two hundred homeward-bound pilgrims on board.
among them was churchill.  in his state-room, in the middle of a
clothes-bag, was louis bondell’s grip.  it was a small, stout leather
affair, and its weight of forty pounds always made churchill nervous when
he wandered too far from it.  the man in the adjoining state-room had a
treasure of gold-dust hidden similarly in a clothes-bag, and the pair of
them ultimately arranged to stand watch and watch.  while one went down
to eat, the other kept an eye on the two state-room doors.  when
churchill wanted to take a hand at whist, the other man mounted guard,
and when the other man wanted to relax his soul, churchill read
four-months’ old newspapers on a camp stool between the two doors.

there were signs of an early winter, and the question that was discussed
from dawn till dark, and far into the dark, was whether they would get
out before the freeze-up or be compelled to abandon the steamboat and
tramp out over the ice.  there were irritating delays.  twice the engines
broke down and had to be tinkered up, and each time there were snow
flurries to warn them of the imminence of winter.  nine times the _w. h.
willis_ essayed to ascend the five-finger rapids with her impaired
machinery, and when she succeeded, she was four days behind her very
liberal schedule.  the question that then arose was whether or not the
steamboat _flora_ would wait for her above the box cañon.  the stretch of
water between the head of the box cañon and the foot of the white horse
rapids was unnavigable for steamboats, and passengers were transhipped at
that point, walking around the rapids from one steamboat to the other.
there were no telephones in the country, hence no way of informing the
waiting _flora_ that the _willis_ was four days late, but coming.

when the _w. h. willis_ pulled into white horse, it was learned that the
_flora_ had waited three days over the limit, and had departed only a few
hours before.  also, it was learned that she would tie up at tagish post
till nine o’clock, sunday morning.  it was then four o’clock, saturday
afternoon.  the pilgrims called a meeting.  on board was a large
peterborough canoe, consigned to the police post at the head of lake
bennett.  they agreed to be responsible for it and to deliver it.  next,
they called for volunteers.  two men were needed to make a race for the
_flora_.  a score of men volunteered on the instant.  among them was
churchill, such being his nature that he volunteered before he thought of
bondell’s gripsack.  when this thought came to him, he began to hope that
he would not be selected; but a man who had made a name as captain of a
college football eleven, as a president of an athletic club, as a
dog-musher and a stampeder in the yukon, and, moreover, who possessed
such shoulders as he, had no right to avoid the honour.  it was thrust
upon him and upon a gigantic german, nick antonsen.

while a crowd of the pilgrims, the canoe on their shoulders, started on a
trot over the portage, churchill ran to his state-room.  he turned the
contents of the clothes-bag on the floor and caught up the grip, with the
intention of entrusting it to the man next door.  then the thought smote
him that it was not his grip, and that he had no right to let it out of
his possession.  so he dashed ashore with it and ran up the portage
changing it often from one hand to the other, and wondering if it really
did not weigh more than forty pounds.

it was half-past four in the afternoon when the two men started.  the
current of the thirty mile river was so strong that rarely could they use
the paddles.  it was out on one bank with a tow-line over the shoulders,
stumbling over the rocks, forcing a way through the underbrush, slipping
at times and falling into the water, wading often up to the knees and
waist; and then, when an insurmountable bluff was encountered, it was
into the canoe, out paddles, and a wild and losing dash across the
current to the other bank, in paddles, over the side, and out tow-line
again.  it was exhausting work.  antonsen toiled like the giant he was,
uncomplaining, persistent, but driven to his utmost by the powerful body
and indomitable brain of churchill.  they never paused for rest.  it was
go, go, and keep on going.  a crisp wind blew down the river, freezing
their hands and making it imperative, from time to time, to beat the
blood back into the numbed fingers.

as night came on, they were compelled to trust to luck.  they fell
repeatedly on the untravelled banks and tore their clothing to shreds in
the underbrush they could not see.  both men were badly scratched and
bleeding.  a dozen times, in their wild dashes from bank to bank, they
struck snags and were capsized.  the first time this happened, churchill
dived and groped in three feet of water for the gripsack.  he lost half
an hour in recovering it, and after that it was carried securely lashed
to the canoe.  as long as the canoe floated it was safe.  antonsen jeered
at the grip, and toward morning began to curse it; but churchill
vouchsafed no explanations.

their delays and mischances were endless.  on one swift bend, around
which poured a healthy young rapid, they lost two hours, making a score
of attempts and capsizing twice.  at this point, on both banks, were
precipitous bluffs, rising out of deep water, and along which they could
neither tow nor pole, while they could not gain with the paddles against
the current.  at each attempt they strained to the utmost with the
paddles, and each time, with heads nigh to bursting from the effort, they
were played out and swept back.  they succeeded finally by an accident.
in the swiftest current, near the end of another failure, a freak of the
current sheered the canoe out of churchill’s control and flung it against
the bluff.  churchill made a blind leap at the bluff and landed in a
crevice.  holding on with one hand, he held the swamped canoe with the
other till antonsen dragged himself out of the water.  then they pulled
the canoe out and rested.  a fresh start at this crucial point took them
by.  they landed on the bank above and plunged immediately ashore and
into the brush with the tow-line.

daylight found them far below tagish post.  at nine o’clock sunday
morning they could hear the _flora_ whistling her departure.  and when,
at ten o’clock, they dragged themselves in to the post, they could barely
see the _flora’s_ smoke far to the southward.  it was a pair of worn-out
tatterdemalions that captain jones of the mounted police welcomed and
fed, and he afterward averred that they possessed two of the most
tremendous appetites he had ever observed.  they lay down and slept in
their wet rags by the stove.  at the end of two hours churchill got up,
carried bondell’s grip, which he had used for a pillow, down to the
canoe, kicked antonsen awake, and started in pursuit of the _flora_.

“there’s no telling what might happen—machinery break down, or
something,” was his reply to captain jones’s expostulations.  “i’m going
to catch that steamer and send her back for the boys.”

tagish lake was white with a fall gale that blew in their teeth.  big,
swinging seas rushed upon the canoe, compelling one man to bale and
leaving one man to paddle.  headway could not be made.  they ran along
the shallow shore and went overboard, one man ahead on the tow-line, the
other shoving on the canoe.  they fought the gale up to their waists in
the icy water, often up to their necks, often over their heads and buried
by the big, crested waves.  there was no rest, never a moment’s pause
from the cheerless, heart-breaking battle.  that night, at the head of
tagish lake, in the thick of a driving snow-squall, they overhauled the
_flora_.  antonsen fell on board, lay where he had fallen, and snored.
churchill looked like a wild man.  his clothes barely clung to him.  his
face was iced up and swollen from the protracted effort of twenty-four
hours, while his hands were so swollen that he could not close the
fingers.  as for his feet, it was an agony to stand upon them.

the captain of the _flora_ was loth to go back to white horse.  churchill
was persistent and imperative; the captain was stubborn.  he pointed out
finally that nothing was to be gained by going back, because the only
ocean steamer at dyea, the _athenian_, was to sail on tuesday morning,
and that he could not make the back trip to white horse and bring up the
stranded pilgrims in time to make the connection.

“what time does the _athenian_ sail?” churchill demanded.

“seven o’clock, tuesday morning.”

“all right,” churchill said, at the same time kicking a tattoo on the
ribs of the snoring antonsen.  “you go back to white home.  we’ll go
ahead and hold the _athenian_.”

antonsen, stupid with sleep, not yet clothed in his waking mind, was
bundled into the canoe, and did not realize what had happened till he was
drenched with the icy spray of a big sea, and heard churchill snarling at
him through the darkness:—

“paddle, can’t you!  do you want to be swamped?”

daylight found them at caribou crossing, the wind dying down, and
antonsen too far gone to dip a paddle.  churchill grounded the canoe on a
quiet beach, where they slept.  he took the precaution of twisting his
arm under the weight of his head.  every few minutes the pain of the pent
circulation aroused him, whereupon he would look at his watch and twist
the other arm under his head.  at the end of two hours he fought with
antonsen to rouse him.  then they started.  lake bennett, thirty miles in
length, was like a millpond; but, half way across, a gale from the south
smote them and turned the water white.  hour after hour they repeated the
struggle on tagish, over the side, pulling and shoving on the canoe, up
to their waists and necks, and over their heads, in the icy water; toward
the last the good-natured giant played completely out.  churchill drove
him mercilessly; but when he pitched forward and bade fair to drown in
three feet of water, the other dragged him into the canoe.  after that,
churchill fought on alone, arriving at the police post at the head of
bennett in the early afternoon.  he tried to help antonsen out of the
canoe, but failed.  he listened to the exhausted man’s heavy breathing,
and envied him when he thought of what he himself had yet to undergo.
antonsen could lie there and sleep; but he, behind time, must go on over
mighty chilcoot and down to the sea.  the real struggle lay before him,
and he almost regretted the strength that resided in his frame because of
the torment it could inflict upon that frame.

churchill pulled the canoe up on the beach, seized bondell’s grip, and
started on a limping dog-trot for the police post.

“there’s a canoe down there, consigned to you from dawson,” he hurled at
the officer who answered his knock.  “and there’s a man in it pretty near
dead.  nothing serious; only played out.  take care of him.  i’ve got to
rush.  good-bye.  want to catch the _athenian_.”

a mile portage connected lake bennett and lake linderman, and his last
words he flung back after him as he resumed the trot.  it was a very
painful trot, but he clenched his teeth and kept on, forgetting his pain
most of the time in the fervent heat with which he regarded the gripsack.
it was a severe handicap.  he swung it from one hand to the other, and
back again.  he tucked it under his arm.  he threw one hand over the
opposite shoulder, and the bag bumped and pounded on his back as he ran
along.  he could scarcely hold it in his bruised and swollen fingers, and
several times he dropped it.  once, in changing from one hand to the
other, it escaped his clutch and fell in front of him, tripped him up,
and threw him violently to the ground.

at the far end of the portage he bought an old set of pack-straps for a
dollar, and in them he swung the grip.  also, he chartered a launch to
run him the six miles to the upper end of lake linderman, where he
arrived at four in the afternoon.  the _athenian_ was to sail from dyea
next morning at seven.  dyea was twenty-eight miles away, and between
towered chilcoot.  he sat down to adjust his foot-gear for the long
climb, and woke up.  he had dozed the instant he sat down, though he had
not slept thirty seconds.  he was afraid his next doze might be longer,
so he finished fixing his foot-gear standing up.  even then he was
overpowered for a fleeting moment.  he experienced the flash of
unconsciousness; becoming aware of it, in mid-air, as his relaxed body
was sinking to the ground and as he caught himself together, he stiffened
his muscles with a spasmodic wrench, and escaped the fall.  the sudden
jerk back to consciousness left him sick and trembling.  he beat his head
with the heel of his hand, knocking wakefulness into the numbed brain.

jack burns’s pack-train was starting back light for crater lake, and
churchill was invited to a mule.  burns wanted to put the gripsack on
another animal, but churchill held on to it, carrying it on his
saddle-pommel.  but he dozed, and the grip persisted in dropping off the
pommel, one side or the other, each time wakening him with a sickening
start.  then, in the early darkness, churchill’s mule brushed him against
a projecting branch that laid his cheek open.  to cap it, the mule
blundered off the trail and fell, throwing rider and gripsack out upon
the rocks.  after that, churchill walked, or stumbled rather, over the
apology for a trail, leading the mule.  stray and awful odours, drifting
from each side of the trail, told of the horses that had died in the rush
for gold.  but he did not mind.  he was too sleepy.  by the time long
lake was reached, however, he had recovered from his sleepiness; and at
deep lake he resigned the gripsack to burns.  but thereafter, by the
light of the dim stars, he kept his eyes on burns.  there were not going
to be any accidents with that bag.

at crater lake, the pack-train went into camp, and churchill, slinging
the grip on his back, started the steep climb for the summit.  for the
first time, on that precipitous wall, he realized how tired he was.  he
crept and crawled like a crab, burdened by the weight of his limbs.  a
distinct and painful effort of will was required each time he lifted a
foot.  an hallucination came to him that he was shod with lead, like a
deep-sea diver, and it was all he could do to resist the desire to reach
down and feel the lead.  as for bondell’s gripsack, it was inconceivable
that forty pounds could weigh so much.  it pressed him down like a
mountain, and he looked back with unbelief to the year before, when he
had climbed that same pass with a hundred and fifty pounds on his back.
if those loads had weighed a hundred and fifty pounds, then bondell’s
grip weighed five hundred.

the first rise of the divide from crater lake was across a small glacier.
here was a well-defined trail.  but above the glacier, which was also
above timber-line, was naught but a chaos of naked rock and enormous
boulders.  there was no way of seeing the trail in the darkness, and he
blundered on, paying thrice the ordinary exertion for all that he
accomplished.  he won the summit in the thick of howling wind and driving
snow, providentially stumbling upon a small, deserted tent, into which he
crawled.  there he found and bolted some ancient fried potatoes and half
a dozen raw eggs.

when the snow ceased and the wind eased down, he began the almost
impossible descent.  there was no trail, and he stumbled and blundered,
often finding himself, at the last moment, on the edge of rocky walls and
steep slopes the depth of which he had no way of judging.  part way down,
the stars clouded over again, and in the consequent obscurity he slipped
and rolled and slid for a hundred feet, landing bruised and bleeding on
the bottom of a large shallow hole.  from all about him arose the stench
of dead horses.  the hole was handy to the trail, and the packers had
made a practice of tumbling into it their broken and dying animals.  the
stench overpowered him, making him deadly sick, and as in a nightmare he
scrambled out.  half-way up, he recollected bondell’s gripsack.  it had
fallen into the hole with him; the pack-strap had evidently broken, and
he had forgotten it.  back he went into the pestilential charnel-pit,
where he crawled around on hands and knees and groped for half an hour.
altogether he encountered and counted seventeen dead horses (and one
horse still alive that he shot with his revolver) before he found
bondell’s grip.  looking back upon a life that had not been without
valour and achievement, he unhesitatingly declared to himself that this
return after the grip was the most heroic act he had ever performed.  so
heroic was it that he was twice on the verge of fainting before he
crawled out of the hole.

by the time he had descended to the scales, the steep pitch of chilcoot
was past, and the way became easier.  not that it was an easy way,
however, in the best of places; but it became a really possible trail,
along which he could have made good time if he had not been worn out, if
he had had light with which to pick his steps, and if it had not been for
bondell’s gripsack.  to him, in his exhausted condition, it was the last
straw.  having barely strength to carry himself along, the additional
weight of the grip was sufficient to throw him nearly every time he
tripped or stumbled.  and when he escaped tripping, branches reached out
in the darkness, hooked the grip between his shoulders, and held him
back.

his mind was made up that if he missed the _athenian_ it would be the
fault of the gripsack.  in fact, only two things remained in his
consciousness—bondell’s grip and the steamer.  he knew only those two
things, and they became identified, in a way, with some stern mission
upon which he had journeyed and toiled for centuries.  he walked and
struggled on as in a dream.  as part of the dream was his arrival at
sheep camp.  he stumbled into a saloon, slid his shoulders out of the
straps, and started to deposit the grip at his feet.  but it slipped from
his fingers and struck the floor with a heavy thud that was not unnoticed
by two men who were just leaving.  churchill drank a glass of whisky,
told the barkeeper to call him in ten minutes, and sat down, his feet on
the grip, his head on his knees.

so badly did his misused body stiffen, that when he was called it
required another ten minutes and a second glass of whisky to unbend his
joints and limber up the muscles.

“hey not that way!” the barkeeper shouted, and then went after him and
started him through the darkness toward canyon city.  some little husk of
inner consciousness told churchill that the direction was right, and,
still as in a dream, he took the cañon trail.  he did not know what
warned him, but after what seemed several centuries of travelling, he
sensed danger and drew his revolver.  still in the dream, he saw two men
step out and heard them halt him.  his revolver went off four times, and
he saw the flashes and heard the explosions of their revolvers.  also, he
was aware that he had been hit in the thigh.  he saw one man go down,
and, as the other came for him, he smashed him a straight blow with the
heavy revolver full in the face.  then he turned and ran.  he came from
the dream shortly afterward, to find himself plunging down the trail at a
limping lope.  his first thought was for the gripsack.  it was still on
his back.  he was convinced that what had happened was a dream till he
felt for his revolver and found it gone.  next he became aware of a sharp
stinging of his thigh, and after investigating, he found his hand warm
with blood.  it was a superficial wound, but it was incontestable.  he
became wider awake, and kept up the lumbering run to canyon city.

he found a man, with a team of horses and a wagon, who got out of bed and
harnessed up for twenty dollars.  churchill crawled in on the wagon-bed
and slept, the gripsack still on his back.  it was a rough ride, over
water-washed boulders down the dyea valley; but he roused only when the
wagon hit the highest places.  any altitude of his body above the
wagon-bed of less than a foot did not faze him.  the last mile was smooth
going, and he slept soundly.

he came to in the grey dawn, the driver shaking him savagely and howling
into his ear that the _athenian_ was gone.  churchill looked blankly at
the deserted harbour.

“there’s a smoke over at skaguay,” the man said.

churchill’s eyes were too swollen to see that far, but he said: “it’s
she.  get me a boat.”

the driver was obliging and found a skiff, and a man to row it for ten
dollars, payment in advance.  churchill paid, and was helped into the
skiff.  it was beyond him to get in by himself.  it was six miles to
skaguay, and he had a blissful thought of sleeping those six miles.  but
the man did not know how to row, and churchill took the oars and toiled
for a few more centuries.  he never knew six longer and more excruciating
miles.  a snappy little breeze blew up the inlet and held him back.  he
had a gone feeling at the pit of the stomach, and suffered from faintness
and numbness.  at his command, the man took the baler and threw salt
water into his face.

the _athenian’s_ anchor was up-and-down when they came alongside, and
churchill was at the end of his last remnant of strength.

“stop her!  stop her!” he shouted hoarsely.

“important message!  stop her!”

then he dropped his chin on his chest and slept.  when half a dozen men
started to carry him up the gang-plank, he awoke, reached for the grip,
and clung to it like a drowning man.

on deck he became a centre of horror and curiosity.  the clothing in
which he had left white horse was represented by a few rags, and he was
as frayed as his clothing.  he had travelled for fifty-five hours at the
top notch of endurance.  he had slept six hours in that time, and he was
twenty pounds lighter than when he started.  face and hands and body were
scratched and bruised, and he could scarcely see.  he tried to stand up,
but failed, sprawling out on the deck, hanging on to the gripsack, and
delivering his message.

“now, put me to bed,” he finished; “i’ll eat when i wake up.”

they did him honour, carrying him down in his rags and dirt and
depositing him and bondell’s grip in the bridal chamber, which was the
biggest and most luxurious state-room in the ship.  twice he slept the
clock around, and he had bathed and shaved and eaten and was leaning over
the rail smoking a cigar when the two hundred pilgrims from white horse
came alongside.

by the time the _athenian_ arrived in seattle, churchill had fully
recuperated, and he went ashore with bondell’s grip in his hand.  he felt
proud of that grip.  to him it stood for achievement and integrity and
trust.  “i’ve delivered the goods,” was the way he expressed these
various high terms to himself.  it was early in the evening, and he went
straight to bondell’s home.  louis bondell was glad to see him, shaking
hands with both hands at the same time and dragging him into the house.

“oh, thanks, old man; it was good of you to bring it out,” bondell said
when he received the gripsack.

he tossed it carelessly upon a couch, and churchill noted with an
appreciative eye the rebound of its weight from the springs.  bondell was
volleying him with questions.

“how did you make out?  how’re the boys?  what became of bill smithers?
is del bishop still with pierce?  did he sell my dogs?  how did sulphur
bottom show up?  you’re looking fine.  what steamer did you come out on?”

to all of which churchill gave answer, till half an hour had gone by and
the first lull in the conversation had arrived.

“hadn’t you better take a look at it?” he suggested, nodding his head at
the gripsack.

“oh, it’s all right,” bondell answered.  “did mitchell’s dump turn out as
much as he expected?”

“i think you’d better look at it,” churchill insisted.  “when i deliver a
thing, i want to be satisfied that it’s all right.  there’s always the
chance that somebody might have got into it when i was asleep, or
something.”

“it’s nothing important, old man,” bondell answered, with a laugh.

“nothing important,” churchill echoed in a faint, small voice.  then he
spoke with decision: “louis, what’s in that bag?  i want to know.”

louis looked at him curiously, then left the room and returned with a
bunch of keys.  he inserted his hand and drew out a heavy colt’s
revolver.  next came out a few boxes of ammunition for the revolver and
several boxes of winchester cartridges.

churchill took the gripsack and looked into it.  then he turned it upside
down and shook it gently.

“the gun’s all rusted,” bondell said.  “must have been out in the rain.”

“yes,” churchill answered.  “too bad it got wet.  i guess i was a bit
careless.”

he got up and went outside.  ten minutes later louis bondell went out and
found him on the steps, sitting down, elbows on knees and chin on hands,
gazing steadfastly out into the darkness.




to build a fire


day had broken cold and grey, exceedingly cold and grey, when the man
turned aside from the main yukon trail and climbed the high earth-bank,
where a dim and little-travelled trail led eastward through the fat
spruce timberland.  it was a steep bank, and he paused for breath at the
top, excusing the act to himself by looking at his watch.  it was nine
o’clock.  there was no sun nor hint of sun, though there was not a cloud
in the sky.  it was a clear day, and yet there seemed an intangible pall
over the face of things, a subtle gloom that made the day dark, and that
was due to the absence of sun.  this fact did not worry the man.  he was
used to the lack of sun.  it had been days since he had seen the sun, and
he knew that a few more days must pass before that cheerful orb, due
south, would just peep above the sky-line and dip immediately from view.

the man flung a look back along the way he had come.  the yukon lay a
mile wide and hidden under three feet of ice.  on top of this ice were as
many feet of snow.  it was all pure white, rolling in gentle undulations
where the ice-jams of the freeze-up had formed.  north and south, as far
as his eye could see, it was unbroken white, save for a dark hair-line
that curved and twisted from around the spruce-covered island to the
south, and that curved and twisted away into the north, where it
disappeared behind another spruce-covered island.  this dark hair-line
was the trail—the main trail—that led south five hundred miles to the
chilcoot pass, dyea, and salt water; and that led north seventy miles to
dawson, and still on to the north a thousand miles to nulato, and finally
to st. michael on bering sea, a thousand miles and half a thousand more.

but all this—the mysterious, far-reaching hairline trail, the absence of
sun from the sky, the tremendous cold, and the strangeness and weirdness
of it all—made no impression on the man.  it was not because he was long
used to it.  he was a new-comer in the land, a _chechaquo_, and this was
his first winter.  the trouble with him was that he was without
imagination.  he was quick and alert in the things of life, but only in
the things, and not in the significances.  fifty degrees below zero meant
eighty odd degrees of frost.  such fact impressed him as being cold and
uncomfortable, and that was all.  it did not lead him to meditate upon
his frailty as a creature of temperature, and upon man’s frailty in
general, able only to live within certain narrow limits of heat and cold;
and from there on it did not lead him to the conjectural field of
immortality and man’s place in the universe.  fifty degrees below zero
stood for a bite of frost that hurt and that must be guarded against by
the use of mittens, ear-flaps, warm moccasins, and thick socks.  fifty
degrees below zero was to him just precisely fifty degrees below zero.
that there should be anything more to it than that was a thought that
never entered his head.

as he turned to go on, he spat speculatively.  there was a sharp,
explosive crackle that startled him.  he spat again.  and again, in the
air, before it could fall to the snow, the spittle crackled.  he knew
that at fifty below spittle crackled on the snow, but this spittle had
crackled in the air.  undoubtedly it was colder than fifty below—how much
colder he did not know.  but the temperature did not matter.  he was
bound for the old claim on the left fork of henderson creek, where the
boys were already.  they had come over across the divide from the indian
creek country, while he had come the roundabout way to take a look at the
possibilities of getting out logs in the spring from the islands in the
yukon.  he would be in to camp by six o’clock; a bit after dark, it was
true, but the boys would be there, a fire would be going, and a hot
supper would be ready.  as for lunch, he pressed his hand against the
protruding bundle under his jacket.  it was also under his shirt, wrapped
up in a handkerchief and lying against the naked skin.  it was the only
way to keep the biscuits from freezing.  he smiled agreeably to himself
as he thought of those biscuits, each cut open and sopped in bacon
grease, and each enclosing a generous slice of fried bacon.

he plunged in among the big spruce trees.  the trail was faint.  a foot
of snow had fallen since the last sled had passed over, and he was glad
he was without a sled, travelling light.  in fact, he carried nothing but
the lunch wrapped in the handkerchief.  he was surprised, however, at the
cold.  it certainly was cold, he concluded, as he rubbed his numbed nose
and cheek-bones with his mittened hand.  he was a warm-whiskered man, but
the hair on his face did not protect the high cheek-bones and the eager
nose that thrust itself aggressively into the frosty air.

at the man’s heels trotted a dog, a big native husky, the proper
wolf-dog, grey-coated and without any visible or temperamental difference
from its brother, the wild wolf.  the animal was depressed by the
tremendous cold.  it knew that it was no time for travelling.  its
instinct told it a truer tale than was told to the man by the man’s
judgment.  in reality, it was not merely colder than fifty below zero; it
was colder than sixty below, than seventy below.  it was seventy-five
below zero.  since the freezing-point is thirty-two above zero, it meant
that one hundred and seven degrees of frost obtained.  the dog did not
know anything about thermometers.  possibly in its brain there was no
sharp consciousness of a condition of very cold such as was in the man’s
brain.  but the brute had its instinct.  it experienced a vague but
menacing apprehension that subdued it and made it slink along at the
man’s heels, and that made it question eagerly every unwonted movement of
the man as if expecting him to go into camp or to seek shelter somewhere
and build a fire.  the dog had learned fire, and it wanted fire, or else
to burrow under the snow and cuddle its warmth away from the air.

the frozen moisture of its breathing had settled on its fur in a fine
powder of frost, and especially were its jowls, muzzle, and eyelashes
whitened by its crystalled breath.  the man’s red beard and moustache
were likewise frosted, but more solidly, the deposit taking the form of
ice and increasing with every warm, moist breath he exhaled.  also, the
man was chewing tobacco, and the muzzle of ice held his lips so rigidly
that he was unable to clear his chin when he expelled the juice.  the
result was that a crystal beard of the colour and solidity of amber was
increasing its length on his chin.  if he fell down it would shatter
itself, like glass, into brittle fragments.  but he did not mind the
appendage.  it was the penalty all tobacco-chewers paid in that country,
and he had been out before in two cold snaps.  they had not been so cold
as this, he knew, but by the spirit thermometer at sixty mile he knew
they had been registered at fifty below and at fifty-five.

he held on through the level stretch of woods for several miles, crossed
a wide flat of nigger-heads, and dropped down a bank to the frozen bed of
a small stream.  this was henderson creek, and he knew he was ten miles
from the forks.  he looked at his watch.  it was ten o’clock.  he was
making four miles an hour, and he calculated that he would arrive at the
forks at half-past twelve.  he decided to celebrate that event by eating
his lunch there.

the dog dropped in again at his heels, with a tail drooping
discouragement, as the man swung along the creek-bed.  the furrow of the
old sled-trail was plainly visible, but a dozen inches of snow covered
the marks of the last runners.  in a month no man had come up or down
that silent creek.  the man held steadily on.  he was not much given to
thinking, and just then particularly he had nothing to think about save
that he would eat lunch at the forks and that at six o’clock he would be
in camp with the boys.  there was nobody to talk to and, had there been,
speech would have been impossible because of the ice-muzzle on his mouth.
so he continued monotonously to chew tobacco and to increase the length
of his amber beard.

once in a while the thought reiterated itself that it was very cold and
that he had never experienced such cold.  as he walked along he rubbed
his cheek-bones and nose with the back of his mittened hand.  he did this
automatically, now and again changing hands.  but rub as he would, the
instant he stopped his cheek-bones went numb, and the following instant
the end of his nose went numb.  he was sure to frost his cheeks; he knew
that, and experienced a pang of regret that he had not devised a
nose-strap of the sort bud wore in cold snaps.  such a strap passed
across the cheeks, as well, and saved them.  but it didn’t matter much,
after all.  what were frosted cheeks?  a bit painful, that was all; they
were never serious.

empty as the man’s mind was of thoughts, he was keenly observant, and he
noticed the changes in the creek, the curves and bends and timber-jams,
and always he sharply noted where he placed his feet.  once, coming
around a bend, he shied abruptly, like a startled horse, curved away from
the place where he had been walking, and retreated several paces back
along the trail.  the creek he knew was frozen clear to the bottom—no
creek could contain water in that arctic winter—but he knew also that
there were springs that bubbled out from the hillsides and ran along
under the snow and on top the ice of the creek.  he knew that the coldest
snaps never froze these springs, and he knew likewise their danger.  they
were traps.  they hid pools of water under the snow that might be three
inches deep, or three feet.  sometimes a skin of ice half an inch thick
covered them, and in turn was covered by the snow.  sometimes there were
alternate layers of water and ice-skin, so that when one broke through he
kept on breaking through for a while, sometimes wetting himself to the
waist.

that was why he had shied in such panic.  he had felt the give under his
feet and heard the crackle of a snow-hidden ice-skin.  and to get his
feet wet in such a temperature meant trouble and danger.  at the very
least it meant delay, for he would be forced to stop and build a fire,
and under its protection to bare his feet while he dried his socks and
moccasins.  he stood and studied the creek-bed and its banks, and decided
that the flow of water came from the right.  he reflected awhile, rubbing
his nose and cheeks, then skirted to the left, stepping gingerly and
testing the footing for each step.  once clear of the danger, he took a
fresh chew of tobacco and swung along at his four-mile gait.

in the course of the next two hours he came upon several similar traps.
usually the snow above the hidden pools had a sunken, candied appearance
that advertised the danger.  once again, however, he had a close call;
and once, suspecting danger, he compelled the dog to go on in front.  the
dog did not want to go.  it hung back until the man shoved it forward,
and then it went quickly across the white, unbroken surface.  suddenly it
broke through, floundered to one side, and got away to firmer footing.
it had wet its forefeet and legs, and almost immediately the water that
clung to it turned to ice.  it made quick efforts to lick the ice off its
legs, then dropped down in the snow and began to bite out the ice that
had formed between the toes.  this was a matter of instinct.  to permit
the ice to remain would mean sore feet.  it did not know this.  it merely
obeyed the mysterious prompting that arose from the deep crypts of its
being.  but the man knew, having achieved a judgment on the subject, and
he removed the mitten from his right hand and helped tear out the
ice-particles.  he did not expose his fingers more than a minute, and was
astonished at the swift numbness that smote them.  it certainly was cold.
he pulled on the mitten hastily, and beat the hand savagely across his
chest.

at twelve o’clock the day was at its brightest.  yet the sun was too far
south on its winter journey to clear the horizon.  the bulge of the earth
intervened between it and henderson creek, where the man walked under a
clear sky at noon and cast no shadow.  at half-past twelve, to the
minute, he arrived at the forks of the creek.  he was pleased at the
speed he had made.  if he kept it up, he would certainly be with the boys
by six.  he unbuttoned his jacket and shirt and drew forth his lunch.
the action consumed no more than a quarter of a minute, yet in that brief
moment the numbness laid hold of the exposed fingers.  he did not put the
mitten on, but, instead, struck the fingers a dozen sharp smashes against
his leg.  then he sat down on a snow-covered log to eat.  the sting that
followed upon the striking of his fingers against his leg ceased so
quickly that he was startled, he had had no chance to take a bite of
biscuit.  he struck the fingers repeatedly and returned them to the
mitten, baring the other hand for the purpose of eating.  he tried to
take a mouthful, but the ice-muzzle prevented.  he had forgotten to build
a fire and thaw out.  he chuckled at his foolishness, and as he chuckled
he noted the numbness creeping into the exposed fingers.  also, he noted
that the stinging which had first come to his toes when he sat down was
already passing away.  he wondered whether the toes were warm or numbed.
he moved them inside the moccasins and decided that they were numbed.

he pulled the mitten on hurriedly and stood up.  he was a bit frightened.
he stamped up and down until the stinging returned into the feet.  it
certainly was cold, was his thought.  that man from sulphur creek had
spoken the truth when telling how cold it sometimes got in the country.
and he had laughed at him at the time!  that showed one must not be too
sure of things.  there was no mistake about it, it was cold.  he strode
up and down, stamping his feet and threshing his arms, until reassured by
the returning warmth.  then he got out matches and proceeded to make a
fire.  from the undergrowth, where high water of the previous spring had
lodged a supply of seasoned twigs, he got his firewood.  working
carefully from a small beginning, he soon had a roaring fire, over which
he thawed the ice from his face and in the protection of which he ate his
biscuits.  for the moment the cold of space was outwitted.  the dog took
satisfaction in the fire, stretching out close enough for warmth and far
enough away to escape being singed.

when the man had finished, he filled his pipe and took his comfortable
time over a smoke.  then he pulled on his mittens, settled the ear-flaps
of his cap firmly about his ears, and took the creek trail up the left
fork.  the dog was disappointed and yearned back toward the fire.  this
man did not know cold.  possibly all the generations of his ancestry had
been ignorant of cold, of real cold, of cold one hundred and seven
degrees below freezing-point.  but the dog knew; all its ancestry knew,
and it had inherited the knowledge.  and it knew that it was not good to
walk abroad in such fearful cold.  it was the time to lie snug in a hole
in the snow and wait for a curtain of cloud to be drawn across the face
of outer space whence this cold came.  on the other hand, there was keen
intimacy between the dog and the man.  the one was the toil-slave of the
other, and the only caresses it had ever received were the caresses of
the whip-lash and of harsh and menacing throat-sounds that threatened the
whip-lash.  so the dog made no effort to communicate its apprehension to
the man.  it was not concerned in the welfare of the man; it was for its
own sake that it yearned back toward the fire.  but the man whistled, and
spoke to it with the sound of whip-lashes, and the dog swung in at the
man’s heels and followed after.

the man took a chew of tobacco and proceeded to start a new amber beard.
also, his moist breath quickly powdered with white his moustache,
eyebrows, and lashes.  there did not seem to be so many springs on the
left fork of the henderson, and for half an hour the man saw no signs of
any.  and then it happened.  at a place where there were no signs, where
the soft, unbroken snow seemed to advertise solidity beneath, the man
broke through.  it was not deep.  he wetted himself half-way to the knees
before he floundered out to the firm crust.

he was angry, and cursed his luck aloud.  he had hoped to get into camp
with the boys at six o’clock, and this would delay him an hour, for he
would have to build a fire and dry out his foot-gear.  this was
imperative at that low temperature—he knew that much; and he turned aside
to the bank, which he climbed.  on top, tangled in the underbrush about
the trunks of several small spruce trees, was a high-water deposit of dry
firewood—sticks and twigs principally, but also larger portions of
seasoned branches and fine, dry, last-year’s grasses.  he threw down
several large pieces on top of the snow.  this served for a foundation
and prevented the young flame from drowning itself in the snow it
otherwise would melt.  the flame he got by touching a match to a small
shred of birch-bark that he took from his pocket.  this burned even more
readily than paper.  placing it on the foundation, he fed the young flame
with wisps of dry grass and with the tiniest dry twigs.

he worked slowly and carefully, keenly aware of his danger.  gradually,
as the flame grew stronger, he increased the size of the twigs with which
he fed it.  he squatted in the snow, pulling the twigs out from their
entanglement in the brush and feeding directly to the flame.  he knew
there must be no failure.  when it is seventy-five below zero, a man must
not fail in his first attempt to build a fire—that is, if his feet are
wet.  if his feet are dry, and he fails, he can run along the trail for
half a mile and restore his circulation.  but the circulation of wet and
freezing feet cannot be restored by running when it is seventy-five
below.  no matter how fast he runs, the wet feet will freeze the harder.

all this the man knew.  the old-timer on sulphur creek had told him about
it the previous fall, and now he was appreciating the advice.  already
all sensation had gone out of his feet.  to build the fire he had been
forced to remove his mittens, and the fingers had quickly gone numb.  his
pace of four miles an hour had kept his heart pumping blood to the
surface of his body and to all the extremities.  but the instant he
stopped, the action of the pump eased down.  the cold of space smote the
unprotected tip of the planet, and he, being on that unprotected tip,
received the full force of the blow.  the blood of his body recoiled
before it.  the blood was alive, like the dog, and like the dog it wanted
to hide away and cover itself up from the fearful cold.  so long as he
walked four miles an hour, he pumped that blood, willy-nilly, to the
surface; but now it ebbed away and sank down into the recesses of his
body.  the extremities were the first to feel its absence.  his wet feet
froze the faster, and his exposed fingers numbed the faster, though they
had not yet begun to freeze.  nose and cheeks were already freezing,
while the skin of all his body chilled as it lost its blood.

but he was safe.  toes and nose and cheeks would be only touched by the
frost, for the fire was beginning to burn with strength.  he was feeding
it with twigs the size of his finger.  in another minute he would be able
to feed it with branches the size of his wrist, and then he could remove
his wet foot-gear, and, while it dried, he could keep his naked feet warm
by the fire, rubbing them at first, of course, with snow.  the fire was a
success.  he was safe.  he remembered the advice of the old-timer on
sulphur creek, and smiled.  the old-timer had been very serious in laying
down the law that no man must travel alone in the klondike after fifty
below.  well, here he was; he had had the accident; he was alone; and he
had saved himself.  those old-timers were rather womanish, some of them,
he thought.  all a man had to do was to keep his head, and he was all
right.  any man who was a man could travel alone.  but it was surprising,
the rapidity with which his cheeks and nose were freezing.  and he had
not thought his fingers could go lifeless in so short a time.  lifeless
they were, for he could scarcely make them move together to grip a twig,
and they seemed remote from his body and from him.  when he touched a
twig, he had to look and see whether or not he had hold of it.  the wires
were pretty well down between him and his finger-ends.

all of which counted for little.  there was the fire, snapping and
crackling and promising life with every dancing flame.  he started to
untie his moccasins.  they were coated with ice; the thick german socks
were like sheaths of iron half-way to the knees; and the mocassin strings
were like rods of steel all twisted and knotted as by some conflagration.
for a moment he tugged with his numbed fingers, then, realizing the folly
of it, he drew his sheath-knife.

but before he could cut the strings, it happened.  it was his own fault
or, rather, his mistake.  he should not have built the fire under the
spruce tree.  he should have built it in the open.  but it had been
easier to pull the twigs from the brush and drop them directly on the
fire.  now the tree under which he had done this carried a weight of snow
on its boughs.  no wind had blown for weeks, and each bough was fully
freighted.  each time he had pulled a twig he had communicated a slight
agitation to the tree—an imperceptible agitation, so far as he was
concerned, but an agitation sufficient to bring about the disaster.  high
up in the tree one bough capsized its load of snow.  this fell on the
boughs beneath, capsizing them.  this process continued, spreading out
and involving the whole tree.  it grew like an avalanche, and it
descended without warning upon the man and the fire, and the fire was
blotted out!  where it had burned was a mantle of fresh and disordered
snow.

the man was shocked.  it was as though he had just heard his own sentence
of death.  for a moment he sat and stared at the spot where the fire had
been.  then he grew very calm.  perhaps the old-timer on sulphur creek
was right.  if he had only had a trail-mate he would have been in no
danger now.  the trail-mate could have built the fire.  well, it was up
to him to build the fire over again, and this second time there must be
no failure.  even if he succeeded, he would most likely lose some toes.
his feet must be badly frozen by now, and there would be some time before
the second fire was ready.

such were his thoughts, but he did not sit and think them.  he was busy
all the time they were passing through his mind, he made a new foundation
for a fire, this time in the open; where no treacherous tree could blot
it out.  next, he gathered dry grasses and tiny twigs from the high-water
flotsam.  he could not bring his fingers together to pull them out, but
he was able to gather them by the handful.  in this way he got many
rotten twigs and bits of green moss that were undesirable, but it was the
best he could do.  he worked methodically, even collecting an armful of
the larger branches to be used later when the fire gathered strength.
and all the while the dog sat and watched him, a certain yearning
wistfulness in its eyes, for it looked upon him as the fire-provider, and
the fire was slow in coming.

when all was ready, the man reached in his pocket for a second piece of
birch-bark.  he knew the bark was there, and, though he could not feel it
with his fingers, he could hear its crisp rustling as he fumbled for it.
try as he would, he could not clutch hold of it.  and all the time, in
his consciousness, was the knowledge that each instant his feet were
freezing.  this thought tended to put him in a panic, but he fought
against it and kept calm.  he pulled on his mittens with his teeth, and
threshed his arms back and forth, beating his hands with all his might
against his sides.  he did this sitting down, and he stood up to do it;
and all the while the dog sat in the snow, its wolf-brush of a tail
curled around warmly over its forefeet, its sharp wolf-ears pricked
forward intently as it watched the man.  and the man as he beat and
threshed with his arms and hands, felt a great surge of envy as he
regarded the creature that was warm and secure in its natural covering.

after a time he was aware of the first far-away signals of sensation in
his beaten fingers.  the faint tingling grew stronger till it evolved
into a stinging ache that was excruciating, but which the man hailed with
satisfaction.  he stripped the mitten from his right hand and fetched
forth the birch-bark.  the exposed fingers were quickly going numb again.
next he brought out his bunch of sulphur matches.  but the tremendous
cold had already driven the life out of his fingers.  in his effort to
separate one match from the others, the whole bunch fell in the snow.  he
tried to pick it out of the snow, but failed.  the dead fingers could
neither touch nor clutch.  he was very careful.  he drove the thought of
his freezing feet; and nose, and cheeks, out of his mind, devoting his
whole soul to the matches.  he watched, using the sense of vision in
place of that of touch, and when he saw his fingers on each side the
bunch, he closed them—that is, he willed to close them, for the wires
were drawn, and the fingers did not obey.  he pulled the mitten on the
right hand, and beat it fiercely against his knee.  then, with both
mittened hands, he scooped the bunch of matches, along with much snow,
into his lap.  yet he was no better off.

after some manipulation he managed to get the bunch between the heels of
his mittened hands.  in this fashion he carried it to his mouth.  the ice
crackled and snapped when by a violent effort he opened his mouth.  he
drew the lower jaw in, curled the upper lip out of the way, and scraped
the bunch with his upper teeth in order to separate a match.  he
succeeded in getting one, which he dropped on his lap.  he was no better
off.  he could not pick it up.  then he devised a way.  he picked it up
in his teeth and scratched it on his leg.  twenty times he scratched
before he succeeded in lighting it.  as it flamed he held it with his
teeth to the birch-bark.  but the burning brimstone went up his nostrils
and into his lungs, causing him to cough spasmodically.  the match fell
into the snow and went out.

the old-timer on sulphur creek was right, he thought in the moment of
controlled despair that ensued: after fifty below, a man should travel
with a partner.  he beat his hands, but failed in exciting any sensation.
suddenly he bared both hands, removing the mittens with his teeth.  he
caught the whole bunch between the heels of his hands.  his arm-muscles
not being frozen enabled him to press the hand-heels tightly against the
matches.  then he scratched the bunch along his leg.  it flared into
flame, seventy sulphur matches at once!  there was no wind to blow them
out.  he kept his head to one side to escape the strangling fumes, and
held the blazing bunch to the birch-bark.  as he so held it, he became
aware of sensation in his hand.  his flesh was burning.  he could smell
it.  deep down below the surface he could feel it.  the sensation
developed into pain that grew acute.  and still he endured it, holding
the flame of the matches clumsily to the bark that would not light
readily because his own burning hands were in the way, absorbing most of
the flame.

at last, when he could endure no more, he jerked his hands apart.  the
blazing matches fell sizzling into the snow, but the birch-bark was
alight.  he began laying dry grasses and the tiniest twigs on the flame.
he could not pick and choose, for he had to lift the fuel between the
heels of his hands.  small pieces of rotten wood and green moss clung to
the twigs, and he bit them off as well as he could with his teeth.  he
cherished the flame carefully and awkwardly.  it meant life, and it must
not perish.  the withdrawal of blood from the surface of his body now
made him begin to shiver, and he grew more awkward.  a large piece of
green moss fell squarely on the little fire.  he tried to poke it out
with his fingers, but his shivering frame made him poke too far, and he
disrupted the nucleus of the little fire, the burning grasses and tiny
twigs separating and scattering.  he tried to poke them together again,
but in spite of the tenseness of the effort, his shivering got away with
him, and the twigs were hopelessly scattered.  each twig gushed a puff of
smoke and went out.  the fire-provider had failed.  as he looked
apathetically about him, his eyes chanced on the dog, sitting across the
ruins of the fire from him, in the snow, making restless, hunching
movements, slightly lifting one forefoot and then the other, shifting its
weight back and forth on them with wistful eagerness.

the sight of the dog put a wild idea into his head.  he remembered the
tale of the man, caught in a blizzard, who killed a steer and crawled
inside the carcass, and so was saved.  he would kill the dog and bury his
hands in the warm body until the numbness went out of them.  then he
could build another fire.  he spoke to the dog, calling it to him; but in
his voice was a strange note of fear that frightened the animal, who had
never known the man to speak in such way before.  something was the
matter, and its suspicious nature sensed danger,—it knew not what danger
but somewhere, somehow, in its brain arose an apprehension of the man.
it flattened its ears down at the sound of the man’s voice, and its
restless, hunching movements and the liftings and shiftings of its
forefeet became more pronounced but it would not come to the man.  he got
on his hands and knees and crawled toward the dog.  this unusual posture
again excited suspicion, and the animal sidled mincingly away.

the man sat up in the snow for a moment and struggled for calmness.  then
he pulled on his mittens, by means of his teeth, and got upon his feet.
he glanced down at first in order to assure himself that he was really
standing up, for the absence of sensation in his feet left him unrelated
to the earth.  his erect position in itself started to drive the webs of
suspicion from the dog’s mind; and when he spoke peremptorily, with the
sound of whip-lashes in his voice, the dog rendered its customary
allegiance and came to him.  as it came within reaching distance, the man
lost his control.  his arms flashed out to the dog, and he experienced
genuine surprise when he discovered that his hands could not clutch, that
there was neither bend nor feeling in the lingers.  he had forgotten for
the moment that they were frozen and that they were freezing more and
more.  all this happened quickly, and before the animal could get away,
he encircled its body with his arms.  he sat down in the snow, and in
this fashion held the dog, while it snarled and whined and struggled.

but it was all he could do, hold its body encircled in his arms and sit
there.  he realized that he could not kill the dog.  there was no way to
do it.  with his helpless hands he could neither draw nor hold his
sheath-knife nor throttle the animal.  he released it, and it plunged
wildly away, with tail between its legs, and still snarling.  it halted
forty feet away and surveyed him curiously, with ears sharply pricked
forward.  the man looked down at his hands in order to locate them, and
found them hanging on the ends of his arms.  it struck him as curious
that one should have to use his eyes in order to find out where his hands
were.  he began threshing his arms back and forth, beating the mittened
hands against his sides.  he did this for five minutes, violently, and
his heart pumped enough blood up to the surface to put a stop to his
shivering.  but no sensation was aroused in the hands.  he had an
impression that they hung like weights on the ends of his arms, but when
he tried to run the impression down, he could not find it.

a certain fear of death, dull and oppressive, came to him.  this fear
quickly became poignant as he realized that it was no longer a mere
matter of freezing his fingers and toes, or of losing his hands and feet,
but that it was a matter of life and death with the chances against him.
this threw him into a panic, and he turned and ran up the creek-bed along
the old, dim trail.  the dog joined in behind and kept up with him.  he
ran blindly, without intention, in fear such as he had never known in his
life.  slowly, as he ploughed and floundered through the snow, he began
to see things again—the banks of the creek, the old timber-jams, the
leafless aspens, and the sky.  the running made him feel better.  he did
not shiver.  maybe, if he ran on, his feet would thaw out; and, anyway,
if he ran far enough, he would reach camp and the boys.  without doubt he
would lose some fingers and toes and some of his face; but the boys would
take care of him, and save the rest of him when he got there.  and at the
same time there was another thought in his mind that said he would never
get to the camp and the boys; that it was too many miles away, that the
freezing had too great a start on him, and that he would soon be stiff
and dead.  this thought he kept in the background and refused to
consider.  sometimes it pushed itself forward and demanded to be heard,
but he thrust it back and strove to think of other things.

it struck him as curious that he could run at all on feet so frozen that
he could not feel them when they struck the earth and took the weight of
his body.  he seemed to himself to skim along above the surface and to
have no connection with the earth.  somewhere he had once seen a winged
mercury, and he wondered if mercury felt as he felt when skimming over
the earth.

his theory of running until he reached camp and the boys had one flaw in
it: he lacked the endurance.  several times he stumbled, and finally he
tottered, crumpled up, and fell.  when he tried to rise, he failed.  he
must sit and rest, he decided, and next time he would merely walk and
keep on going.  as he sat and regained his breath, he noted that he was
feeling quite warm and comfortable.  he was not shivering, and it even
seemed that a warm glow had come to his chest and trunk.  and yet, when
he touched his nose or cheeks, there was no sensation.  running would not
thaw them out.  nor would it thaw out his hands and feet.  then the
thought came to him that the frozen portions of his body must be
extending.  he tried to keep this thought down, to forget it, to think of
something else; he was aware of the panicky feeling that it caused, and
he was afraid of the panic.  but the thought asserted itself, and
persisted, until it produced a vision of his body totally frozen.  this
was too much, and he made another wild run along the trail.  once he
slowed down to a walk, but the thought of the freezing extending itself
made him run again.

and all the time the dog ran with him, at his heels.  when he fell down a
second time, it curled its tail over its forefeet and sat in front of him
facing him curiously eager and intent.  the warmth and security of the
animal angered him, and he cursed it till it flattened down its ears
appeasingly.  this time the shivering came more quickly upon the man.  he
was losing in his battle with the frost.  it was creeping into his body
from all sides.  the thought of it drove him on, but he ran no more than
a hundred feet, when he staggered and pitched headlong.  it was his last
panic.  when he had recovered his breath and control, he sat up and
entertained in his mind the conception of meeting death with dignity.
however, the conception did not come to him in such terms.  his idea of
it was that he had been making a fool of himself, running around like a
chicken with its head cut off—such was the simile that occurred to him.
well, he was bound to freeze anyway, and he might as well take it
decently.  with this new-found peace of mind came the first glimmerings
of drowsiness.  a good idea, he thought, to sleep off to death.  it was
like taking an anæsthetic.  freezing was not so bad as people thought.
there were lots worse ways to die.

he pictured the boys finding his body next day.  suddenly he found
himself with them, coming along the trail and looking for himself.  and,
still with them, he came around a turn in the trail and found himself
lying in the snow.  he did not belong with himself any more, for even
then he was out of himself, standing with the boys and looking at himself
in the snow.  it certainly was cold, was his thought.  when he got back
to the states he could tell the folks what real cold was.  he drifted on
from this to a vision of the old-timer on sulphur creek.  he could see
him quite clearly, warm and comfortable, and smoking a pipe.

“you were right, old hoss; you were right,” the man mumbled to the
old-timer of sulphur creek.

then the man drowsed off into what seemed to him the most comfortable and
satisfying sleep he had ever known.  the dog sat facing him and waiting.
the brief day drew to a close in a long, slow twilight.  there were no
signs of a fire to be made, and, besides, never in the dog’s experience
had it known a man to sit like that in the snow and make no fire.  as the
twilight drew on, its eager yearning for the fire mastered it, and with a
great lifting and shifting of forefeet, it whined softly, then flattened
its ears down in anticipation of being chidden by the man.  but the man
remained silent.  later, the dog whined loudly.  and still later it crept
close to the man and caught the scent of death.  this made the animal
bristle and back away.  a little longer it delayed, howling under the
stars that leaped and danced and shone brightly in the cold sky.  then it
turned and trotted up the trail in the direction of the camp it knew,
where were the other food-providers and fire-providers.




that spot


i don’t think much of stephen mackaye any more, though i used to swear by
him.  i know that in those days i loved him more than my own brother.  if
ever i meet stephen mackaye again, i shall not be responsible for my
actions.  it passes beyond me that a man with whom i shared food and
blanket, and with whom i mushed over the chilcoot trail, should turn out
the way he did.  i always sized steve up as a square man, a kindly
comrade, without an iota of anything vindictive or malicious in his
nature.  i shall never trust my judgment in men again.  why, i nursed
that man through typhoid fever; we starved together on the headwaters of
the stewart; and he saved my life on the little salmon.  and now, after
the years we were together, all i can say of stephen mackaye is that he
is the meanest man i ever knew.

we started for the klondike in the fall rush of 1897, and we started too
late to get over chilcoot pass before the freeze-up.  we packed our
outfit on our backs part way over, when the snow began to fly, and then
we had to buy dogs in order to sled it the rest of the way.  that was how
we came to get that spot.  dogs were high, and we paid one hundred and
ten dollars for him.  he looked worth it.  i say _looked_, because he was
one of the finest-appearing dogs i ever saw.  he weighed sixty pounds,
and he had all the lines of a good sled animal.  we never could make out
his breed.  he wasn’t husky, nor malemute, nor hudson bay; he looked like
all of them and he didn’t look like any of them; and on top of it all he
had some of the white man’s dog in him, for on one side, in the thick of
the mixed yellow-brown-red-and-dirty-white that was his prevailing
colour, there was a spot of coal-black as big as a water-bucket.  that
was why we called him spot.

he was a good looker all right.  when he was in condition his muscles
stood out in bunches all over him.  and he was the strongest-looking
brute i ever saw in alaska, also the most intelligent-looking.  to run
your eyes over him, you’d think he could outpull three dogs of his own
weight.  maybe he could, but i never saw it.  his intelligence didn’t run
that way.  he could steal and forage to perfection; he had an instinct
that was positively gruesome for divining when work was to be done and
for making a sneak accordingly; and for getting lost and not staying lost
he was nothing short of inspired.  but when it came to work, the way that
intelligence dribbled out of him and left him a mere clot of wobbling,
stupid jelly would make your heart bleed.

there are times when i think it wasn’t stupidity.  maybe, like some men i
know, he was too wise to work.  i shouldn’t wonder if he put it all over
us with that intelligence of his.  maybe he figured it all out and
decided that a licking now and again and no work was a whole lot better
than work all the time and no licking.  he was intelligent enough for
such a computation.  i tell you, i’ve sat and looked into that dog’s eyes
till the shivers ran up and down my spine and the marrow crawled like
yeast, what of the intelligence i saw shining out.  i can’t express
myself about that intelligence.  it is beyond mere words.  i saw it,
that’s all.  at times it was like gazing into a human soul, to look into
his eyes; and what i saw there frightened me and started all sorts of
ideas in my own mind of reincarnation and all the rest.  i tell you i
sensed something big in that brute’s eyes; there was a message there, but
i wasn’t big enough myself to catch it.  whatever it was (i know i’m
making a fool of myself)—whatever it was, it baffled me.  i can’t give an
inkling of what i saw in that brute’s eyes; it wasn’t light, it wasn’t
colour; it was something that moved, away back, when the eyes themselves
weren’t moving.  and i guess i didn’t see it move either; i only sensed
that it moved.  it was an expression—that’s what it was—and i got an
impression of it.  no; it was different from a mere expression; it was
more than that.  i don’t know what it was, but it gave me a feeling of
kinship just the same.  oh, no, not sentimental kinship.  it was, rather,
a kinship of equality.  those eyes never pleaded like a deer’s eyes.
they challenged.  no, it wasn’t defiance.  it was just a calm assumption
of equality.  and i don’t think it was deliberate.  my belief is that it
was unconscious on his part.  it was there because it was there, and it
couldn’t help shining out.  no, i don’t mean shine.  it didn’t shine; it
_moved_.  i know i’m talking rot, but if you’d looked into that animal’s
eyes the way i have, you’d understand.  steve was affected the same way i
was.  why, i tried to kill that spot once—he was no good for anything;
and i fell down on it.  i led him out into the brush, and he came along
slow and unwilling.  he knew what was going on.  i stopped in a likely
place, put my foot on the rope, and pulled my big colt’s.  and that dog
sat down and looked at me.  i tell you he didn’t plead.  he just looked.
and i saw all kinds of incomprehensible things moving, yes, _moving_, in
those eyes of his.  i didn’t really see them move; i thought i saw them,
for, as i said before, i guess i only sensed them.  and i want to tell
you right now that it got beyond me.  it was like killing a man, a
conscious, brave man, who looked calmly into your gun as much as to say,
“who’s afraid?”

then, too, the message seemed so near that, instead of pulling the
trigger quick, i stopped to see if i could catch the message.  there it
was, right before me, glimmering all around in those eyes of his.  and
then it was too late.  i got scared.  i was trembly all over, and my
stomach generated a nervous palpitation that made me seasick.  i just sat
down and looked at the dog, and he looked at me, till i thought i was
going crazy.  do you want to know what i did?  i threw down the gun and
ran back to camp with the fear of god in my heart.  steve laughed at me.
but i notice that steve led spot into the woods, a week later, for the
same purpose, and that steve came back alone, and a little later spot
drifted back, too.

at any rate, spot wouldn’t work.  we paid a hundred and ten dollars for
him from the bottom of our sack, and he wouldn’t work.  he wouldn’t even
tighten the traces.  steve spoke to him the first time we put him in
harness, and he sort of shivered, that was all.  not an ounce on the
traces.  he just stood still and wobbled, like so much jelly.  steve
touched him with the whip.  he yelped, but not an ounce.  steve touched
him again, a bit harder, and he howled—the regular long wolf howl.  then
steve got mad and gave him half a dozen, and i came on the run from the
tent.

i told steve he was brutal with the animal, and we had some words—the
first we’d ever had.  he threw the whip down in the snow and walked away
mad.  i picked it up and went to it.  that spot trembled and wobbled and
cowered before ever i swung the lash, and with the first bite of it he
howled like a lost soul.  next he lay down in the snow.  i started the
rest of the dogs, and they dragged him along while i threw the whip into
him.  he rolled over on his back and bumped along, his four legs waving
in the air, himself howling as though he was going through a sausage
machine.  steve came back and laughed at me, and i apologized for what
i’d said.

there was no getting any work out of that spot; and to make up for it, he
was the biggest pig-glutton of a dog i ever saw.  on top of that, he was
the cleverest thief.  there was no circumventing him.  many a breakfast
we went without our bacon because spot had been there first.  and it was
because of him that we nearly starved to death up the stewart.  he
figured out the way to break into our meat-cache, and what he didn’t eat,
the rest of the team did.  but he was impartial.  he stole from
everybody.  he was a restless dog, always very busy snooping around or
going somewhere.  and there was never a camp within five miles that he
didn’t raid.  the worst of it was that they always came back on us to pay
his board bill, which was just, being the law of the land; but it was
mighty hard on us, especially that first winter on the chilcoot, when we
were busted, paying for whole hams and sides of bacon that we never ate.
he could fight, too, that spot.  he could do everything but work.  he
never pulled a pound, but he was the boss of the whole team.  the way he
made those dogs stand around was an education.  he bullied them, and
there was always one or more of them fresh-marked with his fangs.  but he
was more than a bully.  he wasn’t afraid of anything that walked on four
legs; and i’ve seen him march, single-handed into a strange team, without
any provocation whatever, and put the _kibosh_ on the whole outfit.  did
i say he could eat?  i caught him eating the whip once.  that’s straight.
he started in at the lash, and when i caught him he was down to the
handle, and still going.

but he was a good looker.  at the end of the first week we sold him for
seventy-five dollars to the mounted police.  they had experienced
dog-drivers, and we knew that by the time he’d covered the six hundred
miles to dawson he’d be a good sled-dog.  i say we _knew_, for we were
just getting acquainted with that spot.  a little later we were not brash
enough to know anything where he was concerned.  a week later we woke up
in the morning to the dangdest dog-fight we’d ever heard.  it was that
spot come back and knocking the team into shape.  we ate a pretty
depressing breakfast, i can tell you; but cheered up two hours afterward
when we sold him to an official courier, bound in to dawson with
government despatches.  that spot was only three days in coming back,
and, as usual, celebrated his arrival with a rough house.

we spent the winter and spring, after our own outfit was across the pass,
freighting other people’s outfits; and we made a fat stake.  also, we
made money out of spot.  if we sold him once, we sold him twenty times.
he always came back, and no one asked for their money.  we didn’t want
the money.  we’d have paid handsomely for any one to take him off our
hands for keeps’.  we had to get rid of him, and we couldn’t give him
away, for that would have been suspicious.  but he was such a fine looker
that we never had any difficulty in selling him.  “unbroke,” we’d say,
and they’d pay any old price for him.  we sold him as low as twenty-five
dollars, and once we got a hundred and fifty for him.  that particular
party returned him in person, refused to take his money back, and the way
he abused us was something awful.  he said it was cheap at the price to
tell us what he thought of us; and we felt he was so justified that we
never talked back.  but to this day i’ve never quite regained all the old
self-respect that was mine before that man talked to me.

when the ice cleared out of the lakes and river, we put our outfit in a
lake bennett boat and started for dawson.  we had a good team of dogs,
and of course we piled them on top the outfit.  that spot was along—there
was no losing him; and a dozen times, the first day, he knocked one or
another of the dogs overboard in the course of fighting with them.  it
was close quarters, and he didn’t like being crowded.

“what that dog needs is space,” steve said the second day.  “let’s maroon
him.”

we did, running the boat in at caribou crossing for him to jump ashore.
two of the other dogs, good dogs, followed him; and we lost two whole
days trying to find them.  we never saw those two dogs again; but the
quietness and relief we enjoyed made us decide, like the man who refused
his hundred and fifty, that it was cheap at the price.  for the first
time in months steve and i laughed and whistled and sang.  we were as
happy as clams.  the dark days were over.  the nightmare had been lifted.
that spot was gone.

three weeks later, one morning, steve and i were standing on the
river-bank at dawson.  a small boat was just arriving from lake bennett.
i saw steve give a start, and heard him say something that was not nice
and that was not under his breath.  then i looked; and there, in the bow
of the boat, with ears pricked up, sat spot.  steve and i sneaked
immediately, like beaten curs, like cowards, like absconders from
justice.  it was this last that the lieutenant of police thought when he
saw us sneaking.  he surmised that there were law-officers in the boat
who were after us.  he didn’t wait to find out, but kept us in sight, and
in the m. & m. saloon got us in a corner.  we had a merry time
explaining, for we refused to go back to the boat and meet spot; and
finally he held us under guard of another policeman while he went to the
boat.  after we got clear of him, we started for the cabin, and when we
arrived, there was that spot sitting on the stoop waiting for us.  now
how did he know we lived there?  there were forty thousand people in
dawson that summer, and how did he _savve_ our cabin out of all the
cabins?  how did he know we were in dawson, anyway?  i leave it to you.
but don’t forget what i said about his intelligence and that immortal
something i have seen glimmering in his eyes.

there was no getting rid of him any more.  there were too many people in
dawson who had bought him up on chilcoot, and the story got around.  half
a dozen times we put him on board steamboats going down the yukon; but he
merely went ashore at the first landing and trotted back up the bank.  we
couldn’t sell him, we couldn’t kill him (both steve and i had tried), and
nobody else was able to kill him.  he bore a charmed life.  i’ve seen him
go down in a dogfight on the main street with fifty dogs on top of him,
and when they were separated, he’d appear on all his four legs, unharmed,
while two of the dogs that had been on top of him would be lying dead.

i saw him steal a chunk of moose-meat from major dinwiddie’s cache so
heavy that he could just keep one jump ahead of mrs. dinwiddie’s squaw
cook, who was after him with an axe.  as he went up the hill, after the
squaw gave up, major dinwiddie himself came out and pumped his winchester
into the landscape.  he emptied his magazine twice, and never touched
that spot.  then a policeman came along and arrested him for discharging
firearms inside the city limits.  major dinwiddie paid his fine, and
steve and i paid him for the moose-meat at the rate of a dollar a pound,
bones and all.  that was what he paid for it.  meat was high that year.

i am only telling what i saw with my own eyes.  and now i’ll tell you
something also.  i saw that spot fall through a water-hole.  the ice was
three and a half feet thick, and the current sucked him under like a
straw.  three hundred yards below was the big water-hole used by the
hospital.  spot crawled out of the hospital water-hole, licked off the
water, bit out the ice that had formed between his toes, trotted up the
bank, and whipped a big newfoundland belonging to the gold commissioner.

in the fall of 1898, steve and i poled up the yukon on the last water,
bound for stewart river.  we took the dogs along, all except spot.  we
figured we’d been feeding him long enough.  he’d cost us more time and
trouble and money and grub than we’d got by selling him on the
chilcoot—especially grub.  so steve and i tied him down in the cabin and
pulled our freight.  we camped that night at the mouth of indian river,
and steve and i were pretty facetious over having shaken him.  steve was
a funny cuss, and i was just sitting up in the blankets and laughing when
a tornado hit camp.  the way that spot walked into those dogs and gave
them what-for was hair-raising.  now how did he get loose?  it’s up to
you.  i haven’t any theory.  and how did he get across the klondike
river?  that’s another facer.  and anyway, how did he know we had gone up
the yukon?  you see, we went by water, and he couldn’t smell our tracks.
steve and i began to get superstitious about that dog.  he got on our
nerves, too; and, between you and me, we were just a mite afraid of him.

the freeze-up came on when we were at the mouth of henderson creek, and
we traded him off for two sacks of flour to an outfit that was bound up
white river after copper.  now that whole outfit was lost.  never trace
nor hide nor hair of men, dogs, sleds, or anything was ever found.  they
dropped clean out of sight.  it became one of the mysteries of the
country.  steve and i plugged away up the stewart, and six weeks
afterward that spot crawled into camp.  he was a perambulating skeleton,
and could just drag along; but he got there.  and what i want to know is,
who told him we were up the stewart?  we could have gone to a thousand
other places.  how did he know?  you tell me, and i’ll tell you.

no losing him.  at the mayo he started a row with an indian dog.  the
buck who owned the dog took a swing at spot with an axe, missed him, and
killed his own dog.  talk about magic and turning bullets aside—i, for
one, consider it a blamed sight harder to turn an axe aside with a big
buck at the other end of it.  and i saw him do it with my own eyes.  that
buck didn’t want to kill his own dog.  you’ve got to show me.

i told you about spot breaking into our meat cache.  it was nearly the
death of us.  there wasn’t any more meat to be killed, and meat was all
we had to live on.  the moose had gone back several hundred miles and the
indians with them.  there we were.  spring was on, and we had to wait for
the river to break.  we got pretty thin before we decided to eat the
dogs, and we decided to eat spot first.  do you know what that dog did?
he sneaked.  now how did he know our minds were made up to eat him?  we
sat up nights laying for him, but he never came back, and we ate the
other dogs.  we ate the whole team.

and now for the sequel.  you know what it is when a big river breaks up
and a few billion tons of ice go out, jamming and milling and grinding.
just in the thick of it, when the stewart went out, rumbling and roaring,
we sighted spot out in the middle.  he’d got caught as he was trying to
cross up above somewhere.  steve and i yelled and shouted and ran up and
down the bank, tossing our hats in the air.  sometimes we’d stop and hug
each other, we were that boisterous, for we saw spot’s finish.  he didn’t
have a chance in a million.  he didn’t have any chance at all.  after the
ice-run, we got into a canoe and paddled down to the yukon, and down the
yukon to dawson, stopping to feed up for a week at the cabins at the
mouth of henderson creek.  and as we came in to the bank at dawson, there
sat that spot, waiting for us, his ears pricked up, his tail wagging, his
mouth smiling, extending a hearty welcome to us.  now how did he get out
of that ice?  how did he know we were coming to dawson, to the very hour
and minute, to be out there on the bank waiting for us?

the more i think of that spot, the more i am convinced that there are
things in this world that go beyond science.  on no scientific grounds
can that spot be explained.  it’s psychic phenomena, or mysticism, or
something of that sort, i guess, with a lot of theosophy thrown in.  the
klondike is a good country.  i might have been there yet, and become a
millionaire, if it hadn’t been for spot.  he got on my nerves.  i stood
him for two years altogether, and then i guess my stamina broke.  it was
the summer of 1899 when i pulled out.  i didn’t say anything to steve.  i
just sneaked.  but i fixed it up all right.  i wrote steve a note, and
enclosed a package of “rough-on-rats,” telling him what to do with it.  i
was worn down to skin and bone by that spot, and i was that nervous that
i’d jump and look around when there wasn’t anybody within hailing
distance.  but it was astonishing the way i recuperated when i got quit
of him.  i got back twenty pounds before i arrived in san francisco, and
by the time i’d crossed the ferry to oakland i was my old self again, so
that even my wife looked in vain for any change in me.

steve wrote to me once, and his letter seemed irritated.  he took it kind
of hard because i’d left him with spot.  also, he said he’d used the
“rough-on-rats,” per directions, and that there was nothing doing.  a
year went by.  i was back in the office and prospering in all ways—even
getting a bit fat.  and then steve arrived.  he didn’t look me up.  i
read his name in the steamer list, and wondered why.  but i didn’t wonder
long.  i got up one morning and found that spot chained to the gate-post
and holding up the milkman.  steve went north to seattle, i learned, that
very morning.  i didn’t put on any more weight.  my wife made me buy him
a collar and tag, and within an hour he showed his gratitude by killing
her pet persian cat.  there is no getting rid of that spot.  he will be
with me until i die, for he’ll never die.  my appetite is not so good
since he arrived, and my wife says i am looking peaked.  last night that
spot got into mr. harvey’s hen-house (harvey is my next-door neighbour)
and killed nineteen of his fancy-bred chickens.  i shall have to pay for
them.  my neighbours on the other side quarrelled with my wife and then
moved out.  spot was the cause of it.  and that is why i am disappointed
in stephen mackaye.  i had no idea he was so mean a man.




flush of gold


lon mcfane was a bit grumpy, what of losing his tobacco pouch, or else he
might have told me, before we got to it, something about the cabin at
surprise lake.  all day, turn and turn about, we had spelled each other
at going to the fore and breaking trail for the dogs.  it was heavy
snowshoe work, and did not tend to make a man voluble, yet lon mcfane
might have found breath enough at noon, when we stopped to boil coffee,
with which to tell me.  but he didn’t.  surprise lake?--it was surprise
cabin to me.  i had never heard of it before.  i confess i was a bit
tired.  i had been looking for lon to stop and make camp any time for an
hour; but i had too much pride to suggest making camp or to ask him his
intentions; and yet he was my man, lured at a handsome wage to mush my
dogs for me and to obey my commands.  i guess i was a bit grumpy myself.
he said nothing, and i was resolved to ask nothing, even if we tramped on
all night.

we came upon the cabin abruptly.  for a week of trail we had met no one,
and, in my mind, there had been little likelihood of meeting any one for
a week to come.  and yet there it was, right before my eyes, a cabin,
with a dim light in the window and smoke curling up from the chimney.

“why didn’t you tell me—” i began, but was interrupted by lon, who
muttered—

“surprise lake—it lies up a small feeder half a mile on.  it’s only a
pond.”

“yes, but the cabin—who lives in it?”

“a woman,” was the answer, and the next moment lon had rapped on the
door, and a woman’s voice bade him enter.

“have you seen dave recently?” she asked.

“nope,” lon answered carelessly.  “i’ve been in the other direction, down
circle city way.  dave’s up dawson way, ain’t he?”

the woman nodded, and lon fell to unharnessing the dogs, while i unlashed
the sled and carried the camp outfit into the cabin.  the cabin was a
large, one-room affair, and the woman was evidently alone in it.  she
pointed to the stove, where water was already boiling, and lon set about
the preparation of supper, while i opened the fish-bag and fed the dogs.
i looked for lon to introduce us, and was vexed that he did not, for they
were evidently old friends.

“you are lon mcfane, aren’t you?” i heard her ask him.  “why, i remember
you now.  the last time i saw you it was on a steamboat, wasn’t it?  i
remember . . . ”

her speech seemed suddenly to be frozen by the spectacle of dread which,
i knew, from the tenor i saw mounting in her eyes, must be on her inner
vision.  to my astonishment, lon was affected by her words and manner.
his face showed desperate, for all his voice sounded hearty and genial,
as he said—

“the last time we met was at dawson, queen’s jubilee, or birthday, or
something—don’t you remember?—the canoe races in the river, and the
obstacle races down the main street?”

the terror faded out of her eyes and her whole body relaxed.  “oh, yes, i
do remember,” she said.  “and you won one of the canoe races.”

“how’s dave been makin’ it lately?  strikin’ it as rich as ever, i
suppose?” lon asked, with apparent irrelevance.

she smiled and nodded, and then, noticing that i had unlashed the bed
roll, she indicated the end of the cabin where i might spread it.  her
own bunk, i noticed, was made up at the opposite end.

“i thought it was dave coming when i heard your dogs,” she said.

after that she said nothing, contenting herself with watching lon’s
cooking operations, and listening the while as for the sound of dogs
along the trail.  i lay back on the blankets and smoked and watched.
here was mystery; i could make that much out, but no more could i make
out.  why in the deuce hadn’t lon given me the tip before we arrived?  i
looked at her face, unnoticed by her, and the longer i looked the harder
it was to take my eyes away.  it was a wonderfully beautiful face,
unearthly, i may say, with a light in it or an expression or something
“that was never on land or sea.”  fear and terror had completely
vanished, and it was a placidly beautiful face—if by “placid” one can
characterize that intangible and occult something that i cannot say was a
radiance or a light any more than i can say it was an expression.

abruptly, as if for the first time, she became aware of my presence.

“have you seen dave recently?” she asked me.  it was on the tip of my
tongue to say “dave who?” when lon coughed in the smoke that arose from
the sizzling bacon.  the bacon might have caused that cough, but i took
it as a hint and left my question unasked.  “no, i haven’t,” i answered.
“i’m new in this part of the country—”

“but you don’t mean to say,” she interrupted, “that you’ve never heard of
dave—of big dave walsh?”

“you see,” i apologised, “i’m new in the country.  i’ve put in most of my
time in the lower country, down nome way.”

“tell him about dave,” she said to lon.

lon seemed put out, but he began in that hearty, genial manner that i had
noticed before.  it seemed a shade too hearty and genial, and it
irritated me.

“oh, dave is a fine man,” he said.  “he’s a man, every inch of him, and
he stands six feet four in his socks.  his word is as good as his bond.
the man lies who ever says dave told a lie, and that man will have to
fight with me, too, as well—if there’s anything left of him when dave
gets done with him.  for dave is a fighter.  oh, yes, he’s a scrapper
from way back.  he got a grizzly with a ’38 popgun.  he got clawed some,
but he knew what he was doin’.  he went into the cave on purpose to get
that grizzly.  ’fraid of nothing.  free an’ easy with his money, or his
last shirt an’ match when out of money.  why, he drained surprise lake
here in three weeks an’ took out ninety thousand, didn’t he?”  she
flushed and nodded her head proudly.  through his recital she had
followed every word with keenest interest.  “an’ i must say,” lon went
on, “that i was disappointed sore on not meeting dave here to-night.”

lon served supper at one end of the table of whip-sawed spruce, and we
fell to eating.  a howling of the dogs took the woman to the door.  she
opened it an inch and listened.

“where is dave walsh?” i asked, in an undertone.

“dead,” lon answered.  “in hell, maybe.  i don’t know.  shut up.”

“but you just said that you expected to meet him here to-night,” i
challenged.

“oh, shut up, can’t you,” was lon’s reply, in the same cautious
undertone.

the woman had closed the door and was returning, and i sat and meditated
upon the fact that this man who told me to shut up received from me a
salary of two hundred and fifty dollars a month and his board.

lon washed the dishes, while i smoked and watched the woman.  she seemed
more beautiful than ever—strangely and weirdly beautiful, it is true.
after looking at her steadfastly for five minutes, i was compelled to
come back to the real world and to glance at lon mcfane.  this enabled me
to know, without discussion, that the woman, too, was real.  at first i
had taken her for the wife of dave walsh; but if dave walsh were dead, as
lon had said, then she could be only his widow.

it was early to bed, for we faced a long day on the morrow; and as lon
crawled in beside me under the blankets, i ventured a question.

“that woman’s crazy, isn’t she?”

“crazy as a loon,” he answered.

and before i could formulate my next question, lon mcfane, i swear, was
off to sleep.  he always went to sleep that way—just crawled into the
blankets, closed his eyes, and was off, a demure little heavy breathing
rising on the air.  lon never snored.

and in the morning it was quick breakfast, feed the dogs, load the sled,
and hit the trail.  we said good-bye as we pulled out, and the woman
stood in the doorway and watched us off.  i carried the vision of her
unearthly beauty away with me, just under my eyelids, and all i had to
do, any time, was to close them and see her again.  the way was unbroken,
surprise lake being far off the travelled trails, and lon and i took turn
about at beating down the feathery snow with our big, webbed shoes so
that the dogs could travel.  “but you said you expected to meet dave
walsh at the cabin,” trembled on the tip of my tongue a score of times.
i did not utter it.  i could wait until we knocked off in the middle of
the day.  and when the middle of the day came, we went right on, for, as
lon explained, there was a camp of moose hunters at the forks of the
teelee, and we could make there by dark.  but we didn’t make there by
dark, for bright, the lead-dog, broke his shoulder-blade, and we lost an
hour over him before we shot him.  then, crossing a timber jam on the
frozen bed of the teelee, the sled suffered a wrenching capsize, and it
was a case of make camp and repair the runner.  i cooked supper and fed
the dogs while lon made the repairs, and together we got in the night’s
supply of ice and firewood.  then we sat on our blankets, our moccasins
steaming on upended sticks before the fire, and had our evening smoke.

“you didn’t know her?” lon queried suddenly.  i shook my head.

“you noticed the colour of her hair and eyes and her complexion, well,
that’s where she got her name—she was like the first warm glow of a
golden sunrise.  she was called flush of gold.  ever heard of her?”

somewhere i had a confused and misty remembrance of having heard the
name, yet it meant nothing to me.  “flush of gold,” i repeated; “sounds
like the name of a dance-house girl.”  lon shook his head.  “no, she was
a good woman, at least in that sense, though she sinned greatly just the
same.”

“but why do you speak always of her in the past tense, as though she were
dead?”

“because of the darkness on her soul that is the same as the darkness of
death.  the flush of gold that i knew, that dawson knew, and that forty
mile knew before that, is dead.  that dumb, lunatic creature we saw last
night was not flush of gold.”

“and dave?” i queried.

“he built that cabin,” lon answered, “he built it for her . . . and for
himself.  he is dead.  she is waiting for him there.  she half believes
he is not dead.  but who can know the whim of a crazed mind?  maybe she
wholly believes he is not dead.  at any rate, she waits for him there in
the cabin he built.  who would rouse the dead?  then who would rouse the
living that are dead?  not i, and that is why i let on to expect to meet
dave walsh there last night.  i’ll bet a stack that i’d a been more
surprised than she if i _had_ met him there last night.”

“i do not understand,” i said.  “begin at the beginning, as a white man
should, and tell me the whole tale.”

and lon began.  “victor chauvet was an old frenchman—born in the south of
france.  he came to california in the days of gold.  he was a pioneer.
he found no gold, but, instead, became a maker of bottled sunshine—in
short, a grape-grower and wine-maker.  also, he followed gold
excitements.  that is what brought him to alaska in the early days, and
over the chilcoot and down the yukon long before the carmack strike.  the
old town site of ten mile was chauvet’s.  he carried the first mail into
arctic city.  he staked those coal-mines on the porcupine a dozen years
ago.  he grubstaked loftus into the nippennuck country.  now it happened
that victor chauvet was a good catholic, loving two things in this world,
wine and woman.  wine of all kinds he loved, but of woman, only one, and
she was the mother of marie chauvet.”

here i groaned aloud, having meditated beyond self-control over the fact
that i paid this man two hundred and fifty dollars a month.

“what’s the matter now?” he demanded.

“matter?” i complained.  “i thought you were telling the story of flush
of gold.  i don’t want a biography of your old french wine-bibber.”

lon calmly lighted his pipe, took one good puff, then put the pipe aside.
“and you asked me to begin at the beginning,” he said.

“yes,” said i; “the beginning.”

“and the beginning of flush of gold is the old french wine-bibber, for he
was the father of marie chauvet, and marie chauvet was the flush of gold.
what more do you want?  victor chauvet never had much luck to speak of.
he managed to live, and to get along, and to take good care of marie, who
resembled the one woman he had loved.  he took very good care of her.
flush of gold was the pet name he gave her.  flush of gold creek was
named after her—flush of gold town site, too.  the old man was great on
town sites, only he never landed them.

“now, honestly,” lon said, with one of his lightning changes, “you’ve
seen her, what do you think of her—of her looks, i mean?  how does she
strike your beauty sense?”

“she is remarkably beautiful,” i said.  “i never saw anything like her in
my life.  in spite of the fact, last night, that i guessed she was mad, i
could not keep my eyes off of her.  it wasn’t curiosity.  it was wonder,
sheer wonder, she was so strangely beautiful.”

“she was more strangely beautiful before the darkness fell upon her,” lon
said softly.  “she was truly the flush of gold.  she turned all men’s
hearts . . . and heads.  she recalls, with an effort, that i once won a
canoe race at dawson—i, who once loved her, and was told by her of her
love for me.  it was her beauty that made all men love her.  she’d ’a’
got the apple from paris, on application, and there wouldn’t have been
any trojan war, and to top it off she’d have thrown paris down.  and now
she lives in darkness, and she who was always fickle, for the first time
is constant—and constant to a shade, to a dead man she does not realize
is dead.

“and this is the way it was.  you remember what i said last night of dave
walsh—big dave walsh?  he was all that i said, and more, many times more.
he came into this country in the late eighties—that’s a pioneer for you.
he was twenty years old then.  he was a young bull.  when he was
twenty-five he could lift clear of the ground thirteen fifty-pound sacks
of flour.  at first, each fall of the year, famine drove him out.  it was
a lone land in those days.  no river steamboats, no grub, nothing but
salmon bellies and rabbit tracks.  but after famine chased him out three
years, he said he’d had enough of being chased; and the next year he
stayed.  he lived on straight meat when he was lucky enough to get it; he
ate eleven dogs that winter; but he stayed.  and the next winter he
stayed, and the next.  he never did leave the country again.  he was a
bull, a great bull.  he could kill the strongest man in the country with
hard work.  he could outpack a chilcat indian, he could outpaddle a
stick, and he could travel all day with wet feet when the thermometer
registered fifty below zero, and that’s going some, i tell you, for
vitality.  you’d freeze your feet at twenty-five below if you wet them
and tried to keep on.

“dave walsh was a bull for strength.  and yet he was soft and
easy-natured.  anybody could do him, the latest short-horn in camp could
lie his last dollar out of him.  ‘but it doesn’t worry me,’ he had a way
of laughing off his softness; ‘it doesn’t keep me awake nights.’ now
don’t get the idea that he had no backbone.  you remember about the bear
he went after with the popgun.  when it came to fighting dave was the
blamedest ever.  he was the limit, if by that i may describe his
unlimitedness when he got into action, he was easy and kind with the
weak, but the strong had to give trail when he went by.  and he was a man
that men liked, which is the finest word of all, a man’s man.

“dave never took part in the big stampede to dawson when carmack made the
bonanza strike.  you see, dave was just then over on mammon creek
strikin’ it himself.  he discovered mammon creek.  cleaned eighty-four
thousand up that winter, and opened up the claim so that it promised a
couple of hundred thousand for the next winter.  then, summer bein’ on
and the ground sloshy, he took a trip up the yukon to dawson to see what
carmack’s strike looked like.  and there he saw flush of gold.  i
remember the night.  i shall always remember.  it was something sudden,
and it makes one shiver to think of a strong man with all the strength
withered out of him by one glance from the soft eyes of a weak, blond,
female creature like flush of gold.  it was at her dad’s cabin, old
victor chauvet’s.  some friend had brought dave along to talk over town
sites on mammon creek.  but little talking did he do, and what he did was
mostly gibberish.  i tell you the sight of flush of gold had sent dave
clean daffy.  old victor chauvet insisted after dave left that he had
been drunk.  and so he had.  he was drunk, but flush of gold was the
strong drink that made him so.

“that settled it, that first glimpse he caught of her.  he did not start
back down the yukon in a week, as he had intended.  he lingered on a
month, two months, all summer.  and we who had suffered understood, and
wondered what the outcome would be.  undoubtedly, in our minds, it seemed
that flush of gold had met her master.  and why not?  there was romance
sprinkled all over dave walsh.  he was a mammon king, he had made the
mammon creek strike; he was an old sour dough, one of the oldest pioneers
in the land—men turned to look at him when he went by, and said to one
another in awed undertones, ‘there goes dave walsh.’  and why not?  he
stood six feet four; he had yellow hair himself that curled on his neck;
and he was a bull—a yellow-maned bull just turned thirty-one.

“and flush of gold loved him, and, having danced him through a whole
summer’s courtship, at the end their engagement was made known.  the fall
of the year was at hand, dave had to be back for the winter’s work on
mammon creek, and flush of gold refused to be married right away.  dave
put dusky burns in charge of the mammon creek claim, and himself lingered
on in dawson.  little use.  she wanted her freedom a while longer; she
must have it, and she would not marry until next year.  and so, on the
first ice, dave walsh went alone down the yukon behind his dogs, with the
understanding that the marriage would take place when he arrived on the
first steamboat of the next year.

“now dave was as true as the pole star, and she was as false as a
magnetic needle in a cargo of loadstone.  dave was as steady and solid as
she was fickle and fly-away, and in some way dave, who never doubted
anybody, doubted her.  it was the jealousy of his love, perhaps, and
maybe it was the message ticked off from her soul to his; but at any rate
dave was worried by fear of her inconstancy.  he was afraid to trust her
till the next year, he had so to trust her, and he was pretty well beside
himself.  some of it i got from old victor chauvet afterwards, and from
all that i have pieced together i conclude that there was something of a
scene before dave pulled north with his dogs.  he stood up before the old
frenchman, with flush of gold beside him, and announced that they were
plighted to each other.  he was very dramatic, with fire in his eyes, old
victor said.  he talked something about ‘until death do us part’; and old
victor especially remembered that at one place dave took her by the
shoulder with his great paw and almost shook her as he said: ‘even unto
death are you mine, and i would rise from the grave to claim you.’  old
victor distinctly remembered those words ‘even unto death are you mine,
and i would rise from the grave to claim you.’  and he told me afterwards
that flush of gold was pretty badly frightened, and that he afterwards
took dave to one side privately and told him that that wasn’t the way to
hold flush of gold—that he must humour her and gentle her if he wanted to
keep her.

“there is no discussion in my mind but that flush of gold was frightened.
she was a savage herself in her treatment of men, while men had always
treated her as a soft and tender and too utterly-utter something that
must not be hurt.  she didn’t know what harshness was . . . until dave
walsh, standing his six feet four, a big bull, gripped her and pawed her
and assured her that she was his until death, and then some.  and
besides, in dawson, that winter, was a music-player—one of those
macaroni-eating, greasy-tenor-eye-talian-dago propositions—and flush of
gold lost her heart to him.  maybe it was only fascination—i don’t know.
sometimes it seems to me that she really did love dave walsh.  perhaps it
was because he had frightened her with that even-unto-death,
rise-from-the-grave stunt of his that she in the end inclined to the dago
music-player.  but it is all guesswork, and the facts are, sufficient.
he wasn’t a dago; he was a russian count—this was straight; and he wasn’t
a professional piano-player or anything of the sort.  he played the
violin and the piano, and he sang—sang well—but it was for his own
pleasure and for the pleasure of those he sang for.  he had money,
too—and right here let me say that flush of gold never cared a rap for
money.  she was fickle, but she was never sordid.

“but to be getting along.  she was plighted to dave, and dave was coming
up on the first steamboat to get her—that was the summer of ’98, and the
first steamboat was to be expected the middle of june.  and flush of gold
was afraid to throw dave down and face him afterwards.  it was all
planned suddenly.  the russian music-player, the count, was her obedient
slave.  she planned it, i know.  i learned as much from old victor
afterwards.  the count took his orders from her, and caught that first
steamboat down.  it was the _golden rocket_.  and so did flush of gold
catch it.  and so did i.  i was going to circle city, and i was
flabbergasted when i found flush of gold on board.  i didn’t see her name
down on the passenger list.  she was with the count fellow all the time,
happy and smiling, and i noticed that the count fellow was down on the
list as having his wife along.  there it was, state-room, number, and
all.  the first i knew that he was married, only i didn’t see anything of
the wife . . . unless flush of gold was so counted.  i wondered if they’d
got married ashore before starting.  there’d been talk about them in
dawson, you see, and bets had been laid that the count fellow had cut
dave out.

“i talked with the purser.  he didn’t know anything more about it than i
did; he didn’t know flush of gold, anyway, and besides, he was almost
rushed to death.  you know what a yukon steamboat is, but you can’t guess
what the _golden rocket_ was when it left dawson that june of 1898.  she
was a hummer.  being the first steamer out, she carried all the scurvy
patients and hospital wrecks.  then she must have carried a couple of
millions of klondike dust and nuggets, to say nothing of a packed and
jammed passenger list, deck passengers galore, and bucks and squaws and
dogs without end.  and she was loaded down to the guards with freight and
baggage.  there was a mountain of the same on the fore-lower-deck, and
each little stop along the way added to it.  i saw the box come aboard at
teelee portage, and i knew it for what it was, though i little guessed
the joker that was in it.  and they piled it on top of everything else on
the fore-lower-deck, and they didn’t pile it any too securely either.
the mate expected to come back to it again, and then forgot about it.  i
thought at the time that there was something familiar about the big husky
dog that climbed over the baggage and freight and lay down next to the
box.  and then we passed the _glendale_, bound up for dawson.  as she
saluted us, i thought of dave on board of her and hurrying to dawson to
flush of gold.  i turned and looked at her where she stood by the rail.
her eyes were bright, but she looked a bit frightened by the sight of the
other steamer, and she was leaning closely to the count fellow as for
protection.  she needn’t have leaned so safely against him, and i needn’t
have been so sure of a disappointed dave walsh arriving at dawson.  for
dave walsh wasn’t on the _glendale_.  there were a lot of things i didn’t
know, but was soon to know—for instance, that the pair were not yet
married.  inside half an hour preparations for the marriage took place.
what of the sick men in the main cabin, and of the crowded condition of
the _golden rocket_, the likeliest place for the ceremony was found
forward, on the lower deck, in an open space next to the rail and
gang-plank and shaded by the mountain of freight with the big box on top
and the sleeping dog beside it.  there was a missionary on board, getting
off at eagle city, which was the next step, so they had to use him quick.
that’s what they’d planned to do, get married on the boat.

“but i’ve run ahead of the facts.  the reason dave walsh wasn’t on the
_glendale_ was because he was on the _golden rocket_.  it was this way.
after loiterin’ in dawson on account of flush of gold, he went down to
mammon creek on the ice.  and there he found dusky burns doing so well
with the claim, there was no need for him to be around.  so he put some
grub on the sled, harnessed the dogs, took an indian along, and pulled
out for surprise lake.  he always had a liking for that section.  maybe
you don’t know how the creek turned out to be a four-flusher; but the
prospects were good at the time, and dave proceeded to build his cabin
and hers.  that’s the cabin we slept in.  after he finished it, he went
off on a moose hunt to the forks of the teelee, takin’ the indian along.

“and this is what happened.  came on a cold snap.  the juice went down
forty, fifty, sixty below zero.  i remember that snap—i was at forty
mile; and i remember the very day.  at eleven o’clock in the morning the
spirit thermometer at the n. a. t. & t. company’s store went down to
seventy-five below zero.  and that morning, near the forks of the teelee,
dave walsh was out after moose with that blessed indian of his.  i got it
all from the indian afterwards—we made a trip over the ice together to
dyea.  that morning mr. indian broke through the ice and wet himself to
the waist.  of course he began to freeze right away.  the proper thing
was to build a fire.  but dave walsh was a bull.  it was only half a mile
to camp, where a fire was already burning.  what was the good of building
another?  he threw mr. indian over his shoulder—and ran with him—half a
mile—with the thermometer at seventy-five below.  you know what that
means.  suicide.  there’s no other name for it.  why, that buck indian
weighed over two hundred himself, and dave ran half a mile with him.  of
course he froze his lungs.  must have frozen them near solid.  it was a
tomfool trick for any man to do.  and anyway, after lingering horribly
for several weeks, dave walsh died.

“the indian didn’t know what to do with the corpse.  ordinarily he’d have
buried him and let it go at that.  but he knew that dave walsh was a big
man, worth lots of money, a _hi-yu skookum_ chief.  likewise he’d seen
the bodies of other _hi-yu skookums_ carted around the country like they
were worth something.  so he decided to take dave’s body to forty mile,
which was dave’s headquarters.  you know how the ice is on the grass
roots in this country—well, the indian planted dave under a foot of
soil—in short, he put dave on ice.  dave could have stayed there a
thousand years and still been the same old dave.  you understand—just the
same as a refrigerator.  then the indian brings over a whipsaw from the
cabin at surprise lake and makes lumber enough for the box.  also,
waiting for the thaw, he goes out and shoots about ten thousand pounds of
moose.  this he keeps on ice, too.  came the thaw.  the teelee broke.  he
built a raft and loaded it with the meat, the big box with dave inside,
and dave’s team of dogs, and away they went down the teelee.

“the raft got caught on a timber jam and hung up two days.  it was
scorching hot weather, and mr. indian nearly lost his moose meat.  so
when he got to teelee portage he figured a steamboat would get to forty
mile quicker than his raft.  he transferred his cargo, and there you are,
fore-lower deck of the _golden rocket_, flush of gold being married, and
dave walsh in his big box casting the shade for her.  and there’s one
thing i clean forgot.  no wonder i thought the husky dog that came aboard
at teelee portage was familiar.  it was pee-lat, dave walsh’s lead-dog
and favourite—a terrible fighter, too.  he was lying down beside the box.

“flush of gold caught sight of me, called me over, shook hands with me,
and introduced me to the count.  she was beautiful.  i was as mad for her
then as ever.  she smiled into my eyes and said i must sign as one of the
witnesses.  and there was no refusing her.  she was ever a child, cruel
as children are cruel.  also, she told me she was in possession of the
only two bottles of champagne in dawson—or that had been in dawson the
night before; and before i knew it i was scheduled to drink her and the
count’s health.  everybody crowded round, the captain of the steamboat,
very prominent, trying to ring in on the wine, i guess.  it was a funny
wedding.  on the upper deck the hospital wrecks, with various feet in the
grave, gathered and looked down to see.  there were indians all jammed in
the circle, too, big bucks, and their squaws and kids, to say nothing of
about twenty-five snarling wolf-dogs.  the missionary lined the two of
them up and started in with the service.  and just then a dog-fight
started, high up on the pile of freight—pee-lat lying beside the big box,
and a white-haired brute belonging to one of the indians.  the fight
wasn’t explosive at all.  the brutes just snarled at each other from a
distance—tapping at each other long-distance, you know, saying dast and
dassent, dast and dassent.  the noise was rather disturbing, but you
could hear the missionary’s voice above it.

“there was no particularly easy way of getting at the two dogs, except
from the other side of the pile.  but nobody was on that side—everybody
watching the ceremony, you see.  even then everything might have been all
right if the captain hadn’t thrown a club at the dogs.  that was what
precipitated everything.  as i say, if the captain hadn’t thrown that
club, nothing might have happened.

“the missionary had just reached the point where he was saying ‘in
sickness and in health,’ and ‘till death us do part.’  and just then the
captain threw the club.  i saw the whole thing.  it landed on pee-lat,
and at that instant the white brute jumped him.  the club caused it.
their two bodies struck the box, and it began to slide, its lower end
tilting down.  it was a long oblong box, and it slid down slowly until it
reached the perpendicular, when it came down on the run.  the onlookers
on that side the circle had time to get out from under.  flush of gold
and the count, on the opposite side of the circle, were facing the box;
the missionary had his back to it.  the box must have fallen ten feet
straight up and down, and it hit end on.

“now mind you, not one of us knew that dave walsh was dead.  we thought
he was on the _glendale_, bound for dawson.  the missionary had edged off
to one side, and so flush of gold faced the box when it struck.  it was
like in a play.  it couldn’t have been better planned.  it struck on end,
and on the right end; the whole front of the box came off; and out swept
dave walsh on his feet, partly wrapped in a blanket, his yellow hair
flying and showing bright in the sun.  right out of the box, on his feet,
he swept upon flush of gold.  she didn’t know he was dead, but it was
unmistakable, after hanging up two days on a timber jam, that he was
rising all right from the dead to claim her.  possibly that is what she
thought.  at any rate, the sight froze her.  she couldn’t move.  she just
sort of wilted and watched dave walsh coming for her!  and he got her.
it looked almost as though he threw his arms around her, but whether or
not this happened, down to the deck they went together.  we had to drag
dave walsh’s body clear before we could get hold of her.  she was in a
faint, but it would have been just as well if she had never come out of
that faint; for when she did, she fell to screaming the way insane people
do.  she kept it up for hours, till she was exhausted.  oh, yes, she
recovered.  you saw her last night, and know how much recovered she is.
she is not violent, it is true, but she lives in darkness.  she believes
that she is waiting for dave walsh, and so she waits in the cabin he
built for her.  she is no longer fickle.  it is nine years now that she
has been faithful to dave walsh, and the outlook is that she’ll be
faithful to him to the end.”

lon mcfane pulled down the top of the blankets and prepared to crawl in.

“we have her grub hauled to her each year,” he added, “and in general
keep an eye on her.  last night was the first time she ever recognized
me, though.”

“who are the we?” i asked.

“oh,” was the answer, “the count and old victor chauvet and me.  do you
know, i think the count is the one to be really sorry for.  dave walsh
never did know that she was false to him.  and she does not suffer.  her
darkness is merciful to her.”

i lay silently under the blankets for the space of a minute.

“is the count still in the country?” i asked.

but there was a gentle sound of heavy breathing, and i knew lon mcfane
was asleep.




the passing of marcus o’brien


“it is the judgment of this court that you vamose the camp . . . in the
customary way, sir, in the customary way.”

judge marcus o’brien was absent-minded, and mucluc charley nudged him in
the ribs.  marcus o’brien cleared his throat and went on—

“weighing the gravity of the offence, sir, and the extenuating
circumstances, it is the opinion of this court, and its verdict, that you
be outfitted with three days’ grub.  that will do, i think.”

arizona jack cast a bleak glance out over the yukon.  it was a swollen,
chocolate flood, running a mile wide and nobody knew how deep.  the
earth-bank on which he stood was ordinarily a dozen feet above the water,
but the river was now growling at the top of the bank, devouring, instant
by instant, tiny portions of the top-standing soil.  these portions went
into the gaping mouths of the endless army of brown swirls and vanished
away.  several inches more, and red cow would be flooded.

“it won’t do,” arizona jack said bitterly.  “three days’ grub ain’t
enough.”

“there was manchester,” marcus o’brien replied gravely.  “he didn’t get
any grub.”

“and they found his remains grounded on the lower river an’ half eaten by
huskies,” was arizona jack’s retort.  “and his killin’ was without
provocation.  joe deeves never did nothin’, never warbled once, an’ jes’
because his stomach was out of order, manchester ups an’ plugs him.  you
ain’t givin’ me a square deal, o’brien, i tell you that straight.  give
me a week’s grub, and i play even to win out.  three days’ grub, an’ i
cash in.”

“what for did you kill ferguson?” o’brien demanded.  “i haven’t any
patience for these unprovoked killings.  and they’ve got to stop.  red
cow’s none so populous.  it’s a good camp, and there never used to be any
killings.  now they’re epidemic.  i’m sorry for you, jack, but you’ve got
to be made an example of.  ferguson didn’t provoke enough for a killing.”

“provoke!” arizona jack snorted.  “i tell you, o’brien, you don’t savve.
you ain’t got no artistic sensibilities.  what for did i kill ferguson?
what for did ferguson sing ‘then i wisht i was a little bird’?  that’s
what i want to know.  answer me that.  what for did he sing ‘little bird,
little bird’?  one little bird was enough.  i could a-stood one little
bird.  but no, he must sing two little birds.  i gave ’m a chanst.  i
went to him almighty polite and requested him kindly to discard one
little bird.  i pleaded with him.  there was witnesses that testified to
that.

“an’ ferguson was no jay-throated songster,” some one spoke up from the
crowd.

o’brien betrayed indecision.

“ain’t a man got a right to his artistic feelin’s?” arizona jack
demanded.  “i gave ferguson warnin’.  it was violatin’ my own nature to
go on listening to his little birds.  why, there’s music sharps that
fine-strung an’ keyed-up they’d kill for heaps less’n i did.  i’m willin’
to pay for havin’ artistic feelin’s.  i can take my medicine an’ lick the
spoon, but three days’ grub is drawin’ it a shade fine, that’s all, an’ i
hereby register my kick.  go on with the funeral.”

o’brien was still wavering.  he glanced inquiringly at mucluc charley.

“i should say, judge, that three days’ grub was a mite severe,” the
latter suggested; “but you’re runnin’ the show.  when we elected you
judge of this here trial court, we agreed to abide by your decisions, an’
we’ve done it, too, b’gosh, an’ we’re goin’ to keep on doin’ it.”

“mebbe i’ve been a trifle harsh, jack,” o’brien said apologetically—“i’m
that worked up over those killings; an’ i’m willing to make it a week’s
grub.”  he cleared his throat magisterially and looked briskly about him.
“and now we might as well get along and finish up the business.  the
boat’s ready.  you go and get the grub, leclaire.  we’ll settle for it
afterward.”

arizona jack looked grateful, and, muttering something about “damned
little birds,” stepped aboard the open boat that rubbed restlessly
against the bank.  it was a large skiff, built of rough pine planks that
had been sawed by hand from the standing timber of lake linderman, a few
hundred miles above, at the foot of chilcoot.  in the boat were a pair of
oars and arizona jack’s blankets.  leclaire brought the grub, tied up in
a flour-sack, and put it on board.  as he did so, he whispered—“i gave
you good measure, jack.  you done it with provocation.”

“cast her off!” arizona jack cried.

somebody untied the painter and threw it in.  the current gripped the
boat and whirled it away.  the murderer did not bother with the oars,
contenting himself with sitting in the stern-sheets and rolling a
cigarette.  completing it, he struck a match and lighted up.  those that
watched on the bank could see the tiny puffs of smoke.  they remained on
the bank till the boat swung out of sight around the bend half a mile
below.  justice had been done.

the denizens of red cow imposed the law and executed sentences without
the delays that mark the softness of civilization.  there was no law on
the yukon save what they made for themselves.  they were compelled to
make it for themselves.  it was in an early day that red cow flourished
on the yukon—1887—and the klondike and its populous stampedes lay in the
unguessed future.  the men of red cow did not even know whether their
camp was situated in alaska or in the north-west territory, whether they
drew breath under the stars and stripes or under the british flag.  no
surveyor had ever happened along to give them their latitude and
longitude.  red cow was situated somewhere along the yukon, and that was
sufficient for them.  so far as flags were concerned, they were beyond
all jurisdiction.  so far as the law was concerned, they were in no-man’s
land.

they made their own law, and it was very simple.  the yukon executed
their decrees.  some two thousand miles below red cow the yukon flowed
into bering sea through a delta a hundred miles wide.  every mile of
those two thousand miles was savage wilderness.  it was true, where the
porcupine flowed into the yukon inside the arctic circle there was a
hudson bay company trading post.  but that was many hundreds of miles
away.  also, it was rumoured that many hundreds of miles farther on there
were missions.  this last, however, was merely rumour; the men of red cow
had never been there.  they had entered the lone land by way of chilcoot
and the head-waters of the yukon.

the men of red cow ignored all minor offences.  to be drunk and
disorderly and to use vulgar language were looked upon as natural and
inalienable rights.  the men of red cow were individualists, and
recognized as sacred but two things, property and life.  there were no
women present to complicate their simple morality.  there were only three
log-cabins in red cow—the majority of the population of forty men living
in tents or brush shacks; and there was no jail in which to confine
malefactors, while the inhabitants were too busy digging gold or seeking
gold to take a day off and build a jail.  besides, the paramount question
of grub negatived such a procedure.  wherefore, when a man violated the
rights of property or life, he was thrown into an open boat and started
down the yukon.  the quantity of grub he received was proportioned to the
gravity of the offence.  thus, a common thief might get as much as two
weeks’ grub; an uncommon thief might get no more than half of that.  a
murderer got no grub at all.  a man found guilty of manslaughter would
receive grub for from three days to a week.  and marcus o’brien had been
elected judge, and it was he who apportioned the grub.  a man who broke
the law took his chances.  the yukon swept him away, and he might or
might not win to bering sea.  a few days’ grub gave him a fighting
chance.  no grub meant practically capital punishment, though there was a
slim chance, all depending on the season of the year.

having disposed of arizona jack and watched him out of sight, the
population turned from the bank and went to work on its claims—all except
curly jim, who ran the one faro layout in all the northland and who
speculated in prospect-holes on the sides.  two things happened that day
that were momentous.  in the late morning marcus o’brien struck it.  he
washed out a dollar, a dollar and a half, and two dollars, from three
successive pans.  he had found the streak.  curly jim looked into the
hole, washed a few pans himself, and offered o’brien ten thousand dollars
for all rights—five thousand in dust, and, in lieu of the other five
thousand, a half interest in his faro layout.  o’brien refused the offer.
he was there to make money out of the earth, he declared with heat, and
not out of his fellow-men.  and anyway, he didn’t like faro.  besides, he
appraised his strike at a whole lot more than ten thousand.

the second event of moment occurred in the afternoon, when siskiyou
pearly ran his boat into the bank and tied up.  he was fresh from the
outside, and had in his possession a four-months-old newspaper.
furthermore, he had half a dozen barrels of whisky, all consigned to
curly jim.  the men of red cow quit work.  they sampled the whisky—at a
dollar a drink, weighed out on curly’s scales; and they discussed the
news.  and all would have been well, had not curly jim conceived a
nefarious scheme, which was, namely, first to get marcus o’brien drunk,
and next, to buy his mine from him.

the first half of the scheme worked beautifully.  it began in the early
evening, and by nine o’clock o’brien had reached the singing stage.  he
clung with one arm around curly jim’s neck, and even essayed the late
lamented ferguson’s song about the little birds.  he considered he was
quite safe in this, what of the fact that the only man in camp with
artistic feelings was even then speeding down the yukon on the breast of
a five-mile current.

but the second half of the scheme failed to connect.  no matter how much
whisky was poured down his neck, o’brien could not be brought to realize
that it was his bounden and friendly duty to sell his claim.  he
hesitated, it is true, and trembled now and again on the verge of giving
in.  inside his muddled head, however, he was chuckling to himself.  he
was up to curly jim’s game, and liked the hands that were being dealt
him.  the whisky was good.  it came out of one special barrel, and was
about a dozen times better than that in the other five barrels.

siskiyou pearly was dispensing drinks in the bar-room to the remainder of
the population of red cow, while o’brien and curly had out their business
orgy in the kitchen.  but there was nothing small about o’brien.  he went
into the bar-room and returned with mucluc charley and percy leclaire.

“business ’sociates of mine, business ’sociates,” he announced, with a
broad wink to them and a guileless grin to curly.  “always trust their
judgment, always trust ’em.  they’re all right.  give ’em some
fire-water, curly, an’ le’s talk it over.”

this was ringing in; but curly jim, making a swift revaluation of the
claim, and remembering that the last pan he washed had turned out seven
dollars, decided that it was worth the extra whisky, even if it was
selling in the other room at a dollar a drink.

“i’m not likely to consider,” o’brien was hiccoughing to his two friends
in the course of explaining to them the question at issue.  “who?
me?—sell for ten thousand dollars!  no indeed.  i’ll dig the gold myself,
an’ then i’m goin’ down to god’s country—southern california—that’s the
place for me to end my declinin’ days—an’ then i’ll start . . . as i said
before, then i’ll start . . . what did i say i was goin’ to start?”

“ostrich farm,” mucluc charley volunteered.

“sure, just what i’m goin’ to start.”  o’brien abruptly steadied himself
and looked with awe at mucluc charley.  “how did you know?  never said
so.  jes’ thought i said so.  you’re a min’ reader, charley.  le’s have
another.”

curly jim filled the glasses and had the pleasure of seeing four dollars’
worth of whisky disappear, one dollar’s worth of which he punished
himself—o’brien insisted that he should drink as frequently as his
guests.

“better take the money now,” leclaire argued.  “take you two years to dig
it out the hole, an’ all that time you might be hatchin’ teeny little
baby ostriches an’ pulling feathers out the big ones.”

o’brien considered the proposition and nodded approval.  curly jim looked
gratefully at leclaire and refilled the glasses.

“hold on there!” spluttered mucluc charley, whose tongue was beginning to
wag loosely and trip over itself.  “as your father confessor—there i
go—as your brother—o hell!”  he paused and collected himself for another
start.  “as your frien’—business frien’, i should say, i would suggest,
rather—i would take the liberty, as it was, to mention—i mean, suggest,
that there may be more ostriches . . . o hell!”  he downed another glass,
and went on more carefully.  “what i’m drivin’ at is . . . what am i
drivin’ at?”  he smote the side of his head sharply half a dozen times
with the heel of his palm to shake up his ideas.  “i got it!” he cried
jubilantly.  “supposen there’s slathers more’n ten thousand dollars in
that hole!”

o’brien, who apparently was all ready to close the bargain, switched
about.

“great!” he cried.  “splen’d idea.  never thought of it all by myself.”
he took mucluc charley warmly by the hand.  “good frien’!  good
’s’ciate!”  he turned belligerently on curly jim.  “maybe hundred
thousand dollars in that hole.  you wouldn’t rob your old frien’, would
you, curly?  course you wouldn’t.  i know you—better’n yourself, better’n
yourself.  le’s have another: we’re good frien’s, all of us, i say, all
of us.”

and so it went, and so went the whisky, and so went curly jim’s hopes up
and down.  now leclaire argued in favour of immediate sale, and almost
won the reluctant o’brien over, only to lose him to the more brilliant
counter-argument of mucluc charley.  and again, it was mucluc charley who
presented convincing reasons for the sale and percy leclaire who held
stubbornly back.  a little later it was o’brien himself who insisted on
selling, while both friends, with tears and curses, strove to dissuade
him.  the more whiskey they downed, the more fertile of imagination they
became.  for one sober pro or con they found a score of drunken ones; and
they convinced one another so readily that they were perpetually changing
sides in the argument.

the time came when both mucluc charley and leclaire were firmly set upon
the sale, and they gleefully obliterated o’brien’s objections as fast as
he entered them.  o’brien grew desperate.  he exhausted his last argument
and sat speechless.  he looked pleadingly at the friends who had deserted
him.  he kicked mucluc charley’s shins under the table, but that
graceless hero immediately unfolded a new and most logical reason for the
sale.  curly jim got pen and ink and paper and wrote out the bill of
sale.  o’brien sat with pen poised in hand.

“le’s have one more,” he pleaded.  “one more before i sign away a hundred
thousan’ dollars.”

curly jim filled the glasses triumphantly.  o’brien downed his drink and
bent forward with wobbling pen to affix his signature.  before he had
made more than a blot, he suddenly started up, impelled by the impact of
an idea colliding with his consciousness.  he stood upon his feet and
swayed back and forth before them, reflecting in his startled eyes the
thought process that was taking place behind.  then he reached his
conclusion.  a benevolent radiance suffused his countenance.  he turned
to the faro dealer, took his hand, and spoke solemnly.

“curly, you’re my frien’.  there’s my han’.  shake.  ol’ man, i won’t do
it.  won’t sell.  won’t rob a frien’.  no son-of-a-gun will ever have
chance to say marcus o’brien robbed frien’ cause frien’ was drunk.
you’re drunk, curly, an’ i won’t rob you.  jes’ had thought—never thought
it before—don’t know what the matter ’ith me, but never thought it
before.  suppose, jes’ suppose, curly, my ol’ frien’, jes’ suppose there
ain’t ten thousan’ in whole damn claim.  you’d be robbed.  no, sir; won’t
do it.  marcus o’brien makes money out of the groun’, not out of his
frien’s.”

percy leclaire and mucluc charley drowned the faro dealer’s objections in
applause for so noble a sentiment.  they fell upon o’brien from either
side, their arms lovingly about his neck, their mouths so full of words
they could not hear curly’s offer to insert a clause in the document to
the effect that if there weren’t ten thousand in the claim he would be
given back the difference between yield and purchase price.  the longer
they talked the more maudlin and the more noble the discussion became.
all sordid motives were banished.  they were a trio of philanthropists
striving to save curly jim from himself and his own philanthropy.  they
insisted that he was a philanthropist.  they refused to accept for a
moment that there could be found one ignoble thought in all the world.
they crawled and climbed and scrambled over high ethical plateaux and
ranges, or drowned themselves in metaphysical seas of sentimentality.

curly jim sweated and fumed and poured out the whisky.  he found himself
with a score of arguments on his hands, not one of which had anything to
do with the gold-mine he wanted to buy.  the longer they talked the
farther away they got from that gold-mine, and at two in the morning
curly jim acknowledged himself beaten.  one by one he led his helpless
guests across the kitchen floor and thrust them outside.  o’brien came
last, and the three, with arms locked for mutual aid, titubated gravely
on the stoop.

“good business man, curly,” o’brien was saying.  “must say like your
style—fine an’ generous, free-handed hospital . . . hospital . . .
hospitality.  credit to you.  nothin’ base ’n graspin’ in your make-up.
as i was sayin’—”

but just then the faro dealer slammed the door.

the three laughed happily on the stoop.  they laughed for a long time.
then mucluc charley essayed speech.

“funny—laughed so hard—ain’t what i want to say.  my idea is . . . what
wash it?  oh, got it!  funny how ideas slip.  elusive idea—chasin’
elusive idea—great sport.  ever chase rabbits, percy, my frien’?  i had
dog—great rabbit dog.  whash ’is name?  don’t know name—never had no
name—forget name—elusive name—chasin’ elusive name—no, idea—elusive idea,
but got it—what i want to say was—o hell!”

thereafter there was silence for a long time.  o’brien slipped from their
arms to a sitting posture on the stoop, where he slept gently.  mucluc
charley chased the elusive idea through all the nooks and crannies of his
drowning consciousness.  leclaire hung fascinated upon the delayed
utterance.  suddenly the other’s hand smote him on the back.

“got it!” mucluc charley cried in stentorian tones.

the shock of the jolt broke the continuity of leclaire’s mental process.

“how much to the pan?” he demanded.

“pan nothin’!” mucluc charley was angry.  “idea—got it—got leg-hold—ran
it down.”

leclaire’s face took on a rapt, admiring expression, and again he hung
upon the other’s lips.

“ . . . o hell!” said mucluc charley.

at this moment the kitchen door opened for an instant, and curly jim
shouted, “go home!”

“funny,” said mucluc charley.  “shame idea—very shame as mine.  le’s go
home.”

they gathered o’brien up between them and started.  mucluc charley began
aloud the pursuit of another idea.  leclaire followed the pursuit with
enthusiasm.  but o’brien did not follow it.  he neither heard, nor saw,
nor knew anything.  he was a mere wobbling automaton, supported
affectionately and precariously by his two business associates.

they took the path down by the bank of the yukon.  home did not lie that
way, but the elusive idea did.  mucluc charley giggled over the idea that
he could not catch for the edification of leclaire.  they came to where
siskiyou pearly’s boat lay moored to the bank.  the rope with which it
was tied ran across the path to a pine stump.  they tripped over it and
went down, o’brien underneath.  a faint flash of consciousness lighted
his brain.  he felt the impact of bodies upon his and struck out madly
for a moment with his fists.  then he went to sleep again.  his gentle
snore arose on the air, and mucluc charley began to giggle.

“new idea,” he volunteered, “brand new idea.  jes’ caught it—no trouble
at all.  came right up an’ i patted it on the head.  it’s mine.  ’brien’s
drunk—beashly drunk.  shame—damn shame—learn’m lesshon.  trash pearly’s
boat.  put ’brien in pearly’s boat.  casht off—let her go down yukon.
’brien wake up in mornin’.  current too strong—can’t row boat ’gainst
current—mush walk back.  come back madder ’n hatter.  you an’ me headin’
for tall timber.  learn ’m lesshon jes’ shame, learn ’m lesshon.”

siskiyou pearly’s boat was empty, save for a pair of oars.  its gunwale
rubbed against the bank alongside of o’brien.  they rolled him over into
it.  mucluc charley cast off the painter, and leclaire shoved the boat
out into the current.  then, exhausted by their labours, they lay down on
the bank and slept.

next morning all red cow knew of the joke that had been played on marcus
o’brien.  there were some tall bets as to what would happen to the two
perpetrators when the victim arrived back.  in the afternoon a lookout
was set, so that they would know when he was sighted.  everybody wanted
to see him come in.  but he didn’t come, though they sat up till
midnight.  nor did he come next day, nor the next.  red cow never saw
marcus o’brien again, and though many conjectures were entertained, no
certain clue was ever gained to dispel the mystery of his passing.

                                * * * * *

only marcus o’brien knew, and he never came back to tell.  he awoke next
morning in torment.  his stomach had been calcined by the inordinate
quantity of whisky he had drunk, and was a dry and raging furnace.  his
head ached all over, inside and out; and, worse than that, was the pain
in his face.  for six hours countless thousands of mosquitoes had fed
upon him, and their ungrateful poison had swollen his face tremendously.
it was only by a severe exertion of will that he was able to open narrow
slits in his face through which he could peer.  he happened to move his
hands, and they hurt.  he squinted at them, but failed to recognize them,
so puffed were they by the mosquito virus.  he was lost, or rather, his
identity was lost to him.  there was nothing familiar about him, which,
by association of ideas, would cause to rise in his consciousness the
continuity of his existence.  he was divorced utterly from his past, for
there was nothing about him to resurrect in his consciousness a memory of
that past.  besides, he was so sick and miserable that he lacked energy
and inclination to seek after who and what he was.

it was not until he discovered a crook in a little finger, caused by an
unset breakage of years before, that he knew himself to be marcus
o’brien.  on the instant his past rushed into his consciousness.  when he
discovered a blood-blister under a thumb-nail, which he had received the
previous week, his self-identification became doubly sure, and he knew
that those unfamiliar hands belonged to marcus o’brien, or, just as much
to the point, that marcus o’brien belonged to the hands.  his first
thought was that he was ill—that he had had river fever.  it hurt him so
much to open his eyes that he kept them closed.  a small floating branch
struck the boat a sharp rap.  he thought it was some one knocking on the
cabin door, and said, “come in.”  he waited for a while, and then said
testily, “stay out, then, damn you.”  but just the same he wished they
would come in and tell him about his illness.

but as he lay there, the past night began to reconstruct itself in his
brain.  he hadn’t been sick at all, was his thought; he had merely been
drunk, and it was time for him to get up and go to work.  work suggested
his mine, and he remembered that he had refused ten thousand dollars for
it.  he sat up abruptly and squeezed open his eyes.  he saw himself in a
boat, floating on the swollen brown flood of the yukon.  the
spruce-covered shores and islands were unfamiliar.  he was stunned for a
time.  he couldn’t make it out.  he could remember the last night’s orgy,
but there was no connection between that and his present situation.

he closed his eyes and held his aching head in his hands.  what had
happened?  slowly the dreadful thought arose in his mind.  he fought
against it, strove to drive it away, but it persisted: he had killed
somebody.  that alone could explain why he was in an open boat drifting
down the yukon.  the law of red cow that he had so long administered had
now been administered to him.  he had killed some one and been set
adrift.  but whom?  he racked his aching brain for the answer, but all
that came was a vague memory of bodies falling upon him and of striking
out at them.  who were they?  maybe he had killed more than one.  he
reached to his belt.  the knife was missing from its sheath.  he had done
it with that undoubtedly.  but there must have been some reason for the
killing.  he opened his eyes and in a panic began to search about the
boat.  there was no grub, not an ounce of grub.  he sat down with a
groan.  he had killed without provocation.  the extreme rigour of the law
had been visited upon him.

for half an hour he remained motionless, holding his aching head and
trying to think.  then he cooled his stomach with a drink of water from
overside and felt better.  he stood up, and alone on the wide-stretching
yukon, with naught but the primeval wilderness to hear, he cursed strong
drink.  after that he tied up to a huge floating pine that was deeper
sunk in the current than the boat and that consequently drifted faster.
he washed his face and hands, sat down in the stern-sheets, and did some
more thinking.  it was late in june.  it was two thousand miles to bering
sea.  the boat was averaging five miles an hour.  there was no darkness
in such high latitudes at that time of the year, and he could run the
river every hour of the twenty-four.  this would mean, daily, a hundred
and twenty miles.  strike out the twenty for accidents, and there
remained a hundred miles a day.  in twenty days he would reach bering
sea.  and this would involve no expenditure of energy; the river did the
work.  he could lie down in the bottom of the boat and husband his
strength.

for two days he ate nothing.  then, drifting into the yukon flats, he
went ashore on the low-lying islands and gathered the eggs of wild geese
and ducks.  he had no matches, and ate the eggs raw.  they were strong,
but they kept him going.  when he crossed the arctic circle, he found the
hudson bay company’s post.  the brigade had not yet arrived from the
mackenzie, and the post was completely out of grub.  he was offered
wild-duck eggs, but he informed them that he had a bushel of the same on
the boat.  he was also offered a drink of whisky, which he refused with
an exhibition of violent repugnance.  he got matches, however, and after
that he cooked his eggs.  toward the mouth of the river head-winds
delayed him, and he was twenty-four days on the egg diet.  unfortunately,
while asleep he had drifted by both the missions of st. paul and holy
cross.  and he could sincerely say, as he afterward did, that talk about
missions on the yukon was all humbug.  there weren’t any missions, and he
was the man to know.

once on bering sea he exchanged the egg diet for seal diet, and he never
could make up his mind which he liked least.  in the fall of the year he
was rescued by a united states revenue cutter, and the following winter
he made quite a hit in san francisco as a temperance lecturer.  in this
field he found his vocation.  “avoid the bottle” is his slogan and
battle-cry.  he manages subtly to convey the impression that in his own
life a great disaster was wrought by the bottle.  he has even mentioned
the loss of a fortune that was caused by that hell-bait of the devil, but
behind that incident his listeners feel the loom of some terrible and
unguessed evil for which the bottle is responsible.  he has made a
success in his vocation, and has grown grey and respected in the crusade
against strong drink.  but on the yukon the passing of marcus o’brien
remains tradition.  it is a mystery that ranks at par with the
disappearance of sir john franklin.




the wit of porportuk


el-soo had been a mission girl.  her mother had died when she was very
small, and sister alberta had plucked el-soo as a brand from the burning,
one summer day, and carried her away to holy cross mission and dedicated
her to god.  el-soo was a full-blooded indian, yet she exceeded all the
half-breed and quarter-breed girls.  never had the good sisters dealt
with a girl so adaptable and at the same time so spirited.

el-soo was quick, and deft, and intelligent; but above all she was fire,
the living flame of life, a blaze of personality that was compounded of
will, sweetness, and daring.  her father was a chief, and his blood ran
in her veins.  obedience, on the part of el-soo, was a matter of terms
and arrangement.  she had a passion for equity, and perhaps it was
because of this that she excelled in mathematics.

but she excelled in other things.  she learned to read and write english
as no girl had ever learned in the mission.  she led the girls in
singing, and into song she carried her sense of equity.  she was an
artist, and the fire of her flowed toward creation.  had she from birth
enjoyed a more favourable environment, she would have made literature or
music.

instead, she was el-soo, daughter of klakee-nah, a chief, and she lived
in the holy cross mission where were no artists, but only pure-souled
sisters who were interested in cleanliness and righteousness and the
welfare of the spirit in the land of immortality that lay beyond the
skies.

the years passed.  she was eight years old when she entered the mission;
she was sixteen, and the sisters were corresponding with their superiors
in the order concerning the sending of el-soo to the united states to
complete her education, when a man of her own tribe arrived at holy cross
and had talk with her.  el-soo was somewhat appalled by him.  he was
dirty.  he was a caliban-like creature, primitively ugly, with a mop of
hair that had never been combed.  he looked at her disapprovingly and
refused to sit down.

“thy brother is dead,” he said shortly.

el-soo was not particularly shocked.  she remembered little of her
brother.  “thy father is an old man, and alone,” the messenger went on.
“his house is large and empty, and he would hear thy voice and look upon
thee.”

him she remembered—klakee-nah, the headman of the village, the friend of
the missionaries and the traders, a large man thewed like a giant, with
kindly eyes and masterful ways, and striding with a consciousness of
crude royalty in his carriage.

“tell him that i will come,” was el-soo’s answer.

much to the despair of the sisters, the brand plucked from the burning
went back to the burning.  all pleading with el-soo was vain.  there was
much argument, expostulation, and weeping.  sister alberta even revealed
to her the project of sending her to the united states.  el-soo stared
wide-eyed into the golden vista thus opened up to her, and shook her
head.  in her eyes persisted another vista.  it was the mighty curve of
the yukon at tana-naw station.  with the st. george mission on one side,
and the trading post on the other, and midway between the indian village
and a certain large log house where lived an old man tended upon by
slaves.

all dwellers on the yukon bank for twice a thousand miles knew the large
log house, the old man and the tending slaves; and well did the sisters
know the house, its unending revelry, its feasting and its fun.  so there
was weeping at holy cross when el-soo departed.

there was a great cleaning up in the large house when el-soo arrived.
klakee-nah, himself masterful, protested at this masterful conduct of his
young daughter; but in the end, dreaming barbarically of magnificence, he
went forth and borrowed a thousand dollars from old porportuk, than whom
there was no richer indian on the yukon.  also, klakee-nah ran up a heavy
bill at the trading post.  el-soo re-created the large house.  she
invested it with new splendour, while klakee-nah maintained its ancient
traditions of hospitality and revelry.

all this was unusual for a yukon indian, but klakee-nah was an unusual
indian.  not alone did he like to render inordinate hospitality, but,
what of being a chief and of acquiring much money, he was able to do it.
in the primitive trading days he had been a power over his people, and he
had dealt profitably with the white trading companies.  later on, with
porportuk, he had made a gold-strike on the koyokuk river.  klakee-nah
was by training and nature an aristocrat.  porportuk was bourgeois, and
porportuk bought him out of the gold-mine.  porportuk was content to plod
and accumulate.  klakee-nah went back to his large house and proceeded to
spend.  porportuk was known as the richest indian in alaska.  klakee-nah
was known as the whitest.  porportuk was a money-lender and a usurer.
klakee-nah was an anachronism—a mediæval ruin, a fighter and a feaster,
happy with wine and song.

el-soo adapted herself to the large house and its ways as readily as she
had adapted herself to holy cross mission and its ways.  she did not try
to reform her father and direct his footsteps toward god.  it is true,
she reproved him when he drank overmuch and profoundly, but that was for
the sake of his health and the direction of his footsteps on solid earth.

the latchstring to the large house was always out.  what with the coming
and the going, it was never still.  the rafters of the great living-room
shook with the roar of wassail and of song.  at table sat men from all
the world and chiefs from distant tribes—englishmen and colonials, lean
yankee traders and rotund officials of the great companies, cowboys from
the western ranges, sailors from the sea, hunters and dog-mushers of a
score of nationalities.

el-soo drew breath in a cosmopolitan atmosphere.  she could speak english
as well as she could her native tongue, and she sang english songs and
ballads.  the passing indian ceremonials she knew, and the perishing
traditions.  the tribal dress of the daughter of a chief she knew how to
wear upon occasion.  but for the most part she dressed as white women
dress.  not for nothing was her needlework at the mission and her innate
artistry.  she carried her clothes like a white woman, and she made
clothes that could be so carried.

in her way she was as unusual as her father, and the position she
occupied was as unique as his.  she was the one indian woman who was the
social equal with the several white women at tana-naw station.  she was
the one indian woman to whom white men honourably made proposals of
marriage.  and she was the one indian woman whom no white man ever
insulted.

for el-soo was beautiful—not as white women are beautiful, not as indian
women are beautiful.  it was the flame of her, that did not depend upon
feature, that was her beauty.  so far as mere line and feature went, she
was the classic indian type.  the black hair and the fine bronze were
hers, and the black eyes, brilliant and bold, keen as sword-light, proud;
and hers the delicate eagle nose with the thin, quivering nostrils, the
high cheek-bones that were not broad apart, and the thin lips that were
not too thin.  but over all and through all poured the flame of her—the
unanalysable something that was fire and that was the soul of her, that
lay mellow-warm or blazed in her eyes, that sprayed the cheeks of her,
that distended the nostrils, that curled the lips, or, when the lip was
in repose, that was still there in the lip, the lip palpitant with its
presence.

and el-soo had wit—rarely sharp to hurt, yet quick to search out
forgivable weakness.  the laughter of her mind played like lambent flame
over all about her, and from all about her arose answering laughter.  yet
she was never the centre of things.  this she would not permit.  the
large house, and all of which it was significant, was her father’s; and
through it, to the last, moved his heroic figure—host, master of the
revels, and giver of the law.  it is true, as the strength oozed from
him, that she caught up responsibilities from his failing hands.  but in
appearance he still ruled, dozing, ofttimes at the board, a bacchanalian
ruin, yet in all seeming the ruler of the feast.

and through the large house moved the figure of porportuk, ominous, with
shaking head, coldly disapproving, paying for it all.  not that he really
paid, for he compounded interest in weird ways, and year by year absorbed
the properties of klakee-nah.  porportuk once took it upon himself to
chide el-soo upon the wasteful way of life in the large house—it was when
he had about absorbed the last of klakee-nah’s wealth—but he never
ventured so to chide again.  el-soo, like her father, was an aristocrat,
as disdainful of money as he, and with an equal sense of honour as finely
strung.

porportuk continued grudgingly to advance money, and ever the money
flowed in golden foam away.  upon one thing el-soo was resolved—her
father should die as he had lived.  there should be for him no passing
from high to low, no diminution of the revels, no lessening of the lavish
hospitality.  when there was famine, as of old, the indians came groaning
to the large house and went away content.  when there was famine and no
money, money was borrowed from porportuk, and the indians still went away
content.  el-soo might well have repeated, after the aristocrats of
another time and place, that after her came the deluge.  in her case the
deluge was old porportuk.  with every advance of money, he looked upon
her with a more possessive eye, and felt bourgeoning within him ancient
fires.

but el-soo had no eyes for him.  nor had she eyes for the white men who
wanted to marry her at the mission with ring and priest and book.  for at
tana-naw station was a young man, akoon, of her own blood, and tribe, and
village.  he was strong and beautiful to her eyes, a great hunter, and,
in that he had wandered far and much, very poor; he had been to all the
unknown wastes and places; he had journeyed to sitka and to the united
states; he had crossed the continent to hudson bay and back again, and as
seal-hunter on a ship he had sailed to siberia and for japan.

when he returned from the gold-strike in klondike he came, as was his
wont, to the large house to make report to old klakee-nah of all the
world that he had seen; and there he first saw el-soo, three years back
from the mission.  thereat, akoon wandered no more.  he refused a wage of
twenty dollars a day as pilot on the big steamboats.  he hunted some and
fished some, but never far from tana-naw station, and he was at the large
house often and long.  and el-soo measured him against many men and found
him good.  he sang songs to her, and was ardent and glowed until all
tana-naw station knew he loved her.  and porportuk but grinned and
advanced more money for the upkeep of the large house.

then came the death table of klakee-nah.

he sat at feast, with death in his throat, that he could not drown with
wine.  and laughter and joke and song went around, and akoon told a story
that made the rafters echo.  there were no tears or sighs at that table.
it was no more than fit that klakee-nah should die as he had lived, and
none knew this better than el-soo, with her artist sympathy.  the old
roystering crowd was there, and, as of old, three frost-bitten sailors
were there, fresh from the long traverse from the arctic, survivors of a
ship’s company of seventy-four.  at klakee-nah’s back were four old men,
all that were left him of the slaves of his youth.  with rheumy eyes they
saw to his needs, with palsied hands filling his glass or striking him on
the back between the shoulders when death stirred and he coughed and
gasped.

it was a wild night, and as the hours passed and the fun laughed and
roared along, death stirred more restlessly in klakee-nah’s throat.  then
it was that he sent for porportuk.  and porportuk came in from the
outside frost to look with disapproving eyes upon the meat and wine on
the table for which he had paid.  but as he looked down the length of
flushed faces to the far end and saw the face of el-soo, the light in his
eyes flared up, and for a moment the disapproval vanished.

place was made for him at klakee-nah’s side, and a glass placed before
him.  klakee-nah, with his own hands, filled the glass with fervent
spirits.  “drink!” he cried.  “is it not good?”

and porportuk’s eyes watered as he nodded his head and smacked his lips.

“when, in your own house, have you had such drink?” klakee-nah demanded.

“i will not deny that the drink is good to this old throat of mine,”
porportuk made answer, and hesitated for the speech to complete the
thought.

“but it costs overmuch,” klakee-nah roared, completing it for him.

porportuk winced at the laughter that went down the table.  his eyes
burned malevolently.  “we were boys together, of the same age,” he said.
“in your throat is death.  i am still alive and strong.”

an ominous murmur arose from the company.  klakee-nah coughed and
strangled, and the old slaves smote him between the shoulders.  he
emerged gasping, and waved his hand to still the threatening rumble.

“you have grudged the very fire in your house because the wood cost
overmuch!” he cried.  “you have grudged life.  to live cost overmuch, and
you have refused to pay the price.  your life has been like a cabin where
the fire is out and there are no blankets on the floor.”  he signalled to
a slave to fill his glass, which he held aloft.  “but i have lived.  and
i have been warm with life as you have never been warm.  it is true, you
shall live long.  but the longest nights are the cold nights when a man
shivers and lies awake.  my nights have been short, but i have slept
warm.”

he drained the glass.  the shaking hand of a slave failed to catch it as
it crashed to the floor.  klakee-nah sank back, panting, watching the
upturned glasses at the lips of the drinkers, his own lips slightly
smiling to the applause.  at a sign, two slaves attempted to help him sit
upright again.  but they were weak, his frame was mighty, and the four
old men tottered and shook as they helped him forward.

“but manner of life is neither here nor there,” he went on.  “we have
other business, porportuk, you and i, to-night.  debts are mischances,
and i am in mischance with you.  what of my debt, and how great is it?”

porportuk searched in his pouch and brought forth a memorandum.  he
sipped at his glass and began.  “there is the note of august, 1889, for
three hundred dollars.  the interest has never been paid.  and the note
of the next year for five hundred dollars.  this note was included in the
note of two months later for a thousand dollars.  then there is the
note—”

“never mind the many notes!” klakee-nah cried out impatiently.  “they
make my head go around and all the things inside my head.  the whole!
the round whole!  how much is it?”

porportuk referred to his memorandum.  “fifteen thousand nine hundred and
sixty-seven dollars and seventy-five cents,” he read with careful
precision.

“make it sixteen thousand, make it sixteen thousand,” klakee-nah said
grandly.  “odd numbers were ever a worry.  and now—and it is for this
that i have sent for you—make me out a new note for sixteen thousand,
which i shall sign.  i have no thought of the interest.  make it as large
as you will, and make it payable in the next world, when i shall meet you
by the fire of the great father of all indians.  then the note will be
paid.  this i promise you.  it is the word of klakee-nah.”

porportuk looked perplexed, and loudly the laughter arose and shook the
room.  klakee-nah raised his hands.  “nay,” he cried.  “it is not a joke.
i but speak in fairness.  it was for this i sent for you, porportuk.
make out the note.”

“i have no dealings with the next world,” porportuk made answer slowly.

“have you no thought to meet me before the great father!” klakee-nah
demanded.  then he added, “i shall surely be there.”

“i have no dealings with the next world,” porportuk repeated sourly.

the dying man regarded him with frank amazement.

“i know naught of the next world,” porportuk explained.  “i do business
in this world.”

klakee-nah’s face cleared.  “this comes of sleeping cold of nights,” he
laughed.  he pondered for a space, then said, “it is in this world that
you must be paid.  there remains to me this house.  take it, and burn the
debt in the candle there.”

“it is an old house and not worth the money,” porportuk made answer.

“there are my mines on the twisted salmon.”

“they have never paid to work,” was the reply.

“there is my share in the steamer _koyokuk_.  i am half owner.”

“she is at the bottom of the yukon.”

klakee-nah started.  “true, i forgot.  it was last spring when the ice
went out.”  he mused for a time while the glasses remained untasted, and
all the company waited upon his utterance.

“then it would seem i owe you a sum of money which i cannot pay . . . in
this world?”  porportuk nodded and glanced down the table.

“then it would seem that you, porportuk, are a poor business man,”
klakee-nah said slyly.  and boldly porportuk made answer, “no; there is
security yet untouched.”

“what!” cried klakee-nah.  “have i still property?  name it, and it is
yours, and the debt is no more.”

“there it is.”  porportuk pointed at el-soo.

klakee-nah could not understand.  he peered down the table, brushed his
eyes, and peered again.

“your daughter, el-soo—her will i take and the debt be no more.  i will
burn the debt there in the candle.”

klakee-nah’s great chest began to heave.  “ho! ho!—a joke.  ho! ho! ho!”
he laughed homerically.  “and with your cold bed and daughters old enough
to be the mother of el-soo!  ho! ho! ho!”  he began to cough and
strangle, and the old slaves smote him on the back.  “ho! ho!” he began
again, and went off into another paroxysm.

porportuk waited patiently, sipping from his glass and studying the
double row of faces down the board.  “it is no joke,” he said finally.
“my speech is well meant.”

klakee-nah sobered and looked at him, then reached for his glass, but
could not touch it.  a slave passed it to him, and glass and liquor he
flung into the face of porportuk.

“turn him out!” klakee-nah thundered to the waiting table that strained
like a pack of hounds in leash.  “and roll him in the snow!”

as the mad riot swept past him and out of doors, he signalled to the
slaves, and the four tottering old men supported him on his feet as he
met the returning revellers, upright, glass in hand, pledging them a
toast to the short night when a man sleeps warm.

it did not take long to settle the estate of klakee-nah.  tommy, the
little englishman, clerk at the trading post, was called in by el-soo to
help.  there was nothing but debts, notes overdue, mortgaged properties,
and properties mortgaged but worthless.  notes and mortgages were held by
porportuk.  tommy called him a robber many times as he pondered the
compounding of the interest.

“is it a debt, tommy?” el-soo asked.

“it is a robbery,” tommy answered.

“nevertheless, it is a debt,” she persisted.

the winter wore away, and the early spring, and still the claims of
porportuk remained unpaid.  he saw el-soo often and explained to her at
length, as he had explained to her father, the way the debt could be
cancelled.  also, he brought with him old medicine-men, who elaborated to
her the everlasting damnation of her father if the debt were not paid.
one day, after such an elaboration, el-soo made final announcement to
porportuk.

“i shall tell you two things,” she said.  “first i shall not be your
wife.  will you remember that?  second, you shall be paid the last cent
of the sixteen thousand dollars—”

“fifteen thousand nine hundred and sixty-seven dollars and seventy-five
cents,” porportuk corrected.

“my father said sixteen thousand,” was her reply.  “you shall be paid.”

“how?”

“i know not how, but i shall find out how.  now go, and bother me no
more.  if you do”—she hesitated to find fitting penalty—“if you do, i
shall have you rolled in the snow again as soon as the first snow flies.”

this was still in the early spring, and a little later el-soo surprised
the country.  word went up and down the yukon from chilcoot to the delta,
and was carried from camp to camp to the farthermost camps, that in june,
when the first salmon ran, el-soo, daughter of klakee-nah, would sell
herself at public auction to satisfy the claims of porportuk.  vain were
the attempts to dissuade her.  the missionary at st. george wrestled with
her, but she replied—

“only the debts to god are settled in the next world.  the debts of men
are of this world, and in this world are they settled.”

akoon wrestled with her, but she replied, “i do love thee, akoon; but
honour is greater than love, and who am i that i should blacken my
father?”  sister alberta journeyed all the way up from holy cross on the
first steamer, and to no better end.

“my father wanders in the thick and endless forests,” said el-soo.  “and
there will he wander, with the lost souls crying, till the debt be paid.
then, and not until then, may he go on to the house of the great father.”

“and you believe this?” sister alberta asked.

“i do not know,” el-soo made answer.  “it was my father’s belief.”

sister alberta shrugged her shoulders incredulously.

“who knows but that the things we believe come true?” el-soo went on.
“why not?  the next world to you may be heaven and harps . . . because
you have believed heaven and harps; to my father the next world may be a
large house where he will sit always at table feasting with god.”

“and you?” sister alberta asked.  “what is your next world?”

el-soo hesitated but for a moment.  “i should like a little of both,” she
said.  “i should like to see your face as well as the face of my father.”

the day of the auction came.  tana-naw station was populous.  as was
their custom, the tribes had gathered to await the salmon-run, and in the
meantime spent the time in dancing and frolicking, trading and gossiping.
then there was the ordinary sprinkling of white adventurers, traders, and
prospectors, and, in addition, a large number of white men who had come
because of curiosity or interest in the affair.

it had been a backward spring, and the salmon were late in running.  this
delay but keyed up the interest.  then, on the day of the auction, the
situation was made tense by akoon.  he arose and made public and solemn
announcement that whosoever bought el-soo would forthwith and immediately
die.  he flourished the winchester in his hand to indicate the manner of
the taking-off.  el-soo was angered thereat; but he refused to speak with
her, and went to the trading post to lay in extra ammunition.

the first salmon was caught at ten o’clock in the evening, and at
midnight the auction began.  it took place on top of the high bank
alongside the yukon.  the sun was due north just below the horizon, and
the sky was lurid red.  a great crowd gathered about the table and the
two chairs that stood near the edge of the bank.  to the fore were many
white men and several chiefs.  and most prominently to the fore, rifle in
hand, stood akoon.  tommy, at el-soo’s request, served as auctioneer, but
she made the opening speech and described the goods about to be sold.
she was in native costume, in the dress of a chief’s daughter, splendid
and barbaric, and she stood on a chair, that she might be seen to
advantage.

“who will buy a wife?” she asked.  “look at me.  i am twenty years old
and a maid.  i will be a good wife to the man who buys me.  if he is a
white man, i shall dress in the fashion of white women; if he is an
indian, i shall dress as”—she hesitated a moment—“a squaw.  i can make my
own clothes, and sew, and wash, and mend.  i was taught for eight years
to do these things at holy cross mission.  i can read and write english,
and i know how to play the organ.  also i can do arithmetic and some
algebra—a little.  i shall be sold to the highest bidder, and to him i
will make out a bill of sale of myself.  i forgot to say that i can sing
very well, and that i have never been sick in my life.  i weigh one
hundred and thirty-two pounds; my father is dead and i have no relatives.
who wants me?”

she looked over the crowd with flaming audacity and stepped down.  at
tommy’s request she stood upon the chair again, while he mounted the
second chair and started the bidding.

surrounding el-soo stood the four old slaves of her father.  they were
age-twisted and palsied, faithful to their meat, a generation out of the
past that watched unmoved the antics of younger life.  in the front of
the crowd were several eldorado and bonanza kings from the upper yukon,
and beside them, on crutches, swollen with scurvy, were two broken
prospectors.  from the midst of the crowd, thrust out by its own
vividness, appeared the face of a wild-eyed squaw from the remote regions
of the upper tana-naw; a strayed sitkan from the coast stood side by side
with a stick from lake le barge, and, beyond, a half-dozen
french-canadian voyageurs, grouped by themselves.  from afar came the
faint cries of myriads of wild-fowl on the nesting-grounds.  swallows
were skimming up overhead from the placid surface of the yukon, and
robins were singing.  the oblique rays of the hidden sun shot through the
smoke, high-dissipated from forest fires a thousand miles away, and
turned the heavens to sombre red, while the earth shone red in the
reflected glow.  this red glow shone in the faces of all, and made
everything seem unearthly and unreal.

the bidding began slowly.  the sitkan, who was a stranger in the land and
who had arrived only half an hour before, offered one hundred dollars in
a confident voice, and was surprised when akoon turned threateningly upon
him with the rifle.  the bidding dragged.  an indian from the tozikakat,
a pilot, bid one hundred and fifty, and after some time a gambler, who
had been ordered out of the upper country, raised the bid to two hundred.
el-soo was saddened; her pride was hurt; but the only effect was that she
flamed more audaciously upon the crowd.

there was a disturbance among the onlookers as porportuk forced his way
to the front.  “five hundred dollars!” he bid in a loud voice, then
looked about him proudly to note the effect.

he was minded to use his great wealth as a bludgeon with which to stun
all competition at the start.  but one of the voyageurs, looking on
el-soo with sparkling eyes, raised the bid a hundred.

“seven hundred!” porportuk returned promptly.

and with equal promptness came the “eight hundred” of the voyageur.

then porportuk swung his club again.

“twelve hundred!” he shouted.

with a look of poignant disappointment, the voyageur succumbed.  there
was no further bidding.  tommy worked hard, but could not elicit a bid.

el-soo spoke to porportuk.  “it were good, porportuk, for you to weigh
well your bid.  have you forgotten the thing i told you—that i would
never marry you!”

“it is a public auction,” he retorted.  “i shall buy you with a bill of
sale.  i have offered twelve hundred dollars.  you come cheap.”

“too damned cheap!” tommy cried.  “what if i am auctioneer?  that does
not prevent me from bidding.  i’ll make it thirteen hundred.”

“fourteen hundred,” from porportuk.

“i’ll buy you in to be my—my sister,” tommy whispered to el-soo, then
called aloud, “fifteen hundred!”

at two thousand one of the eldorado kings took a hand, and tommy dropped
out.

a third time porportuk swung the club of his wealth, making a clean raise
of five hundred dollars.  but the eldorado king’s pride was touched.  no
man could club him.  and he swung back another five hundred.

el-soo stood at three thousand.  porportuk made it thirty-five hundred,
and gasped when the eldorado king raised it a thousand dollars.
porportuk again raised it five hundred, and again gasped when the king
raised a thousand more.

porportuk became angry.  his pride was touched; his strength was
challenged, and with him strength took the form of wealth.  he would not
be ashamed for weakness before the world.  el-soo became incidental.  the
savings and scrimpings from the cold nights of all his years were ripe to
be squandered.  el-soo stood at six thousand.  he made it seven thousand.
and then, in thousand-dollar bids, as fast as they could be uttered, her
price went up.  at fourteen thousand the two men stopped for breath.

then the unexpected happened.  a still heavier club was swung.  in the
pause that ensued, the gambler, who had scented a speculation and formed
a syndicate with several of his fellows, bid sixteen thousand dollars.

“seventeen thousand,” porportuk said weakly.

“eighteen thousand,” said the king.

porportuk gathered his strength.  “twenty thousand.”

the syndicate dropped out.  the eldorado king raised a thousand, and
porportuk raised back; and as they bid, akoon turned from one to the
other, half menacingly, half curiously, as though to see what manner of
man it was that he would have to kill.  when the king prepared to make
his next bid, akoon having pressed closer, the king first loosed the
revolver at his hip, then said:

“twenty-three thousand.”

“twenty-four thousand,” said porportuk.  he grinned viciously, for the
certitude of his bidding had at last shaken the king.  the latter moved
over close to el-soo.  he studied her carefully for a long while.

“and five hundred,” he said at last.

“twenty-five thousand,” came porportuk’s raise.

the king looked for a long space, and shook his head.  he looked again,
and said reluctantly, “and five hundred.”

“twenty-six thousand,” porportuk snapped.

the king shook his head and refused to meet tommy’s pleading eye.  in the
meantime akoon had edged close to porportuk.  el-soo’s quick eye noted
this, and, while tommy wrestled with the eldorado king for another bid,
she bent, and spoke in a low voice in the ear of a slave.  and while
tommy’s “going—going—going—” dominated the air, the slave went up to
akoon and spoke in a low voice in his ear.  akoon made no sign that he
had heard, though el-soo watched him anxiously.

“gone!” tommy’s voice rang out.  “to porportuk, for twenty-six thousand
dollars.”

porportuk glanced uneasily at akoon.  all eyes were centred upon akoon,
but he did nothing.

“let the scales be brought,” said el-soo.

“i shall make payment at my house,” said porportuk.

“let the scales be brought,” el-soo repeated.  “payment shall be made
here where all can see.”

so the gold scales were brought from the trading post, while porportuk
went away and came back with a man at his heels, on whose shoulders was a
weight of gold-dust in moose-hide sacks.  also, at porportuk’s back,
walked another man with a rifle, who had eyes only for akoon.

“here are the notes and mortgages,” said porportuk, “for fifteen thousand
nine hundred and sixty-seven dollars and seventy-five cents.”

el-soo received them into her hands and said to tommy, “let them be
reckoned as sixteen thousand.”

“there remains ten thousand dollars to be paid in gold,” tommy said.

porportuk nodded, and untied the mouths of the sacks.  el-soo, standing
at the edge of the bank, tore the papers to shreds and sent them
fluttering out over the yukon.  the weighing began, but halted.

“of course, at seventeen dollars,” porportuk had said to tommy, as he
adjusted the scales.

“at sixteen dollars,” el-soo said sharply.

“it is the custom of all the land to reckon gold at seventeen dollars for
each ounce,” porportuk replied.  “and this is a business transaction.”

el-soo laughed.  “it is a new custom,” she said.  “it began this spring.
last year, and the years before, it was sixteen dollars an ounce.  when
my father’s debt was made, it was sixteen dollars.  when he spent at the
store the money he got from you, for one ounce he was given sixteen
dollars’ worth of flour, not seventeen.  wherefore, shall you pay for me
at sixteen, and not at seventeen.”  porportuk grunted and allowed the
weighing to proceed.

“weigh it in three piles, tommy,” she said.  “a thousand dollars here,
three thousand here, and here six thousand.”

it was slow work, and, while the weighing went on, akoon was closely
watched by all.

“he but waits till the money is paid,” one said; and the word went around
and was accepted, and they waited for what akoon should do when the money
was paid.  and porportuk’s man with the rifle waited and watched akoon.

the weighing was finished, and the gold-dust lay on the table in three
dark-yellow heaps.  “there is a debt of my father to the company for
three thousand dollars,” said el-soo.  “take it, tommy, for the company.
and here are four old men, tommy.  you know them.  and here is one
thousand dollars.  take it, and see that the old men are never hungry and
never without tobacco.”

tommy scooped the gold into separate sacks.  six thousand dollars
remained on the table.  el-soo thrust the scoop into the heap, and with a
sudden turn whirled the contents out and down to the yukon in a golden
shower.  porportuk seized her wrist as she thrust the scoop a second time
into the heap.

“it is mine,” she said calmly.  porportuk released his grip, but he
gritted his teeth and scowled darkly as she continued to scoop the gold
into the river till none was left.

the crowd had eyes for naught but akoon, and the rifle of porportuk’s man
lay across the hollow of his arm, the muzzle directed at akoon a yard
away, the man’s thumb on the hammer.  but akoon did nothing.

“make out the bill of sale,” porportuk said grimly.

and tommy made out the till of sale, wherein all right and title in the
woman el-soo was vested in the man porportuk.  el-soo signed the
document, and porportuk folded it and put it away in his pouch.  suddenly
his eyes flashed, and in sudden speech he addressed el-soo.

“but it was not your father’s debt,” he said, “what i paid was the price
for you.  your sale is business of to-day and not of last year and the
years before.  the ounces paid for you will buy at the post to-day
seventeen dollars of flour, and not sixteen.  i have lost a dollar on
each ounce.  i have lost six hundred and twenty-five dollars.”

el-soo thought for a moment, and saw the error she had made.  she smiled,
and then she laughed.

“you are right,” she laughed, “i made a mistake.  but it is too late.
you have paid, and the gold is gone.  you did not think quick.  it is
your loss.  your wit is slow these days, porportuk.  you are getting
old.”

he did not answer.  he glanced uneasily at akoon, and was reassured.  his
lips tightened, and a hint of cruelty came into his face.  “come,” he
said, “we will go to my house.”

“do you remember the two things i told you in the spring?” el-soo asked,
making no movement to accompany him.

“my head would be full with the things women say, did i heed them,” he
answered.

“i told you that you would be paid,” el-soo went on carefully.  “and i
told you that i would never be your wife.”

“but that was before the bill of sale.”  porportuk crackled the paper
between his fingers inside the pouch.  “i have bought you before all the
world.  you belong to me.  you will not deny that you belong to me.”

“i belong to you,” el-soo said steadily.

“i own you.”

“you own me.”

porportuk’s voice rose slightly and triumphantly.  “as a dog, i own you.”

“as a dog you own me,” el-soo continued calmly.  “but, porportuk, you
forget the thing i told you.  had any other man bought me, i should have
been that man’s wife.  i should have been a good wife to that man.  such
was my will.  but my will with you was that i should never be your wife.
wherefore, i am your dog.”

porportuk knew that he played with fire, and he resolved to play firmly.
“then i speak to you, not as el-soo, but as a dog,” he said; “and i tell
you to come with me.”  he half reached to grip her arm, but with a
gesture she held him back.

“not so fast, porportuk.  you buy a dog.  the dog runs away.  it is your
loss.  i am your dog.  what if i run away?”

“as the owner of the dog, i shall beat you—”

“when you catch me?”

“when i catch you.”

“then catch me.”

he reached swiftly for her, but she eluded him.  she laughed as she
circled around the table.  “catch her!” porportuk commanded the indian
with the rifle, who stood near to her.  but as the indian stretched forth
his arm to her, the eldorado king felled him with a fist blow under the
ear.  the rifle clattered to the ground.  then was akoon’s chance.  his
eyes glittered, but he did nothing.

porportuk was an old man, but his cold nights retained for him his
activity.  he did not circle the table.  he came across suddenly, over
the top of the table.  el-soo was taken off her guard.  she sprang back
with a sharp cry of alarm, and porportuk would have caught her had it not
been for tommy.  tommy’s leg went out, porportuk tripped and pitched
forward on the ground.  el-soo got her start.

“then catch me,” she laughed over her shoulder, as she fled away.

she ran lightly and easily, but porportuk ran swiftly and savagely.  he
outran her.  in his youth he had been swiftest of all the young men.  but
el-soo dodged in a willowy, elusive way.  being in native dress, her feet
were not cluttered with skirts, and her pliant body curved a flight that
defied the gripping fingers of porportuk.

with laughter and tumult, the great crowd scattered out to see the chase.
it led through the indian encampment; and ever dodging, circling, and
reversing, el-soo and porportuk appeared and disappeared among the tents.
el-soo seemed to balance herself against the air with her arms, now one
side, now on the other, and sometimes her body, too, leaned out upon the
air far from the perpendicular as she achieved her sharpest curves.  and
porportuk, always a leap behind, or a leap this side or that, like a lean
hound strained after her.

they crossed the open ground beyond the encampment and disappeared in the
forest.  tana-naw station waited their reappearance, and long and vainly
it waited.

in the meantime akoon ate and slept, and lingered much at the steamboat
landing, deaf to the rising resentment of tana-naw station in that he did
nothing.  twenty-four hours later porportuk returned.  he was tired and
savage.  he spoke to no one but akoon, and with him tried to pick a
quarrel.  but akoon shrugged his shoulders and walked away.  porportuk
did not waste time.  he outfitted half a dozen of the young men,
selecting the best trackers and travellers, and at their head plunged
into the forest.

next day the steamer _seattle_, bound up river, pulled in to the shore
and wooded up.  when the lines were cast off and she churned out from the
bank, akoon was on board in the pilot-house.  not many hours afterward,
when it was his turn at the wheel, he saw a small birch-bark canoe put
off from the shore.  there was only one person in it.  he studied it
carefully, put the wheel over, and slowed down.

the captain entered the pilot-house.  “what’s the matter?” he demanded.
“the water’s good.”

akoon grunted.  he saw a larger canoe leaving the bank, and in it were a
number of persons.  as the _seattle_ lost headway, he put the wheel over
some more.

the captain fumed.  “it’s only a squaw,” he protested.

akoon did not grunt.  he was all eyes for the squaw and the pursuing
canoe.  in the latter six paddles were flashing, while the squaw paddled
slowly.

“you’ll be aground,” the captain protested, seizing the wheel.

but akoon countered his strength on the wheel and looked him in the eyes.
the captain slowly released the spokes.

“queer beggar,” he sniffed to himself.

akoon held the _seattle_ on the edge of the shoal water and waited till
he saw the squaw’s fingers clutch the forward rail.  then he signalled
for full speed ahead and ground the wheel over.  the large canoe was very
near, but the gap between it and the steamer was widening.

the squaw laughed and leaned over the rail.

“then catch me, porportuk!” she cried.

akoon left the steamer at fort yukon.  he outfitted a small poling-boat
and went up the porcupine river.  and with him went el-soo.  it was a
weary journey, and the way led across the backbone of the world; but
akoon had travelled it before.  when they came to the head-waters of the
porcupine, they left the boat and went on foot across the rocky
mountains.

akoon greatly liked to walk behind el-soo and watch the movements of her.
there was a music in it that he loved.  and especially he loved the
well-rounded calves in their sheaths of soft-tanned leather, the slim
ankles, and the small moccasined feet that were tireless through the
longest days.

“you are light as air,” he said, looking up at her.  “it is no labour for
you to walk.  you almost float, so lightly do your feet rise and fall.
you are like a deer, el-soo; you are like a deer, and your eyes are like
deer’s eyes, sometimes when you look at me, or when you hear a quick
sound and wonder if it be danger that stirs.  your eyes are like a deer’s
eyes now as you look at me.”

and el-soo, luminous and melting, bent and kissed akoon.

“when we reach the mackenzie, we will not delay,” akoon said later.  “we
will go south before the winter catches us.  we will go to the sunlands
where there is no snow.  but we will return.  i have seen much of the
world, and there is no land like alaska, no sun like our sun, and the
snow is good after the long summer.”

“and you will learn to read,” said el-soo.

and akoon said, “i will surely learn to read.”  but there was delay when
they reached the mackenzie.  they fell in with a band of mackenzie
indians, and, hunting, akoon was shot by accident.  the rifle was in the
hands of a youth.  the bullet broke akoon’s right arm and, ranging
farther, broke two of his ribs.  akoon knew rough surgery, while el-soo
had learned some refinements at holy cross.  the bones were finally set,
and akoon lay by the fire for them to knit.  also, he lay by the fire so
that the smoke would keep the mosquitoes away.

then it was that porportuk, with his six young men, arrived.  akoon
groaned in his helplessness and made appeal to the mackenzies.  but
porportuk made demand, and the mackenzies were perplexed.  porportuk was
for seizing upon el-soo, but this they would not permit.  judgment must
be given, and, as it was an affair of man and woman, the council of the
old men was called—this that warm judgment might not be given by the
young men, who were warm of heart.

the old men sat in a circle about the smudge-fire.  their faces were lean
and wrinkled, and they gasped and panted for air.  the smoke was not good
for them.  occasionally they struck with withered hands at the mosquitoes
that braved the smoke.  after such exertion they coughed hollowly and
painfully.  some spat blood, and one of them sat a bit apart with head
bowed forward, and bled slowly and continuously at the mouth; the
coughing sickness had gripped them.  they were as dead men; their time
was short.  it was a judgment of the dead.

“and i paid for her a heavy price,” porportuk concluded his complaint.
“such a price you have never seen.  sell all that is yours—sell your
spears and arrows and rifles, sell your skins and furs, sell your tents
and boats and dogs, sell everything, and you will not have maybe a
thousand dollars.  yet did i pay for the woman, el-soo, twenty-six times
the price of all your spears and arrows and rifles, your skins and furs,
your tents and boats and dogs.  it was a heavy price.”

the old men nodded gravely, though their weazened eye-slits widened with
wonder that any woman should be worth such a price.  the one that bled at
the mouth wiped his lips.  “is it true talk?” he asked each of
porportuk’s six young men.  and each answered that it was true.

“is it true talk?” he asked el-soo, and she answered, “it is true.”

“but porportuk has not told that he is an old man,” akoon said, “and that
he has daughters older than el-soo.”

“it is true, porportuk is an old man,” said el-soo.

“it is for porportuk to measure the strength his age,” said he who bled
at the mouth.  “we be old men.  behold!  age is never so old as youth
would measure it.”

and the circle of old men champed their gums, and nodded approvingly, and
coughed.

“i told him that i would never be his wife,” said el-soo.

“yet you took from him twenty-six times all that we possess?” asked a
one-eyed old man.

el-soo was silent.

“it is true?”  and his one eye burned and bored into her like a fiery
gimlet.

“it is true,” she said.

“but i will run away again,” she broke out passionately, a moment later.
“always will i run away.”

“that is for porportuk to consider,” said another of the old men.  “it is
for us to consider the judgment.”

“what price did you pay for her?” was demanded of akoon.

“no price did i pay for her,” he answered.  “she was above price.  i did
not measure her in gold-dust, nor in dogs, and tents, and furs.”

the old men debated among themselves and mumbled in undertones.  “these
old men are ice,” akoon said in english.  “i will not listen to their
judgment, porportuk.  if you take el-soo, i will surely kill you.”

the old men ceased and regarded him suspiciously.  “we do not know the
speech you make,” one said.

“he but said that he would kill me,” porportuk volunteered.  “so it were
well to take from him his rifle, and to have some of your young men sit
by him, that he may not do me hurt.  he is a young man, and what are
broken bones to youth!”

akoon, lying helpless, had rifle and knife taken from him, and to either
side of his shoulders sat young men of the mackenzies.  the one-eyed old
man arose and stood upright.  “we marvel at the price paid for one mere
woman,” he began; “but the wisdom of the price is no concern of ours.  we
are here to give judgment, and judgment we give.  we have no doubt.  it
is known to all that porportuk paid a heavy price for the woman el-soo.
wherefore does the woman el-soo belong to porportuk and none other.”  he
sat down heavily, and coughed.  the old men nodded and coughed.

“i will kill you,” akoon cried in english.

porportuk smiled and stood up.  “you have given true judgment,” he said
to the council, “and my young men will give to you much tobacco.  now let
the woman be brought to me.”

akoon gritted his teeth.  the young men took el-soo by the arms.  she did
not resist, and was led, her face a sullen flame, to porportuk.

“sit there at my feet till i have made my talk,” he commanded.  he paused
a moment.  “it is true,” he said, “i am an old man.  yet can i understand
the ways of youth.  the fire has not all gone out of me.  yet am i no
longer young, nor am i minded to run these old legs of mine through all
the years that remain to me.  el-soo can run fast and well.  she is a
deer.  this i know, for i have seen and run after her.  it is not good
that a wife should run so fast.  i paid for her a heavy price, yet does
she run away from me.  akoon paid no price at all, yet does she run to
him.

“when i came among you people of the mackenzie, i was of one mind.  as i
listened in the council and thought of the swift legs of el-soo, i was of
many minds.  now am i of one mind again but it is a different mind from
the one i brought to the council.  let me tell you my mind.  when a dog
runs once away from a master, it will run away again.  no matter how many
times it is brought back, each time it will run away again.  when we have
such dogs, we sell them.  el-soo is like a dog that runs away.  i will
sell her.  is there any man of the council that will buy?”

the old men coughed and remained silent

“akoon would buy,” porportuk went on, “but he has no money.  wherefore i
will give el-soo to him, as he said, without price.  even now will i give
her to him.”

reaching down, he took el-soo by the hand and led her across the space to
where akoon lay on his back.

“she has a bad habit, akoon,” he said, seating her at akoon’s feet.  “as
she has run away from me in the past, in the days to come she may run
away from you.  but there is no need to fear that she will ever run away,
akoon.  i shall see to that.  never will she run away from you—this is
the word of porportuk.  she has great wit.  i know, for often has it
bitten into me.  yet am i minded myself to give my wit play for once.
and by my wit will i secure her to you, akoon.”

stooping, porportuk crossed el-soo’s feet, so that the instep of one lay
over that of the other; and then, before his purpose could be divined, he
discharged his rifle through the two ankles.  as akoon struggled to rise
against the weight of the young men, there was heard the crunch of the
broken bone rebroken.

“it is just,” said the old men, one to another.

el-soo made no sound.  she sat and looked at her shattered ankles, on
which she would never walk again.

“my legs are strong, el-soo,” akoon said.  “but never will they bear me
away from you.”

el-soo looked at him, and for the first time in all the time he had known
her, akoon saw tears in her eyes.

“your eyes are like deer’s eyes, el-soo,” he said.

“is it just?” porportuk asked, and grinned from the edge of the smoke as
he prepared to depart.

“it is just,” the old men said.  and they sat on in the silence.

the strength of the strong


    _parables don’t lie_, _but liars will parable_.

                                                              —_lip-king_.

old long-beard paused in his narrative, licked his greasy fingers, and
wiped them on his naked sides where his one piece of ragged bearskin
failed to cover him.  crouched around him, on their hams, were three
young men, his grandsons, deer-runner, yellow-head, and
afraid-of-the-dark.  in appearance they were much the same.  skins of
wild animals partly covered them.  they were lean and meagre of build,
narrow-hipped and crooked-legged, and at the same time deep-chested, with
heavy arms and enormous hands.  there was much hair on their chests and
shoulders, and on the outsides of their arms and legs.  their heads were
matted with uncut hair, long locks of which often strayed before their
eyes, beady and black and glittering like the eyes of birds.  they were
narrow between the eyes and broad between the cheeks, while their lower
jaws were projecting and massive.

it was a night of clear starlight, and below them, stretching away
remotely, lay range on range of forest-covered hills.  in the distance
the heavens were red from the glow of a volcano.  at their backs yawned
the black mouth of a cave, out of which, from time to time, blew draughty
gusts of wind.  immediately in front of them blazed a fire.  at one side,
partly devoured, lay the carcass of a bear, with about it, at a
respectable distance, several large dogs, shaggy and wolf-like.  beside
each man lay his bow and arrows and a huge club.  in the cave-mouth a
number of rude spears leaned against the rock.

“so that was how we moved from the cave to the tree,” old long-beard
spoke up.

they laughed boisterously, like big children, at recollection of a
previous story his words called up.  long-beard laughed, too, the
five-inch bodkin of bone, thrust midway through the cartilage of his
nose, leaping and dancing and adding to his ferocious appearance.  he did
not exactly say the words recorded, but he made animal-like sounds with
his mouth that meant the same thing.

“and that is the first i remember of the sea valley,” long-beard went on.
“we were a very foolish crowd.  we did not know the secret of strength.
for, behold, each family lived by itself, and took care of itself.  there
were thirty families, but we got no strength from one another.  we were
in fear of each other all the time.  no one ever paid visits.  in the top
of our tree we built a grass house, and on the platform outside was a
pile of rocks, which were for the heads of any that might chance to try
to visit us.  also, we had our spears and arrows.  we never walked under
the trees of the other families, either.  my brother did, once, under old
boo-oogh’s tree, and he got his head broken and that was the end of him.

“old boo-oogh was very strong.  it was said he could pull a grown man’s
head right off.  i never heard of him doing it, because no man would give
him a chance.  father wouldn’t.  one day, when father was down on the
beach, boo-oogh took after mother.  she couldn’t run fast, for the day
before she had got her leg clawed by a bear when she was up on the
mountain gathering berries.  so boo-oogh caught her and carried her up
into his tree.  father never got her back.  he was afraid.  old boo-oogh
made faces at him.

“but father did not mind.  strong-arm was another strong man.  he was one
of the best fishermen.  but one day, climbing after sea-gull eggs, he had
a fall from the cliff.  he was never strong after that.  he coughed a
great deal, and his shoulders drew near to each other.  so father took
strong-arm’s wife.  when he came around and coughed under our tree,
father laughed at him and threw rocks at him.  it was our way in those
days.  we did not know how to add strength together and become strong.”

“would a brother take a brother’s wife?” deer-runner demanded.

“yes, if he had gone to live in another tree by himself.”

“but we do not do such things now,” afraid-of-the-dark objected.

“it is because i have taught your fathers better.”  long-beard thrust his
hairy paw into the bear meat and drew out a handful of suet, which he
sucked with a meditative air.  again he wiped his hands on his naked
sides and went on.  “what i am telling you happened in the long ago,
before we knew any better.”

“you must have been fools not to know better,” was deer-runner’s comment,
yellow-head grunting approval.

“so we were, but we became bigger fools, as you shall see.  still, we did
learn better, and this was the way of it.  we fish-eaters had not learned
to add our strength until our strength was the strength of all of us.
but the meat-eaters, who lived across the divide in the big valley, stood
together, hunted together, fished together, and fought together.  one day
they came into our valley.  each family of us got into its own cave and
tree.  there were only ten meat-eaters, but they fought together, and we
fought, each family by itself.”

long-beard counted long and perplexedly on his fingers.

“there were sixty men of us,” was what he managed to say with fingers and
lips combined.  “and we were very strong, only we did not know it.  so we
watched the ten men attack boo-oogh’s tree.  he made a good fight, but he
had no chance.  we looked on.  when some of the meat-eaters tried to
climb the tree, boo-oogh had to show himself in order to drop stones on
their heads, whereupon the other meat-eaters, who were waiting for that
very thing, shot him full of arrows.  and that was the end of boo-oogh.

“next, the meat-eaters got one-eye and his family in his cave.  they
built a fire in the mouth and smoked him out, like we smoked out the bear
there to-day.  then they went after six-fingers, up his tree, and, while
they were killing him and his grown son, the rest of us ran away.  they
caught some of our women, and killed two old men who could not run fast
and several children.  the women they carried away with them to the big
valley.

“after that the rest of us crept back, and, somehow, perhaps because we
were in fear and felt the need for one another, we talked the thing over.
it was our first council—our first real council.  and in that council we
formed our first tribe.  for we had learned the lesson.  of the ten
meat-eaters, each man had had the strength of ten, for the ten had fought
as one man.  they had added their strength together.  but of the thirty
families and the sixty men of us, we had had the strength of but one man,
for each had fought alone.

“it was a great talk we had, and it was hard talk, for we did not have
the words then as now with which to talk.  the bug made some of the words
long afterward, and so did others of us make words from time to time.
but in the end we agreed to add our strength together and to be as one
man when the meat-eaters came over the divide to steal our women.  and
that was the tribe.

“we set two men on the divide, one for the day and one for the night, to
watch if the meat-eaters came.  these were the eyes of the tribe.  then,
also, day and night, there were to be ten men awake with their clubs and
spears and arrows in their hands, ready to fight.  before, when a man
went after fish, or clams, or gull-eggs, he carried his weapons with him,
and half the time he was getting food and half the time watching for fear
some other man would get him.  now that was all changed.  the men went
out without their weapons and spent all their time getting food.
likewise, when the women went into the mountains after roots and berries,
five of the ten men went with them to guard them.  while all the time,
day and night, the eyes of the tribe watched from the top of the divide.

“but troubles came.  as usual, it was about the women.  men without wives
wanted other men’s wives, and there was much fighting between men, and
now and again one got his head smashed or a spear through his body.
while one of the watchers was on top of the divide, another man stole his
wife, and he came down to fight.  then the other watcher was in fear that
some one would take his wife, and he came down likewise.  also, there was
trouble among the ten men who carried always their weapons, and they
fought five against five, till some ran away down the coast and the
others ran after them.

“so it was that the tribe was left without eyes or guards.  we had not
the strength of sixty.  we had no strength at all.  so we held a council
and made our first laws.  i was but a cub at the time, but i remember.
we said that, in order to be strong, we must not fight one another, and
we made a law that when a man killed another him would the tribe kill.
we made another law that whoso stole another man’s wife him would the
tribe kill.  we said that whatever man had too great strength, and by
that strength hurt his brothers in the tribe, him would we kill that his
strength might hurt no more.  for, if we let his strength hurt, the
brothers would become afraid and the tribe would fall apart, and we would
be as weak as when the meat-eaters first came upon us and killed
boo-oogh.

“knuckle-bone was a strong man, a very strong man, and he knew not law.
he knew only his own strength, and in the fullness thereof he went forth
and took the wife of three-clams.  three-clams tried to fight, but
knuckle-bone clubbed out his brains.  yet had knuckle-bone forgotten that
all the men of us had added our strength to keep the law among us, and
him we killed, at the foot of his tree, and hung his body on a branch as
a warning that the law was stronger than any man.  for we were the law,
all of us, and no man was greater than the law.

“then there were other troubles, for know, o deer-runner, and
yellow-head, and afraid-of-the-dark, that it is not easy to make a tribe.
there were many things, little things, that it was a great trouble to
call all the men together to have a council about.  we were having
councils morning, noon, and night, and in the middle of the night.  we
could find little time to go out and get food, because of the councils,
for there was always some little thing to be settled, such as naming two
new watchers to take the place of the old ones on the hill, or naming how
much food should fall to the share of the men who kept their weapons
always in their hands and got no food for themselves.

“we stood in need of a chief man to do these things, who would be the
voice of the council, and who would account to the council for the things
he did.  so we named fith-fith the chief man.  he was a strong man, too,
and very cunning, and when he was angry he made noises just like that,
_fith-fith_, like a wild-cat.

“the ten men who guarded the tribe were set to work making a wall of
stones across the narrow part of the valley.  the women and large
children helped, as did other men, until the wall was strong.  after
that, all the families came down out of their caves and trees and built
grass houses behind the shelter of the wall.  these houses were large and
much better than the caves and trees, and everybody had a better time of
it because the men had added their strength together and become a tribe.
because of the wall and the guards and the watchers, there was more time
to hunt and fish and pick roots and berries; there was more food, and
better food, and no one went hungry.  and three-legs, so named because
his legs had been smashed when a boy and who walked with a
stick—three-legs got the seed of the wild corn and planted it in the
ground in the valley near his house.  also, he tried planting fat roots
and other things he found in the mountain valleys.

“because of the safety in the sea valley, which was because of the wall
and the watchers and the guards, and because there was food in plenty for
all without having to fight for it, many families came in from the coast
valleys on both sides and from the high back mountains where they had
lived more like wild animals than men.  and it was not long before the
sea valley filled up, and in it were countless families.  but, before
this happened, the land, which had been free to all and belonged to all,
was divided up.  three-legs began it when he planted corn.  but most of
us did not care about the land.  we thought the marking of the boundaries
with fences of stone was a foolishness.  we had plenty to eat, and what
more did we want?  i remember that my father and i built stone fences for
three-legs and were given corn in return.

“so only a few got all the land, and three-legs got most of it.  also,
others that had taken land gave it to the few that held on, being paid in
return with corn and fat roots, and bear-skins, and fishes which the
farmers got from the fishermen in exchange for corn.  and, the first
thing we knew, all the land was gone.

“it was about this time that fith-fith died and dog-tooth, his son, was
made chief.  he demanded to be made chief anyway, because his father had
been chief before him.  also, he looked upon himself as a greater chief
than his father.  he was a good chief at first, and worked hard, so that
the council had less and less to do.  then arose a new voice in the sea
valley.  it was twisted-lip.  we had never thought much of him, until he
began to talk with the spirits of the dead.  later we called him big-fat,
because he ate over-much, and did no work, and grew round and large.  one
day big-fat told us that the secrets of the dead were his, and that he
was the voice of god.  he became great friends with dog-tooth, who
commanded that we should build big-fat a grass house.  and big-fat put
taboos all around this house and kept god inside.

“more and more dog-tooth became greater than the council, and when the
council grumbled and said it would name a new chief, big-fat spoke with
the voice of god and said no.  also, three-legs and the others who held
the land stood behind dog-tooth.  moreover, the strongest man in the
council was sea-lion, and him the land-owners gave land to secretly,
along with many bearskins and baskets of corn.  so sea-lion said that
big-fat’s voice was truly the voice of god and must be obeyed.  and soon
afterward sea-lion was named the voice of dog-tooth and did most of his
talking for him.

“then there was little-belly, a little man, so thin in the middle that he
looked as if he had never had enough to eat.  inside the mouth of the
river, after the sand-bar had combed the strength of the breakers, he
built a big fish-trap.  no man had ever seen or dreamed a fish-trap
before.  he worked weeks on it, with his son and his wife, while the rest
of us laughed at their labours.  but, when it was done, the first day he
caught more fish in it than could the whole tribe in a week, whereat
there was great rejoicing.  there was only one other place in the river
for a fish-trap, but, when my father and i and a dozen other men started
to make a very large trap, the guards came from the big grass-house we
had built for dog-tooth.  and the guards poked us with their spears and
told us begone, because little-belly was going to build a trap there
himself on the word of sea-lion, who was the voice of dog-tooth.

“there was much grumbling, and my father called a council.  but, when he
rose to speak, him the sea-lion thrust through the throat with a spear
and he died.  and dog-tooth and little-belly, and three-legs and all that
held land said it was good.  and big-fat said it was the will of god.
and after that all men were afraid to stand up in the council, and there
was no more council.

“another man, pig-jaw, began to keep goats.  he had heard about it as
among the meat-eaters, and it was not long before he had many flocks.
other men, who had no land and no fish-traps, and who else would have
gone hungry, were glad to work for pig-jaw, caring for his goats,
guarding them from wild dogs and tigers, and driving them to the feeding
pastures in the mountains.  in return, pig-jaw gave them goat-meat to eat
and goat-skins to wear, and sometimes they traded the goat-meat for fish
and corn and fat roots.

“it was this time that money came to be.  sea-lion was the man who first
thought of it, and he talked it over with dog-tooth and big-fat.  you
see, these three were the ones that got a share of everything in the sea
valley.  one basket out of every three of corn was theirs, one fish out
of every three, one goat out of every three.  in return, they fed the
guards and the watchers, and kept the rest for themselves.  sometimes,
when a big haul of fish was made they did not know what to do with all
their share.  so sea-lion set the women to making money out of
shell—little round pieces, with a hole in each one, and all made smooth
and fine.  these were strung on strings, and the strings were called
money.

“each string was of the value of thirty fish, or forty fish, but the
women, who made a string a day, were given two fish each.  the fish came
out of the shares of dog-tooth, big-fat, and sea-lion, which they three
did not eat.  so all the money belonged to them.  then they told
three-legs and the other land-owners that they would take their share of
corn and roots in money, little-belly that they would take their share of
fish in money, pig-jaw that they would take their share of goats and
cheese in money.  thus, a man who had nothing, worked for one who had,
and was paid in money.  with this money he bought corn, and fish, and
meat, and cheese.  and three-legs and all owners of things paid dog-tooth
and sea-lion and big-fat their share in money.  and they paid the guards
and watchers in money, and the guards and watchers bought their food with
the money.  and, because money was cheap, dog-tooth made many more men
into guards.  and, because money was cheap to make, a number of men began
to make money out of shell themselves.  but the guards stuck spears in
them and shot them full of arrows, because they were trying to break up
the tribe.  it was bad to break up the tribe, for then the meat-eaters
would come over the divide and kill them all.

“big-fat was the voice of god, but he took broken-rib and made him into a
priest, so that he became the voice of big-fat and did most of his
talking for him.  and both had other men to be servants to them.  so,
also, did little-belly and three-legs and pig-jaw have other men to lie
in the sun about their grass houses and carry messages for them and give
commands.  and more and more were men taken away from work, so that those
that were left worked harder than ever before.  it seemed that men
desired to do no work and strove to seek out other ways whereby men
should work for them.  crooked-eyes found such a way.  he made the first
fire-brew out of corn.  and thereafter he worked no more, for he talked
secretly with dog-tooth and big-fat and the other masters, and it was
agreed that he should be the only one to make fire-brew.  but
crooked-eyes did no work himself.  men made the brew for him, and he paid
them in money.  then he sold the fire-brew for money, and all men bought.
and many strings of money did he give dog-tooth and sea-lion and all of
them.

“big-fat and broken-rib stood by dog-tooth when he took his second wife,
and his third wife.  they said dog-tooth was different from other men and
second only to god that big-fat kept in his taboo house, and dog-tooth
said so, too, and wanted to know who were they to grumble about how many
wives he took.  dog-tooth had a big canoe made, and, many more men he
took from work, who did nothing and lay in the sun, save only when
dog-tooth went in the canoe, when they paddled for him.  and he made
tiger-face head man over all the guards, so that tiger-face became his
right arm, and when he did not like a man tiger-face killed that man for
him.  and tiger-face, also, made another man to be his right arm, and to
give commands, and to kill for him.

“but this was the strange thing: as the days went by we who were left
worked harder and harder, and yet did we get less and less to eat.”

“but what of the goats and the corn and the fat roots and the fish-trap?”
spoke up afraid-of-the-dark, “what of all this?  was there not more food
to be gained by man’s work?”

“it is so,” long-beard agreed.  “three men on the fish-trap got more fish
than the whole tribe before there was a fish-trap.  but have i not said
we were fools?  the more food we were able to get, the less food did we
have to eat.”

“but was it not plain that the many men who did not work ate it all up?”
yellow-head demanded.

long-beard nodded his head sadly.

“dog-tooth’s dogs were stuffed with meat, and the men who lay in the sun
and did no work were rolling in fat, and, at the same time, there were
little children crying themselves to sleep with hunger biting them with
every wail.”

deer-runner was spurred by the recital of famine to tear out a chunk of
bear-meat and broil it on a stick over the coals.  this he devoured with
smacking lips, while long-beard went on:

“when we grumbled big-fat arose, and with the voice of god said that god
had chosen the wise men to own the land and the goats and the fish-trap,
and the fire-brew, and that without these wise men we would all be
animals, as in the days when we lived in trees.

“and there arose one who became a singer of songs for the king.  him they
called the bug, because he was small and ungainly of face and limb and
excelled not in work or deed.  he loved the fattest marrow bones, the
choicest fish, the milk warm from the goats, the first corn that was
ripe, and the snug place by the fire.  and thus, becoming singer of songs
to the king, he found a way to do nothing and be fat.  and when the
people grumbled more and more, and some threw stones at the king’s grass
house, the bug sang a song of how good it was to be a fish-eater.  in his
song he told that the fish-eaters were the chosen of god and the finest
men god had made.  he sang of the meat-eaters as pigs and crows, and sang
how fine and good it was for the fish-eaters to fight and die doing god’s
work, which was the killing of meat-eaters.  the words of his song were
like fire in us, and we clamoured to be led against the meat-eaters.  and
we forgot that we were hungry, and why we had grumbled, and were glad to
be led by tiger-face over the divide, where we killed many meat-eaters
and were content.

“but things were no better in the sea valley.  the only way to get food
was to work for three-legs or little-belly or pig-jaw; for there was no
land that a man might plant with corn for himself.  and often there were
more men than three-legs and the others had work for.  so these men went
hungry, and so did their wives and children and their old mothers.
tiger-face said they could become guards if they wanted to, and many of
them did, and thereafter they did no work except to poke spears in the
men who did work and who grumbled at feeding so many idlers.

“and when we grumbled, ever the bug sang new songs.  he said that
three-legs and pig-jaw and the rest were strong men, and that that was
why they had so much.  he said that we should be glad to have strong men
with us, else would we perish of our own worthlessness and the
meat-eaters.  therefore, we should be glad to let such strong men have
all they could lay hands on.  and big-fat and pig-jaw and tiger-face and
all the rest said it was true.

“‘all right,’ said long-fang, ‘then will i, too, be a strong man.’  and
he got himself corn, and began to make fire-brew and sell it for strings
of money.  and, when crooked-eyes complained, long-fang said that he was
himself a strong man, and that if crooked-eyes made any more noise he
would bash his brains out for him.  whereat crooked-eyes was afraid and
went and talked with three-legs and pig-jaw.  and all three went and
talked to dog-tooth.  and dog-tooth spoke to sea-lion, and sea-lion sent
a runner with a message to tiger-face.  and tiger-face sent his guards,
who burned long-fang’s house along with the fire-brew he had made.  also,
they killed him and all his family.  and big-fat said it was good, and
the bug sang another song about how good it was to observe the law, and
what a fine land the sea valley was, and how every man who loved the sea
valley should go forth and kill the bad meat-eaters.  and again his song
was as fire to us, and we forgot to grumble.

“it was very strange.  when little-belly caught too many fish, so that it
took a great many to sell for a little money, he threw many of the fish
back into the sea, so that more money would be paid for what was left.
and three-legs often let many large fields lie idle so as to get more
money for his corn.  and the women, making so much money out of shell
that much money was needed to buy with, dog-tooth stopped the making of
money.  and the women had no work, so they took the places of the men.  i
worked on the fish-trap, getting a string of money every five days.  but
my sister now did my work, getting a string of money for every ten days.
the women worked cheaper, and there was less food, and tiger-face said we
should become guards.  only i could not become a guard because i was lame
of one leg and tiger-face would not have me.  and there were many like
me.  we were broken men and only fit to beg for work or to take care of
the babies while the women worked.”

yellow-head, too, was made hungry by the recital and broiled a piece of
bear-meat on the coals.

“but why didn’t you rise up, all of you, and kill three-legs and pig-jaw
and big-fat and the rest and get enough to eat?” afraid-in-the-dark
demanded.

“because we could not understand,” long-beard answered.  “there was too
much to think about, and, also, there were the guards sticking spears
into us, and big-fat talking about god, and the bug singing new songs.
and when any man did think right, and said so, tiger-face and the guards
got him, and he was tied out to the rocks at low tide so that the rising
waters drowned him.

“it was a strange thing—the money.  it was like the bug’s songs.  it
seemed all right, but it wasn’t, and we were slow to understand.
dog-tooth began to gather the money in.  he put it in a big pile, in a
grass house, with guards to watch it day and night.  and the more money
he piled in the house the dearer money became, so that a man worked a
longer time for a string of money than before.  then, too, there was
always talk of war with the meat-eaters, and dog-tooth and tiger-face
filled many houses with corn, and dried fish, and smoked goat-meat, and
cheese.  and with the food, piled there in mountains the people had not
enough to eat.  but what did it matter?  whenever the people grumbled too
loudly the bug sang a new song, and big-fat said it was god’s word that
we should kill meat-eaters, and tiger-face led us over the divide to kill
and be killed.  i was not good enough to be a guard and lie fat in the
sun, but, when we made war, tiger-face was glad to take me along.  and
when we had eaten, all the food stored in the houses we stopped fighting
and went back to work to pile up more food.”

“then were you all crazy,” commented deer-runner.

“then were we indeed all crazy,” long-beard agreed.  “it was strange, all
of it.  there was split-nose.  he said everything was wrong.  he said it
was true that we grew strong by adding our strength together.  and he
said that, when we first formed the tribe, it was right that the men
whose strength hurt the tribe should be shorn of their strength—men who
bashed their brothers’ heads and stole their brothers’ wives.  and now,
he said, the tribe was not getting stronger, but was getting weaker,
because there were men with another kind of strength that were hurting
the tribe—men who had the strength of the land, like three-legs; who had
the strength of the fish-trap, like little-belly; who had the strength of
all the goat-meat, like pig-jaw.  the thing to do, split-nose said, was
to shear these men of their evil strength; to make them go to work, all
of them, and to let no man eat who did not work.

“and the bug sang another song about men like split-nose, who wanted to
go back, and live in trees.

“yet split-nose said no; that he did not want to go back, but ahead; that
they grew strong only as they added their strength together; and that, if
the fish-eaters would add their strength to the meat-eaters, there would
be no more fighting and no more watchers and no more guards, and that,
with all men working, there would be so much food that each man would
have to work not more than two hours a day.

“then the bug sang again, and he sang that split-nose was lazy, and he
sang also the ‘song of the bees.’  it was a strange song, and those who
listened were made mad, as from the drinking of strong fire-brew.  the
song was of a swarm of bees, and of a robber wasp who had come in to live
with the bees and who was stealing all their honey.  the wasp was lazy
and told them there was no need to work; also, he told them to make
friends with the bears, who were not honey-stealers but only very good
friends.  and the bug sang in crooked words, so that those who listened
knew that the swarm was the sea valley tribe, that the bears were the
meat-eaters, and that the lazy wasp was split-nose.  and when the bug
sang that the bees listened to the wasp till the swarm was near to
perishing, the people growled and snarled, and when the bug sang that at
last the good bees arose and stung the wasp to death, the people picked
up stones from the ground and stoned split-nose to death till there was
naught to be seen of him but the heap of stones they had flung on top of
him.  and there were many poor people who worked long and hard and had
not enough to eat that helped throw the stones on split-nose.

“and, after the death of split-nose, there was but one other man that
dared rise up and speak his mind, and that man was hair-face.  ‘where is
the strength of the strong?’ he asked.  ‘we are the strong, all of us,
and we are stronger than dog-tooth and tiger-face and three-legs and
pig-jaw and all the rest who do nothing and eat much and weaken us by the
hurt of their strength which is bad strength.  men who are slaves are not
strong.  if the man who first found the virtue and use of fire had used
his strength we would have been his slaves, as we are the slaves to-day
of little-belly, who found the virtue and use of the fish-trap; and of
the men who found the virtue and use of the land, and the goats, and the
fire-brew.  before, we lived in trees, my brothers, and no man was safe.
but we fight no more with one another.  we have added our strength
together.  then let us fight no more with the meat-eaters.  let us add
our strength and their strength together.  then will we be indeed strong.
and then we will go out together, the fish-eaters and the meat-eaters,
and we will kill the tigers and the lions and the wolves and the wild
dogs, and we will pasture our goats on all the hill-sides and plant our
corn and fat roots in all the high mountain valleys.  in that day we will
be so strong that all the wild animals will flee before us and perish.
and nothing will withstand us, for the strength of each man will be the
strength of all men in the world.’

“so said hair-face, and they killed him, because, they said, he was a
wild man and wanted to go back and live in a tree.  it was very strange.
whenever a man arose and wanted to go forward all those that stood still
said he went backward and should be killed.  and the poor people helped
stone him, and were fools.  we were all fools, except those who were fat
and did no work.  the fools were called wise, and the wise were stoned.
men who worked did not get enough to eat, and the men who did not work
ate too much.

“and the tribe went on losing strength.  the children were weak and
sickly.  and, because we ate not enough, strange sicknesses came among us
and we died like flies.  and then the meat-eaters came upon us.  we had
followed tiger-face too often over the divide and killed them.  and now
they came to repay in blood.  we were too weak and sick to man the big
wall.  and they killed us, all of us, except some of the women, which
they took away with them.  the bug and i escaped, and i hid in the
wildest places, and became a hunter of meat and went hungry no more.  i
stole a wife from the meat-eaters, and went to live in the caves of the
high mountains where they could not find me.  and we had three sons, and
each son stole a wife from the meat-eaters.  and the rest you know, for
are you not the sons of my sons?”

“but the bug?” queried deer-runner.  “what became of him?”

“he went to live with the meat-eaters and to be a singer of songs to the
king.  he is an old man now, but he sings the same old songs; and, when a
man rises up to go forward, he sings that that man is walking backward to
live in a tree.”

long-beard dipped into the bear-carcass and sucked with toothless gums at
a fist of suet.

“some day,” he said, wiping his hands on his sides, “all the fools will
be dead and then all live men will go forward.  the strength of the
strong will be theirs, and they will add their strength together, so
that, of all the men in the world, not one will fight with another.
there will be no guards nor watchers on the walls.  and all the hunting
animals will be killed, and, as hair-face said, all the hill-sides will
be pastured with goats and all the high mountain valleys will be planted
with corn and fat roots.  and all men will be brothers, and no man will
lie idle in the sun and be fed by his fellows.  and all that will come to
pass in the time when the fools are dead, and when there will be no more
singers to stand still and sing the ‘song of the bees.’  bees are not
men.”




south of the slot


old san francisco, which is the san francisco of only the other day, the
day before the earthquake, was divided midway by the slot.  the slot was
an iron crack that ran along the centre of market street, and from the
slot arose the burr of the ceaseless, endless cable that was hitched at
will to the cars it dragged up and down.  in truth, there were two slots,
but in the quick grammar of the west time was saved by calling them, and
much more that they stood for, “the slot.”  north of the slot were the
theatres, hotels, and shopping district, the banks and the staid,
respectable business houses.  south of the slot were the factories,
slums, laundries, machine-shops, boiler works, and the abodes of the
working class.

the slot was the metaphor that expressed the class cleavage of society,
and no man crossed this metaphor, back and forth, more successfully than
freddie drummond.  he made a practice of living in both worlds, and in
both worlds he lived signally well.  freddie drummond was a professor in
the sociology department of the university of california, and it was as a
professor of sociology that he first crossed over the slot, lived for six
mouths in the great labour-ghetto, and wrote _the unskilled labourer_—a
book that was hailed everywhere as an able contribution to the literature
of progress, and as a splendid reply to the literature of discontent.
politically and economically it was nothing if not orthodox.  presidents
of great railway systems bought whole editions of it to give to their
employees.  the manufacturers’ association alone distributed fifty
thousand copies of it.  in a way, it was almost as immoral as the
far-famed and notorious _message to garcia_, while in its pernicious
preachment of thrift and content it ran _mr. wiggs of the cabbage patch_
a close second.

at first, freddie drummond found it monstrously difficult to get along
among the working people.  he was not used to their ways, and they
certainly were not used to his.  they were suspicious.  he had no
antecedents.  he could talk of no previous jobs.  his hands were soft.
his extraordinary politeness was ominous.  his first idea of the rôle he
would play was that of a free and independent american who chose to work
with his hands and no explanations given.  but it wouldn’t do, as he
quickly discovered.  at the beginning they accepted him, very
provisionally, as a freak.  a little later, as he began to know his way
about better, he insensibly drifted into the rôle that would work—namely,
he was a man who had seen better days, very much better days, but who was
down on his luck, though, to be sure, only temporarily.

he learned many things, and generalized much and often erroneously, all
of which can be found in the pages of _the unskilled labourer_.  he saved
himself, however, after the sane and conservative manner of his kind, by
labelling his generalizations as “tentative.”  one of his first
experiences was in the great wilmax cannery, where he was put on
piece-work making small packing cases.  a box factory supplied the parts,
and all freddie drummond had to do was to fit the parts into a form and
drive in the wire nails with a light hammer.

it was not skilled labour, but it was piece-work.  the ordinary labourers
in the cannery got a dollar and a half per day.  freddie drummond found
the other men on the same job with him jogging along and earning a dollar
and seventy-five cents a day.  by the third day he was able to earn the
same.  but he was ambitious.  he did not care to jog along and, being
unusually able and fit, on the fourth day earned two dollars.

the next day, having keyed himself up to an exhausting high-tension, he
earned two dollars and a half.  his fellow workers favoured him with
scowls and black looks, and made remarks, slangily witty and which he did
not understand, about sucking up to the boss and pace-making and holding
her down, when the rains set in.  he was astonished at their malingering
on piece-work, generalized about the inherent laziness of the unskilled
labourer, and proceeded next day to hammer out three dollars’ worth of
boxes.

and that night, coming out of the cannery, he was interviewed by his
fellow workmen, who were very angry and incoherently slangy.  he failed
to comprehend the motive behind their action.  the action itself was
strenuous.  when he refused to ease down his pace and bleated about
freedom of contract, independent americanism, and the dignity of toil,
they proceeded to spoil his pace-making ability.  it was a fierce battle,
for drummond was a large man and an athlete, but the crowd finally jumped
on his ribs, walked on his face, and stamped on his fingers, so that it
was only after lying in bed for a week that he was able to get up and
look for another job.  all of which is duly narrated in that first book
of his, in the chapter entitled “the tyranny of labour.”

a little later, in another department of the wilmax cannery, lumping as a
fruit-distributor among the women, he essayed to carry two boxes of fruit
at a time, and was promptly reproached by the other fruit-lumpers.  it
was palpable malingering; but he was there, he decided, not to change
conditions, but to observe.  so he lumped one box thereafter, and so well
did he study the art of shirking that he wrote a special chapter on it,
with the last several paragraphs devoted to tentative generalizations.

in those six months he worked at many jobs and developed into a very good
imitation of a genuine worker.  he was a natural linguist, and he kept
notebooks, making a scientific study of the workers’ slang or argot,
until he could talk quite intelligibly.  this language also enabled him
more intimately to follow their mental processes, and thereby to gather
much data for a projected chapter in some future book which he planned to
entitle _synthesis of working-class psychology_.

before he arose to the surface from that first plunge into the underworld
he discovered that he was a good actor and demonstrated the plasticity of
his nature.  he was himself astonished at his own fluidity.  once having
mastered the language and conquered numerous fastidious qualms, he found
that he could flow into any nook of working-class life and fit it so
snugly as to feel comfortably at home.  as he said, in the preface to his
second book, _the toiler_, he endeavoured really to know the working
people, and the only possible way to achieve this was to work beside
them, eat their food, sleep in their beds, be amused with their
amusements, think their thoughts, and feel their feeling.

he was not a deep thinker.  he had no faith in new theories.  all his
norms and criteria were conventional.  his thesis on the french
revolution was noteworthy in college annals, not merely for its
painstaking and voluminous accuracy, but for the fact that it was the
dryest, deadest, most formal, and most orthodox screed ever written on
the subject.  he was a very reserved man, and his natural inhibition was
large in quantity and steel-like in quality.  he had but few friends.  he
was too undemonstrative, too frigid.  he had no vices, nor had any one
ever discovered any temptations.  tobacco he detested, beer he abhorred,
and he was never known to drink anything stronger than an occasional
light wine at dinner.

when a freshman he had been baptized “ice-box” by his warmer-blooded
fellows.  as a member of the faculty he was known as “cold-storage.”  he
had but one grief, and that was “freddie.”  he had earned it when he
played full-back in the ‘varsity eleven, and his formal soul had never
succeeded in living it down.  “freddie” he would ever be, except
officially, and through nightmare vistas he looked into a future when his
world would speak of him as “old freddie.”

for he was very young to be a doctor of sociology, only twenty-seven, and
he looked younger.  in appearance and atmosphere he was a strapping big
college man, smooth-faced and easy-mannered, clean and simple and
wholesome, with a known record of being a splendid athlete and an implied
vast possession of cold culture of the inhibited sort.  he never talked
shop out of class and committee rooms, except later on, when his books
showered him with distasteful public notice and he yielded to the extent
of reading occasional papers before certain literary and economic
societies.

he did everything right—too right; and in dress and comportment was
inevitably correct.  not that he was a dandy.  far from it.  he was a
college man, in dress and carriage as like as a pea to the type that of
late years is being so generously turned out of our institutions of
higher learning.  his handshake was satisfyingly strong and stiff.  his
blue eyes were coldly blue and convincingly sincere.  his voice, firm and
masculine, clean and crisp of enunciation, was pleasant to the ear.  the
one drawback to freddie drummond was his inhibition.  he never unbent.
in his football days, the higher the tension of the game, the cooler he
grew.  he was noted as a boxer, but he was regarded as an automaton, with
the inhuman precision of a machine judging distance and timing blows,
guarding, blocking, and stalling.  he was rarely punished himself, while
he rarely punished an opponent.  he was too clever and too controlled to
permit himself to put a pound more weight into a punch than he intended.
with him it was a matter of exercise.  it kept him fit.

as time went by, freddie drummond found himself more frequently crossing
the slot and losing himself in south of market.  his summer and winter
holidays were spent there, and, whether it was a week or a week-end, he
found the time spent there to be valuable and enjoyable.  and there was
so much material to be gathered.  his third book, _mass and master_,
became a text-book in the american universities; and almost before he
knew it, he was at work on a fourth one, _the fallacy of the
inefficient_.

somewhere in his make-up there was a strange twist or quirk.  perhaps it
was a recoil from his environment and training, or from the tempered seed
of his ancestors, who had been book-men generation preceding generation;
but at any rate, he found enjoyment in being down in the working-class
world.  in his own world he was “cold-storage,” but down below he was
“big” bill totts, who could drink and smoke, and slang and fight, and be
an all-round favourite.  everybody liked bill, and more than one working
girl made love to him.  at first he had been merely a good actor, but as
time went on, simulation became second nature.  he no longer played a
part, and he loved sausages, sausages and bacon, than which, in his own
proper sphere, there was nothing more loathsome in the way of food.

from doing the thing for the need’s sake, he came to doing the thing for
the thing’s sake.  he found himself regretting as the time drew near for
him to go back to his lecture-room and his inhibition.  and he often
found himself waiting with anticipation for the dreamy time to pass when
he could cross the slot and cut loose and play the devil.  he was not
wicked, but as “big” bill totts he did a myriad things that freddie
drummond would never have been permitted to do.  moreover, freddie
drummond never would have wanted to do them.  that was the strangest part
of his discovery.  freddie drummond and bill totts were two totally
different creatures.  the desires and tastes and impulses of each ran
counter to the other’s.  bill totts could shirk at a job with clear
conscience, while freddie drummond condemned shirking as vicious,
criminal, and un-american, and devoted whole chapters to condemnation of
the vice.  freddie drummond did not care for dancing, but bill totts
never missed the nights at the various dancing clubs, such as the
magnolia, the western star, and the elite; while he won a massive silver
cup, standing thirty inches high, for being the best-sustained character
at the butchers and meat workers’ annual grand masked ball.  and bill
totts liked the girls and the girls liked him, while freddie drummond
enjoyed playing the ascetic in this particular, was open in his
opposition to equal suffrage, and cynically bitter in his secret
condemnation of coeducation.

freddie drummond changed his manners with his dress, and without effort.
when he entered the obscure little room used for his transformation
scenes, he carried himself just a bit too stiffly.  he was too erect, his
shoulders were an inch too far back, while his face was grave, almost
harsh, and practically expressionless.  but when he emerged in bill
totts’ clothes he was another creature.  bill totts did not slouch, but
somehow his whole form limbered up and became graceful.  the very sound
of the voice was changed, and the laugh was loud and hearty, while loose
speech and an occasional oath were as a matter of course on his lips.
also, bill totts was a trifle inclined to late hours, and at times, in
saloons, to be good-naturedly bellicose with other workmen.  then, too,
at sunday picnics or when coming home from the show, either arm betrayed
a practised familiarity in stealing around girls’ waists, while he
displayed a wit keen and delightful in the flirtatious badinage that was
expected of a good fellow in his class.

so thoroughly was bill totts himself, so thoroughly a workman, a genuine
denizen of south of the slot, that he was as class-conscious as the
average of his kind, and his hatred for a scab even exceeded that of the
average loyal union man.  during the water front strike, freddie drummond
was somehow able to stand apart from the unique combination, and, coldly
critical, watch bill totts hilariously slug scab longshoremen.  for bill
totts was a dues-paying member of the longshoremen union and had a right
to be indignant with the usurpers of his job.  “big” bill totts was so
very big, and so very able, that it was “big” bill to the front when
trouble was brewing.  from acting outraged feelings, freddie drummond, in
the rôle of his other self, came to experience genuine outrage, and it
was only when he returned to the classic atmosphere of the university
that he was able, sanely and conservatively, to generalize upon his
underworld experiences and put them down on paper as a trained
sociologist should.  that bill totts lacked the perspective to raise him
above class-consciousness freddie drummond clearly saw.  but bill totts
could not see it.  when he saw a scab taking his job away, he saw red at
the same time, and little else did he see.  it was freddie drummond,
irreproachably clothed and comported, seated at his study desk or facing
his class in _sociology_ 17, who saw bill totts, and all around bill
totts, and all around the whole scab and union-labour problem and its
relation to the economic welfare of the united states in the struggle for
the world market.  bill totts really wasn’t able to see beyond the next
meal and the prize-fight the following night at the gaiety athletic club.

it was while gathering material for _women and work_ that freddie
received his first warning of the danger he was in.  he was too
successful at living in both worlds.  this strange dualism he had
developed was after all very unstable, and, as he sat in his study and
meditated, he saw that it could not endure.  it was really a transition
stage, and if he persisted he saw that he would inevitably have to drop
one world or the other.  he could not continue in both.  and as he looked
at the row of volumes that graced the upper shelf of his revolving
book-case, his volumes, beginning with his thesis and ending with _women
and work_, he decided that that was the world he would hold to and stick
by.  bill totts had served his purpose, but he had become a too dangerous
accomplice.  bill totts would have to cease.

freddie drummond’s fright was due to mary condon, president of the
international glove workers’ union no. 974.  he had seen her, first, from
the spectators’ gallery, at the annual convention of the northwest
federation of labour, and he had seen her through bill totts’ eyes, and
that individual had been most favourably impressed by her.  she was not
freddie drummond’s sort at all.  what if she were a royal-bodied woman,
graceful and sinewy as a panther, with amazing black eyes that could fill
with fire or laughter-love, as the mood might dictate?  he detested women
with a too exuberant vitality and a lack of . . . well, of inhibition.
freddie drummond accepted the doctrine of evolution because it was quite
universally accepted by college men, and he flatly believed that man had
climbed up the ladder of life out of the weltering muck and mess of lower
and monstrous organic things.  but he was a trifle ashamed of this
genealogy, and preferred not to think of it.  wherefore, probably, he
practised his iron inhibition and preached it to others, and preferred
women of his own type, who could shake free of this bestial and
regrettable ancestral line and by discipline and control emphasize the
wideness of the gulf that separated them from what their dim forbears had
been.

bill totts had none of these considerations.  he had liked mary condon
from the moment his eyes first rested on her in the convention hall, and
he had made it a point, then and there, to find out who she was.  the
next time he met her, and quite by accident, was when he was driving an
express waggon for pat morrissey.  it was in a lodging-house in mission
street, where he had been called to take a trunk into storage.  the
landlady’s daughter had called him and led him to the little bedroom, the
occupant of which, a glove-maker, had just been removed to hospital.  but
bill did not know this.  he stooped, up-ended the trunk, which was a
large one, got it on his shoulder, and struggled to his feet with his
back toward the open door.  at that moment he heard a woman’s voice.

“belong to the union?” was the question asked.

“aw, what’s it to you?” he retorted.  “run along now, an’ git outa my
way.  i wanta turn round.”

the next he know, big as he was, he was whirled half around and sent
reeling backward, the trunk overbalancing him, till he fetched up with a
crash against the wall.  he started to swear, but at the same instant
found himself looking into mary condon’s flashing, angry eyes.

“of course i b’long to the union,” he said.  “i was only kiddin’ you.”

“where’s your card?” she demanded in businesslike tones.

“in my pocket.  but i can’t git it out now.  this trunk’s too damn heavy.
come on down to the waggon an’ i’ll show it to you.”

“put that trunk down,” was the command.

“what for?  i got a card, i’m tellin’ you.”

“put it down, that’s all.  no scab’s going to handle that trunk.  you
ought to be ashamed of yourself, you big coward, scabbing on honest men.
why don’t you join the union and be a man?”

mary condon’s colour had left her face, and it was apparent that she was
in a rage.

“to think of a big man like you turning traitor to his class.  i suppose
you’re aching to join the militia for a chance to shoot down union
drivers the next strike.  you may belong to the militia already, for that
matter.  you’re the sort—”

“hold on, now, that’s too much!”  bill dropped the trunk to the floor
with a bang, straightened up, and thrust his hand into his inside coat
pocket.  “i told you i was only kiddin’.  there, look at that.”

it was a union card properly enough.

“all right, take it along,” mary condon said.  “and the next time don’t
kid.”

her face relaxed as she noticed the ease with which he got the big trunk
to his shoulder, and her eyes glowed as they glanced over the graceful
massiveness of the man.  but bill did not see that.  he was too busy with
the trunk.

the next time he saw mary condon was during the laundry strike.  the
laundry workers, but recently organized, were green at the business, and
had petitioned mary condon to engineer the strike.  freddie drummond had
had an inkling of what was coming, and had sent bill totts to join the
union and investigate.  bill’s job was in the wash-room, and the men had
been called out first, that morning, in order to stiffen the courage of
the girls; and bill chanced to be near the door to the mangle-room when
mary condon started to enter.  the superintendent, who was both large and
stout, barred her way.  he wasn’t going to have his girls called out, and
he’d teach her a lesson to mind her own business.  and as mary tried to
squeeze past him he thrust her back with a fat hand on her shoulder.  she
glanced around and saw bill.

“here you, mr. totts,” she called.  “lend a hand.  i want to get in.”

bill experienced a startle of warm surprise.  she had remembered his name
from his union card.  the next moment the superintendent had been plucked
from the doorway raving about rights under the law, and the girls were
deserting their machines.  during the rest of that short and successful
strike, bill constituted himself mary condon’s henchman and messenger,
and when it was over returned to the university to be freddie drummond
and to wonder what bill totts could see in such a woman.

freddie drummond was entirely safe, but bill had fallen in love.  there
was no getting away from the fact of it, and it was this fact that had
given freddie drummond his warning.  well, he had done his work, and his
adventures could cease.  there was no need for him to cross the slot
again.  all but the last three chapters of his latest, _labour tactics
and strategy_, was finished, and he had sufficient material on hand
adequately to supply those chapters.

another conclusion he arrived at, was that in order to sheet-anchor
himself as freddie drummond, closer ties and relations in his own social
nook were necessary.  it was time that he was married, anyway, and he was
fully aware that if freddie drummond didn’t get married, bill totts
assuredly would, and the complications were too awful to contemplate.
and so, enters catherine van vorst.  she was a college woman herself, and
her father, the one wealthy member of the faculty, was the head of the
philosophy department as well.  it would be a wise marriage from every
standpoint, freddie drummond concluded when the engagement was
consummated and announced.  in appearance cold and reserved, aristocratic
and wholesomely conservative, catherine van vorst, though warm in her
way, possessed an inhibition equal to drummond’s.

all seemed well with him, but freddie drummond could not quite shake off
the call of the underworld, the lure of the free and open, of the
unhampered, irresponsible life south of the slot.  as the time of his
marriage approached, he felt that he had indeed sowed wild oats, and he
felt, moreover, what a good thing it would be if he could have but one
wild fling more, play the good fellow and the wastrel one last time, ere
he settled down to grey lecture-rooms and sober matrimony.  and, further
to tempt him, the very last chapter of _labour tactics and strategy_
remained unwritten for lack of a trifle more of essential data which he
had neglected to gather.

so freddie drummond went down for the last time as bill totts, got his
data, and, unfortunately, encountered mary condon.  once more installed
in his study, it was not a pleasant thing to look back upon.  it made his
warning doubly imperative.  bill totts had behaved abominably.  not only
had he met mary condon at the central labour council, but he had stopped
at a chop-house with her, on the way home, and treated her to oysters.
and before they parted at her door, his arms had been about her, and he
had kissed her on the lips and kissed her repeatedly.  and her last words
in his ear, words uttered softly with a catchy sob in the throat that was
nothing more nor less than a love cry, were “bill . . . dear, dear bill.”

freddie drummond shuddered at the recollection.  he saw the pit yawning
for him.  he was not by nature a polygamist, and he was appalled at the
possibilities of the situation.  it would have to be put an end to, and
it would end in one only of two ways: either he must become wholly bill
totts and be married to mary condon, or he must remain wholly freddie
drummond and be married to catherine van vorst.  otherwise, his conduct
would be beneath contempt and horrible.

in the several months that followed, san francisco was torn with labour
strife.  the unions and the employers’ associations had locked horns with
a determination that looked as if they intended to settle the matter, one
way or the other, for all time.  but freddie drummond corrected proofs,
lectured classes, and did not budge.  he devoted himself to catherine van
vorst, and day by day found more to respect and admire in her—nay, even
to love in her.  the street car strike tempted him, but not so severely
as he would have expected; and the great meat strike came on and left him
cold.  the ghost of bill totts had been successfully laid, and freddie
drummond with rejuvenescent zeal tackled a brochure, long-planned, on the
topic of “diminishing returns.”

the wedding was two weeks off, when, one afternoon, in san francisco,
catherine van vorst picked him up and whisked him away to see a boys’
club, recently instituted by the settlement workers in whom she was
interested.  it was her brother’s machine, but they were alone with the
exception of the chauffeur.  at the junction with kearny street, market
and geary streets intersect like the sides of a sharp-angled letter “v.”
they, in the auto, were coming down market with the intention of
negotiating the sharp apex and going up geary.  but they did not know
what was coming down geary, timed by fate to meet them at the apex.
while aware from the papers that the meat strike was on and that it was
an exceedingly bitter one, all thought of it at that moment was farthest
from freddie drummond’s mind.  was he not seated beside catherine?  and
besides, he was carefully expositing to her his views on settlement
work—views that bill totts’ adventures had played a part in formulating.

coming down geary street were six meat waggons.  beside each scab driver
sat a policeman.  front and rear, and along each side of this procession,
marched a protecting escort of one hundred police.  behind the police
rearguard, at a respectful distance, was an orderly but vociferous mob,
several blocks in length, that congested the street from sidewalk to
sidewalk.  the beef trust was making an effort to supply the hotels, and,
incidentally, to begin the breaking of the strike.  the st. francis had
already been supplied, at a cost of many broken windows and broken heads,
and the expedition was marching to the relief of the palace hotel.

all unwitting, drummond sat beside catherine, talking settlement work, as
the auto, honking methodically and dodging traffic, swung in a wide curve
to get around the apex.  a big coal waggon, loaded with lump coal and
drawn by four huge horses, just debouching from kearny street as though
to turn down market, blocked their way.  the driver of the waggon seemed
undecided, and the chauffeur, running slow but disregarding some shouted
warning from the crossing policemen, swerved the auto to the left,
violating the traffic rules, in order to pass in front of the waggon.

at that moment freddie drummond discontinued his conversation.  nor did
he resume it again, for the situation was developing with the rapidity of
a transformation scene.  he heard the roar of the mob at the rear, and
caught a glimpse of the helmeted police and the lurching meat waggons.
at the same moment, laying on his whip, and standing up to his task, the
coal driver rushed horses and waggon squarely in front of the advancing
procession, pulled the horses up sharply, and put on the big brake.  then
he made his lines fast to the brake-handle and sat down with the air of
one who had stopped to stay.  the auto had been brought to a stop, too,
by his big panting leaders which had jammed against it.

before the chauffeur could back clear, an old irishman, driving a rickety
express waggon and lashing his one horse to a gallop, had locked wheels
with the auto.  drummond recognized both horse and waggon, for he had
driven them often himself.  the irishman was pat morrissey.  on the other
side a brewery waggon was locking with the coal waggon, and an east-bound
kearny street car, wildly clanging its gong, the motorman shouting
defiance at the crossing policeman, was dashing forward to complete the
blockade.  and waggon after waggon was locking and blocking and adding to
the confusion.  the meat waggons halted.  the police were trapped.  the
roar at the rear increased as the mob came on to the attack, while the
vanguard of the police charged the obstructing waggons.

“we’re in for it,” drummond remarked coolly to catherine.

“yes,” she nodded, with equal coolness.  “what savages they are.”

his admiration for her doubled on itself.  she was indeed his sort.  he
would have been satisfied with her even if she had screamed, and clung to
him, but this—this was magnificent.  she sat in that storm centre as
calmly as if it had been no more than a block of carriages at the opera.

the police were struggling to clear a passage.  the driver of the coal
waggon, a big man in shirt sleeves, lighted a pipe and sat smoking.  he
glanced down complacently at a captain of police who was raving and
cursing at him, and his only acknowledgment was a shrug of the shoulders.
from the rear arose the rat-rat-tat of clubs on heads and a pandemonium
of cursing, yelling, and shouting.  a violent accession of noise
proclaimed that the mob had broken through and was dragging a scab from a
waggon.  the police captain reinforced from his vanguard, and the mob at
the rear was repelled.  meanwhile, window after window in the high office
building on the right had been opened, and the class-conscious clerks
were raining a shower of office furniture down on the heads of police and
scabs.  waste-baskets, ink-bottles, paper-weights, type-writers—anything
and everything that came to hand was filling the air.

a policeman, under orders from his captain, clambered to the lofty seat
of the coal waggon to arrest the driver.  and the driver, rising
leisurely and peacefully to meet him, suddenly crumpled him in his arms
and threw him down on top of the captain.  the driver was a young giant,
and when he climbed on his load and poised a lump of coal in both hands,
a policeman, who was just scaling the waggon from the side, let go and
dropped back to earth.  the captain ordered half-a-dozen of his men to
take the waggon.  the teamster, scrambling over the load from side to
side, beat them down with huge lumps of coal.

the crowd on the sidewalks and the teamsters on the locked waggons roared
encouragement and their own delight.  the motorman, smashing helmets with
his controller bar, was beaten into insensibility and dragged from his
platform.  the captain of police, beside himself at the repulse of his
men, led the next assault on the coal waggon.  a score of police were
swarming up the tall-sided fortress.  but the teamster multiplied
himself.  at times there were six or eight policemen rolling on the
pavement and under the waggon.  engaged in repulsing an attack on the
rear end of his fortress, the teamster turned about to see the captain
just in the act of stepping on to the seat from the front end.  he was
still in the air and in most unstable equilibrium, when the teamster
hurled a thirty-pound lump of coal.  it caught the captain fairly on the
chest, and he went over backward, striking on a wheeler’s back, tumbling
on to the ground, and jamming against the rear wheel of the auto.

catherine thought he was dead, but he picked himself up and charged back.
she reached out her gloved hand and patted the flank of the snorting,
quivering horse.  but drummond did not notice the action.  he had eyes
for nothing save the battle of the coal waggon, while somewhere in his
complicated psychology, one bill totts was heaving and straining in an
effort to come to life.  drummond believed in law and order and the
maintenance of the established, but this riotous savage within him would
have none of it.  then, if ever, did freddie drummond call upon his iron
inhibition to save him.  but it is written that the house divided against
itself must fall.  and freddie drummond found that he had divided all the
will and force of him with bill totts, and between them the entity that
constituted the pair of them was being wrenched in twain.

freddie drummond sat in the auto, quite composed, alongside catherine van
vorst; but looking out of freddie drummond’s eyes was bill totts, and
somewhere behind those eyes, battling for the control of their mutual
body, were freddie drummond the sane and conservative sociologist, and
bill totts, the class-conscious and bellicose union working man.  it was
bill totts, looking out of those eyes, who saw the inevitable end of the
battle on the coal waggon.  he saw a policeman gain the top of the load,
a second, and a third.  they lurched clumsily on the loose footing, but
their long riot-clubs were out and swinging.  one blow caught the
teamster on the head.  a second he dodged, receiving it on the shoulder.
for him the game was plainly up.  he dashed in suddenly, clutched two
policemen in his arms, and hurled himself a prisoner to the pavement, his
hold never relaxing on his two captors.

catherine van vorst was sick and faint at sight of the blood and brutal
fighting.  but her qualms were vanquished by the sensational and most
unexpected happening that followed.  the man beside her emitted an
unearthly and uncultured yell and rose to his feet.  she saw him spring
over the front seat, leap to the broad rump of the wheeler, and from
there gain the waggon.  his onslaught was like a whirlwind.  before the
bewildered officer on the load could guess the errand of this
conventionally clad but excited-seeming gentleman, he was the recipient
of a punch that arched him back through the air to the pavement.  a kick
in the face led an ascending policeman to follow his example.  a rush of
three more gained the top and locked with bill totts in a gigantic
clinch, during which his scalp was opened up by a club, and coat, vest,
and half his starched shirt were torn from him.  but the three policemen
were flung far and wide, and bill totts, raining down lumps of coal, held
the fort.

the captain led gallantly to the attack, but was bowled over by a chunk
of coal that burst on his head in black baptism.  the need of the police
was to break the blockade in front before the mob could break in at the
rear, and bill totts’ need was to hold the waggon till the mob did break
through.  so the battle of the coal went on.

the crowd had recognized its champion.  “big” bill, as usual, had come to
the front, and catherine van vorst was bewildered by the cries of “bill!
o you bill!” that arose on every hand.  pat morrissey, on his waggon
seat, was jumping and screaming in an ecstasy, “eat ’em, bill!  eat ’em!
eat ’em alive!”  from the sidewalk she heard a woman’s voice cry out,
“look out, bill—front end!”  bill took the warning and with well-directed
coal cleared the front end of the waggon of assailants.  catherine van
vorst turned her head and saw on the curb of the sidewalk a woman with
vivid colouring and flashing black eyes who was staring with all her soul
at the man who had been freddie drummond a few minutes before.

the windows of the office building became vociferous with applause.  a
fresh shower of office chairs and filing cabinets descended.  the mob had
broken through on one side the line of waggons, and was advancing, each
segregated policeman the centre of a fighting group.  the scabs were torn
from their seats, the traces of the horses cut, and the frightened
animals put in flight.  many policemen crawled under the coal waggon for
safety, while the loose horses, with here and there a policeman on their
backs or struggling at their heads to hold them, surged across the
sidewalk opposite the jam and broke into market street.

catherine van vorst heard the woman’s voice calling in warning.  she was
back on the curb again, and crying out—

“beat it, bill!  now’s your time!  beat it!”

the police for the moment had been swept away.  bill totts leaped to the
pavement and made his way to the woman on the sidewalk.  catherine van
vorst saw her throw her arms around him and kiss him on the lips; and
catherine van vorst watched him curiously as he went on down the
sidewalk, one arm around the woman, both talking and laughing, and he
with a volubility and abandon she could never have dreamed possible.

the police were back again and clearing the jam while waiting for
reinforcements and new drivers and horses.  the mob had done its work and
was scattering, and catherine van vorst, still watching, could see the
man she had known as freddie drummond.  he towered a head above the
crowd.  his arm was still about the woman.  and she in the motor-car,
watching, saw the pair cross market street, cross the slot, and disappear
down third street into the labour ghetto.

                                * * * * *

in the years that followed no more lectures were given in the university
of california by one freddie drummond, and no more books on economics and
the labour question appeared over the name of frederick a. drummond.  on
the other hand there arose a new labour leader, william totts by name.
he it was who married mary condon, president of the international glove
workers’ union no. 974; and he it was who called the notorious cooks and
waiters’ strike, which, before its successful termination, brought out
with it scores of other unions, among which, of the more remotely allied,
were the chicken pickers and the undertakers.




the unparalleled invasion


it was in the year 1976 that the trouble between the world and china
reached its culmination.  it was because of this that the celebration of
the second centennial of american liberty was deferred.  many other plans
of the nations of the earth were twisted and tangled and postponed for
the same reason.  the world awoke rather abruptly to its danger; but for
over seventy years, unperceived, affairs had been shaping toward this
very end.

the year 1904 logically marks the beginning of the development that,
seventy years later, was to bring consternation to the whole world.  the
japanese-russian war took place in 1904, and the historians of the time
gravely noted it down that that event marked the entrance of japan into
the comity of nations.  what it really did mark was the awakening of
china.  this awakening, long expected, had finally been given up.  the
western nations had tried to arouse china, and they had failed.  out of
their native optimism and race-egotism they had therefore concluded that
the task was impossible, that china would never awaken.

what they had failed to take into account was this: _that between them
and china was no common psychological speech_.  their thought-processes
were radically dissimilar.  there was no intimate vocabulary.  the
western mind penetrated the chinese mind but a short distance when it
found itself in a fathomless maze.  the chinese mind penetrated the
western mind an equally short distance when it fetched up against a
blank, incomprehensible wall.  it was all a matter of language.  there
was no way to communicate western ideas to the chinese mind.  china
remained asleep.  the material achievement and progress of the west was a
closed book to her; nor could the west open the book.  back and deep down
on the tie-ribs of consciousness, in the mind, say, of the
english-speaking race, was a capacity to thrill to short, saxon words;
back and deep down on the tie-ribs of consciousness of the chinese mind
was a capacity to thrill to its own hieroglyphics; but the chinese mind
could not thrill to short, saxon words; nor could the english-speaking
mind thrill to hieroglyphics.  the fabrics of their minds were woven from
totally different stuffs.  they were mental aliens.  and so it was that
western material achievement and progress made no dent on the rounded
sleep of china.

came japan and her victory over russia in 1904.  now the japanese race
was the freak and paradox among eastern peoples.  in some strange way
japan was receptive to all the west had to offer.  japan swiftly
assimilated the western ideas, and digested them, and so capably applied
them that she suddenly burst forth, full-panoplied, a world-power.  there
is no explaining this peculiar openness of japan to the alien culture of
the west.  as well might be explained any biological sport in the animal
kingdom.

having decisively thrashed the great russian empire, japan promptly set
about dreaming a colossal dream of empire for herself.  korea she had
made into a granary and a colony; treaty privileges and vulpine diplomacy
gave her the monopoly of manchuria.  but japan was not satisfied.  she
turned her eyes upon china.  there lay a vast territory, and in that
territory were the hugest deposits in the world of iron and coal—the
backbone of industrial civilization.  given natural resources, the other
great factor in industry is labour.  in that territory was a population
of 400,000,000 souls—one quarter of the then total population of the
earth.  furthermore, the chinese were excellent workers, while their
fatalistic philosophy (or religion) and their stolid nervous organization
constituted them splendid soldiers—if they were properly managed.
needless to say, japan was prepared to furnish that management.

but best of all, from the standpoint of japan, the chinese was a kindred
race.  the baffling enigma of the chinese character to the west was no
baffling enigma to the japanese.  the japanese understood as we could
never school ourselves or hope to understand.  their mental processes
were the same.  the japanese thought with the same thought-symbols as did
the chinese, and they thought in the same peculiar grooves.  into the
chinese mind the japanese went on where we were balked by the obstacle of
incomprehension.  they took the turning which we could not perceive,
twisted around the obstacle, and were out of sight in the ramifications
of the chinese mind where we could not follow.  they were brothers.  long
ago one had borrowed the other’s written language, and, untold
generations before that, they had diverged from the common mongol stock.
there had been changes, differentiations brought about by diverse
conditions and infusions of other blood; but down at the bottom of their
beings, twisted into the fibres of them, was a heritage in common, a
sameness in kind that time had not obliterated.

and so japan took upon herself the management of china.  in the years
immediately following the war with russia, her agents swarmed over the
chinese empire.  a thousand miles beyond the last mission station toiled
her engineers and spies, clad as coolies, under the guise of itinerant
merchants or proselytizing buddhist priests, noting down the horse-power
of every waterfall, the likely sites for factories, the heights of
mountains and passes, the strategic advantages and weaknesses, the wealth
of the farming valleys, the number of bullocks in a district or the
number of labourers that could be collected by forced levies.  never was
there such a census, and it could have been taken by no other people than
the dogged, patient, patriotic japanese.

but in a short time secrecy was thrown to the winds.  japan’s officers
reorganized the chinese army; her drill sergeants made the mediæval
warriors over into twentieth century soldiers, accustomed to all the
modern machinery of war and with a higher average of marksmanship than
the soldiers of any western nation.  the engineers of japan deepened and
widened the intricate system of canals, built factories and foundries,
netted the empire with telegraphs and telephones, and inaugurated the era
of railroad-building.  it was these same protagonists of
machine-civilization that discovered the great oil deposits of chunsan,
the iron mountains of whang-sing, the copper ranges of chinchi, and they
sank the gas wells of wow-wee, that most marvellous reservoir of natural
gas in all the world.

in china’s councils of empire were the japanese emissaries.  in the ears
of the statesmen whispered the japanese statesmen.  the political
reconstruction of the empire was due to them.  they evicted the scholar
class, which was violently reactionary, and put into office progressive
officials.  and in every town and city of the empire newspapers were
started.  of course, japanese editors ran the policy of these papers,
which policy they got direct from tokio.  it was these papers that
educated and made progressive the great mass of the population.

china was at last awake.  where the west had failed, japan succeeded.
she had transmuted western culture and achievement into terms that were
intelligible to the chinese understanding.  japan herself, when she so
suddenly awakened, had astounded the world.  but at the time she was only
forty millions strong.  china’s awakening, with her four hundred millions
and the scientific advance of the world, was frightfully astounding.  she
was the colossus of the nations, and swiftly her voice was heard in no
uncertain tones in the affairs and councils of the nations.  japan egged
her on, and the proud western peoples listened with respectful ears.

china’s swift and remarkable rise was due, perhaps more than to anything
else, to the superlative quality of her labour.  the chinese was the
perfect type of industry.  he had always been that.  for sheer ability to
work no worker in the world could compare with him.  work was the breath
of his nostrils.  it was to him what wandering and fighting in far lands
and spiritual adventure had been to other peoples.  liberty, to him,
epitomized itself in access to the means of toil.  to till the soil and
labour interminably was all he asked of life and the powers that be.  and
the awakening of china had given its vast population not merely free and
unlimited access to the means of toil, but access to the highest and most
scientific machine-means of toil.

china rejuvenescent!  it was but a step to china rampant.  she discovered
a new pride in herself and a will of her own.  she began to chafe under
the guidance of japan, but she did not chafe long.  on japan’s advice, in
the beginning, she had expelled from the empire all western missionaries,
engineers, drill sergeants, merchants, and teachers.  she now began to
expel the similar representatives of japan.  the latter’s advisory
statesmen were showered with honours and decorations, and sent home.  the
west had awakened japan, and, as japan had then requited the west, japan
was not requited by china.  japan was thanked for her kindly aid and
flung out bag and baggage by her gigantic protégé.  the western nations
chuckled.  japan’s rainbow dream had gone glimmering.  she grew angry.
china laughed at her.  the blood and the swords of the samurai would out,
and japan rashly went to war.  this occurred in 1922, and in seven bloody
months manchuria, korea, and formosa were taken away from her and she was
hurled back, bankrupt, to stifle in her tiny, crowded islands.  exit
japan from the world drama.  thereafter she devoted herself to art, and
her task became to please the world greatly with her creations of wonder
and beauty.

contrary to expectation, china did not prove warlike.  she had no
napoleonic dream, and was content to devote herself to the arts of peace.
after a time of disquiet, the idea was accepted that china was to be
feared, not in war, but in commerce.  it will be seen that the real
danger was not apprehended.  china went on consummating her
machine-civilization.  instead of a large standing army, she developed an
immensely larger and splendidly efficient militia.  her navy was so small
that it was the laughing stock of the world; nor did she attempt to
strengthen her navy.  the treaty ports of the world were never entered by
her visiting battleships.

the real danger lay in the fecundity of her loins, and it was in 1970
that the first cry of alarm was raised.  for some time all territories
adjacent to china had been grumbling at chinese immigration; but now it
suddenly came home to the world that china’s population was 500,000,000.
she had increased by a hundred millions since her awakening.  burchaldter
called attention to the fact that there were more chinese in existence
than white-skinned people.  he performed a simple sum in arithmetic.  he
added together the populations of the united states, canada, new zealand,
australia, south africa, england, france, germany, italy, austria,
european russia, and all scandinavia.  the result was 495,000,000.  and
the population of china overtopped this tremendous total by 5,000,000.
burchaldter’s figures went round the world, and the world shivered.

for many centuries china’s population had been constant.  her territory
had been saturated with population; that is to say, her territory, with
the primitive method of production, had supported the maximum limit of
population.  but when she awoke and inaugurated the machine-civilization,
her productive power had been enormously increased.  thus, on the same
territory, she was able to support a far larger population.  at once the
birth rate began to rise and the death rate to fall.  before, when
population pressed against the means of subsistence, the excess
population had been swept away by famine.  but now, thanks to the
machine-civilization, china’s means of subsistence had been enormously
extended, and there were no famines; her population followed on the heels
of the increase in the means of subsistence.

during this time of transition and development of power, china had
entertained no dreams of conquest.  the chinese was not an imperial race.
it was industrious, thrifty, and peace-loving.  war was looked upon as an
unpleasant but necessary task that at times must be performed.  and so,
while the western races had squabbled and fought, and world-adventured
against one another, china had calmly gone on working at her machines and
growing.  now she was spilling over the boundaries of her empire—that was
all, just spilling over into the adjacent territories with all the
certainty and terrifying slow momentum of a glacier.

following upon the alarm raised by burchaldter’s figures, in 1970 france
made a long-threatened stand.  french indo-china had been overrun, filled
up, by chinese immigrants.  france called a halt.  the chinese wave
flowed on.  france assembled a force of a hundred thousand on the
boundary between her unfortunate colony and china, and china sent down an
army of militia-soldiers a million strong.  behind came the wives and
sons and daughters and relatives, with their personal household luggage,
in a second army.  the french force was brushed aside like a fly.  the
chinese militia-soldiers, along with their families, over five millions
all told, coolly took possession of french indo-china and settled down to
stay for a few thousand years.

outraged france was in arms.  she hurled fleet after fleet against the
coast of china, and nearly bankrupted herself by the effort.  china had
no navy.  she withdrew like a turtle into her shell.  for a year the
french fleets blockaded the coast and bombarded exposed towns and
villages.  china did not mind.  she did not depend upon the rest of the
world for anything.  she calmly kept out of range of the french guns and
went on working.  france wept and wailed, wrung her impotent hands and
appealed to the dumfounded nations.  then she landed a punitive
expedition to march to peking.  it was two hundred and fifty thousand
strong, and it was the flower of france.  it landed without opposition
and marched into the interior.  and that was the last ever seen of it.
the line of communication was snapped on the second day.  not a survivor
came back to tell what had happened.  it had been swallowed up in china’s
cavernous maw, that was all.

in the five years that followed, china’s expansion, in all land
directions, went on apace.  siam was made part of the empire, and, in
spite of all that england could do, burma and the malay peninsula were
overrun; while all along the long south boundary of siberia, russia was
pressed severely by china’s advancing hordes.  the process was simple.
first came the chinese immigration (or, rather, it was already there,
having come there slowly and insidiously during the previous years).
next came the clash of arms and the brushing away of all opposition by a
monster army of militia-soldiers, followed by their families and
household baggage.  and finally came their settling down as colonists in
the conquered territory.  never was there so strange and effective a
method of world conquest.

napal and bhutan were overrun, and the whole northern boundary of india
pressed against by this fearful tide of life.  to the west, bokhara, and,
even to the south and west, afghanistan, were swallowed up.  persia,
turkestan, and all central asia felt the pressure of the flood.  it was
at this time that burchaldter revised his figures.  he had been mistaken.
china’s population must be seven hundred millions, eight hundred
millions, nobody knew how many millions, but at any rate it would soon be
a billion.  there were two chinese for every white-skinned human in the
world, burchaldter announced, and the world trembled.  china’s increase
must have begun immediately, in 1904.  it was remembered that since that
date there had not been a single famine.  at 5,000,000 a year increase,
her total increase in the intervening seventy years must be 350,000,000.
but who was to know?  it might be more.  who was to know anything of this
strange new menace of the twentieth century—china, old china,
rejuvenescent, fruitful, and militant!

the convention of 1975 was called at philadelphia.  all the western
nations, and some few of the eastern, were represented.  nothing was
accomplished.  there was talk of all countries putting bounties on
children to increase the birth rate, but it was laughed to scorn by the
arithmeticians, who pointed out that china was too far in the lead in
that direction.  no feasible way of coping with china was suggested.
china was appealed to and threatened by the united powers, and that was
all the convention of philadelphia came to; and the convention and the
powers were laughed at by china.  li tang fwung, the power behind the
dragon throne, deigned to reply.

“what does china care for the comity of nations?” said li tang fwung.
“we are the most ancient, honourable, and royal of races.  we have our
own destiny to accomplish.  it is unpleasant that our destiny does not
tally with the destiny of the rest of the world, but what would you?  you
have talked windily about the royal races and the heritage of the earth,
and we can only reply that that remains to be seen.  you cannot invade
us.  never mind about your navies.  don’t shout.  we know our navy is
small.  you see we use it for police purposes.  we do not care for the
sea.  our strength is in our population, which will soon be a billion.
thanks to you, we are equipped with all modern war-machinery.  send your
navies.  we will not notice them.  send your punitive expeditions, but
first remember france.  to land half a million soldiers on our shores
would strain the resources of any of you.  and our thousand millions
would swallow them down in a mouthful.  send a million; send five
millions, and we will swallow them down just as readily.  pouf!  a mere
nothing, a meagre morsel.  destroy, as you have threatened, you united
states, the ten million coolies we have forced upon your shores—why, the
amount scarcely equals half of our excess birth rate for a year.”

so spoke li tang fwung.  the world was nonplussed, helpless, terrified.
truly had he spoken.  there was no combating china’s amazing birth rate.
if her population was a billion, and was increasing twenty millions a
year, in twenty-five years it would be a billion and a half—equal to the
total population of the world in 1904.  and nothing could be done.  there
was no way to dam up the over-spilling monstrous flood of life.  war was
futile.  china laughed at a blockade of her coasts.  she welcomed
invasion.  in her capacious maw was room for all the hosts of earth that
could be hurled at her.  and in the meantime her flood of yellow life
poured out and on over asia.  china laughed and read in their magazines
the learned lucubrations of the distracted western scholars.

but there was one scholar china failed to reckon on—jacobus laningdale.
not that he was a scholar, except in the widest sense.  primarily,
jacobus laningdale was a scientist, and, up to that time, a very obscure
scientist, a professor employed in the laboratories of the health office
of new york city.  jacobus laningdale’s head was very like any other
head, but in that head was evolved an idea.  also, in that head was the
wisdom to keep that idea secret.  he did not write an article for the
magazines.  instead, he asked for a vacation.  on september 19, 1975, he
arrived in washington.  it was evening, but he proceeded straight to the
white house, for he had already arranged an audience with the president.
he was closeted with president moyer for three hours.  what passed
between them was not learned by the rest of the world until long after;
in fact, at that time the world was not interested in jacobus laningdale.
next day the president called in his cabinet.  jacobus laningdale was
present.  the proceedings were kept secret.  but that very afternoon
rufus cowdery, secretary of state, left washington, and early the
following morning sailed for england.  the secret that he carried began
to spread, but it spread only among the heads of governments.  possibly
half-a-dozen men in a nation were entrusted with the idea that had formed
in jacobus laningdale’s head.  following the spread of the secret, sprang
up great activity in all the dockyards, arsenals, and navy-yards.  the
people of france and austria became suspicious, but so sincere were their
governments’ calls for confidence that they acquiesced in the unknown
project that was afoot.

this was the time of the great truce.  all countries pledged themselves
solemnly not to go to war with any other country.  the first definite
action was the gradual mobilization of the armies of russia, germany,
austria, italy, greece, and turkey.  then began the eastward movement.
all railroads into asia were glutted with troop trains.  china was the
objective, that was all that was known.  a little later began the great
sea movement.  expeditions of warships were launched from all countries.
fleet followed fleet, and all proceeded to the coast of china.  the
nations cleaned out their navy-yards.  they sent their revenue cutters
and dispatch boats and lighthouse tenders, and they sent their last
antiquated cruisers and battleships.  not content with this, they
impressed the merchant marine.  the statistics show that 58,640 merchant
steamers, equipped with searchlights and rapid-fire guns, were despatched
by the various nations to china.

and china smiled and waited.  on her land side, along her boundaries,
were millions of the warriors of europe.  she mobilized five times as
many millions of her militia and awaited the invasion.  on her sea coasts
she did the same.  but china was puzzled.  after all this enormous
preparation, there was no invasion.  she could not understand.  along the
great siberian frontier all was quiet.  along her coasts the towns and
villages were not even shelled.  never, in the history of the world, had
there been so mighty a gathering of war fleets.  the fleets of all the
world were there, and day and night millions of tons of battleships
ploughed the brine of her coasts, and nothing happened.  nothing was
attempted.  did they think to make her emerge from her shell?  china
smiled.  did they think to tire her out, or starve her out?  china smiled
again.

but on may 1, 1976, had the reader been in the imperial city of peking,
with its then population of eleven millions, he would have witnessed a
curious sight.  he would have seen the streets filled with the chattering
yellow populace, every queued head tilted back, every slant eye turned
skyward.  and high up in the blue he would have beheld a tiny dot of
black, which, because of its orderly evolutions, he would have identified
as an airship.  from this airship, as it curved its flight back and forth
over the city, fell missiles—strange, harmless missiles, tubes of fragile
glass that shattered into thousands of fragments on the streets and
house-tops.  but there was nothing deadly about these tubes of glass.
nothing happened.  there were no explosions.  it is true, three chinese
were killed by the tubes dropping on their heads from so enormous a
height; but what were three chinese against an excess birth rate of
twenty millions?  one tube struck perpendicularly in a fish-pond in a
garden and was not broken.  it was dragged ashore by the master of the
house.  he did not dare to open it, but, accompanied by his friends, and
surrounded by an ever-increasing crowd, he carried the mysterious tube to
the magistrate of the district.  the latter was a brave man.  with all
eyes upon him, he shattered the tube with a blow from his brass-bowled
pipe.  nothing happened.  of those who were very near, one or two thought
they saw some mosquitoes fly out.  that was all.  the crowd set up a
great laugh and dispersed.

as peking was bombarded by glass tubes, so was all china.  the tiny
airships, dispatched from the warships, contained but two men each, and
over all cities, towns, and villages they wheeled and curved, one man
directing the ship, the other man throwing over the glass tubes.

had the reader again been in peking, six weeks later, he would have
looked in vain for the eleven million inhabitants.  some few of them he
would have found, a few hundred thousand, perhaps, their carcasses
festering in the houses and in the deserted streets, and piled high on
the abandoned death-waggons.  but for the rest he would have had to seek
along the highways and byways of the empire.  and not all would he have
found fleeing from plague-stricken peking, for behind them, by hundreds
of thousands of unburied corpses by the wayside, he could have marked
their flight.  and as it was with peking, so it was with all the cities,
towns, and villages of the empire.  the plague smote them all.  nor was
it one plague, nor two plagues; it was a score of plagues.  every
virulent form of infectious death stalked through the land.  too late the
chinese government apprehended the meaning of the colossal preparations,
the marshalling of the world-hosts, the flights of the tin airships, and
the rain of the tubes of glass.  the proclamations of the government were
vain.  they could not stop the eleven million plague-stricken wretches,
fleeing from the one city of peking to spread disease through all the
land.  the physicians and health officers died at their posts; and death,
the all-conqueror, rode over the decrees of the emperor and li tang
fwung.  it rode over them as well, for li tang fwung died in the second
week, and the emperor, hidden away in the summer palace, died in the
fourth week.

had there been one plague, china might have coped with it.  but from a
score of plagues no creature was immune.  the man who escaped smallpox
went down before scarlet fever.  the man who was immune to yellow fever
was carried away by cholera; and if he were immune to that, too, the
black death, which was the bubonic plague, swept him away.  for it was
these bacteria, and germs, and microbes, and bacilli, cultured in the
laboratories of the west, that had come down upon china in the rain of
glass.

all organization vanished.  the government crumbled away.  decrees and
proclamations were useless when the men who made them and signed them one
moment were dead the next.  nor could the maddened millions, spurred on
to flight by death, pause to heed anything.  they fled from the cities to
infect the country, and wherever they fled they carried the plagues with
them.  the hot summer was on—jacobus laningdale had selected the time
shrewdly—and the plague festered everywhere.  much is conjectured of what
occurred, and much has been learned from the stories of the few
survivors.  the wretched creatures stormed across the empire in
many-millioned flight.  the vast armies china had collected on her
frontiers melted away.  the farms were ravaged for food, and no more
crops were planted, while the crops already in were left unattended and
never came to harvest.  the most remarkable thing, perhaps, was the
flights.  many millions engaged in them, charging to the bounds of the
empire to be met and turned back by the gigantic armies of the west.  the
slaughter of the mad hosts on the boundaries was stupendous.  time and
again the guarding line was drawn back twenty or thirty miles to escape
the contagion of the multitudinous dead.

once the plague broke through and seized upon the german and austrian
soldiers who were guarding the borders of turkestan.  preparations had
been made for such a happening, and though sixty thousand soldiers of
europe were carried off, the international corps of physicians isolated
the contagion and dammed it back.  it was during this struggle that it
was suggested that a new plague-germ had originated, that in some way or
other a sort of hybridization between plague-germs had taken place,
producing a new and frightfully virulent germ.  first suspected by
vomberg, who became infected with it and died, it was later isolated and
studied by stevens, hazenfelt, norman, and landers.

such was the unparalleled invasion of china.  for that billion of people
there was no hope.  pent in their vast and festering charnel-house, all
organization and cohesion lost, they could do naught but die.  they could
not escape.  as they were flung back from their land frontiers, so were
they flung back from the sea.  seventy-five thousand vessels patrolled
the coasts.  by day their smoking funnels dimmed the sea-rim, and by
night their flashing searchlights ploughed the dark and harrowed it for
the tiniest escaping junk.  the attempts of the immense fleets of junks
were pitiful.  not one ever got by the guarding sea-hounds.  modern
war-machinery held back the disorganized mass of china, while the plagues
did the work.

but old war was made a thing of laughter.  naught remained to him but
patrol duty.  china had laughed at war, and war she was getting, but it
was ultra-modern war, twentieth century war, the war of the scientist and
the laboratory, the war of jacobus laningdale.  hundred-ton guns were
toys compared with the micro-organic projectiles hurled from the
laboratories, the messengers of death, the destroying angels that stalked
through the empire of a billion souls.

during all the summer and fall of 1976 china was an inferno.  there was
no eluding the microscopic projectiles that sought out the remotest
hiding-places.  the hundreds of millions of dead remained unburied and
the germs multiplied themselves, and, toward the last, millions died
daily of starvation.  besides, starvation weakened the victims and
destroyed their natural defences against the plagues.  cannibalism,
murder, and madness reigned.  and so perished china.

not until the following february, in the coldest weather, were the first
expeditions made.  these expeditions were small, composed of scientists
and bodies of troops; but they entered china from every side.  in spite
of the most elaborate precautions against infection, numbers of soldiers
and a few of the physicians were stricken.  but the exploration went
bravely on.  they found china devastated, a howling wilderness through
which wandered bands of wild dogs and desperate bandits who had survived.
all survivors were put to death wherever found.  and then began the great
task, the sanitation of china.  five years and hundreds of millions of
treasure were consumed, and then the world moved in—not in zones, as was
the idea of baron albrecht, but heterogeneously, according to the
democratic american programme.  it was a vast and happy intermingling of
nationalities that settled down in china in 1982 and the years that
followed—a tremendous and successful experiment in cross-fertilization.
we know to-day the splendid mechanical, intellectual, and art output that
followed.

it was in 1987, the great truce having been dissolved, that the ancient
quarrel between france and germany over alsace-lorraine recrudesced.  the
war-cloud grew dark and threatening in april, and on april 17 the
convention of copenhagen was called.  the representatives of the nations
of the world, being present, all nations solemnly pledged themselves
never to use against one another the laboratory methods of warfare they
had employed in the invasion of china.

the enemy of all the world


it was silas bannerman who finally ran down that scientific wizard and
arch-enemy of mankind, emil gluck.  gluck’s confession, before he went to
the electric chair, threw much light upon the series of mysterious
events, many apparently unrelated, that so perturbed the world between
the years 1933 and 1941.  it was not until that remarkable document was
made public that the world dreamed of there being any connection between
the assassination of the king and queen of portugal and the murders of
the new york city police officers.  while the deeds of emil gluck were
all that was abominable, we cannot but feel, to a certain extent, pity
for the unfortunate, malformed, and maltreated genius.  this side of his
story has never been told before, and from his confession and from the
great mass of evidence and the documents and records of the time we are
able to construct a fairly accurate portrait of him, and to discern the
factors and pressures that moulded him into the human monster he became
and that drove him onward and downward along the fearful path he trod.

emil gluck was born in syracuse, new york, in 1895.  his father, josephus
gluck, was a special policeman and night watchman, who, in the year 1900,
died suddenly of pneumonia.  the mother, a pretty, fragile creature, who,
before her marriage, had been a milliner, grieved herself to death over
the loss of her husband.  this sensitiveness of the mother was the
heritage that in the boy became morbid and horrible.

in 1901, the boy, emil, then six years of age, went to live with his
aunt, mrs. ann bartell.  she was his mother’s sister, but in her breast
was no kindly feeling for the sensitive, shrinking boy.  ann bartell was
a vain, shallow, and heartless woman.  also, she was cursed with poverty
and burdened with a husband who was a lazy, erratic ne’er-do-well.  young
emil gluck was not wanted, and ann bartell could be trusted to impress
this fact sufficiently upon him.  as an illustration of the treatment he
received in that early, formative period, the following instance is
given.

when he had been living in the bartell home a little more than a year, he
broke his leg.  he sustained the injury through playing on the forbidden
roof—as all boys have done and will continue to do to the end of time.
the leg was broken in two places between the knee and thigh.  emil,
helped by his frightened playmates, managed to drag himself to the front
sidewalk, where he fainted.  the children of the neighbourhood were
afraid of the hard-featured shrew who presided over the bartell house;
but, summoning their resolution, they rang the bell and told ann bartell
of the accident.  she did not even look at the little lad who lay
stricken on the sidewalk, but slammed the door and went back to her
wash-tub.  the time passed.  a drizzle came on, and emil gluck, out of
his faint, lay sobbing in the rain.  the leg should have been set
immediately.  as it was, the inflammation rose rapidly and made a nasty
case of it.  at the end of two hours, the indignant women of the
neighbourhood protested to ann bartell.  this time she came out and
looked at the lad.  also she kicked him in the side as he lay helpless at
her feet, and she hysterically disowned him.  he was not her child, she
said, and recommended that the ambulance be called to take him to the
city receiving hospital.  then she went back into the house.

it was a woman, elizabeth shepstone, who came along, learned the
situation, and had the boy placed on a shutter.  it was she who called
the doctor, and who, brushing aside ann bartell, had the boy carried into
the house.  when the doctor arrived, ann bartell promptly warned him that
she would not pay him for his services.  for two months the little emil
lay in bed, the first month on his back without once being turned over;
and he lay neglected and alone, save for the occasional visits of the
unremunerated and over-worked physician.  he had no toys, nothing with
which to beguile the long and tedious hours.  no kind word was spoken to
him, no soothing hand laid upon his brow, no single touch or act of
loving tenderness—naught but the reproaches and harshness of ann bartell,
and the continually reiterated information that he was not wanted.  and
it can well be understood, in such environment, how there was generated
in the lonely, neglected boy much of the bitterness and hostility for his
kind that later was to express itself in deeds so frightful as to terrify
the world.

it would seem strange that, from the hands of ann bartell, emil gluck
should have received a college education; but the explanation is simple.
her ne’er-do-well husband, deserting her, made a strike in the nevada
goldfields, and returned to her a many-times millionaire.  ann bartell
hated the boy, and immediately she sent him to the farristown academy, a
hundred miles away.  shy and sensitive, a lonely and misunderstood little
soul, he was more lonely than ever at farristown.  he never came home, at
vacation, and holidays, as the other boys did.  instead, he wandered
about the deserted buildings and grounds, befriended and misunderstood by
the servants and gardeners, reading much, it is remembered, spending his
days in the fields or before the fire-place with his nose poked always in
the pages of some book.  it was at this time that he over-used his eyes
and was compelled to take up the wearing of glasses, which same were so
prominent in the photographs of him published in the newspapers in 1941.

he was a remarkable student.  application such as his would have taken
him far; but he did not need application.  a glance at a text meant
mastery for him.  the result was that he did an immense amount of
collateral reading and acquired more in half a year than did the average
student in half-a-dozen years.  in 1909, barely fourteen years of age, he
was ready—“more than ready” the headmaster of the academy said—to enter
yale or harvard.  his juvenility prevented him from entering those
universities, and so, in 1909, we find him a freshman at historic bowdoin
college.  in 1913 he graduated with highest honours, and immediately
afterward followed professor bradlough to berkeley, california.  the one
friend that emil gluck discovered in all his life was professor
bradlough.  the latter’s weak lungs had led him to exchange maine for
california, the removal being facilitated by the offer of a professorship
in the state university.  throughout the year 1914, emil gluck resided in
berkeley and took special scientific courses.  toward the end of that
year two deaths changed his prospects and his relations with life.  the
death of professor bradlough took from him the one friend he was ever to
know, and the death of ann bartell left him penniless.  hating the
unfortunate lad to the last, she cut him off with one hundred dollars.

the following year, at twenty years of age, emil gluck was enrolled as an
instructor of chemistry in the university of california.  here the years
passed quietly; he faithfully performed the drudgery that brought him his
salary, and, a student always, he took half-a-dozen degrees.  he was,
among other things, a doctor of sociology, of philosophy, and of science,
though he was known to the world, in later days, only as professor gluck.

he was twenty-seven years old when he first sprang into prominence in the
newspapers through the publication of his book, _sex and progress_.  the
book remains to-day a milestone in the history and philosophy of
marriage.  it is a heavy tome of over seven hundred pages, painfully
careful and accurate, and startlingly original.  it was a book for
scientists, and not one calculated to make a stir.  but gluck, in the
last chapter, using barely three lines for it, mentioned the hypothetical
desirability of trial marriages.  at once the newspapers seized these
three lines, “played them up yellow,” as the slang was in those days, and
set the whole world laughing at emil gluck, the bespectacled young
professor of twenty-seven.  photographers snapped him, he was besieged by
reporters, women’s clubs throughout the land passed resolutions
condemning him and his immoral theories; and on the floor of the
california assembly, while discussing the state appropriation to the
university, a motion demanding the expulsion of gluck was made under
threat of withholding the appropriation—of course, none of his
persecutors had read the book; the twisted newspaper version of only
three lines of it was enough for them.  here began emil gluck’s hatred
for newspaper men.  by them his serious and intrinsically valuable work
of six years had been made a laughing-stock and a notoriety.  to his
dying day, and to their everlasting regret, he never forgave them.

it was the newspapers that were responsible for the next disaster that
befell him.  for the five years following the publication of his book he
had remained silent, and silence for a lonely man is not good.  one can
conjecture sympathetically the awful solitude of emil gluck in that
populous university; for he was without friends and without sympathy.
his only recourse was books, and he went on reading and studying
enormously.  but in 1927 he accepted an invitation to appear before the
human interest society of emeryville.  he did not trust himself to speak,
and as we write we have before us a copy of his learned paper.  it is
sober, scholarly, and scientific, and, it must also be added,
conservative.  but in one place he dealt with, and i quote his words,
“the industrial and social revolution that is taking place in society.”
a reporter present seized upon the word “revolution,” divorced it from
the text, and wrote a garbled account that made emil gluck appear an
anarchist.  at once, “professor gluck, anarchist,” flamed over the wires
and was appropriately “featured” in all the newspapers in the land.

he had attempted to reply to the previous newspaper attack, but now he
remained silent.  bitterness had already corroded his soul.  the
university faculty appealed to him to defend himself, but he sullenly
declined, even refusing to enter in defence a copy of his paper to save
himself from expulsion.  he refused to resign, and was discharged from
the university faculty.  it must be added that political pressure had
been put upon the university regents and the president.

persecuted, maligned, and misunderstood, the forlorn and lonely man made
no attempt at retaliation.  all his life he had been sinned against, and
all his life he had sinned against no one.  but his cup of bitterness was
not yet full to overflowing.  having lost his position, and being without
any income, he had to find work.  his first place was at the union iron
works, in san francisco, where he proved a most able draughtsman.  it was
here that he obtained his firsthand knowledge of battleships and their
construction.  but the reporters discovered him and featured him in his
new vocation.  he immediately resigned and found another place; but after
the reporters had driven him away from half-a-dozen positions, he steeled
himself to brazen out the newspaper persecution.  this occurred when he
started his electroplating establishment—in oakland, on telegraph avenue.
it was a small shop, employing three men and two boys.  gluck himself
worked long hours.  night after night, as policeman carew testified on
the stand, he did not leave the shop till one and two in the morning.  it
was during this period that he perfected the improved ignition device for
gas-engines, the royalties from which ultimately made him wealthy.

he started his electroplating establishment early in the spring of 1928,
and it was in the same year that he formed the disastrous love attachment
for irene tackley.  now it is not to be imagined that an extraordinary
creature such as emil gluck could be any other than an extraordinary
lover.  in addition to his genius, his loneliness, and his morbidness, it
must be taken into consideration that he knew nothing about women.
whatever tides of desire flooded his being, he was unschooled in the
conventional expression of them; while his excessive timidity was bound
to make his love-making unusual.  irene tackley was a rather pretty young
woman, but shallow and light-headed.  at the time she worked in a small
candy store across the street from gluck’s shop.  he used to come in and
drink ice-cream sodas and lemon-squashes, and stare at her.  it seems the
girl did not care for him, and merely played with him.  he was “queer,”
she said; and at another time she called him a crank when describing how
he sat at the counter and peered at her through his spectacles, blushing
and stammering when she took notice of him, and often leaving the shop in
precipitate confusion.

gluck made her the most amazing presents—a silver tea-service, a diamond
ring, a set of furs, opera-glasses, a ponderous _history of the world_ in
many volumes, and a motor-cycle all silver-plated in his own shop.
enters now the girl’s lover, putting his foot down, showing great anger,
compelling her to return gluck’s strange assortment of presents.  this
man, william sherbourne, was a gross and stolid creature, a heavy-jawed
man of the working class who had become a successful building-contractor
in a small way.  gluck did not understand.  he tried to get an
explanation, attempting to speak with the girl when she went home from
work in the evening.  she complained to sherbourne, and one night he gave
gluck a beating.  it was a very severe beating, for it is on the records
of the red cross emergency hospital that gluck was treated there that
night and was unable to leave the hospital for a week.

still gluck did not understand.  he continued to seek an explanation from
the girl.  in fear of sherbourne, he applied to the chief of police for
permission to carry a revolver, which permission was refused, the
newspapers as usual playing it up sensationally.  then came the murder of
irene tackley, six days before her contemplated marriage with sherbourne.
it was on a saturday night.  she had worked late in the candy store,
departing after eleven o’clock with her week’s wages in her purse.  she
rode on a san pablo avenue surface car to thirty-fourth street, where she
alighted and started to walk the three blocks to her home.  that was the
last seen of her alive.  next morning she was found, strangled, in a
vacant lot.

emil gluck was immediately arrested.  nothing that he could do could save
him.  he was convicted, not merely on circumstantial evidence, but on
evidence “cooked up” by the oakland police.  there is no discussion but
that a large portion of the evidence was manufactured.  the testimony of
captain shehan was the sheerest perjury, it being proved long afterward
that on the night in question he had not only not been in the vicinity of
the murder, but that he had been out of the city in a resort on the san
leandro road.  the unfortunate gluck received life imprisonment in san
quentin, while the newspapers and the public held that it was a
miscarriage of justice—that the death penalty should have been visited
upon him.

gluck entered san quentin prison on april 17, 1929.  he was then
thirty-four years of age.  and for three years and a half, much of the
time in solitary confinement, he was left to meditate upon the injustice
of man.  it was during that period that his bitterness corroded home and
he became a hater of all his kind.  three other things he did during the
same period: he wrote his famous treatise, _human morals_, his remarkable
brochure, _the criminal sane_, and he worked out his awful and monstrous
scheme of revenge.  it was an episode that had occurred in his
electroplating establishment that suggested to him his unique weapon of
revenge.  as stated in his confession, he worked every detail out
theoretically during his imprisonment, and was able, on his release,
immediately to embark on his career of vengeance.

his release was sensational.  also it was miserably and criminally
delayed by the soulless legal red tape then in vogue.  on the night of
february 1, 1932, tim haswell, a hold-up man, was shot during an
attempted robbery by a citizen of piedmont heights.  tim haswell lingered
three days, during which time he not only confessed to the murder of
irene tackley, but furnished conclusive proofs of the same.  bert
danniker, a convict dying of consumption in folsom prison, was implicated
as accessory, and his confession followed.  it is inconceivable to us of
to-day—the bungling, dilatory processes of justice a generation ago.
emil gluck was proved in february to be an innocent man, yet he was not
released until the following october.  for eight months, a greatly
wronged man, he was compelled to undergo his unmerited punishment.  this
was not conducive to sweetness and light, and we can well imagine how he
ate his soul with bitterness during those dreary eight months.

he came back to the world in the fall of 1932, as usual a “feature” topic
in all the newspapers.  the papers, instead of expressing heartfelt
regret, continued their old sensational persecution.  one paper did
more—the _san francisco intelligencer_.  john hartwell, its editor,
elaborated an ingenious theory that got around the confessions of the two
criminals and went to show that gluck was responsible, after all, for the
murder of irene tackley.  hartwell died.  and sherbourne died too, while
policeman phillipps was shot in the leg and discharged from the oakland
police force.

the murder of hartwell was long a mystery.  he was alone in his editorial
office at the time.  the reports of the revolver were heard by the office
boy, who rushed in to find hartwell expiring in his chair.  what puzzled
the police was the fact, not merely that he had been shot with his own
revolver, but that the revolver had been exploded in the drawer of his
desk.  the bullets had torn through the front of the drawer and entered
his body.  the police scouted the theory of suicide, murder was dismissed
as absurd, and the blame was thrown upon the eureka smokeless cartridge
company.  spontaneous explosion was the police explanation, and the
chemists of the cartridge company were well bullied at the inquest.  but
what the police did not know was that across the street, in the mercer
building, room 633, rented by emil gluck, had been occupied by emil gluck
at the very moment hartwell’s revolver so mysteriously exploded.

at the time, no connection was made between hartwell’s death and the
death of william sherbourne.  sherbourne had continued to live in the
home he had built for irene tackley, and one morning in january, 1933, he
was found dead.  suicide was the verdict of the coroner’s inquest, for he
had been shot by his own revolver.  the curious thing that happened that
night was the shooting of policeman phillipps on the sidewalk in front of
sherbourne’s house.  the policeman crawled to a police telephone on the
corner and rang up for an ambulance.  he claimed that some one had shot
him from behind in the leg.  the leg in question was so badly shattered
by three ’38 calibre bullets that amputation was necessary.  but when the
police discovered that the damage had been done by his own revolver, a
great laugh went up, and he was charged with having been drunk.  in spite
of his denial of having touched a drop, and of his persistent assertion
that the revolver had been in his hip pocket and that he had not laid a
finger to it, he was discharged from the force.  emil gluck’s confession,
six years later, cleared the unfortunate policeman of disgrace, and he is
alive to-day and in good health, the recipient of a handsome pension from
the city.

emil gluck, having disposed of his immediate enemies, now sought a wider
field, though his enmity for newspaper men and for the police remained
always active.  the royalties on his ignition device for gasolene-engines
had mounted up while he lay in prison, and year by year the earning power
of his invention increased.  he was independent, able to travel wherever
he willed over the earth and to glut his monstrous appetite for revenge.
he had become a monomaniac and an anarchist—not a philosophic anarchist,
merely, but a violent anarchist.  perhaps the word is misused, and he is
better described as a nihilist, or an annihilist.  it is known that he
affiliated with none of the groups of terrorists.  he operated wholly
alone, but he created a thousandfold more terror and achieved a
thousandfold more destruction than all the terrorist groups added
together.

he signalized his departure from california by blowing up fort mason.  in
his confession he spoke of it as a little experiment—he was merely trying
his hand.  for eight years he wandered over the earth, a mysterious
terror, destroying property to the tune of hundreds of millions of
dollars, and destroying countless lives.  one good result of his awful
deeds was the destruction he wrought among the terrorists themselves.
every time he did anything the terrorists in the vicinity were gathered
in by the police dragnet, and many of them were executed.  seventeen were
executed at rome alone, following the assassination of the italian king.

perhaps the most world-amazing achievement of his was the assassination
of the king and queen of portugal.  it was their wedding day.  all
possible precautions had been taken against the terrorists, and the way
from the cathedral, through lisbon’s streets, was double-banked with
troops, while a squad of two hundred mounted troopers surrounded the
carriage.  suddenly the amazing thing happened.  the automatic rifles of
the troopers began to go off, as well as the rifles, in the immediate
vicinity, of the double-banked infantry.  in the excitement the muzzles
of the exploding rifles were turned in all directions.  the slaughter was
terrible—horses, troops, spectators, and the king and queen, were riddled
with bullets.  to complicate the affair, in different parts of the crowd
behind the foot-soldiers, two terrorists had bombs explode on their
persons.  these bombs they had intended to throw if they got the
opportunity.  but who was to know this?  the frightful havoc wrought by
the bursting bombs but added to the confusion; it was considered part of
the general attack.

one puzzling thing that could not be explained away was the conduct of
the troopers with their exploding rifles.  it seemed impossible that they
should be in the plot, yet there were the hundreds their flying bullets
had slain, including the king and queen.  on the other hand, more
baffling than ever was the fact that seventy per cent. of the troopers
themselves had been killed or wounded.  some explained this on the ground
that the loyal foot-soldiers, witnessing the attack on the royal
carriage, had opened fire on the traitors.  yet not one bit of evidence
to verify this could be drawn from the survivors, though many were put to
the torture.  they contended stubbornly that they had not discharged
their rifles at all, but that their rifles had discharged themselves.
they were laughed at by the chemists, who held that, while it was just
barely probable that a single cartridge, charged with the new smokeless
powder, might spontaneously explode, it was beyond all probability and
possibility for all the cartridges in a given area, so charged,
spontaneously to explode.  and so, in the end, no explanation of the
amazing occurrence was reached.  the general opinion of the rest of the
world was that the whole affair was a blind panic of the feverish latins,
precipitated, it was true, by the bursting of two terrorist bombs; and in
this connection was recalled the laughable encounter of long years before
between the russian fleet and the english fishing boats.

and emil gluck chuckled and went his way.  he knew.  but how was the
world to know?  he had stumbled upon the secret in his old electroplating
shop on telegraph avenue in the city of oakland.  it happened, at that
time, that a wireless telegraph station was established by the thurston
power company close to his shop.  in a short time his electroplating vat
was put out of order.  the vat-wiring had many bad joints, and, on
investigation, gluck discovered minute welds at the joints in the wiring.
these, by lowering the resistance, had caused an excessive current to
pass through the solution, “boiling” it and spoiling the work.  but what
had caused the welds? was the question in gluck’s mind.  his reasoning
was simple.  before the establishment of the wireless station, the vat
had worked well.  not until after the establishment of the wireless
station had the vat been ruined.  therefore the wireless station had been
the cause.  but how?  he quickly answered the question.  if an electric
discharge was capable of operating a coherer across three thousand miles
of ocean, then, certainly, the electric discharges from the wireless
station four hundred feet away could produce coherer effects on the bad
joints in the vat-wiring.

gluck thought no more about it at the time.  he merely re-wired his vat
and went on electroplating.  but afterwards, in prison, he remembered the
incident, and like a flash there came into his mind the full significance
of it.  he saw in it the silent, secret weapon with which to revenge
himself on the world.  his great discovery, which died with him, was
control over the direction and scope of the electric discharge.  at the
time, this was the unsolved problem of wireless telegraphy—as it still is
to-day—but emil gluck, in his prison cell, mastered it.  and, when he was
released, he applied it.  it was fairly simple, given the directing power
that was his, to introduce a spark into the powder-magazines of a fort, a
battleship, or a revolver.  and not alone could he thus explode powder at
a distance, but he could ignite conflagrations.  the great boston fire
was started by him—quite by accident, however, as he stated in his
confession, adding that it was a pleasing accident and that he had never
had any reason to regret it.

it was emil gluck that caused the terrible german-american war, with the
loss of 800,000 lives and the consumption of almost incalculable
treasure.  it will be remembered that in 1939, because of the pickard
incident, strained relations existed between the two countries.  germany,
though aggrieved, was not anxious for war, and, as a peace token, sent
the crown prince and seven battleships on a friendly visit to the united
states.  on the night of february 15, the seven warships lay at anchor in
the hudson opposite new york city.  and on that night emil gluck, alone,
with all his apparatus on board, was out in a launch.  this launch, it
was afterwards proved, was bought by him from the ross turner company,
while much of the apparatus he used that night had been purchased from
the columbia electric works.  but this was not known at the time.  all
that was known was that the seven battleships blew up, one after another,
at regular four-minute intervals.  ninety per cent. of the crews and
officers, along with the crown prince, perished.  many years before, the
american battleship _maine_ had been blown up in the harbour of havana,
and war with spain had immediately followed—though there has always
existed a reasonable doubt as to whether the explosion was due to
conspiracy or accident.  but accident could not explain the blowing up of
the seven battleships on the hudson at four-minute intervals.  germany
believed that it had been done by a submarine, and immediately declared
war.  it was six months after gluck’s confession that she returned the
philippines and hawaii to the united states.

in the meanwhile emil gluck, the malevolent wizard and arch-hater,
travelled his whirlwind path of destruction.  he left no traces.
scientifically thorough, he always cleaned up after himself.  his method
was to rent a room or a house, and secretly to install his
apparatus—which apparatus, by the way, he so perfected and simplified
that it occupied little space.  after he had accomplished his purpose he
carefully removed the apparatus.  he bade fair to live out a long life of
horrible crime.

the epidemic of shooting of new york city policemen was a remarkable
affair.  it became one of the horror mysteries of the time.  in two short
weeks over a hundred policemen were shot in the legs by their own
revolvers.  inspector jones did not solve the mystery, but it was his
idea that finally outwitted gluck.  on his recommendation the policemen
ceased carrying revolvers, and no more accidental shootings occurred.

it was in the early spring of 1940 that gluck destroyed the mare island
navy-yard.  from a room in vallejo he sent his electric discharges across
the vallejo straits to mare island.  he first played his flashes on the
battleship _maryland_.  she lay at the dock of one of the mine-magazines.
on her forward deck, on a huge temporary platform of timbers, were
disposed over a hundred mines.  these mines were for the defence of the
golden gate.  any one of these mines was capable of destroying a dozen
battleships, and there were over a hundred mines.  the destruction was
terrific, but it was only gluck’s overture.  he played his flashes down
the mare island shore, blowing up five torpedo boats, the torpedo
station, and the great magazine at the eastern end of the island.
returning westward again, and scooping in occasional isolated magazines
on the high ground back from the shore, he blew up three cruisers and the
battleships _oregon_, _delaware_, _new hampshire_, and _florida_—the
latter had just gone into dry-dock, and the magnificent dry-dock was
destroyed along with her.

it was a frightful catastrophe, and a shiver of horror passed through the
land.  but it was nothing to what was to follow.  in the late fall of
that year emil gluck made a clean sweep of the atlantic seaboard from
maine to florida.  nothing escaped.  forts, mines, coast defences of all
sorts, torpedo stations, magazines—everything went up.  three months
afterward, in midwinter, he smote the north shore of the mediterranean
from gibraltar to greece in the same stupefying manner.  a wail went up
from the nations.  it was clear that human agency was behind all this
destruction, and it was equally clear, through emil gluck’s impartiality,
that the destruction was not the work of any particular nation.  one
thing was patent, namely, that whoever was the human behind it all, that
human was a menace to the world.  no nation was safe.  there was no
defence against this unknown and all-powerful foe.  warfare was
futile—nay, not merely futile but itself the very essence of the peril.
for a twelve-month the manufacture of powder ceased, and all soldiers and
sailors were withdrawn from all fortifications and war vessels.  and even
a world-disarmament was seriously considered at the convention of the
powers, held at the hague at that time.

and then silas bannerman, a secret service agent of the united states,
leaped into world-fame by arresting emil gluck.  at first bannerman was
laughed at, but he had prepared his case well, and in a few weeks the
most sceptical were convinced of emil gluck’s guilt.  the one thing,
however, that silas bannerman never succeeded in explaining, even to his
own satisfaction, was how first he came to connect gluck with the
atrocious crimes.  it is true, bannerman was in vallejo, on secret
government business, at the time of the destruction of mare island; and
it is true that on the streets of vallejo emil gluck was pointed out to
him as a queer crank; but no impression was made at the time.  it was not
until afterward, when on a vacation in the rocky mountains and when
reading the first published reports of the destruction along the atlantic
coast, that suddenly bannerman thought of emil gluck.  and on the instant
there flashed into his mind the connection between gluck and the
destruction.  it was only an hypothesis, but it was sufficient.  the
great thing was the conception of the hypothesis, in itself an act of
unconscious cerebration—a thing as unaccountable as the flashing, for
instance, into newton’s mind of the principle of gravitation.

the rest was easy.  where was gluck at the time of the destruction along
the atlantic sea-board? was the question that formed in bannerman’s mind.
by his own request he was put upon the case.  in no time he ascertained
that gluck had himself been up and down the atlantic coast in the late
fall of 1940.  also he ascertained that gluck had been in new york city
during the epidemic of the shooting of police officers.  where was gluck
now? was bannerman’s next query.  and, as if in answer, came the
wholesale destruction along the mediterranean.  gluck had sailed for
europe a month before—bannerman knew that.  it was not necessary for
bannerman to go to europe.  by means of cable messages and the
co-operation of the european secret services, he traced gluck’s course
along the mediterranean and found that in every instance it coincided
with the blowing up of coast defences and ships.  also, he learned that
gluck had just sailed on the green star liner _plutonic_ for the united
states.

the case was complete in bannerman’s mind, though in the interval of
waiting he worked up the details.  in this he was ably assisted by george
brown, an operator employed by the wood’s system of wireless telegraphy.
when the _plutonic_ arrived off sandy hook she was boarded by bannerman
from a government tug, and emil gluck was made a prisoner.  the trial and
the confession followed.  in the confession gluck professed regret only
for one thing, namely, that he had taken his time.  as he said, had he
dreamed that he was ever to be discovered he would have worked more
rapidly and accomplished a thousand times the destruction he did.  his
secret died with him, though it is now known that the french government
managed to get access to him and offered him a billion francs for his
invention wherewith he was able to direct and closely to confine electric
discharges.  “what!” was gluck’s reply—“to sell to you that which would
enable you to enslave and maltreat suffering humanity?”  and though the
war departments of the nations have continued to experiment in their
secret laboratories, they have so far failed to light upon the slightest
trace of the secret.  emil gluck was executed on december 4, 1941, and so
died, at the age of forty-six, one of the world’s most unfortunate
geniuses, a man of tremendous intellect, but whose mighty powers, instead
of making toward good, were so twisted and warped that he became the most
amazing of criminals.

the dream of debs


i awoke fully an hour before my customary time.  this in itself was
remarkable, and i lay very wide awake, pondering over it.  something was
the matter, something was wrong—i knew not what.  i was oppressed by a
premonition of something terrible that had happened or was about to
happen.  but what was it?  i strove to orient myself.  i remembered that
at the time of the great earthquake of 1906 many claimed they awakened
some moments before the first shock and that during these moments they
experienced strange feelings of dread.  was san francisco again to be
visited by earthquake?

i lay for a full minute, numbly expectant, but there occurred no reeling
of walls nor shock and grind of falling masonry.  all was quiet.  that
was it!  the silence!  no wonder i had been perturbed.  the hum of the
great live city was strangely absent.  the surface cars passed along my
street, at that time of day, on an average of one every three minutes;
but in the ten succeeding minutes not a car passed.  perhaps it was a
street-railway strike, was my thought; or perhaps there had been an
accident and the power was shut off.  but no, the silence was too
profound.  i heard no jar and rattle of waggon wheels, nor stamp of
iron-shod hoofs straining up the steep cobble-stones.

pressing the push-button beside my bed, i strove to hear the sound of the
bell, though i well knew it was impossible for the sound to rise three
stories to me even if the bell did ring.  it rang all right, for a few
minutes later brown entered with the tray and morning paper.  though his
features were impassive as ever, i noted a startled, apprehensive light
in his eyes.  i noted, also, that there was no cream on the tray.

“the creamery did not deliver this morning,” he explained; “nor did the
bakery.”

i glanced again at the tray.  there were no fresh french rolls—only
slices of stale graham bread from yesterday, the most detestable of bread
so far as i was concerned.

“nothing was delivered this morning, sir,” brown started to explain
apologetically; but i interrupted him.

“the paper?”

“yes, sir, it was delivered, but it was the only thing, and it is the
last time, too.  there won’t be any paper to-morrow.  the paper says so.
can i send out and get you some condensed milk?”

i shook my head, accepted the coffee black, and spread open the paper.
the headlines explained everything—explained too much, in fact, for the
lengths of pessimism to which the journal went were ridiculous.  a
general strike, it said, had been called all over the united states; and
most foreboding anxieties were expressed concerning the provisioning of
the great cities.

i read on hastily, skimming much and remembering much of labour troubles
in the past.  for a generation the general strike had been the dream of
organized labour, which dream had arisen originally in the mind of debs,
one of the great labour leaders of thirty years before.  i recollected
that in my young college-settlement days i had even written an article on
the subject for one of the magazines and that i had entitled it “the
dream of debs.”  and i must confess that i had treated the idea very
cavalierly and academically as a dream and nothing more.  time and the
world had rolled on, gompers was gone, the american federation of labour
was gone, and gone was debs with all his wild revolutionary ideas; but
the dream had persisted, and here it was at last realized in fact.  but i
laughed, as i read, at the journal’s gloomy outlook.  i knew better.  i
had seen organized labour worsted in too many conflicts.  it would be a
matter only of days when the thing would be settled.  this was a national
strike, and it wouldn’t take the government long to break it.

i threw the paper down and proceeded to dress.  it would certainly be
interesting to be out in the streets of san francisco when not a wheel
was turning and the whole city was taking an enforced vacation.

“i beg your pardon, sir,” brown said, as he handed me my cigar-case, “but
mr. harmmed has asked to see you before you go out.”

“send him in right away,” i answered.

harmmed was the butler.  when he entered i could see he was labouring
under controlled excitement.  he came at once to the point.

“what shall i do, sir?  there will be needed provisions, and the delivery
drivers are on strike.  and the electricity is shut off—i guess they’re
on strike, too.”

“are the shops open?” i asked.

“only the small ones, sir.  the retail clerks are out, and the big ones
can’t open; but the owners and their families are running the little ones
themselves.”

“then take the machine,” i said, “and go the rounds and make your
purchases.  buy plenty of everything you need or may need.  get a box of
candles—no, get half-a-dozen boxes.  and, when you’re done, tell harrison
to bring the machine around to the club for me—not later than eleven.”

harmmed shook his head gravely.  “mr. harrison has struck along with the
chauffeurs’ union, and i don’t know how to run the machine myself.”

“oh, ho, he has, has he?” said i.  “well, when next mister harrison happens
around you tell him that he can look elsewhere for a position.”

“yes, sir.”

“you don’t happen to belong to a butlers’ union, do you, harmmed?”

“no, sir,” was the answer.  “and even if i did i’d not desert my employer
in a crisis like this.  no, sir, i would—”

“all right, thank you,” i said.  “now you get ready to accompany me.
i’ll run the machine myself, and we’ll lay in a stock of provisions to
stand a siege.”

it was a beautiful first of may, even as may days go.  the sky was
cloudless, there was no wind, and the air was warm—almost balmy.  many
autos were out, but the owners were driving them themselves.  the streets
were crowded but quiet.  the working class, dressed in its sunday best,
was out taking the air and observing the effects of the strike.  it was
all so unusual, and withal so peaceful, that i found myself enjoying it.
my nerves were tingling with mild excitement.  it was a sort of placid
adventure.  i passed miss chickering.  she was at the helm of her little
runabout.  she swung around and came after me, catching me at the corner.

“oh, mr. corf!”’ she hailed.  “do you know where i can buy candles?  i’ve
been to a dozen shops, and they’re all sold out.  it’s dreadfully awful,
isn’t it?”

but her sparkling eyes gave the lie to her words.  like the rest of us,
she was enjoying it hugely.  quite an adventure it was, getting those
candles.  it was not until we went across the city and down into the
working-class quarter south of market street that we found small corner
groceries that had not yet sold out.  miss chickering thought one box was
sufficient, but i persuaded her into taking four.  my car was large, and
i laid in a dozen boxes.  there was no telling what delays might arise in
the settlement of the strike.  also, i filled the car with sacks of
flour, baking-powder, tinned goods, and all the ordinary necessaries of
life suggested by harmmed, who fussed around and clucked over the
purchases like an anxious old hen.

the remarkable thing, that first day of the strike, was that no one
really apprehended anything serious.  the announcement of organized
labour in the morning papers that it was prepared to stay out a month or
three months was laughed at.  and yet that very first day we might have
guessed as much from the fact that the working class took practically no
part in the great rush to buy provisions.  of course not.  for weeks and
months, craftily and secretly, the whole working class had been laying in
private stocks of provisions.  that was why we were permitted to go down
and buy out the little groceries in the working-class neighbourhoods.

it was not until i arrived at the club that afternoon that i began to
feel the first alarm.  everything was in confusion.  there were no olives
for the cocktails, and the service was by hitches and jerks.  most of the
men were angry, and all were worried.  a babel of voices greeted me as i
entered.  general folsom, nursing his capacious paunch in a window-seat
in the smoking-room was defending himself against half-a-dozen excited
gentlemen who were demanding that he should do something.

“what can i do more than i have done?” he was saying.  “there are no
orders from washington.  if you gentlemen will get a wire through i’ll do
anything i am commanded to do.  but i don’t see what can be done.  the
first thing i did this morning, as soon as i learned of the strike, was
to order in the troops from the presidio—three thousand of them.  they’re
guarding the banks, the mint, the post office, and all the public
buildings.  there is no disorder whatever.  the strikers are keeping the
peace perfectly.  you can’t expect me to shoot them down as they walk
along the streets with wives and children all in their best bib and
tucker.”

“i’d like to know what’s happening on wall street,” i heard jimmy wombold
say as i passed along.  i could imagine his anxiety, for i knew that he
was deep in the big consolidated-western deal.

“say, corf,” atkinson bustled up to me, “is your machine running?”

“yes,” i answered, “but what’s the matter with your own?”

“broken down, and the garages are all closed.  and my wife’s somewhere
around truckee, i think, stalled on the overland.  can’t get a wire to
her for love or money.  she should have arrived this evening.  she may be
starving.  lend me your machine.”

“can’t get it across the bay,” halstead spoke up.  “the ferries aren’t
running.  but i tell you what you can do.  there’s rollinson—oh,
rollinson, come here a moment.  atkinson wants to get a machine across
the bay.  his wife is stuck on the overland at truckee.  can’t you bring
the _lurlette_ across from tiburon and carry the machine over for him?”

the _lurlette_ was a two-hundred-ton, ocean-going schooner-yacht.

rollinson shook his head.  “you couldn’t get a longshoreman to land the
machine on board, even if i could get the _lurlette_ over, which i can’t,
for the crew are members of the coast seamen’s union, and they’re on
strike along with the rest.”

“but my wife may be starving,” i could hear atkinson wailing as i moved
on.

at the other end of the smoking-room i ran into a group of men bunched
excitedly and angrily around bertie messener.  and bertie was stirring
them up and prodding them in his cool, cynical way.  bertie didn’t care
about the strike.  he didn’t care much about anything.  he was blasé—at
least in all the clean things of life; the nasty things had no attraction
for him.  he was worth twenty millions, all of it in safe investments,
and he had never done a tap of productive work in his life—inherited it
all from his father and two uncles.  he had been everywhere, seen
everything, and done everything but get married, and this last in the
face of the grim and determined attack of a few hundred ambitious mammas.
for years he had been the greatest catch, and as yet he had avoided being
caught.  he was disgracefully eligible.  on top of his wealth he was
young, handsome, and, as i said before, clean.  he was a great athlete, a
young blond god that did everything perfectly and admirably with the
solitary exception of matrimony.  and he didn’t care about anything, had
no ambitions, no passions, no desire to do the very things he did so much
better than other men.

“this is sedition!” one man in the group was crying.  another called it
revolt and revolution, and another called it anarchy.

“i can’t see it,” bertie said.  “i have been out in the streets all
morning.  perfect order reigns.  i never saw a more law-abiding populace.
there’s no use calling it names.  it’s not any of those things.  it’s
just what it claims to be, a general strike, and it’s your turn to play,
gentlemen.”

“and we’ll play all right!” cried garfield, one of the traction
millionaires.  “we’ll show this dirt where its place is—the beasts!  wait
till the government takes a hand.”

“but where is the government?” bertie interposed.  “it might as well be
at the bottom of the sea so far as you’re concerned.  you don’t know
what’s happening at washington.  you don’t know whether you’ve got a
government or not.”

“don’t you worry about that,” garfield blurted out.

“i assure you i’m not worrying,” bertie smiled languidly.  “but it seems
to me it’s what you fellows are doing.  look in the glass, garfield.”

garfield did not look, but had he looked he would have seen a very
excited gentleman with rumpled, iron-grey hair, a flushed face, mouth
sullen and vindictive, and eyes wildly gleaming.

“it’s not right, i tell you,” little hanover said; and from his tone i
was sure that he had already said it a number of times.

“now that’s going too far, hanover,” bertie replied.  “you fellows make
me tired.  you’re all open-shop men.  you’ve eroded my eardrums with your
endless gabble for the open shop and the right of a man to work.  you’ve
harangued along those lines for years.  labour is doing nothing wrong in
going out on this general strike.  it is violating no law of god nor man.
don’t you talk, hanover.  you’ve been ringing the changes too long on the
god-given right to work . . . or not to work; you can’t escape the
corollary.  it’s a dirty little sordid scrap, that’s all the whole thing
is.  you’ve got labour down and gouged it, and now labour’s got you down
and is gouging you, that’s all, and you’re squealing.”

every man in the group broke out in indignant denials that labour had
ever been gouged.

“no, sir!” garfield was shouting.  “we’ve done the best for labour.
instead of gouging it, we’ve given it a chance to live.  we’ve made work
for it.  where would labour be if it hadn’t been for us?”

“a whole lot better off,” bertie sneered.  “you’ve got labour down and
gouged it every time you got a chance, and you went out of your way to
make chances.”

“no!  no!” were the cries.

“there was the teamsters’ strike, right here in san francisco,” bertie
went on imperturbably.  “the employers’ association precipitated that
strike.  you know that.  and you know i know it, too, for i’ve sat in
these very rooms and heard the inside talk and news of the fight.  first
you precipitated the strike, then you bought the mayor and the chief of
police and broke the strike.  a pretty spectacle, you philanthropists
getting the teamsters down and gouging them.

“hold on, i’m not through with you.  it’s only last year that the labour
ticket of colorado elected a governor.  he was never seated.  you know
why.  you know how your brother philanthropists and capitalists of
colorado worked it.  it was a case of getting labour down and gouging it.
you kept the president of the south-western amalgamated association of
miners in jail for three years on trumped-up murder charges, and with him
out of the way you broke up the association.  that was gouging labour,
you’ll admit.  the third time the graduated income tax was declared
unconstitutional was a gouge.  so was the eight-hour bill you killed in
the last congress.

“and of all unmitigated immoral gouges, your destruction of the
closed-shop principle was the limit.  you know how it was done. you
bought out farburg, the last president of the old american federation of
labour.  he was your creature—or the creature of all the trusts and
employers’ associations, which is the same thing.  you precipitated the
big closed-shop strike.  farburg betrayed that strike.  you won, and the
old american federation of labour crumbled to pieces.  you fellows
destroyed it, and by so doing undid yourselves; for right on top of it
began the organization of the i.l.w.—the biggest and solidest
organization of labour the united states has ever seen, and you are
responsible for its existence and for the present general strike.  you
smashed all the old federations and drove labour into the i.l.w., and the
i.l.w. called the general strike—still fighting for the closed shop.  and
then you have the effrontery to stand here face to face and tell me that
you never got labour down and gouged it.  bah!”

this time there were no denials.  garfield broke out in self-defence—

“we’ve done nothing we were not compelled to do, if we were to win.”

“i’m not saying anything about that,” bertie answered.  “what i am
complaining about is your squealing now that you’re getting a taste of
your own medicine.  how many strikes have you won by starving labour into
submission?  well, labour’s worked out a scheme whereby to starve you
into submission.  it wants the closed shop, and, if it can get it by
starving you, why, starve you shall.”

“i notice that you have profited in the past by those very labour gouges
you mention,” insinuated brentwood, one of the wiliest and most astute of
our corporation lawyers.  “the receiver is as bad as the thief,” he
sneered.  “you had no hand in the gouging, but you took your whack out of
the gouge.”

“that is quite beside the question, brentwood,” bertie drawled.  “you’re
as bad as hanover, intruding the moral element.  i haven’t said that
anything is right or wrong.  it’s all a rotten game, i know; and my sole
kick is that you fellows are squealing now that you’re down and labour’s
taking a gouge out of you.  of course i’ve taken the profits from the
gouging and, thanks to you, gentlemen, without having personally to do
the dirty work.  you did that for me—oh, believe me, not because i am
more virtuous than you, but because my good father and his various
brothers left me a lot of money with which to pay for the dirty work.”

“if you mean to insinuate—” brentwood began hotly.

“hold on, don’t get all-ruffled up,” bertie interposed insolently.
“there’s no use in playing hypocrites in this thieves’ den.  the high and
lofty is all right for the newspapers, boys’ clubs, and sunday
schools—that’s part of the game; but for heaven’s sake don’t let’s play
it on one another.  you know, and you know that i know just what jobbery
was done in the building trades’ strike last fall, who put up the money,
who did the work, and who profited by it.”  (brentwood flushed darkly.)
“but we are all tarred with the same brush, and the best thing for us to
do is to leave morality out of it.  again i repeat, play the game, play
it to the last finish, but for goodness’ sake don’t squeal when you get
hurt.”

when i left the group bertie was off on a new tack tormenting them with
the more serious aspects of the situation, pointing out the shortage of
supplies that was already making itself felt, and asking them what they
were going to do about it.  a little later i met him in the cloak-room,
leaving, and gave him a lift home in my machine.

“it’s a great stroke, this general strike,” he said, as we bowled along
through the crowded but orderly streets.  “it’s a smashing body-blow.
labour caught us napping and struck at our weakest place, the stomach.
i’m going to get out of san francisco, corf.  take my advice and get out,
too.  head for the country, anywhere.  you’ll have more chance.  buy up a
stock of supplies and get into a tent or a cabin somewhere.  soon
there’ll be nothing but starvation in this city for such as we.”

how correct bertie messener was i never dreamed.  i decided that he was
an alarmist.  as for myself, i was content to remain and watch the fun.
after i dropped him, instead of going directly home, i went on in a hunt
for more food.  to my surprise, i learned that the small groceries where
i had bought in the morning were sold out.  i extended my search to the
potrero, and by good luck managed to pick up another box of candles, two
sacks of wheat flour, ten pounds of graham flour (which would do for the
servants), a case of tinned corn, and two cases of tinned tomatoes.  it
did look as though there was going to be at least a temporary food
shortage, and i hugged myself over the goodly stock of provisions i had
laid in.

the next morning i had my coffee in bed as usual, and, more than the
cream, i missed the daily paper.  it was this absence of knowledge of
what was going on in the world that i found the chief hardship.  down at
the club there was little news.  rider had crossed from oakland in his
launch, and halstead had been down to san jose and back in his machine.
they reported the same conditions in those places as in san francisco.
everything was tied up by the strike.  all grocery stocks had been bought
out by the upper classes.  and perfect order reigned.  but what was
happening over the rest of the country—in chicago?  new york?
washington?  most probably the same things that were happening with us,
we concluded; but the fact that we did not know with absolute surety was
irritating.

general folsom had a bit of news.  an attempt had been made to place army
telegraphers in the telegraph offices, but the wires had been cut in
every direction.  this was, so far, the one unlawful act committed by
labour, and that it was a concerted act he was fully convinced.  he had
communicated by wireless with the army post at benicia, the telegraph
lines were even then being patrolled by soldiers all the way to
sacramento.  once, for one short instant, they had got the sacramento
call, then the wires, somewhere, were cut again.  general folsom reasoned
that similar attempts to open communication were being made by the
authorities all the way across the continent, but he was non-committal as
to whether or not he thought the attempt would succeed.  what worried him
was the wire-cutting; he could not but believe that it was an important
part of the deep-laid labour conspiracy.  also, he regretted that the
government had not long since established its projected chain of wireless
stations.

the days came and went, and for a while it was a humdrum time.  nothing
happened.  the edge of excitement had become blunted.  the streets were
not so crowded.  the working class did not come uptown any more to see
how we were taking the strike.  and there were not so many automobiles
running around.  the repair-shops and garages were closed, and whenever a
machine broke down it went out of commission.  the clutch on mine broke,
and neither love nor money could get it repaired.  like the rest, i was
now walking.  san francisco lay dead, and we did not know what was
happening over the rest of the country.  but from the very fact that we
did not know we could conclude only that the rest of the country lay as
dead as san francisco.  from time to time the city was placarded with the
proclamations of organized labour—these had been printed months before,
and evidenced how thoroughly the i.l.w. had prepared for the strike.
every detail had been worked out long in advance.  no violence had
occurred as yet, with the exception of the shooting of a few wire-cutters
by the soldiers, but the people of the slums were starving and growing
ominously restless.

the business men, the millionaires, and the professional class held
meetings and passed resolutions, but there was no way of making the
proclamations public.  they could not even get them printed.  one result
of these meetings, however, was that general folsom was persuaded into
taking military possession of the wholesale houses and of all the flour,
grain, and food warehouses.  it was high time, for suffering was becoming
acute in the homes of the rich, and bread-lines were necessary.  i knew
that my servants were beginning to draw long faces, and it was
amazing—the hole they made in my stock of provisions.  in fact, as i
afterward surmised, each servant was stealing from me and secreting a
private stock of provisions for himself.

but with the formation of the bread-lines came new troubles.  there was
only so much of a food reserve in san francisco, and at the best it could
not last long.  organized labour, we knew, had its private supplies;
nevertheless, the whole working class joined the bread-lines.  as a
result, the provisions general folsom had taken possession of diminished
with perilous rapidity.  how were the soldiers to distinguish between a
shabby middle-class man, a member of the i.l.w., or a slum dweller?  the
first and the last had to be fed, but the soldiers did not know all the
i.l.w. men in the city, much less the wives and sons and daughters of the
i.l.w. men.  the employers helping, a few of the known union men were
flung out of the bread-lines; but that amounted to nothing.  to make
matters worse, the government tugs that had been hauling food from the
army depots on mare island to angel island found no more food to haul.
the soldiers now received their rations from the confiscated provisions,
and they received them first.

the beginning of the end was in sight.  violence was beginning to show
its face.  law and order were passing away, and passing away, i must
confess, among the slum people and the upper classes.  organized labour
still maintained perfect order.  it could well afford to—it had plenty to
eat.  i remember the afternoon at the club when i caught halstead and
brentwood whispering in a corner.  they took me in on the venture.
brentwood’s machine was still in running order, and they were going out
cow-stealing.  halstead had a long butcher knife and a cleaver.  we went
out to the outskirts of the city.  here and there were cows grazing, but
always they were guarded by their owners.  we pursued our quest,
following along the fringe of the city to the east, and on the hills near
hunter’s point we came upon a cow guarded by a little girl.  there was
also a young calf with the cow.  we wasted no time on preliminaries.  the
little girl ran away screaming, while we slaughtered the cow.  i omit the
details, for they are not nice—we were unaccustomed to such work, and we
bungled it.

but in the midst of it, working with the haste of fear, we heard cries,
and we saw a number of men running toward us.  we abandoned the spoils
and took to our heels.  to our surprise we were not pursued.  looking
back, we saw the men hurriedly cutting up the cow.  they had been on the
same lay as ourselves.  we argued that there was plenty for all, and ran
back.  the scene that followed beggars description.  we fought and
squabbled over the division like savages.  brentwood, i remember, was a
perfect brute, snarling and snapping and threatening that murder would be
done if we did not get our proper share.

and we were getting our share when there occurred a new irruption on the
scene.  this time it was the dreaded peace officers of the i.l.w.  the
little girl had brought them.  they were armed with whips and clubs, and
there were a score of them.  the little girl danced up and down in anger,
the tears streaming down her cheeks, crying: “give it to ’em!  give it to
’em!  that guy with the specs—he did it!  mash his face for him!  mash
his face!”  that guy with the specs was i, and i got my face mashed, too,
though i had the presence of mind to take off my glasses at the first.
my! but we did receive a trouncing as we scattered in all directions.
brentwood, halstead, and i fled away for the machine.  brentwood’s nose
was bleeding, while halstead’s cheek was cut across with the scarlet
slash of a black-snake whip.

and, lo, when the pursuit ceased and we had gained the machine, there,
hiding behind it, was the frightened calf.  brentwood warned us to be
cautious, and crept up on it like a wolf or tiger.  knife and cleaver had
been left behind, but brentwood still had his hands, and over and over on
the ground he rolled with the poor little calf as he throttled it.  we
threw the carcass into the machine, covered it over with a robe, and
started for home.  but our misfortunes had only begun.  we blew out a
tyre.  there was no way of fixing it, and twilight was coming on.  we
abandoned the machine, brentwood pulling and staggering along in advance,
the calf, covered by the robe, slung across his shoulders.  we took turn
about carrying that calf, and it nearly killed us.  also, we lost our
way.  and then, after hours of wandering and toil, we encountered a gang
of hoodlums.  they were not i.l.w. men, and i guess they were as hungry
as we.  at any rate, they got the calf and we got the thrashing.
brentwood raged like a madman the rest of the way home, and he looked
like one, with his torn clothes, swollen nose, and blackened eyes.

there wasn’t any more cow-stealing after that.  general folsom sent his
troopers out and confiscated all the cows, and his troopers, aided by the
militia, ate most of the meat.  general folsom was not to be blamed; it
was his duty to maintain law and order, and he maintained it by means of
the soldiers, wherefore he was compelled to feed them first of all.

it was about this time that the great panic occurred.  the wealthy
classes precipitated the flight, and then the slum people caught the
contagion and stampeded wildly out of the city.  general folsom was
pleased.  it was estimated that at least 200,000 had deserted san
francisco, and by that much was his food problem solved.  well do i
remember that day.  in the morning i had eaten a crust of bread.  half of
the afternoon i had stood in the bread-line; and after dark i returned
home, tired and miserable, carrying a quart of rice and a slice of bacon.
brown met me at the door.  his face was worn and terrified.  all the
servants had fled, he informed me.  he alone remained.  i was touched by
his faithfulness and, when i learned that he had eaten nothing all day, i
divided my food with him.  we cooked half the rice and half the bacon,
sharing it equally and reserving the other half for morning.  i went to
bed with my hunger, and tossed restlessly all night.  in the morning i
found brown had deserted me, and, greater misfortune still, he had stolen
what remained of the rice and bacon.

it was a gloomy handful of men that came together at the club that
morning.  there was no service at all.  the last servant was gone.  i
noticed, too, that the silver was gone, and i learned where it had gone.
the servants had not taken it, for the reason, i presume, that the club
members got to it first.  their method of disposing of it was simple.
down south of market street, in the dwellings of the i.l.w., the
housewives had given square meals in exchange for it.  i went back to my
house.  yes, my silver was gone—all but a massive pitcher.  this i
wrapped up and carried down south of market street.

i felt better after the meal, and returned to the club to learn if there
was anything new in the situation.  hanover, collins, and dakon were just
leaving.  there was no one inside, they told me, and they invited me to
come along with them.  they were leaving the city, they said, on dakon’s
horses, and there was a spare one for me. dakon had four magnificent
carriage horses that he wanted to save, and general folsom had given him
the tip that next morning all the horses that remained in the city were
to be confiscated for food.  there were not many horses left, for tens of
thousands of them had been turned loose into the country when the hay and
grain gave out during the first days.  birdall, i remember, who had great
draying interests, had turned loose three hundred dray horses.  at an
average value of five hundred dollars, this had amounted to $150,000.  he
had hoped, at first, to recover most of the horses after the strike was
over, but in the end he never recovered one of them.  they were all eaten
by the people that fled from san francisco.  for that matter, the killing
of the army mules and horses for food had already begun.

fortunately for dakon, he had had a plentiful supply of hay and grain
stored in his stable.  we managed to raise four saddles, and we found the
animals in good condition and spirited, withal unused to being ridden.  i
remembered the san francisco of the great earthquake as we rode through
the streets, but this san francisco was vastly more pitiable.  no
cataclysm of nature had caused this, but, rather, the tyranny of the
labour unions.  we rode down past union square and through the theatre,
hotel, and shopping districts.  the streets were deserted.  here and
there stood automobiles, abandoned where they had broken down or when the
gasolene had given out.  there was no sign of life, save for the
occasional policemen and the soldiers guarding the banks and public
buildings.  once we came upon an i.l.w. man pasting up the latest
proclamation.  we stopped to read.  “we have maintained an orderly
strike,” it ran; “and we shall maintain order to the end.  the end will
come when our demands are satisfied, and our demands will be satisfied
when we have starved our employers into submission, as we ourselves in
the past have often been starved into submission.”

“messener’s very words,” collins said.  “and i, for one, am ready to
submit, only they won’t give me a chance to submit.  i haven’t had a full
meal in an age.  i wonder what horse-meat tastes like?”

we stopped to read another proclamation: “when we think our employers are
ready to submit we shall open up the telegraphs and place the employers’
associations of the united states in communication.  but only messages
relating to peace terms shall be permitted over the wires.”

we rode on, crossed market street, and a little later were passing
through the working-class district.  here the streets were not deserted.
leaning over the gates or standing in groups were the i.l.w. men.  happy,
well-fed children were playing games, and stout housewives sat on the
front steps gossiping.  one and all cast amused glances at us.  little
children ran after us, crying: “hey, mister, ain’t you hungry?”  and one
woman, nursing a child at her breast, called to dakon: “say, fatty, i’ll
give you a meal for your skate—ham and potatoes, currant jelly, white
bread, canned butter, and two cups of coffee.”

“have you noticed, the last few days,” hanover remarked to me, “that
there’s not been a stray dog in the streets?”

i had noticed, but i had not thought about it before.  it was high time
to leave the unfortunate city.  we at last managed to connect with the
san bruno road, along which we headed south.  i had a country place near
menlo, and it was our objective.  but soon we began to discover that the
country was worse off and far more dangerous than the city.  there the
soldiers and the i.l.w. kept order; but the country had been turned over
to anarchy.  two hundred thousand people had fled from san francisco, and
we had countless evidences that their flight had been like that of an
army of locusts.

they had swept everything clean.  there had been robbery and fighting.
here and there we passed bodies by the roadside and saw the blackened
ruins of farm-houses.  the fences were down, and the crops had been
trampled by the feet of a multitude.  all the vegetable patches had been
rooted up by the famished hordes.  all the chickens and farm animals had
been slaughtered.  this was true of all the main roads that led out of
san francisco.  here and there, away from the roads, farmers had held
their own with shotguns and revolvers, and were still holding their own.
they warned us away and refused to parley with us.  and all the
destruction and violence had been done by the slum-dwellers and the upper
classes.  the i.l.w. men, with plentiful food supplies, remained quietly
in their homes in the cities.

early in the ride we received concrete proof of how desperate was the
situation.  to the right of us we heard cries and rifle-shots.  bullets
whistled dangerously near.  there was a crashing in the underbrush; then
a magnificent black truck-horse broke across the road in front of us and
was gone.  we had barely time to notice that he was bleeding and lame.
he was followed by three soldiers.  the chase went on among the trees on
the left.  we could hear the soldiers calling to one another.  a fourth
soldier limped out upon the road from the right, sat down on a boulder,
and mopped the sweat from his face.

“militia,” dakon whispered.  “deserters.”

the man grinned up at us and asked for a match.  in reply to dakon’s
“what’s the word?” he informed us that the militiamen were deserting.
“no grub,” he explained.  “they’re feedin’ it all to the regulars.”  we
also learned from him that the military prisoners had been released from
alcatraz island because they could no longer be fed.

i shall never forget the next sight we encountered.  we came upon it
abruptly around a turn of the road.  overhead arched the trees.  the
sunshine was filtering down through the branches.  butterflies were
fluttering by, and from the fields came the song of larks.  and there it
stood, a powerful touring car.  about it and in it lay a number of
corpses.  it told its own tale.  its occupants, fleeing from the city,
had been attacked and dragged down by a gang of slum dwellers—hoodlums.
the thing had occurred within twenty-four hours.  freshly opened meat and
fruit tins explained the reason for the attack.  dakon examined the
bodies.

“i thought so,” he reported.  “i’ve ridden in that car.  it was
perriton—the whole family.  we’ve got to watch out for ourselves from now
on.”

“but we have no food with which to invite attack,” i objected.

dakon pointed to the horse i rode, and i understood.

early in the day dakon’s horse had cast a shoe.  the delicate hoof had
split, and by noon the animal was limping.  dakon refused to ride it
farther, and refused to desert it.  so, on his solicitation, we went on.
he would lead the horse and join us at my place.  that was the last we
saw of him; nor did we ever learn his end.

by one o’clock we arrived at the town of menlo, or, rather, at the site
of menlo, for it was in ruins.  corpses lay everywhere.  the business
part of the town, as well as part of the residences, had been gutted by
fire.  here and there a residence still held out; but there was no
getting near them.  when we approached too closely we were fired upon.
we met a woman who was poking about in the smoking ruins of her cottage.
the first attack, she told us had been on the stores, and as she talked
we could picture that raging, roaring, hungry mob flinging itself on the
handful of townspeople.  millionaires and paupers had fought side by side
for the food, and then fought with one another after they got it.  the
town of palo alto and stanford university had been sacked in similar
fashion, we learned.  ahead of us lay a desolate, wasted land; and we
thought we were wise in turning off to my place.  it lay three miles to
the west, snuggling among the first rolling swells of the foothills.

but as we rode along we saw that the devastation was not confined to the
main roads.  the van of the flight had kept to the roads, sacking the
small towns as it went; while those that followed had scattered out and
swept the whole countryside like a great broom.  my place was built of
concrete, masonry, and tiles, and so had escaped being burned, but it was
gutted clean.  we found the gardener’s body in the windmill, littered
around with empty shot-gun shells.  he had put up a good fight.  but no
trace could we find of the two italian labourers, nor of the house-keeper
and her husband.  not a live thing remained.  the calves, the colts, all
the fancy poultry and thoroughbred stock, everything, was gone.  the
kitchen and the fireplaces, where the mob had cooked, were a mess, while
many camp-fires outside bore witness to the large number that had fed and
spent the night.  what they had not eaten they had carried away.  there
was not a bite for us.

we spent the rest of the night vainly waiting for dakon, and in the
morning, with our revolvers, fought off half-a-dozen marauders.  then we
killed one of dakon’s horses, hiding for the future what meat we did not
immediately eat.  in the afternoon collins went out for a walk, but
failed to return.  this was the last straw to hanover.  he was for flight
there and then, and i had great difficulty in persuading him to wait for
daylight.  as for myself, i was convinced that the end of the general
strike was near, and i was resolved to return to san francisco.  so, in
the morning, we parted company, hanover heading south, fifty pounds of
horse-meat strapped to his saddle, while i, similarly loaded, headed
north.  little hanover pulled through all right, and to the end of his
life he will persist, i know, in boring everybody with the narrative of
his subsequent adventures.

i got as far as belmont, on the main road back, when i was robbed of my
horse-meat by three militiamen.  there was no change in the situation,
they said, except that it was going from bad to worse.  the i.l.w. had
plenty of provisions hidden away and could last out for months.  i
managed to get as far as baden, when my horse was taken away from me by a
dozen men.  two of them were san francisco policemen, and the remainder
were regular soldiers.  this was ominous.  the situation was certainly
extreme when the regulars were beginning to desert.  when i continued my
way on foot, they already had the fire started, and the last of dakon’s
horses lay slaughtered on the ground.

as luck would have it, i sprained my ankle, and succeeded in getting no
farther than south san francisco.  i lay there that night in an
out-house, shivering with the cold and at the same time burning with
fever.  two days i lay there, too sick to move, and on the third, reeling
and giddy, supporting myself on an extemporized crutch, i tottered on
toward san francisco.  i was weak as well, for it was the third day since
food had passed my lips.  it was a day of nightmare and torment.  as in a
dream i passed hundreds of regular soldiers drifting along in the
opposite direction, and many policemen, with their families, organized in
large groups for mutual protection.

as i entered the city i remembered the workman’s house at which i had
traded the silver pitcher, and in that direction my hunger drove me.
twilight was falling when i came to the place.  i passed around by the
alleyway and crawled up the black steps, on which i collapsed.  i managed
to reach out with the crutch and knock on the door.  then i must have
fainted, for i came to in the kitchen, my face wet with water, and whisky
being poured down my throat.  i choked and spluttered and tried to talk.
i began saying something about not having any more silver pitchers, but
that i would make it up to them afterward if they would only give me
something to eat.  but the housewife interrupted me.

“why, you poor man,” she said, “haven’t you heard?  the strike was called
off this afternoon.  of course we’ll give you something to eat.”

she bustled around, opening a tin of breakfast bacon and preparing to fry
it.

“let me have some now, please,” i begged; and i ate the raw bacon on a
slice of bread, while her husband explained that the demands of the
i.l.w. had been granted.  the wires had been opened up in the early
afternoon, and everywhere the employers’ associations had given in.
there hadn’t been any employers left in san francisco, but general folsom
had spoken for them.  the trains and steamers would start running in the
morning, and so would everything else just as soon as system could be
established.

and that was the end of the general strike.  i never want to see another
one.  it was worse than a war.  a general strike is a cruel and immoral
thing, and the brain of man should be capable of running industry in a
more rational way.  harrison is still my chauffeur.  it was part of the
conditions of the i.l.w. that all of its members should be reinstated in
their old positions.  brown never came back, but the rest of the servants
are with me.  i hadn’t the heart to discharge them—poor creatures, they
were pretty hard-pressed when they deserted with the food and silver.
and now i can’t discharge them.  they have all been unionized by the
i.l.w.  the tyranny of organized labour is getting beyond human
endurance.  something must be done.




the sea-farmer


“that wull be the doctor’s launch,” said captain macelrath.

the pilot grunted, while the skipper swept on with his glass from the
launch to the strip of beach and to kingston beyond, and then slowly
across the entrance to howth head on the northern side.

“the tide’s right, and we’ll have you docked in two hours,” the pilot
vouchsafed, with an effort at cheeriness.  “ring’s end basin, is it?”

this time the skipper grunted.

“a dirty dublin day.”

again the skipper grunted.  he was weary with the night of wind in the
irish channel behind him, the unbroken hours of which he had spent on the
bridge.  and he was weary with all the voyage behind him—two years and
four months between home port and home port, eight hundred and fifty days
by his log.

“proper wunter weather,” he answered, after a silence.  “the town is
undistinct.  ut wull be rainun’ guid an’ hearty for the day.”

captain macelrath was a small man, just comfortably able to peep over the
canvas dodger of the bridge.  the pilot and third officer loomed above
him, as did the man at the wheel, a bulky german, deserted from a
warship, whom he had signed on in rangoon.  but his lack of inches made
captain macelrath a no less able man.  at least so the company reckoned,
and so would he have reckoned could he have had access to the carefully
and minutely compiled record of him filed away in the office archives.
but the company had never given him a hint of its faith in him.  it was
not the way of the company, for the company went on the principle of
never allowing an employee to think himself indispensable or even
exceedingly useful; wherefore, while quick to censure, it never praised.
what was captain macelrath, anyway, save a skipper, one skipper of the
eighty-odd skippers that commanded the company’s eighty-odd freighters on
all the highways and byways of the sea?

beneath them, on the main deck, two chinese stokers were carrying
breakfast for’ard across the rusty iron plates that told their own grim
story of weight and wash of sea.  a sailor was taking down the life-line
that stretched from the forecastle, past the hatches and cargo-winches,
to the bridge-deck ladder.

“a rough voyage,” suggested the pilot.

“aye, she was fair smokin’ ot times, but not thot i minded thot so much
as the lossin’ of time.  i hate like onythun’ tull loss time.”

so saying, captain macelrath turned and glanced aft, aloft and alow, and
the pilot, following his gaze, saw the mute but convincing explanation of
that loss of time.  the smoke-stack, buff-coloured underneath, was white
with salt, while the whistle-pipe glittered crystalline in the random
sunlight that broke for the instant through a cloud-rift.  the port
lifeboat was missing, its iron davits, twisted and wrenched, testifying
to the mightiness of the blow that had been struck the old _tryapsic_.
the starboard davits were also empty.  the shattered wreck of the
lifeboat they had held lay on the fiddley beside the smashed engine-room
skylight, which was covered by a tarpaulin.  below, to star-board, on the
bridge deck, the pilot saw the crushed mess-room door, roughly bulkheaded
against the pounding seas.  abreast of it, on the smokestack guys, and
being taken down by the bos’n and a sailor, hung the huge square of rope
netting which had failed to break those seas of their force.

“twice afore i mentioned thot door tull the owners,” said captain
macelrath.  “but they said ut would do.  there was bug seas thot time.
they was uncreditable bug.  and thot buggest one dud the domage.  ut fair
carried away the door an’ laid ut flat on the mess table an’ smashed out
the chief’s room.  he was a but sore about ut.”

“it must ’a’ been a big un,” the pilot remarked sympathetically.

“aye, ut was thot.  thungs was lively for a but.  ut finished the mate.
he was on the brudge wuth me, an’ i told hum tull take a look tull the
wedges o’ number one hatch.  she was takin’ watter freely an’ i was no
sure o’ number one.  i dudna like the look o’ ut, an’ i was fuggerin’
maybe tull heave to tull the marn, when she took ut over abaft the
brudge.  my word, she was a bug one.  we got a but of ut ourselves on the
brudge.  i dudna miss the mate ot the first, what o’ routin’ out chips
an’ bulkheadun’ thot door an’ stretchun’ the tarpaulin over the
sky-light.  then he was nowhere to be found.  the men ot the wheel said
as he seen hum goin’ down the lodder just afore she hut us.  we looked
for’ard, we looked tull hus room, aye looked tull the engine-room, an’ we
looked along aft on the lower deck, and there he was, on both sides the
cover to the steam-pipe runnun’ tull the after-wunches.”

the pilot ejaculated an oath of amazement and horror.

“aye,” the skipper went on wearily, “an’ on both sides the steam-pipe uz
well.  i tell ye he was in two pieces, splut clean uz a herrin’.  the sea
must a-caught hum on the upper brudge deck, carried hum clean across the
fiddley, an’ banged hum head-on tull the pipe cover.  it sheered through
hum like so much butter, down atween the eyes, an’ along the middle of
hum, so that one leg an’ arm was fast tull the one piece of hum, an’ one
leg an’ arm fast tull the other piece of hum.  i tull ye ut was fair
grewsome.  we putt hum together an’ rolled hum in canvas uz we pulled hum
out.”

the pilot swore again.

“oh, ut wasna onythun’ tull greet about,” captain macelrath assured him.
“’twas a guid ruddance.  he was no a sailor, thot mate-fellow.  he was
only fut for a pugsty, an’ a dom puir apology for thot same.”

it is said that there are three kinds of irish—catholic, protestant, and
north-of-ireland—and that the north-of-ireland irishman is a transplanted
scotchman.  captain macelrath was a north-of-ireland man, and, talking
for much of the world like a scotchman, nothing aroused his ire quicker
than being mistaken for a scotchman.  irish he stoutly was, and irish he
stoutly abided, though it was with a faint lip-lift of scorn that he
mentioned mere south-of-ireland men, or even orange-men.  himself he was
presbyterian, while in his own community five men were all that ever
mustered at a meeting in the orange men’s hall.  his community was the
island mcgill, where seven thousand of his kind lived in such amity and
sobriety that in the whole island there was but one policeman and never a
public-house at all.

captain macelrath did not like the sea, and had never liked it.  he wrung
his livelihood from it, and that was all the sea was, the place where he
worked, as the mill, the shop, and the counting-house were the places
where other men worked.  romance never sang to him her siren song, and
adventure had never shouted in his sluggish blood.  he lacked
imagination.  the wonders of the deep were without significance to him.
tornadoes, hurricanes, waterspouts, and tidal waves were so many
obstacles to the way of a ship on the sea and of a master on the
bridge—they were that to him, and nothing more.  he had seen, and yet not
seen, the many marvels and wonders of far lands.  under his eyelids
burned the brazen glories of the tropic seas, or ached the bitter gales
of the north atlantic or far south pacific; but his memory of them was of
mess-room doors stove in, of decks awash and hatches threatened, of undue
coal consumption, of long passages, and of fresh paint-work spoiled by
unexpected squalls of rain.

“i know my buzz’ness,” was the way he often put it, and beyond his
business was all that he did not know, all that he had seen with the
mortal eyes of him and yet that he never dreamed existed.  that he knew
his business his owners were convinced, or at forty he would not have
held command of the _tryapsic_, three thousand tons net register, with a
cargo capacity of nine thousand tons and valued at fifty-thousand pounds.

he had taken up seafaring through no love of it, but because it had been
his destiny, because he had been the second son of his father instead of
the first.  island mcgill was only so large, and the land could support
but a certain definite proportion of those that dwelt upon it.  the
balance, and a large balance it was, was driven to the sea to seek its
bread.  it had been so for generations.  the eldest sons took the farms
from their fathers; to the other sons remained the sea and its
salt-ploughing.  so it was that donald macelrath, farmer’s son and
farm-boy himself, had shifted from the soil he loved to the sea he hated
and which it was his destiny to farm.  and farmed it he had, for twenty
years, shrewd, cool-headed, sober, industrious, and thrifty, rising from
ship’s boy and forecastle hand to mate and master of sailing-ships and
thence into steam, second officer, first, and master, from small command
to larger, and at last to the bridge of the old _tryapsic_—old, to be
sure, but worth her fifty thousand pounds and still able to bear up in
all seas, and weather her nine thousand tons of freight.

from the bridge of the _tryapsic_, the high place he had gained in the
competition of men, he stared at dublin harbour opening out, at the town
obscured by the dark sky of the dreary wind-driven day, and at the
tangled tracery of spars and rigging of the harbour shipping.  back from
twice around the world he was, and from interminable junketings up and
down on far stretches, home-coming to the wife he had not seen in
eight-and-twenty months, and to the child he had never seen and that was
already walking and talking.  he saw the watch below of stokers and
trimmers bobbing out of the forecastle doors like rabbits from a warren
and making their way aft over the rusty deck to the mustering of the port
doctor.  they were chinese, with expressionless, sphinx-like faces, and
they walked in peculiar shambling fashion, dragging their feet as if the
clumsy brogans were too heavy for their lean shanks.

he saw them and he did not see them, as he passed his hand beneath his
visored cap and scratched reflectively his mop of sandy hair.  for the
scene before him was but the background in his brain for the vision of
peace that was his—a vision that was his often during long nights on the
bridge when the old _tryapsic_ wallowed on the vexed ocean floor, her
decks awash, her rigging thrumming in the gale gusts or snow squalls or
driving tropic rain.  and the vision he saw was of farm and farm-house
and straw-thatched outbuildings, of children playing in the sun, and the
good wife at the door, of lowing kine, and clucking fowls, and the stamp
of horses in the stable, of his father’s farm next to him, with, beyond,
the woodless, rolling land and the hedged fields, neat and orderly,
extending to the crest of the smooth, soft hills.  it was his vision and
his dream, his romance and adventure, the goal of all his effort, the
high reward for the salt-ploughing and the long, long furrows he ran up
and down the whole world around in his farming of the sea.

in simple taste and homely inclination this much-travelled man was more
simple and homely than the veriest yokel.  seventy-one years his father
was, and had never slept a night out of his own bed in his own house on
island mcgill.  that was the life ideal, so captain macelrath considered,
and he was prone to marvel that any man, not under compulsion, should
leave a farm to go to sea.  to this much-travelled man the whole world
was as familiar as the village to the cobbler sitting in his shop.  to
captain macelrath the world was a village.  in his mind’s eye he saw its
streets a thousand leagues long, aye, and longer; turnings that doubled
earth’s stormiest headlands or were the way to quiet inland ponds;
cross-roads, taken one way, that led to flower-lands and summer seas, and
that led the other way to bitter, ceaseless gales and the perilous bergs
of the great west wind drift.  and the cities, bright with lights, were
as shops on these long streets—shops where business was transacted, where
bunkers were replenished, cargoes taken or shifted, and orders received
from the owners in london town to go elsewhere and beyond, ever along the
long sea-lanes, seeking new cargoes here, carrying new cargoes there,
running freights wherever shillings and pence beckoned and underwriters
did not forbid.  but it was all a weariness to contemplate, and, save
that he wrung from it his bread, it was without profit under the sun.

the last good-bye to the wife had been at cardiff, twenty-eight months
before, when he sailed for valparaiso with coals—nine thousand tons and
down to his marks.  from valparaiso he had gone to australia, light, a
matter of six thousand miles on end with a stormy passage and running
short of bunker coal.  coals again to oregon, seven thousand miles, and
nigh as many more with general cargo for japan and china.  thence to
java, loading sugar for marseilles, and back along the mediterranean to
the black sea, and on to baltimore, down to her marks with crome ore,
buffeted by hurricanes, short again of bunker coal and calling at bermuda
to replenish.  then a time charter, norfolk, virginia, loading mysterious
contraband coal and sailing for south africa under orders of the
mysterious german supercargo put on board by the charterers.  on to
madagascar, steaming four knots by the supercargo’s orders, and the
suspicion forming that the russian fleet might want the coal.  confusion
and delays, long waits at sea, international complications, the whole
world excited over the old _tryapsic_ and her cargo of contraband, and
then on to japan and the naval port of sassebo.  back to australia,
another time charter and general merchandise picked up at sydney,
melbourne, and adelaide, and carried on to mauritius, lourenço marques,
durban, algoa bay, and cape town.  to ceylon for orders, and from ceylon
to rangoon to load rice for rio janeiro.  thence to buenos aires and
loading maize for the united kingdom or the continent, stopping at st.
vincent, to receive orders to proceed to dublin.  two years and four
months, eight hundred and fifty days by the log, steaming up and down the
thousand-league-long sea-lanes and back again to dublin town.  and he was
well aweary.

a little tug had laid hold of the _tryapsic_, and with clang and clatter
and shouted command, with engines half-ahead, slow-speed, or half-astern,
the battered old sea-tramp was nudged and nosed and shouldered through
the dock-gates into ring’s end basin.  lines were flung ashore, fore and
aft, and a ’midship spring got out.  already a small group of the happy
shore-staying folk had clustered on the dock.

“ring off,” captain macelrath commanded in his slow thick voice; and the
third officer worked the lever of the engine-room telegraph.

“gangway out!” called the second officer; and when this was accomplished,
“that will do.”

it was the last task of all, gangway out.  “that will do” was the
dismissal.  the voyage was ended, and the crew shambled eagerly forward
across the rusty decks to where their sea-bags were packed and ready for
the shore.  the taste of the land was strong in the men’s mouths, and
strong it was in the skipper’s mouth as he muttered a gruff good day to
the departing pilot, and himself went down to his cabin.  up the gangway
were trooping the customs officers, the surveyor, the agent’s clerk, and
the stevedores.  quick work disposed of these and cleared his cabin, the
agent waiting to take him to the office.

“dud ye send word tull the wife?” had been his greeting to the clerk.

“yes, a telegram, as soon as you were reported.”

“she’ll likely be comin’ down on the marnin’ train,” the skipper had
soliloquized, and gone inside to change his clothes and wash.

he took a last glance about the room and at two photographs on the wall,
one of the wife the other of an infant—the child he had never seen.  he
stepped out into the cabin, with its panelled walls of cedar and maple,
and with its long table that seated ten, and at which he had eaten by
himself through all the weary time.  no laughter and clatter and wordy
argument of the mess-room had been his.  he had eaten silently, almost
morosely, his silence emulated by the noiseless asiatic who had served
him.  it came to him suddenly, the overwhelming realization of the
loneliness of those two years and more.  all his vexations and anxieties
had been his own.  he had shared them with no one.  his two young
officers were too young and flighty, the mate too stupid.  there was no
consulting with them.  one tenant had shared the cabin with him, that
tenant his responsibility.  they had dined and supped together, walked
the bridge together, and together they had bedded.

“och!” he muttered to that grim companion, “i’m quit of you, an’ wull
quit . . . for a wee.”

ashore he passed the last of the seamen with their bags, and, at the
agent’s, with the usual delays, put through his ship business.  when
asked out by them to drink he took milk and soda.

“i am no teetotaler,” he explained; “but for the life o’ me i canna bide
beer or whusky.”

in the early afternoon, when he finished paying off his crew, he hurried
to the private office where he had been told his wife was waiting.

his eyes were for her first, though the temptation was great to have more
than a hurried glimpse of the child in the chair beside her.  he held her
off from him after the long embrace, and looked into her face long and
steadily, drinking in every feature of it and wondering that he could
mark no changes of time.  a warm man, his wife thought him, though had
the opinion of his officers been asked it would have been: a harsh man
and a bitter one.

“wull, annie, how is ut wi’ ye?” he queried, and drew her to him again.

and again he held her away from him, this wife of ten years and of whom
he knew so little.  she was almost a stranger—more a stranger than his
chinese steward, and certainly far more a stranger than his own officers
whom he had seen every day, day and day, for eight hundred and fifty
days.  married ten years, and in that time he had been with her nine
weeks—scarcely a honeymoon.  each time home had been a getting acquainted
again with her.  it was the fate of the men who went out to the
salt-ploughing.  little they knew of their wives and less of their
children.  there was his chief engineer—old, near-sighted macpherson—who
told the story of returning home to be locked out of his house by his
four-year kiddie that never had laid eyes on him before.

“an’ thus ’ull be the loddie,” the skipper said, reaching out a hesitant
hand to the child’s cheek.

but the boy drew away from him, sheltering against the mother’s side.

“och!” she cried, “and he doesna know his own father.”

“nor i hum.  heaven knows i could no a-picked hum out of a crowd, though
he’ll be havin’ your nose i’m thunkun’.”

“an’ your own eyes, donald.  look ut them.  he’s your own father, laddie.
kiss hum like the little mon ye are.”

but the child drew closer to her, his expression of fear and distrust
growing stronger, and when the father attempted to take him in his arms
he threatened to cry.

the skipper straightened up, and to conceal the pang at his heart he drew
out his watch and looked at it.

“ut’s time to go, annie,” he said.  “thot train ’ull be startun’.”

he was silent on the train at first, divided between watching the wife
with the child going to sleep in her arms and looking out of the window
at the tilled fields and green unforested hills vague and indistinct in
the driving drizzle that had set in.  they had the compartment to
themselves.  when the boy slept she laid him out on the seat and wrapped
him warmly.  and when the health of relatives and friends had been
inquired after, and the gossip of island mcgill narrated, along with the
weather and the price of land and crops, there was little left to talk
about save themselves, and captain macelrath took up the tale brought
home for the good wife from all his world’s-end wandering.  but it was
not a tale of marvels he told, nor of beautiful flower-lands nor
mysterious eastern cities.

“what like is java?” she asked once.

“full o’ fever.  half the crew down wuth ut an’ luttle work.  ut was
quinine an’ quinine the whole blessed time.  each marnun’ ’twas quinine
an’ gin for all hands on an empty stomach.  an’ they who was no sick made
ut out to be hovun’ ut bad uz the rest.”

another time she asked about newcastle.

“coals an’ coal-dust—thot’s all.  no a nice sutty.  i lost two chinks
there, stokers the both of them.  an’ the owners paid a fine tull the
government of a hundred pounds each for them.  ‘we regret tull note,’
they wrut me—i got the letter tull oregon—‘we regret tull note the loss
o’ two chinese members o’ yer crew ot newcastle, an’ we recommend greater
carefulness un the future.’  greater carefulness!  and i could no a-been
more careful.  the chinks hod forty-five pounds each comun’ tull them in
wages, an’ i was no a-thunkun’ they ’ud run.

“but thot’s their way—‘we regret tull note,’ ‘we beg tull advise,’ ‘we
recommend,’ ‘we canna understand’—an’ the like o’ thot.  domned cargo
tank!  an’ they would thunk i could drive her like a _lucania_, an’
wi’out burnun’ coals.  there was thot propeller.  i was after them a guid
while for ut.  the old one was iron, thuck on the edges, an’ we couldna
make our speed.  an’ the new one was bronze—nine hundred pounds ut cost,
an’ then wantun’ their returns out o’ ut, an’ me wuth a bod passage an’
lossin’ time every day.  ‘we regret tull note your long passage from
voloparaiso tull sydney wuth an average daily run o’ only one hundred an’
suxty-seven.  we hod expected better results wuth the new propeller.  you
should a-made an average daily run o’ two hundred and suxteen.’

“an’ me on a wunter passage, blowin’ a luvin’ gale half the time, wuth
hurricane force in atweenwhiles, an’ hove to sux days, wuth engines
stopped an’ bunker coal runnun’ short, an’ me wuth a mate thot stupid he
could no pass a shup’s light ot night wi’out callun’ me tull the brudge.
i wrut an’ told ’em so.  an’ then: ‘our nautical adviser suggests you
kept too far south,’ an’ ‘we are lookun’ for better results from thot
propeller.’  nautical adviser!—shore pilot!  ut was the regular latitude
for a wunter passage from voloparaiso tull sydney.

“an’ when i come un tull auckland short o’ coal, after lettun’ her druft
sux days wuth the fires out tull save the coal, an’ wuth only twenty tons
in my bunkers, i was thunkun’ o’ the lossin’ o’ time an’ the expense, an’
tull save the owners i took her un an’ out wi’out pilotage.  pilotage was
no compulsory.  an’ un yokohama, who should i meet but captun robinson o’
the _dyapsic_.  we got a-talkun’ about ports an’ places down
australia-way, an’ first thing he says: ‘speakun’ o’ auckland—of course,
captun, you was never un auckland?’  ‘yus,’ i says, ‘i was un there very
recent.’  ‘oh, ho,’ he says, very angry-like, ‘so you was the smart aleck
thot fetched me thot letter from the owners: “we note item of fufteen
pounds for pilotage ot auckland.  a shup o’ ours was un tull auckland
recently an’ uncurred no such charge.  we beg tull advise you thot we
conseeder thus pilotage an onnecessary expense which should no be
uncurred un the future.”’

“but dud they say a word tull me for the fufteen pounds i saved tull
them?  no a word.  they send a letter tull captun robinson for no savun’
them the fufteen pounds, an’ tull me: ‘we note item of two guineas
doctor’s fee at auckland for crew.  please explain thus onusual
expunditure.’  ut was two o’ the chinks.  i was thunkun’ they hod
beri-beri, an’ thot was the why o’ sendun’ for the doctor.  i buried the
two of them ot sea not a week after.  but ut was: ‘please explain thus
onusual expunditure,’ an’ tull captun robinson, ‘we beg tull advise you
thot we conseeder thus pilotage an onnecessary expense.’

“dudna i cable them from newcastle, tellun’ them the old tank was thot
foul she needed dry-dock?  seven months out o’ dry-dock, an’ the west
coast the quickest place for foulun’ un the world.  but freights was up,
an’ they hod a charter o’ coals for portland.  the _arrata_, one o’ the
woor line, left port the same day uz us, bound for portland, an’ the old
_tryapsic_ makun’ sux knots, seven ot the best.  an’ ut was ot comox,
takun’ un bunker coal, i got the letter from the owners.  the boss
humself hod signed ut, an’ ot the bottom he wrut un hus own hond: ‘the
_arrata_ beat you by four an’ a half days.  am dusappointed.’
dusappointed!  when i had cabled them from newcastle.  when she drydocked
ot portland, there was whuskers on her a foot long, barnacles the size o’
me fust, oysters like young sauce plates.  ut took them two days
afterward tull clean the dock o’ shells an’ muck.

“an’ there was the motter o’ them fire-bars ot newcastle.  the firm
ashore made them heavier than the engineer’s speecifications, an’ then
forgot tull charge for the dufference.  ot the last moment, wuth me
ashore gettun’ me clearance, they come wuth the bill: ‘tull error on
fire-bars, sux pounds.’  they’d been tull the shup an’ macpherson hod
o.k.’d ut.  i said ut was strange an’ would no pay.  ‘then you are
dootun’ the chief engineer,’ says they.  ‘i’m no dootun’,’ says i, ‘but i
canna see my way tull sign.  come wuth me tull the shup.  the launch wull
cost ye naught an’ ut ’ull brung ye back.  an’ we wull see what
macpherson says.’

“but they would no come.  ot portland i got the bill un a letter.  i took
no notice.  ot hong-kong i got a letter from the owners.  the bill hod
been sent tull them.  i wrut them from java explainun’.  at marseilles
the owners wrut me: ‘tull extra work un engine-room, sux pounds.  the
engineer has o.k.’d ut, an’ you have no o.k.’d ut.  are you dootun’ the
engineer’s honesty?’  i wrut an’ told them i was no dootun’ his honesty;
thot the bill was for extra weight o’ fire-bars; an’ thot ut was o.k.
dud they pay ut?  they no dud.  they must unvestigate.  an’ some clerk un
the office took sick, an’ the bill was lost.  an’ there was more letters.
i got letters from the owners an’ the firm—‘tull error on fire-bars, sux
pounds’—ot baltimore, ot delagoa bay, ot moji, ot rangoon, ot rio, an’ ot
montevuddio.  ut uz no settled yut.  i tell ye, annie, the owners are
hard tull please.”

he communed with himself for a moment, and then muttered indignantly:
“tull error on fire-bars, sux pounds.”

“hov ye heard of jamie?” his wife asked in the pause.

captain macelrath shook his head.

“he was washed off the poop wuth three seamen.”

“whereabouts?”

“off the horn.  ’twas on the _thornsby_.”

“they would be runnun’ homeward bound?”

“aye,” she nodded.  “we only got the word three days gone.  his wife is
greetin’ like tull die.”

“a good lod, jamie,” he commented, “but a stiff one ot carryun’ on.  i
mind me when we was mates together un the _albion_.  an’ so jamie’s gone.”

again a pause fell, to be broken by the wife.

“an’ ye will no a-heard o’ the _bankshire_?  macdougall lost her in
magellan straits.  ’twas only yesterday ut was in the paper.”

“a cruel place, them magellan straits,” he said.  “dudna thot domned
mate-fellow nigh putt me ashore twice on the one passage through?  he was
a eediot, a lunatuc.  i wouldna have hum on the brudge a munut.  comun’
tull narrow reach, thuck weather, wuth snow squalls, me un the
chart-room, dudna i guv hum the changed course?  ‘south-east-by-east,’ i
told hum.  ‘south-east-by-east, sir,’ says he.  fufteen munuts after i
comes on tull the brudge.  ‘funny,’ says thot mate-fellow, ‘i’m no
rememberun’ ony islands un the mouth o’ narrow reach.  i took one look ot
the islands an’ yells, ‘putt your wheel hard a-starboard,’ tull the mon
ot the wheel.  an’ ye should a-seen the old _tryapsic_ turnun’ the
sharpest circle she ever turned.  i waited for the snow tull clear, an’
there was narrow reach, nice uz ye please, tull the east’ard an’ the
islands un the mouth o’ false bay tull the south’ard.  ‘what course was
ye steerun’?’ i says tull the mon ot the wheel.  ‘south-by-east, sir,’
says he.  i looked tull the mate-fellow.  what could i say?  i was thot
wroth i could a-kult hum.  four points dufference.  five munuts more an’
the old _tryapsic_ would a-been funushed.

“an’ was ut no the same when we cleared the straits tull the east’ard?
four hours would a-seen us guid an’ clear.  i was forty hours then on the
brudge.  i guv the mate his course, an’ the bearun’ o’ the askthar light
astern.  ‘don’t let her bear more tull the north’ard than west-by-north,’
i said tull hum, ’an’ ye wull be all right.’  an’ i went below an’ turned
un.  but i couldna sleep for worryun’.  after forty hours on the brudge,
what was four hours more? i thought.  an’ for them four hours wull ye be
lettun’ the mate loss her on ye?  ‘no,’ i says to myself.  an’ wuth thot
i got up, hod a wash an’ a cup o’ coffee, an’ went tull the brudge.  i
took one look ot the bearun’ o’ askthar light.  ’twas nor’west-by-west,
and the old _tryapsic_ down on the shoals.  he was a eediot, thot
mate-fellow.  ye could look overside an’ see the duscoloration of the
watter.  ’twas a close call for the old _tryapsic_ i’m tellun’ ye.  twice
un thirty hours he’d a-hod her ashore uf ut hod no been for me.”

captain macelrath fell to gazing at the sleeping child with mild wonder
in his small blue eyes, and his wife sought to divert him from his woes.

“ye remember jummy maccaul?” she asked.  “ye went tull school wuth hus
two boys.  old jummy maccaul thot hoz the farm beyond doctor haythorn’s
place.”

“oh, aye, an’ what o’ hum?  uz he dead?”

“no, but he was after askun’ your father, when he sailed last time for
voloparaiso, uf ye’d been there afore.  an’ when your father says no,
then jummy says, ‘an’ how wull he be knowun a’ tull find hus way?’  an’
with thot your father says: ‘verry sumple ut uz, jummy.  supposun’ you
was goin’ tull the mainland tull a mon who luved un belfast.  belfast uz
a bug sutty, jummy, an’ how would ye be findun’ your way?’  ‘by way o’ me
tongue,’ says jummy; ‘i’d be askun’ the folk i met.’  ‘i told ye ut was
sumple,’ says your father.  ‘ut’s the very same way my donald finds the
road tull voloparaiso.  he asks every shup he meets upon the sea tull ot
last he meets wuth a shup thot’s been tull voloparaiso, an’ the captun o’
thot shup tells hum the way.’  an’ jummy scratches hus head an’ says he
understands an’ thot ut’s a very sumple motter after all.”

the skipper chuckled at the joke, and his tired blue eyes were merry for
the moment.

“he was a thun chap, thot mate-fellow, oz thun oz you an’ me putt
together,” he remarked after a time, a slight twinkle in his eye of
appreciation of the bull.  but the twinkle quickly disappeared and the
blue eyes took on a bleak and wintry look.  “what dud he do ot
voloparaiso but land sux hundred fathom o’ chain cable an’ take never a
receipt from the lighter-mon.  i was gettun’ my clearance ot the time.
when we got tull sea, i found he hod no receipt for the cable.

“‘an’ ye no took a receipt for ut?’ says i.

“‘no,’ says he.  ‘wasna ut goin’ direct tull the agents?’

“‘how long ha’ ye been goin’ tull sea,’ says i, ‘not tull be knowin’ the
mate’s duty uz tull deluver no cargo wuthout receipt for same?  an’ on
the west coast ot thot.  what’s tull stop the lighter-mon from stealun’ a
few lengths o’ ut?’

“an’ ut come out uz i said.  sux hundred went over the side, but
four hundred an’ ninety-five was all the agents received.  the
lighter-mon swore ut was all he received from the mate—four hundred an’
ninety-five fathom.  i got a letter from the owners ot portland.  they no
blamed the mate for ut, but me, an’ me ashore ot the time on shup’s
buzz’ness.  i could no be in the two places ot the one time.  an’ the
letters from the owners an’ the agents uz still comun’ tull me.

“thot mate-fellow was no a proper sailor, an’ no a mon tull work for
owners.  dudna he want tull break me wuth the board of trade for bein’
below my marks?  he said as much tull the bos’n.  an’ he told me tull my
face homeward bound thot i’d been half an inch under my marks.  ’twas at
portland, loadun’ cargo un fresh watter an’ goin’ tull comox tull load
bunker coal un salt watter.  i tell ye, annie, ut takes close fuggerin’,
an’ i _was_ half an inch under the load-line when the bunker coal was un.
but i’m no tellun’ any other body but you.  an’ thot mate-fellow
untendun’ tull report me tull the board o’ trade, only for thot he saw
fut tull be sliced un two pieces on the steam-pipe cover.

“he was a fool.  after loadun’ ot portland i hod tull take on suxty tons
o’ coal tull last me tull comox.  the charges for lighterun’ was heavy,
an’ no room ot the coal dock.  a french barque was lyin’ alongside the
dock an’ i spoke tull the captun, askun’ hum what he would charge when
work for the day was done, tull haul clear for a couple o’ hours an’ let
me un.  ‘twenty dollars,’ said he.  ut was savun’ money on lighters tull
the owner, an’ i gave ut tull hum.  an’ thot night, after dark, i hauled
un an’ took on the coal.  then i started tull go out un the stream an’
drop anchor—under me own steam, of course.

“we hod tull go out stern first, an’ somethun’ went wrong wuth the
reversun’ gear.  old macpherson said he could work ut by hond, but very
slow ot thot.  an’ i said ‘all right.’  we started.  the pilot was on
board.  the tide was ebbun’ stuffly, an’ right abreast an’ a but below
was a shup lyin’ wuth a lighter on each side.  i saw the shup’s ridun’
lights, but never a light on the lighters.  ut was close quarters to
shuft a bug vessel onder steam, wuth macpherson workun’ the reversun’
gear by hond.  we hod to come close down upon the shup afore i could go
ahead an’ clear o’ the shups on the dock-ends.  an’ we struck the lighter
stern-on, just uz i rung tull macpherson half ahead.

“‘what was thot?’ says the pilot, when we struck the lighter.

“‘i dunna know,’ says i, ‘an’ i’m wonderun’.’

“the pilot was no keen, ye see, tull hus job.  i went on tull a guid
place an’ dropped anchor, an’ ut would all a-been well but for thot
domned eediot mate.

“‘we smashed thot lighter,’ says he, comun’ up the lodder tull the
brudge—an’ the pilot stondun’ there wuth his ears cocked tull hear.

“‘what lighter?’ says i.

“‘thot lighter alongside the shup,’ says the mate.

“‘i dudna see no lighter,’ says i, and wuth thot i steps on hus fut guid
an’ hard.

“after the pilot was gone i says tull the mate: ‘uf you dunna know
onythun’, old mon, for heaven’s sake keep your mouth shut.’

“‘but ye dud smash thot lighter, dudn’t ye?’ says he.

“‘uf we dud,’ says i, ‘ut’s no your buzz’ness tull be tellun’ the
pilot—though, mind ye, i’m no admuttun’ there was ony lighter.’

“an’ next marnun’, just uz i’m after dressun’, the steward says, ‘a mon
tull see ye, sir.’  ‘fetch hum un,’ says i.  an’ un he come.  ‘sut down,’
says i.  an’ he sot down.

“he was the owner of the lighter, an’ when he hod told hus story, i says,
‘i dudna see ony lighter.’

“‘what, mon?’ says he.  ‘no see a two-hundred-ton lighter, bug oz a
house, alongside thot shup?’

“‘i was goin’ by the shup’s lights,’ says i, ‘an’ i dudna touch the shup,
thot i know.’

“‘but ye dud touch the lighter,’ says he.  ‘ye smashed her.  there’s a
thousand dollars’ domage done, an’ i’ll see ye pay for ut.’

“‘look here, muster,’ says i, ‘when i’m shuftun’ a shup ot night i follow
the law, an’ the law dustunctly says i must regulate me actions by the
lights o’ the shuppun’.  your lighter never hod no ridun’ light, nor dud
i look for ony lighter wuthout lights tull show ut.’

“‘the mate says—’ he beguns.

“‘domn the mate,’ says i.  ‘dud your lighter hov a ridun’ light?’

“‘no, ut dud not,’ says he, ‘but ut was a clear night wuth the moon
a-showun’.’

“‘ye seem tull know your buzz’ness,’ says i.  ‘but let me tell ye thot i
know my buzz’ness uz well, an’ thot i’m no a-lookun’ for lighters wuthout
lights.  uf ye thunk ye hov a case, go ahead.  the steward will show ye
out.  guid day.’

“an’ thot was the end o’ ut.  but ut wull show ye what a puir fellow thot
mate was.  i call ut a blessun’ for all masters thot he was sliced un two
on thot steam-pipe cover.  he had a pull un the office an’ thot was the
why he was kept on.”

“the wekley farm wull soon be for sale, so the agents be tellun’ me,” his
wife remarked, slyly watching what effect her announcement would have
upon him.

his eyes flashed eagerly on the instant, and he straightened up as might
a man about to engage in some agreeable task.  it was the farm of his
vision, adjoining his father’s, and her own people farmed not a mile
away.

“we wull be buyun’ ut,” he said, “though we wull be no tellun’ a soul of
ut ontul ut’s bought an’ the money paid down.  i’ve savun’ consuderable
these days, though pickun’s uz no what they used to be, an’ we hov a tidy
nest-egg laid by.  i wull see the father an’ hove the money ready tull
hus hond, so uf i’m ot sea he can buy whenever the land offers.”

he rubbed the frosted moisture from the inside of the window and peered
out at the pouring rain, through which he could discern nothing.

“when i was a young men i used tull be afeard thot the owners would guv
me the sack.  stull afeard i am of the sack.  but once thot farm is mine
i wull no be afeard ony longer.  ut’s a puir job thus sea-farmun’.  me
managin’ un all seas an’ weather an’ perils o’ the deep a shup worth
fufty thousand pounds, wuth cargoes ot times worth fufty thousand more—a
hundred thousand pounds, half a million dollars uz the yankees say, an’
me wuth all the responsubility gettun’ a screw o’ twenty pounds a month.
what mon ashore, managin’ a buz’ness worth a hundred thousand pounds wull
be gettun’ uz small a screw uz twenty pounds?  an’ wuth such masters uz a
captun serves—the owners, the underwriters, an’ the board o’ trade, all
pullun’ an wantun’ dufferent thungs—the owners wantun’ quick passages an’
domn the rusk, the underwriters wantun’ safe passages an’ domn the delay,
an’ the board o’ trade wantun’ cautious passages an’ caution always
meanun’ delay.  three dufferent masters, an’ all three able an’ wullun’
to break ye uf ye don’t serve their dufferent wushes.”

he felt the train slackening speed, and peered again through the misty
window.  he stood up, buttoned his overcoat, turned up the collar, and
awkwardly gathered the child, still asleep, in his arms.

“i wull see the father,” he said, “an’ hov the money ready tull hus hond
so uf i’m ot sea when the land offers he wull no muss the chance tull
buy.  an’ then the owners can guv me the sack uz soon uz they like.  ut
will be all night un, an’ i wull be wuth you, annie, an’ the sea can go
tull hell.”

happiness was in both their faces at the prospect, and for a moment both
saw the same vision of peace.  annie leaned toward him, and as the train
stopped they kissed each other across the sleeping child.




samuel


margaret henan would have been a striking figure under any circumstances,
but never more so than when i first chanced upon her, a sack of grain of
fully a hundredweight on her shoulder, as she walked with sure though
tottering stride from the cart-tail to the stable, pausing for an instant
to gather strength at the foot of the steep steps that led to the
grain-bin.  there were four of these steps, and she went up them, a step
at a time, slowly, unwaveringly, and with so dogged certitude that it
never entered my mind that her strength could fail her and let that
hundred-weight sack fall from the lean and withered frame that wellnigh
doubled under it.  for she was patently an old woman, and it was her age
that made me linger by the cart and watch.

six times she went between the cart and the stable, each time with a full
sack on her back, and beyond passing the time of day with me she took no
notice of my presence.  then, the cart empty, she fumbled for matches and
lighted a short clay pipe, pressing down the burning surface of the
tobacco with a calloused and apparently nerveless thumb.  the hands were
noteworthy.  they were large-knuckled, sinewy and malformed by labour,
rimed with callouses, the nails blunt and broken, and with here and there
cuts and bruises, healed and healing, such as are common to the hands of
hard-working men.  on the back were huge, upstanding veins, eloquent of
age and toil.  looking at them, it was hard to believe that they were the
hands of the woman who had once been the belle of island mcgill.  this
last, of course, i learned later.  at the time i knew neither her history
nor her identity.

she wore heavy man’s brogans.  her legs were stockingless, and i had
noticed when she walked that her bare feet were thrust into the crinkly,
iron-like shoes that sloshed about her lean ankles at every step.  her
figure, shapeless and waistless, was garbed in a rough man’s shirt and in
a ragged flannel petticoat that had once been red.  but it was her face,
wrinkled, withered and weather-beaten, surrounded by an aureole of
unkempt and straggling wisps of greyish hair, that caught and held me.
neither drifted hair nor serried wrinkles could hide the splendid dome of
a forehead, high and broad without verging in the slightest on the
abnormal.

the sunken cheeks and pinched nose told little of the quality of the life
that flickered behind those clear blue eyes of hers.  despite the minutiæ
of wrinkle-work that somehow failed to weazen them, her eyes were clear
as a girl’s—clear, out-looking, and far-seeing, and with an open and
unblinking steadfastness of gaze that was disconcerting.  the remarkable
thing was the distance between them.  it is a lucky man or woman who has
the width of an eye between, but with margaret henan the width between
her eyes was fully that of an eye and a half.  yet so symmetrically
moulded was her face that this remarkable feature produced no uncanny
effect, and, for that matter, would have escaped the casual observer’s
notice.  the mouth, shapeless and toothless, with down-turned corners and
lips dry and parchment-like, nevertheless lacked the muscular slackness
so usual with age.  the lips might have been those of a mummy, save for
that impression of rigid firmness they gave.  not that they were
atrophied.  on the contrary, they seemed tense and set with a muscular
and spiritual determination.  there, and in the eyes, was the secret of
the certitude with which she carried the heavy sacks up the steep steps,
with never a false step or overbalance, and emptied them in the
grain-bin.

“you are an old woman to be working like this,” i ventured.

she looked at me with that strange, unblinking gaze, and she thought and
spoke with the slow deliberateness that characterized everything about
her, as if well aware of an eternity that was hers and in which there was
no need for haste.  again i was impressed by the enormous certitude of
her.  in this eternity that seemed so indubitably hers, there was time
and to spare for safe-footing and stable equilibrium—for certitude, in
short.  no more in her spiritual life than in carrying the hundredweights
of grain was there a possibility of a misstep or an overbalancing.  the
feeling produced in me was uncanny.  here was a human soul that, save for
the most glimmering of contacts, was beyond the humanness of me.  and the
more i learned of margaret henan in the weeks that followed the more
mysteriously remote she became.  she was as alien as a far-journeyer from
some other star, and no hint could she nor all the countryside give me of
what forms of living, what heats of feeling, or rules of philosophic
contemplation actuated her in all that she had been and was.

“i wull be suvunty-two come guid friday a fortnight,” she said in reply
to my question.

“but you are an old woman to be doing this man’s work, and a strong man’s
work at that,” i insisted.

again she seemed to immerse herself in that atmosphere of contemplative
eternity, and so strangely did it affect me that i should not have been
surprised to have awaked a century or so later and found her just
beginning to enunciate her reply—

“the work hoz tull be done, an’ i am beholden tull no one.”

“but have you no children, no family, relations?”

“oh, aye, a-plenty o’ them, but they no see fut tull be helpun’ me.”

she drew out her pipe for a moment, then added, with a nod of her head
toward the house, “i luv’ wuth meself.”

i glanced at the house, straw-thatched and commodious, at the large
stable, and at the large array of fields i knew must belong with the
place.

“it is a big bit of land for you to farm by yourself.”

“oh, aye, a bug but, suvunty acres.  ut kept me old mon buzzy, along wuth
a son an’ a hired mon, tull say naught o’ extra honds un the harvest an’
a maid-servant un the house.”

she clambered into the cart, gathered the reins in her hands, and quizzed
me with her keen, shrewd eyes.

“belike ye hail from over the watter—ameruky, i’m meanun’?”

“yes, i’m a yankee,” i answered.

“ye wull no be findun’ mony island mcgill folk stoppun’ un ameruky?”

“no; i don’t remember ever meeting one, in the states.”

she nodded her head.

“they are home-luvun’ bodies, though i wull no be sayin’ they are no
fair-travelled.  yet they come home ot the last, them oz are no lost ot
sea or kult by fevers an’ such-like un foreign parts.”

“then your sons will have gone to sea and come home again?” i queried.

“oh, aye, all savun’ samuel oz was drownded.”

at the mention of samuel i could have sworn to a strange light in her
eyes, and it seemed to me, as by some telepathic flash, that i divined in
her a tremendous wistfulness, an immense yearning.  it seemed to me that
here was the key to her inscrutableness, the clue that if followed
properly would make all her strangeness plain.  it came to me that here
was a contact and that for the moment i was glimpsing into the soul of
her.  the question was tickling on my tongue, but she forestalled me.

she _tchk’d_ to the horse, and with a “guid day tull you, sir,” drove
off.

                                * * * * *

a simple, homely people are the folk of island mcgill, and i doubt if a
more sober, thrifty, and industrious folk is to be found in all the
world.  meeting them abroad—and to meet them abroad one must meet them on
the sea, for a hybrid seafaring and farmer breed are they—one would never
take them to be irish.  irish they claim to be, speaking of the north of
ireland with pride and sneering at their scottish brothers; yet scotch
they undoubtedly are, transplanted scotch of long ago, it is true, but
none the less scotch, with a thousand traits, to say nothing of their
tricks of speech and woolly utterance, which nothing less than their
scotch clannishness could have preserved to this late day.

a narrow loch, scarcely half a mile wide, separates island mcgill from
the mainland of ireland; and, once across this loch, one finds himself in
an entirely different country.  the scotch impression is strong, and the
people, to commence with, are presbyterians.  when it is considered that
there is no public-house in all the island and that seven thousand souls
dwell therein, some idea may be gained of the temperateness of the
community.  wedded to old ways, public opinion and the ministers are
powerful influences, while fathers and mothers are revered and obeyed as
in few other places in this modern world.  courting lasts never later
than ten at night, and no girl walks out with her young man without her
parents’ knowledge and consent.

the young men go down to the sea and sow their wild oats in the wicked
ports, returning periodically, between voyages, to live the old intensive
morality, to court till ten o’clock, to sit under the minister each
sunday, and to listen at home to the same stern precepts that the elders
preached to them from the time they were laddies.  much they learned of
women in the ends of the earth, these seafaring sons, yet a canny wisdom
was theirs and they never brought wives home with them.  the one solitary
exception to this had been the schoolmaster, who had been guilty of
bringing a wife from half a mile the other side of the loch.  for this he
had never been forgiven, and he rested under a cloud for the remainder of
his days.  at his death the wife went back across the loch to her own
people, and the blot on the escutcheon of island mcgill was erased.  in
the end the sailor-men married girls of their own homeland and settled
down to become exemplars of all the virtues for which the island was
noted.

island mcgill was without a history.  she boasted none of the events that
go to make history.  there had never been any wearing of the green, any
fenian conspiracies, any land disturbances.  there had been but one
eviction, and that purely technical—a test case, and on advice of the
tenant’s lawyer.  so island mcgill was without annals.  history had
passed her by.   she paid her taxes, acknowledged her crowned rulers, and
left the world alone; all she asked in return was that the world should
leave her alone.  the world was composed of two parts—island mcgill and
the rest of it.  and whatever was not island mcgill was outlandish and
barbarian; and well she knew, for did not her seafaring sons bring home
report of that world and its ungodly ways?

                                * * * * *

it was from the skipper of a glasgow tramp, as passenger from colombo to
rangoon, that i had first learned of the existence of island mcgill; and
it was from him that i had carried the letter that gave me entrance to
the house of mrs. ross, widow of a master mariner, with a daughter living
with her and with two sons, master mariners themselves and out upon the
sea.  mrs. ross did not take in boarders, and it was captain ross’s
letter alone that had enabled me to get from her bed and board.  in the
evening, after my encounter with margaret henan, i questioned mrs. ross,
and i knew on the instant that i had in truth stumbled upon mystery.

like all island mcgill folk, as i was soon to discover, mrs. ross was at
first averse to discussing margaret henan at all.  yet it was from her i
learned that evening that margaret henan had once been one of the island
belles.  herself the daughter of a well-to-do farmer, she had married
thomas henan, equally well-to-do.  beyond the usual housewife’s tasks she
had never been accustomed to work.  unlike many of the island women, she
had never lent a hand in the fields.

“but what of her children?” i asked.

“two o’ the sons, jamie an’ timothy uz married an’ be goun’ tull sea.
thot bug house close tull the post office uz jamie’s.  the daughters thot
ha’ no married be luvun’ wuth them as dud marry.  an’ the rest be dead.”

“the samuels,” clara interpolated, with what i suspected was a giggle.

she was mrs. ross’s daughter, a strapping young woman with handsome
features and remarkably handsome black eyes.

“’tuz naught to be smuckerun’ ot,” her mother reproved her.

“the samuels?” i intervened.  “i don’t understand.”

“her four sons thot died.”

“and were they all named samuel?”

“aye.”

“strange,” i commented in the lagging silence.

“very strange,” mrs. ross affirmed, proceeding stolidly with the knitting
of the woollen singlet on her knees—one of the countless under-garments
that she interminably knitted for her skipper sons.

“and it was only the samuels that died?” i queried, in further attempt.

“the others luved,” was the answer.  “a fine fomuly—no finer on the
island.  no better lods ever sailed out of island mcgill.  the munuster
held them up oz models tull pottern after.  nor was ever a whusper
breathed again’ the girls.”

“but why is she left alone now in her old age?” i persisted.  “why don’t
her own flesh and blood look after her?  why does she live alone?  don’t
they ever go to see her or care for her?”

“never a one un twenty years an’ more now.  she fetched ut on tull
herself.  she drove them from the house just oz she drove old tom henan,
thot was her husband, tull hus death.”

“drink?” i ventured.

mrs. ross shook her head scornfully, as if drink was a weakness beneath
the weakest of island mcgill.

a long pause followed, during which mrs. ross knitted stolidly on, only
nodding permission when clara’s young man, mate on one of the shire line
sailing ships, came to walk out with her.  i studied the half-dozen
ostrich eggs, hanging in the corner against the wall like a cluster of
some monstrous fruit.  on each shell were painted precipitous and
impossible seas through which full-rigged ships foamed with a lack of
perspective only equalled by their sharp technical perfection.  on the
mantelpiece stood two large pearl shells, obviously a pair, intricately
carved by the patient hands of new caledonian convicts.  in the centre of
the mantel was a stuffed bird-of-paradise, while about the room were
scattered gorgeous shells from the southern seas, delicate sprays of
coral sprouting from barnacled _pi-pi_ shells and cased in glass,
assegais from south africa, stone axes from new guinea, huge alaskan
tobacco-pouches beaded with heraldic totem designs, a boomerang from
australia, divers ships in glass bottles, a cannibal _kai-kai_ bowl from
the marquesas, and fragile cabinets from china and the indies and inlaid
with mother-of-pearl and precious woods.

i gazed at this varied trove brought home by sailor sons, and pondered
the mystery of margaret henan, who had driven her husband to his death
and been forsaken by all her kin.  it was not the drink.  then what was
it?—some shocking cruelty? some amazing infidelity? or some fearful,
old-world peasant-crime?

i broached my theories, but to all mrs. ross shook her head.

“ut was no thot,” she said.  “margaret was a guid wife an’ a guid mother,
an’ i doubt she would harm a fly.  she brought up her fomuly god-fearin’
an’ decent-minded.  her trouble was thot she took lunatic—turned eediot.”

mrs. ross tapped significantly on her forehead to indicate a state of
addlement.

“but i talked with her this afternoon,” i objected, “and i found her a
sensible woman—remarkably bright for one of her years.”

“aye, an’ i’m grantun’ all thot you say,” she went on calmly.  “but i am
no referrun’ tull thot.  i am referrun’ tull her wucked-headed an’
vucious stubbornness.  no more stubborn woman ever luv’d than margaret
henan.  ut was all on account o’ samuel, which was the name o’ her
youngest an’ they do say her favourut brother—hum oz died by hus own hond
all through the munuster’s mustake un no registerun’ the new church ot
dublin.  ut was a lesson thot the name was musfortunate, but she would no
take ut, an’ there was talk when she called her first child samuel—hum
thot died o’ the croup.  an’ wuth thot what does she do but call the next
one samuel, an’ hum only three when he fell un tull the tub o’ hot watter
an’ was plain cooked tull death.  ut all come, i tell you, o’ her
wucked-headed an’ foolush stubbornness.  for a samuel she must hov; an’
ut was the death of the four of her sons.  after the first, dudna her own
mother go down un the dirt tull her feet, a-beggun’ an’ pleadun’ wuth her
no tull name her next one samuel?  but she was no tull be turned from her
purpose.  margaret henan was always set on her ways, an’ never more so
thon on thot name samuel.

“she was fair lunatuc on samuel.  dudna her neighbours’ an’ all kuth an’
kun savun’ them thot luv’d un the house wuth her, get up an’ walk out ot
the christenun’ of the second—hum thot was cooked?  thot they dud, an’ ot
the very moment the munuster asked what would the bairn’s name be.
‘samuel,’ says she; an’ wuth thot they got up an’ walked out an’ left the
house.  an’ ot the door dudna her aunt fannie, her mother’s suster, turn
an’ say loud for all tull hear: ‘what for wull she be wantun’ tull murder
the wee thing?’  the munuster heard fine, an’ dudna like ut, but, oz he
told my larry afterward, what could he do?  ut was the woman’s wush, an’
there was no law again’ a mother callun’ her child accordun’ tull her
wush.

“an’ then was there no the third samuel?  an’ when he was lost ot sea off
the cape, dudna she break all laws o’ nature tull hov a fourth?  she was
forty-seven, i’m tellun’ ye, an’ she hod a child ot forty-seven.  thunk
on ut!  ot forty-seven!  ut was fair scand’lous.”

                                * * * * *

from clara, next morning, i got the tale of margaret henan’s favourite
brother; and from here and there, in the week that followed, i pieced
together the tragedy of margaret henan.  samuel dundee had been the
youngest of margaret’s four brothers, and, as clara told me, she had
well-nigh worshipped him.  he was going to sea at the time, skipper of
one of the sailing ships of the bank line, when he married agnes hewitt.
she was described as a slender wisp of a girl, delicately featured and
with a nervous organization of the supersensitive order.  theirs had been
the first marriage in the “new” church, and after a two-weeks’ honeymoon
samuel had kissed his bride good-bye and sailed in command of the
_loughbank_, a big four-masted barque.

and it was because of the “new” church that the minister’s blunder
occurred.  nor was it the blunder of the minister alone, as one of the
elders later explained; for it was equally the blunder of the whole
presbytery of coughleen, which included fifteen churches on island mcgill
and the mainland.  the old church, beyond repair, had been torn down and
the new one built on the original foundation.  looking upon the
foundation-stones as similar to a ship’s keel, it never entered the
minister’s nor the presbytery’s head that the new church was legally any
other than the old church.

“an’ three couples was married the first week un the new church,” clara
said.  “first of all, samuel dundee an’ agnes hewitt; the next day albert
mahan an’ minnie duncan; an’ by the week-end eddie troy and flo
mackintosh—all sailor-men, an’ un sux weeks’ time the last of them back
tull their ships an’ awa’, an’ no one o’ them dreamin’ of the wuckedness
they’d been ot.”

the imp of the perverse must have chuckled at the situation.  all things
favoured.  the marriages had taken place in the first week of may, and it
was not till three months later that the minister, as required by law,
made his quarterly report to the civil authorities in dublin.  promptly
came back the announcement that his church had no legal existence, not
being registered according to the law’s demands.  this was overcome by
prompt registration; but the marriages were not to be so easily remedied.
the three sailor husbands were away, and their wives, in short, were not
their wives.

“but the munuster was no for alarmin’ the bodies,” said clara.  “he kept
hus council an’ bided hus time, waitun’ for the lods tull be back from
sea.  oz luck would have ut, he was away across the island tull a
christenun’ when albert mahan arrives home onexpected, hus shup just
docked ot dublin.  ut’s nine o’clock ot night when the munuster, un hus
sluppers an’ dressun’-gown, gets the news.  up he jumps an’ calls for
horse an’ saddle, an’ awa’ he goes like the wund for albert mahan’s.
albert uz just goun’ tull bed an’ hoz one shoe off when the munuster
arrives.

“‘come wuth me, the pair o’ ye,’ says he, breathless-like.  ‘what for,
an’ me dead weary an’ goun’ tull bed?’ says albert.  ‘yull be lawful

“’we be no married?’ says minnie.  he shook his head.  ‘an’ i om no

‘’tus no every mon thot hoz two weddun’ nights on island mcgill.’”

six months later eddie troy came home and was promptly remarried.  but
samuel dundee was away on a three-years’ voyage and his ship fell
overdue.  further to complicate the situation, a baby boy, past two years
old, was waiting for him in the arms of his wife.  the months passed, and
the wife grew thin with worrying.  “ut’s no meself i’m thunkun’ on,” she
is reported to have said many times, “but ut’s the puir fatherless bairn.
uf aught happened tull samuel where wull the bairn stond?”

lloyd’s posted the _loughbank_ as missing, and the owners ceased the
monthly remittance of samuel’s half-pay to his wife.  it was the question
of the child’s legitimacy that preyed on her mind, and, when all hope of
samuel’s return was abandoned, she drowned herself and the child in the
loch.  and here enters the greater tragedy.  the _loughbank_ was not
lost.  by a series of sea disasters and delays too interminable to
relate, she had made one of those long, unsighted passages such as occur
once or twice in half a century.  how the imp must have held both his
sides!  back from the sea came samuel, and when they broke the news to
him something else broke somewhere in his heart or head.  next morning
they found him where he had tried to kill himself across the grave of his
wife and child.  never in the history of island mcgill was there so
fearful a death-bed.  he spat in the minister’s face and reviled him, and
died blaspheming so terribly that those that tended on him did so with
averted gaze and trembling hands.

and, in the face of all this, margaret henan named her first child
samuel.

                                * * * * *

how account for the woman’s stubbornness?  or was it a morbid obsession
that demanded a child of hers should be named samuel?  her third child
was a girl, named after herself, and the fourth was a boy again.  despite
the strokes of fate that had already bereft her, and despite the loss of
friends and relatives, she persisted in her resolve to name the child
after her brother.  she was shunned at church by those who had grown up
with her.  her mother, after a final appeal, left her house with the
warning that if the child were so named she would never speak to her
again.  and though the old lady lived thirty-odd years longer she kept
her word.  the minister agreed to christen the child any name but samuel,
and every other minister on island mcgill refused to christen it by the
name she had chosen.  there was talk on the part of margaret henan of
going to law at the time, but in the end she carried the child to belfast
and there had it christened samuel.

and then nothing happened.  the whole island was confuted.  the boy grew
and prospered.  the schoolmaster never ceased averring that it was the
brightest lad he had ever seen.  samuel had a splendid constitution, a
tremendous grip on life.  to everybody’s amazement he escaped the usual
run of childish afflictions.  measles, whooping-cough and mumps knew him
not.  he was armour-clad against germs, immune to all disease.  headaches
and earaches were things unknown.  “never so much oz a boil or a pumple,”
as one of the old bodies told me, ever marred his healthy skin.  he broke
school records in scholarship and athletics, and whipped every boy of his
size or years on island mcgill.

it was a triumph for margaret henan.  this paragon was hers, and it bore
the cherished name.  with the one exception of her mother, friends and
relatives drifted back and acknowledged that they had been mistaken;
though there were old crones who still abided by their opinion and who
shook their heads ominously over their cups of tea.  the boy was too
wonderful to last.  there was no escaping the curse of the name his
mother had wickedly laid upon him.  the young generation joined margaret
henan in laughing at them, but the old crones continued to shake their
heads.

other children followed.  margaret henan’s fifth was a boy, whom she
called jamie, and in rapid succession followed three girls, alice, sara,
and nora, the boy timothy, and two more girls, florence and katie.  katie
was the last and eleventh, and margaret henan, at thirty-five, ceased
from her exertions.  she had done well by island mcgill and the queen.
nine healthy children were hers.  all prospered.  it seemed her ill-luck
had shot its bolt with the deaths of her first two.  nine lived, and one
of them was named samuel.

jamie elected to follow the sea, though it was not so much a matter of
election as compulsion, for the eldest sons on island mcgill remained on
the land, while all other sons went to the salt-ploughing.  timothy
followed jamie, and by the time the latter had got his first command, a
steamer in the bay trade out of cardiff, timothy was mate of a big
sailing ship.  samuel, however, did not take kindly to the soil.  the
farmer’s life had no attraction for him.  his brothers went to sea, not
out of desire, but because it was the only way for them to gain their
bread; and he, who had no need to go, envied them when, returned from far
voyages, they sat by the kitchen fire, and told their bold tales of the
wonderlands beyond the sea-rim.

samuel became a teacher, much to his father’s disgust, and even took
extra certificates, going to belfast for his examinations.  when the old
master retired, samuel took over his school.  secretly, however, he
studied navigation, and it was margaret’s delight when he sat by the
kitchen fire, and, despite their master’s tickets, tangled up his
brothers in the theoretics of their profession.  tom henan alone was
outraged when samuel, school teacher, gentleman, and heir to the henan
farm, shipped to sea before the mast.  margaret had an abiding faith in
her son’s star, and whatever he did she was sure was for the best.  like
everything else connected with his glorious personality, there had never
been known so swift a rise as in the case of samuel.  barely with two
years’ sea experience before the mast, he was taken from the forecastle
and made a provisional second mate.  this occurred in a fever port on the
west coast, and the committee of skippers that examined him agreed that
he knew more of the science of navigation than they had remembered or
forgotten.  two years later he sailed from liverpool, mate of the _starry
grace_, with both master’s and extra-master’s tickets in his possession.
and then it happened—the thing the old crones had been shaking their
heads over for years.

it was told me by gavin mcnab, bos’n of the _starry grace_ at the time,
himself an island mcgill man.

“wull do i remember ut,” he said.  “we was runnin’ our eastun’ down, an’
makun’ heavy weather of ut.  oz fine a sailor-mon oz ever walked was
samuel henan.  i remember the look of hum wull thot last marnun’,
a-watch-un’ them bug seas curlun’ up astern, an’ a-watchun’ the old girl
an’ seeun’ how she took them—the skupper down below an’ drunkun’ for
days.  ut was ot seven thot henan brought her up on tull the wund, not
darun’ tull run longer on thot fearful sea.  ot eight, after havun’
breakfast, he turns un, an’ a half hour after up comes the skupper,
bleary-eyed an’ shaky an’ holdun’ on tull the companion.  ut was fair
smokun’, i om tellun’ ye, an’ there he stood, blunkun’ an’ noddun’ an’
talkun’ tull humsel’.  ‘keep off,’ says he ot last tull the mon ot the
wheel.  ‘my god!’ says the second mate, standun’ beside hum.  the skupper
never looks tull hum ot all, but keeps on mutterun” an’ jabberun’ tull
humsel’.  all of a suddent-like he straightens up an’ throws hus head
back, an’ says: ‘put your wheel over, me mon—now domn ye!  are ye deef
thot ye’ll no be hearun’ me?’

“ut was a drunken mon’s luck, for the _starry grace_ wore off afore thot
god-almighty gale wuthout shuppun’ a bucket o’ watter, the second mate
shoutun’ orders an’ the crew jumpun’ like mod.  an’ wuth thot the skupper
nods contented-like tull humself an’ goes below after more whusky.  ut
was plain murder o’ the lives o’ all of us, for ut was no the time for
the buggest shup afloat tull be runnun’.  run?  never hov i seen the
like!  ut was beyond all thunkun’, an’ me goun’ tull sea, boy an’ men,
for forty year.  i tell you ut was fair awesome.

“the face o’ the second mate was white oz death, an’ he stood ut alone
for half an hour, when ut was too much for hum an’ he went below an’
called samuel an’ the third.  aye, a fine sailor-mon thot samuel, but ut
was too much for hum.  he looked an’ studied, and looked an’ studied, but
he could no see hus way.  he durst na heave tull.  she would ha’ been
sweeput o’ all honds an’ stucks an’ everythung afore she could a-fetched
up.  there was naught tull do but keep on runnun’.  an’ uf ut worsened we
were lost ony way, for soon or late that overtakun’ sea was sure tull
sweep us clear over poop an’ all.

“dud i say ut was a god-almighty gale?  ut was worse nor thot.  the devil
himself must ha’ hod a hond un the brewun’ o’ ut, ut was thot fearsome.
i ha’ looked on some sights, but i om no carun’ tull look on the like o’
thot again.  no mon dared tull be un hus bunk.  no, nor no mon on the
decks.  all honds of us stood on top the house an’ held on an’ watched.
the three mates was on the poop, with two men ot the wheel, an’ the only
mon below was thot whusky-blighted captain snorun’ drunk.

“an’ then i see ut comun’, a mile away, risun’ above all the waves like
an island un the sea—the buggest wave ever i looked upon.  the three
mates stood tulgether an’ watched ut comun’, a-prayun’ like we thot she
would no break un passun’ us.  but ut was no tull be.  ot the last, when
she rose up like a mountain, curlun’ above the stern an’ blottun’ out the
sky, the mates scattered, the second an’ third runnun’ for the
mizzen-shrouds an’ climbun’ up, but the first runnun’ tull the wheel tull
lend a hond.  he was a brave men, thot samuel henan.  he run straight un
tull the face o’ thot father o’ all waves, no thunkun’ on humself but
thunkun’ only o’ the shup.  the two men was lashed tull the wheel, but he
would be ready tull hond un the case they was kult.  an’ then she took
ut.  we on the house could no see the poop for the thousand tons o’
watter thot hod hut ut.  thot wave cleaned them out, took everythung
along wuth ut—the two mates, climbun’ up the mizzen-ruggun’, samuel henan
runnun’ tull the wheel, the two men ot the wheel, aye, an’ the wheel
utself.  we never saw aught o’ them, for she broached tull what o’ the
wheel goun’, an’ two men o’ us was drownded off the house, no tull
mention the carpenter thot we pucked up ot the break o’ the poop wuth
every bone o’ hus body broke tull he was like so much jelly.”

and here enters the marvel of it, the miraculous wonder of that woman’s
heroic spirit.  margaret henan was forty-seven when the news came home of
the loss of samuel; and it was not long after that the unbelievable
rumour went around island mcgill.  i say unbelievable.  island mcgill
would not believe.  doctor hall pooh-pooh’d it.  everybody laughed at it
as a good joke.  they traced back the gossip to sara dack, servant to the
henans’, and who alone lived with margaret and her husband.  but sara
dack persisted in her assertion and was called a low-mouthed liar.  one
or two dared question tom henan himself, but beyond black looks and
curses for their presumption they elicited nothing from him.

the rumour died down, and the island fell to discussing in all its
ramifications the loss of the _grenoble_ in the china seas, with all her
officers and half her crew born and married on island mcgill.  but the
rumour would not stay down.  sara dack was louder in her assertions, the
looks tom henan cast about him were blacker than ever, and dr. hall,
after a visit to the henan house, no longer pooh-pooh’d.  then island
mcgill sat up, and there was a tremendous wagging of tongues.  it was
unnatural and ungodly.  the like had never been heard.  and when, as time
passed, the truth of sara dack’s utterances was manifest, the island folk
decided, like the bos’n of the _starry grace_, that only the devil could
have had a hand in so untoward a happening.  and the infatuated woman, so
sara dack reported, insisted that it would be a boy.  “eleven bairns ha’
i borne,” she said; “sux o’ them lossies an’ five o’ them loddies.  an’
sunce there be balance un all thungs, so wull there be balance wuth me.
sux o’ one an’ half a dozen o’ the other—there uz the balance, an’ oz
sure oz the sun rises un the marnun’, thot sure wull ut be a boy.”

and boy it was, and a prodigy.  dr. hall raved about its unblemished
perfection and massive strength, and wrote a brochure on it for the
dublin medical society as the most interesting case of the sort in his
long career.  when sara dack gave the babe’s unbelievable weight, island
mcgill refused to believe and once again called her liar.  but when
doctor hall attested that he had himself weighed it and seen it tip that
very notch, island mcgill held its breath and accepted whatever report
sara dack made of the infant’s progress or appetite.  and once again
margaret henan carried a babe to belfast and had it christened samuel.

                                * * * * *

“oz good oz gold ut was,” said sara dack to me.

sara, at the time i met her, was a buxom, phlegmatic spinster of sixty,
equipped with an experience so tragic and unusual that though her tongue
ran on for decades its output would still be of imperishable interest to
her cronies.

“oz good oz good,” said sara dack.  “ut never fretted.  sut ut down un
the sun by the hour an’ never a sound ut would make oz long oz ut was no
hungered!  an’ thot strong!  the grup o’ uts honds was like a mon’s.  i
mind me, when ut was but hours old, ut grupped me so mighty thot i
fetched a scream i was thot frightened.  ut was the punk o’ health.  ut
slept an’ ate, an’ grew.  ut never bothered.  never a night’s sleep ut
lost tull no one, nor ever a munut’s, an’ thot wuth cuttin’ uts teeth an’
all.  an’ margaret would dandle ut on her knee an’ ask was there ever so
fine a loddie un the three kungdoms.

“the way ut grew!  ut was un keepun’ wuth the way ut ate.  ot a year ut
was the size o’ a bairn of two.  ut was slow tull walk an’ talk.
exceptun’ for gurgly noises un uts throat an’ for creepun’ on all fours,
ut dudna monage much un the walkun’ an’ talkun’ line.  but thot was tull
be expected from the way ut grew.  ut all went tull growun’ strong an’
healthy.  an’ even old tom henan cheered up ot the might of ut an’ said
was there ever the like o’ ut un the three kungdoms.  ut was doctor hall
thot first suspicioned, i mind me well, though ut was luttle i dreamt
what he was up tull ot the time.  i seehum holdun’ thungs’ un fronto’
luttle sammy’s eyes, an’ a-makun’ noises, loud an’ soft, an’ far an’
near, un luttle sammy’s ears.  an’ then i see doctor hall go away,
wrunklun’ hus eyebrows an’ shakun’ hus head like the bairn was ailun’.
but he was no ailun’, oz i could swear tull, me a-seeun’ hum eat an’
grow.  but doctor hall no said a word tull margaret an’ i was no for
guessun’ the why he was sore puzzled.

“i mind me when luttle sammy first spoke.  he was two years old an’ the
size of a child o five, though he could no monage the walkun’ yet but
went around on all fours, happy an’ contented-like an’ makun’ no trouble
oz long oz he was fed promptly, which was onusual often.  i was hangun’
the wash on the line ot the time when out he comes, on all fours, hus bug
head waggun’ tull an’ fro an’ blunkun’ un the sun.  an’ then, suddent, he
talked.  i was thot took a-back i near died o’ fright, an’ fine i knew ut
then, the shakun’ o’ doctor hall’s head.  talked?  never a bairn on
island mcgill talked so loud an’ tull such purpose.  there was no
mustakun’ ut.  i stood there all tremblun’ an’ shakun’.  little sammy was
brayun’.  i tell you, sir, he was brayun’ like an ass—just like
thot,—loud an’ long an’ cheerful tull ut seemed hus lungs ud crack.

“he was a eediot—a great, awful, monster eediot.  ut was after he talked
thot doctor hall told margaret, but she would no believe.  ut would all
come right, she said.  ut was growun’ too fast for aught else.  guv ut
time, said she, an’ we would see.  but old tom henan knew, an’ he never
held up hus head again.  he could no abide the thung, an’ would no brung
humsel’ tull touch ut, though i om no denyun’ he was fair fascinated by
ut.  mony the time, i see hum watchun’ of ut around a corner, lookun’ ot
ut tull hus eyes fair bulged wuth the horror; an’ when ut brayed old tom
ud stuck hus fungers tull hus ears an’ look thot miserable i could
a-puttied hum.

“an’ bray ut could!  ut was the only thung ut could do besides eat an’
grow.  whenever ut was hungry ut brayed, an’ there was no stoppun’ ut
save wuth food.  an’ always of a marnun’, when first ut crawled tull the
kutchen-door an’ blunked out ot the sun, ut brayed.  an’ ut was brayun’
that brought about uts end.

“i mind me well.  ut was three years old an’ oz bug oz a led o’ ten.  old
tom hed been goun’ from bed tull worse, ploughun’ up an’ down the fields
an’ talkun’ an’ mutterun’ tull humself.  on the marnun’ o’ the day i mind
me, he was suttun’ on the bench outside the kutchen, a-futtun’ the handle
tull a puck-axe.  unbeknown, the monster eediot crawled tull the door an’
brayed after hus fashion ot the sun.  i see old tom start up an’ look.
an’ there was the monster eediot, waggun’ uts bug head an’ blunkun’ an’
brayun’ like the great bug ass ut was.  ut was too much for tom.
somethun’ went wrong wuth hum suddent-like.  he jumped tull hus feet an’
fetched the puck-handle down on the monster eediot’s head.  an’ he hut ut
again an’ again like ut was a mod dog an’ hum afeard o’ ut.  an’ he went
straight tull the stable an’ hung humsel’ tull a rafter.  an’ i was no
for stoppun’ on after such-like, an’ i went tull stay along wuth me
suster thot was married tull john martin an’ comfortable-off.”

                                * * * * *

i sat on the bench by the kitchen door and regarded margaret henan, while
with her callous thumb she pressed down the live fire of her pipe and
gazed out across the twilight-sombred fields.  it was the very bench tom
henan had sat upon that last sanguinary day of life.  and margaret sat in
the doorway where the monster, blinking at the sun, had so often wagged
its head and brayed.  we had been talking for an hour, she with that slow
certitude of eternity that so befitted her; and, for the life of me, i
could lay no finger on the motives that ran through the tangled warp and
woof of her.  was she a martyr to truth?  did she have it in her to
worship at so abstract a shrine?  had she conceived abstract truth to be
the one high goal of human endeavour on that day of long ago when she
named her first-born samuel?  or was hers the stubborn obstinacy of the
ox? the fixity of purpose of the balky horse? the stolidity of the
self-willed peasant-mind?  was it whim or fancy?—the one streak of lunacy
in what was otherwise an eminently rational mind?  or, reverting, was
hers the spirit of a bruno?  was she convinced of the intellectual
rightness of the stand she had taken?  was hers a steady, enlightened
opposition to superstition? or—and a subtler thought—was she mastered by
some vaster, profounder superstition, a fetish-worship of which the alpha
and the omega was the cryptic _samuel_?

“wull ye be tellun’ me,” she said, “thot uf the second samuel hod been
named larry thot he would no hov fell un the hot watter an’ drownded?
atween you an’ me, sir, an’ ye are untellugent-lookun’ tull the eye,
would the name hov made ut onyways dufferent?  would the washun’ no be
done thot day uf he hod been larry or michael?  would hot watter no be
hot, an’ would hot watter no burn uf he hod hod ony other name but
samuel?”

i acknowledged the justice of her contention, and she went on.

“do a wee but of a name change the plans o’ god?  do the world run by hut
or muss, an’ be god a weak, shully-shallyun’ creature thot ud alter the
fate an’ destiny o’ thungs because the worm margaret henan seen fut tull
name her bairn samuel?  there be my son jamie.  he wull no sign a
rooshan-funn un hus crew because o’ believun’ thot rooshan-funns do be
monajun’ the wunds an’ hov the makun’ o’ bod weather.  wull you be
thunkun’ so?  wull you be thunkun’ thot god thot makes the wunds tull
blow wull bend hus head from on high tull lussen tull the word o’ a
greasy rooshan-funn un some dirty shup’s fo’c’sle?”

i said no, certainly not; but she was not to be set aside from pressing
home the point of her argument.

“then wull you be thunkun’ thot god thot directs the stars un their
courses, an’ tull whose mighty foot the world uz but a footstool, wull
you be thunkun’ thot he wull take a spite again’ margaret henan an’ send
a bug wave off the cape tull wash her son un tull eternity, all because
she was for namun’ hum samuel?”

“but why samuel?” i asked.

“an’ thot i dinna know.  i wantud ut so.”

“but _why_ did you want it so?”

“an’ uz ut me thot would be answerun’ a such-like question?  be there ony
mon luvun’ or dead thot can answer?  who can tell the _why_ o’ like?  my
jamie was fair daft on buttermilk, he would drunk ut tull, oz he said
humself, hus back teeth was awash.  but my tumothy could no abide
buttermilk.  i like tull lussen tull the thunder growlun’ an’ roarun’,
an’ rampajun’.  my katie could no abide the noise of ut, but must scream
an’ flutter an’ go runnun’ for the mudmost o’ a feather-bed.  never yet
hov i heard the answer tull the _why_ o’ like, god alone hoz thot answer.
you an’ me be mortal an’ we canna know.  enough for us tull know what we
like an’ what we duslike.  i _like_—thot uz the first word an’ the last.
an’ behind thot like no men can go an’ find the _why_ o’ ut.  i _like_
samuel, an’ i like ut well.  ut uz a sweet name, an’ there be a rollun’
wonder un the sound o’ ut thot passes onderstandun’.”

the twilight deepened, and in the silence i gazed upon that splendid dome
of a forehead which time could not mar, at the width between the eyes,
and at the eyes themselves—clear, out-looking, and wide-seeing.  she rose
to her feet with an air of dismissing me, saying—

“ut wull be a dark walk home, an’ there wull be more thon a sprunkle o’
wet un the sky.”

“have you any regrets, margaret henan?” i asked, suddenly and without
forethought.

she studied me a moment.

“aye, thot i no ha’ borne another son.”

“and you would . . .?” i faltered.

“aye, thot i would,” she answered.  “ut would ha’ been hus name.”

i went down the dark road between the hawthorn hedges puzzling over the
why of like, repeating _samuel_ to myself and aloud and listening to the
rolling wonder in its sound that had charmed her soul and led her life in
tragic places.  _samuel_!  there was a rolling wonder in the sound.  aye,
there was!
